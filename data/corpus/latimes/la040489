The 150-year-old rush to live in the Golden State has swelled the population to 
28.3 million, making one of every 11 people in the nation a Californian, 
researchers in Sacramento said. The population estimate for the fiscal year 
ending last July 1, up a record 662,000 over the year before, places California 
more than 10 million people ahead of the next largest state, New York, with 
17.8 million, said officials in the state Finance Department's demographic 
research unit. "We just have too much to offer everyone, I guess," said John 
Malson, a manager in the unit. The migration into California outstripped the 
number who left, adding 372,000 to the population and accounting for 56% of the 
overall increase. The other 44% in population growth was due to births totaling 
504,000 and deaths 215,000.

An earthquake rumbled through Northern California, helping mark the state's 
Earthquake Preparedness Month. The magnitude 5 temblor also broke window glass 
and dumped items from some store shelves, but there was no serious damage and 
no injuries, authorities said. Centered on the Calaveras fault, about eight 
miles east of Milpitas, the temblor caused the ground to roll for about 20 
seconds, witnesses said. It was felt as far north as Petaluma, in many 
communities to the east of San Francisco and south to the Monterey Peninsula. 
April was proclaimed 1989 Earthquake Preparedness Month by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. The campaign, with the theme "Beat the Quake," seeks to educate the 
public about earthquake safety. April 18 is the anniversary of the great San 
Francisco earthquake of 1906, which triggered fires that destroyed most of the 
city.

The Speaker of India's Parliament, overruling opposition objections, declared 
that the government need not release all sections of a report implicating a 
senior aide to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her 1984 assassination. 
Opposition politicians charged that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had not 
fulfilled a pledge when on March 27 he released part of the findings from the 
investigation into his mother's death. The document had been suppressed on 
national security grounds since 1986, but publication in an anti-government 
newspaper of allegations concerning aide R. K. Dhawan and a subsequent 
parliamentary uproar compelled Gandhi to try to defuse the dispute. The 
government also said its own inquiry had cleared Dhawan.

South Korean authorities jailed two dissident leaders and questioned others 
about an illegal trip to Communist North Korea by a colleague, the Rev. Moon Ik 
Hwan, police reported. Opponents accused the government of using Moon's trip 
last week as an excuse to crack down on dissent, and students supporting him 
battled police in seven cities. Dissidents have sought their own contact with 
North Korea on the subject of reunification, but the government insists that 
all dialogue be handled through official channels. Meanwhile, Moon was reported 
on his way to Beijing and planning to return home by way of Japan later in the 
week.

Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told Congress he expects to give final 
approval by August to a plan for restarting nuclear reactors in South Carolina 
that make materials for atomic weapons. Watkins told a special panel of the 
House Armed Services Committee he had begun reviewing restart recommendations 
from Westinghouse Electric Corp., which operates the Savannah River Site 
reactors near Aiken, S.C., under an Energy Department contract. The three 
reactors, which produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads, at 
Savannah River have been shut down for nearly a year because of safety 
problems.

told reporters in disclosing that he was flying to New York with a letter from 
President Najibullah to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar citing 
the violations. Neighboring Pakistan acknowledges arming and harboring rebels

Two Japanese veterans of World War II reportedly will be among the remnants of 
the Communist Party of Malaya who will surrender to Thai forces in the next two 
months, military officials said in Bangkok. An army officer involved in the 
surrender procedure confirmed a report that 15 Japanese war veterans had joined 
the party in 1948 and that two -- both now in their 70s -- had survived 40 
years in the jungle. The party waged a guerrilla war against Japanese troops in 
Malaysia, then fought against the British after the war ended. Their forces 
were eventually defeated, but a few thousand fled to the Thai-Malaysian border 
area, where they have continued to harass both governments for almost four 
decades.

The Soviet Union permitted 4,240 Jews to emigrate in March, the largest monthly 
total since the benchmark set a decade ago, a leading American Jewish group 
said. This was up from 2,425 in February, when the encouraging trend set 
throughout 1988 and in January showed a drop, and nearly as high as the 4,746 
Jews allowed to emigrate in October, 1979, said a spokesman for the National 
Conference on Soviet Jewry. That last year of the '70s, in which 51,370 Jews 
left the Soviet Union, is the standard for judging emigration rates. It 
compares to 896 in all of 1984 before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took 
office, and 18,965 in 1988.

CLARK HARRISON; PARAPLEGIC ADVENTURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clark Harrison, 64, a paraplegic adventurer who nine months ago crashed his 
single-engine airplane into the wilds of Greenland but survived with only a cut 
on his face. Harrison, a pilot, author, politician, banker and real estate 
broker, had been paralyzed from the chest down by a sniper's bullet in Germany 
during World War II. He used a wheelchair to travel around showing young people 
with spinal cord injuries what they can do with their lives. He served as a 
director of Shepherd Spinal Center, an Atlanta rehabilitation hospital for 
paralyzing spinal disorders, since its founding in 1975. Harrison got his 
pilot's license at age 55 and, at 60, flew a hand-controlled single-engine 
plane solo to Anchorage, Alaska, from his home base to raise money for 
Shepherd. He was trying to raise money for the Shepherd Center for Independent 
Living when he attempted his solo trans-Atlantic flight last July to Germany, 
where he had hoped to visit the battlefield in Stolberg where he was wounded. 
But his plane ran out of gas over Greenland. In Atlanta on Tuesday of the 
complications of flu.

AL MARTINEZ: NIGHT OF THE CAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Magic nights in L.A. Warm winds blow through the city. Rustling palms whisper 
like lovers after dark. Lights gleam in the moving air, assuming qualities of 
glitter that cast us in the unsettling half-light of fairy tales. Cats prowl 
the back alleys at midnight; traffic floats dream-like down Sunset. 
</P>
<P>
A friend used to say spirits walked the Earth when hot winds blew. "There's 
mischief afoot," he'd say, looking down at the lighted streets from the city 
room. His name was Nick. We worked nights in those days, and the nights taunted 
us with mystery. "Someone somewhere is up to no good." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday. It's a restless night for me. I sleep little enough, and artificial 
time changes don't make it easier. The rhythm breaks; the eyes pop open. I 
prowl with the cats, listening to the wind. I'm not alone. The night crowd sips 
black coffee, thumbs through magazines, shops for food and launders at the 
24-hour places. Some walk dogs. A few bound through the darkness in obsessive 
commitment to cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
I drive down La Cienega, thinking of Nick. He said to me once, "You know, if 
Jesus hadn't gotten into all that trouble, he might've had a nice life as a 
general contractor." And he said to me once, "Smart animals eat, sleep and 
fornicate. None of them write. Writing is not a natural function of nature." 
</P>
<P>
I'm thinking about Nick this night because I've just seen a show based on the 
acerbic nature of Oscar Levant. It's called "At Wit's End,' and it's at the 
Coronet Theatre. Stan Freeman plays Levant, a tortured genius who used humor to 
ward off hell and the piano to define heaven. 
</P>
<P>
The show is full of music and full of Levant's quotable comments. You've heard 
most of them. "When I was young I looked like Al Capone, but I lacked his 
compassion." "I don't drink. It makes me feel good." "I knew Doris Day before 
she became a virgin." "I was once thrown out of a mental hospital for 
depressing the other patients." 
</P>
<P>
Levant died in 1972 in Beverly Hills. He was 66. Nick died in 1987 in Pasadena. 
He was 57. They were alike in a lot of ways. Nick's piano was his typewriter 
and his stinging wit a reprisal against what seemed the mind-wrenching 
vicissitudes of life. 
</P>
<P>
Both took drugs to control their dementia, Nick in modest amounts, Levant in 
raging excess. Ten years of his life were a Nembutal blur. "The day I embraced 
Judy Garland," Levant once said, "may have been the greatest moment in 
pharmaceutical history." Humor, like murder, is born in dark places of the 
soul. "There is a thin line between genius and insanity," Levant said. "I have 
erased this line." 
</P>
<P>
Nick used to talk about luck, but he never really believed in it. "Luck comes 
in last," he told me once. We argued. We always argued. "Sometimes it comes in 
first," I said. "Sometimes it wins. What about the guy from Baltimore who beat 
you for the Pulitzer? Did he beat you on talent?" Nick shrugged, unwilling to 
admit that. "Talent wins," he said, "but exceptions to the rule occasionally 
finish strong." 
</P>
<P>
Levant, by Freeman's interpretation, talked about luck but couldn't define it. 
"Luck," he would say and let that one word hang in the smoky air. Luck . . . 
Then he'd think about it and play some Gershwin music and say, "The worst part 
of being in a mental institution is when you come out of the bathroom and the 
nurse says, 'Any luck?' " The laughter fades. "Luck," he says again. 
</P>
<P>
Midnight. I drive west on Sunset and then into Beverly Hills. Despite the hour, 
there's a man in designer sweats running along Beverly Boulevard, the king of 
fitness by moonlight. He looks a little like one of our editors, and I remember 
what Nick used to say about a body-conscious assistant on the city desk who 
managed to weight-lift himself into Mr. America contention. "An editor on 
anabolic steroids," Nick would comment as he passed, "is an awesome sight." 
</P>
<P>
I pull into the driveway. Our cat stands on the roof, yowling. She was given to 
us as neutered. She isn't. "Love is what causes your palms to itch," Nick used 
to say. The hot wind is stronger now. Pollen from the oak trees lays ribbons of 
gold on the driveway. Leaves whirl through the air. Oscar Levant said, "I would 
throw myself into the orchestra pit, but I'm afraid of mingling with 
strangers." 
</P>
<P>
The wind blows and the cat yowls.

NUCLEAR POWER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A. David Rossin ("Nuclear Power: Small Risks, Big Gains," Op-Ed Page, March 26) 
may well believe that the "technical lessons from Three Mile Island have been . 
. . learned and learned well," but this conclusion is as misguided as his facts 
are distorted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has acknowledged, nearly 
four-fifths of the nation's reactors have not completed implementing the 
requirements that arose from the TMI accident 10 years ago. Unfinished items 
include the very control rooms, instruments and control systems that Rossin 
touts as evidence of nuclear power's safety. The NRC's top safety official 
admitted that many of the unimplemented items have great safety significance, 
and that he doesn't understand why they remain unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
If the industry has returned to its pre-TMI level of complacency, unfortunately 
so has the NRC, which has failed to act against any of the delinquent 
utilities. Worse, the NRC recently argued (unsuccessfully) in federal court 
that it need not consider certain safety matters at a Pennsylvania reactor 
because the odds of an accident are "remote and speculative." So much for the 
lessons of TMI. 
</P>
<P>
Rossin should also learn how to read public opinion polls. The AP poll found 
that 55% are willing to let existing reactors operate, but nearly 70% opposed 
any new reactor construction -- a finding that is in line with every recent 
poll undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the American people wisely are unwilling to trade one 
environmental calamity (the greenhouse effect) for another (nuclear power and 
its radioactive waste). There are better alternatives: increased energy 
efficiency to start, along with energy conservation; and further development of 
solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy forms. 
</P>
<P>
In an age where we are learning we must reduce our production of all 
unnecessary toxic waste, it makes sense to stop producing the most unnecessary 
toxic waste of them all: nuclear waste.

THERE WAS NO EXCUSE

The crude oil clotting the shores of Alaska's Prince William Sound mocks 
Washington's oft-made promise that oil development on federal lands and in 
federal waters will be conducted only in an "environmentally sound" manner. As 
late as Monday, Secretary of the Interior Manuel J. Lujan was vowing that the 
Bush Administration would forge ahead with exploration and drilling in the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska's North Slope in an "environmentally 
sound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that 8,548 tankers had successfully negotiated Prince William Sound in 
the past decade to load up at the port of Valdez lulled too many people into 
believing that the operation was so environmentally sound that it was immune 
from accident. The 8,549th tanker proved otherwise. The nation now demands a 
new definition of "environmentally sound." 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez did not become an environmental disaster just because the 
ship's captain may have been drunk and absent from the bridge. This was not a 
simple traffic accident. Veteran observers of the trans-Alaska pipeline system 
from its inception had said that if ever there was to be a serious accident, 
Prince William Sound was a likely site. 
</P>
<P>
There was no excuse, then, for cutbacks in the U.S. Coast Guard budget that 
made it impossible to fully monitor the movement of tankers in and out of the 
sound. There was no excuse for the failure to have adequate oil-spill equipment 
on hand in Valdez, and the trained personnel to use it immediately. There was 
no excuse for the failure to ring the ruptured Exxon Valdez with containment 
booms within the five hours that had been promised by the oil industry's 
accident contingency plan (It took a day and a half). There was no excuse for 
assuming that the worst likely spill would involve 200,000 barrels of oil or 
less. The Exxon Valdez hemorrhaged 240,000 barrels of Alaska crude and, but for 
luck, might have lost even more of its 1.2-million-barrel load. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to oil company officials, Interior Secretary Lujan said Monday: 
"If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails among the U.S. 
public, then we can kiss goodby the domestic oil and gas development in the 
(Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), off shore and in the public lands." But 
Lujan has it wrong. These are public lands and the first responsibility for 
seeing that development is conducted in an "environmentally sound" manner is 
that of the federal government. Rather, the government has been too much of a 
willing partner in exploiting them. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government cannot assume that the oil companies will follow every 
environmental stricture on their own. It must see that they do. The federal 
government cannot count on the companies maintaining adequate equipment and 
personnel to use in the event of a spill. It must insist on it, and inspect and 
test the gear frequently. The federal government cannot take for granted that 
the oil companies will react with alacrity when a disaster is in progress. It 
must be the primary watchdog and take control. These decisions involve the 
public's land, the public's waters, the public's wilderness shorelines, the 
public's fish, the public's waterfowl, the public's marine mammals. The 
public's interest must be protected and that can only be achieved by the 
public's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, echoing the oil companies, insists there is no connection 
between the Exxon Valdez and drilling the Arctic wildlife preserve. But 
physically, there is only one way to get the oil out and that is through Prince 
William Sound. Since Good Friday, the two are linked environmentally and 
politically. The Reagan and Bush administrations have conducted only the most 
superficial and optimistic of environmental assessments of the impact of 
drilling on the Arctic refuge, while promising that this industrial enterprise 
in the wilderness will be achieved in an "environmentally sound" manner. Since 
good Friday, those words are hollow ones. A skeptical nation will demand a new 
definition.

CAR PHONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, three of my co-workers were injured while returning from a seminar in 
Los Angeles when a man talking on a car phone caused a four-vehicle rear-ender. 
The man readily admitted that his attention was diverted by the phone call and 
that not only was he not applying the brakes, he was accelerating at the time 
of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure I'm not the only one who sees people every day who are chatting away 
on their car phones, virtually oblivious to everything around them. It's 
against the law now for a driver to be wearing headphones while driving. How 
many more people are going to have to be injured before a law is enacted which 
makes it illegal to be talking on a car phone while a vehicle is moving.? 
</P>
<P>
We need to take action now!

TURNABOUT IN CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fidel Castro is going all out to make this week's visit to Cuba by Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev look like an upbeat meeting between friends and 
allies. But no amount of positive public statements can hide the differences 
between the rigid Marxism that Castro imposed on his people and Gorbachev's 
more open style of Communism. 
</P>
<P>
The dissonance between appearances and reality began with Gorbachev's arrival 
at Havana's airport Sunday. An estimated half million people turned out to 
greet the Soviet leader, about a quarter of the capital's population. To some 
extent, the large crowds reflect genuine Cuban gratitude for the more than $5 
billion a year in economic aid that the Soviet Union provides to Castro. But 
the crowds also reflect how disciplined Cuba's Communists are. They have 
neighborhood defense committees in every community on the island, and can turn 
people out when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Many Cubans in the crowds also are undoubtedly curious about this new Soviet 
leader. While the official Cuban media have limited the amount of information 
people on the island get about Gorbachev's efforts at glasnost and reform, many 
Cubans are aware that something unusual is afoot in the Soviet Union, and they 
certainly know that Castro is not very happy about it. On several recent 
occasions the Cuban dictator has publicly voiced his disapproval of Gorbachev's 
campaign of perestroika to restructure the Soviet economy, warning audiences 
against the danger of using "capitalist mechanisms to build socialism." To 
emphasize his own Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy, Castro has even abandoned minimal 
economic reforms and other openings recently attempted in Cuba, calling for a 
campaign of "rectification." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's challenge in Cuba is to try to get Castro to change his ways 
without angering a notoriously volatile ally. Cuba is a drain on the Soviet 
Union, so Gorbachev wants Castro to run things more efficiently, if only for 
the sake of economy. But Cuba is the Soviet Union's chief outpost in the 
Western Hemisphere, and that gives Castro important leverage in dealing with 
Gorbachev. The interplay between two such strong and highly visible 
personalities will be intriguing to watch. And, if nothing else, there is 
historic irony in the reversal of roles being played during the first visit to 
Cuba by a Soviet leader in 15 years. Fidel Castro built his international 
reputation playing the young, firebrand revolutionary who was willing to 
challenge orthodox old men in the Kremlin. Now Castro is the rigid older man 
having to deal with a maverick from Moscow.

MORNING BRIEFING: AT $200,000 PER PITCH, BUSH MAY BE OVERPAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since President Bush earns $200,000 a year and throws only one pitch a year -- 
on opening day -- should he be considered one of the highest-paid participants 
in the game? 
</P>
<P>
If so, it wouldn't be by much. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 opening-day pitchers in major league baseball, 23 are paid more than 
Bush, including the two who shared the mound with the President in Baltimore on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles' Dave Schmidt will make $625,000 this season, and 
Boston's Roger Clemens will make $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's toss Monday, by the way, was high and outside, which probably explains 
the salary discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
Just for openers: Opening day of the baseball season always brings its trove of 
statistical treasures, and Jim Shea of the Hartford Courant has gathered some 
of them together. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ted Williams hit .449 in 14 openers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Feller threw a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on opening day 
in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Babe Ruth won his first three starts as an opening-day pitcher and went on 
to hit .422 in 18 openers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bell last year became the first player to hit three home runs on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don Drysdale is the only pitcher to hit two homers on the first day of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Who started the custom of throwing out the first ball in the 
presidential opener? 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: For only the second time in Sparky Anderson's 10 seasons as 
Detroit's manager, a rookie -- first baseman Torey Lovullo -- will start in the 
Tigers' opener today. 
</P>
<P>
Lovullo, from UCLA, was drafted as a second baseman-shortstop in the fifth 
round of the June, 1987 draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers must expect big things from the former Bruin, who has had only 177 
at-bats in competition higher than double A. They gave him jersey No. 23, the 
number worn by Kirk Gibson when he played for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Going up: Former NBA star George Yardley, speaking at a basketball awards 
breakfast in Anaheim on Sunday, had an observation about then and now. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching some of the films of the old days in the NBA, back in the '50s, 
when I was playing," Yardley said. "One thing I noticed right away: We all had 
the same vertical jumps that the girls have now." 
</P>
<P>
Extra Yardley: Yardley had another message for the prep all-stars in his 
audience: "Get involved with a sport like golf or tennis, sports that you can 
use for many years. Basketball is one of the first sports to desert you because 
of age." 
</P>
<P>
Aces: Reliever Mark Davis of the San Diego Padres had an enjoyable spring -- up 
to a point. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed one earned run in 18 innings and had two holes in one on the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
He scored the second of those aces in Palm Springs last week. Seeking a third, 
Davis went back the next day to try again. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a 16 on the same hole. 
</P>
<P>
Countdowns: Notice anything odd about the Lakers' 138-98 victory over San 
Antonio last Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had 10 assists, nine rebounds, eight points, seven free throws, 
six free throws made, five turnovers, four offensive rebounds, three personal 
fouls, two steals and one field goal. 
</P>
<P>
No mention of partridges or pear trees. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: William Howard Taft in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Said Senior Tour pro and accomplished golf instructor Phil Rodgers, 
after spending a week working with Greg Norman: "My wife told me to quit giving 
lessons and start taking them."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
JOHNSON HELPS CARRY METS OVER CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog didn't ask for Howard Johnson's bat to be 
checked this time. He was too busy checking the list of injured Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hit a home run and drove in three runs as the Mets beat the Cardinals, 
8-4, Monday to win their 11th consecutive season opener played at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have won five consecutive season openers and 18 of their last 20. They 
have not lost an opening-day game at Shea Stadium since dropping an 11-10 
decision to Montreal on April 8, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when Johnson hit 36 homers, Herzog thought the Met third baseman was 
putting cork into his bat. 
</P>
<P>
"That's forgotten," Johnson said. "It's sweet because it came on opening day 
and because we beat a team that will give us trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals played without All-Star shortstop Ozzie Smith, who has a strained 
muscle in his left side. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a good spring," Herzog said. "We lost (pitcher Danny) Cox for the 
season and then (pitcher) Greg Mathews went down. We can't afford to get off to 
a slow start because the Mets are a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, mentioned in many trade rumors during the winter, had a two-run single 
off Joe Magrane during a four-run third inning and a solo home run off Todd 
Worrell in the eighth. In nine career at-bats against Worrell, Johnson has four 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best relievers in the league," Johnson said of Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets had serious trade talks with Atlanta, Seattle, Boston and Kansas City, 
and Johnson was part of all the deals. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I've got a lot of people to win over," Johnson said. "I just want to 
get off to a fast start. The trade talk was depressing in the sense I didn't 
know where I would be. But if I'm traded, the other team is getting a good 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, the league earned-run average leader last year at 2.18, pitched 3 2/3 
innings and allowed nine hits and seven runs, all earned. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry had three hits and two runs batted in for the Mets, and 
Dwight Gooden pitched seven-plus innings for the victory to improve to 3-0 on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden left with none out in the eighth, after Pedro Guerrero drove in his 
fourth run of the game with a single. Don Aase, who was released by Baltimore 
last season and invited to camp with New York as a non-roster player, came on 
to retire the side and got a save in his Met debut. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, San Diego 3 -- Kevin Mitchell drove in four runs with a 
two-run homer in the first inning and a two-run single in the seventh to lead 
the Giants to victory at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
With San Diego leading, 3-2, starter Eric Show retired the first two batters in 
the seventh but then walked Brett Butler, Robby Thompson and Will Clark. 
Mitchell's single drove in the tying and winning runs, and Candy Maldonado's 
double chased Show. 
</P>
<P>
The three-run rally made a winner of San Francisco starter Rick Reuschel, who 
was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. The 39-year-old Reuschel allowed 
three runs and six hits in six innings.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
ORIOLES, FAR AHEAD OF 1988 PACE, BEAT RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles, losers of the first 21 games last year, won their season 
opener Monday, beating the American League East champion Boston Red Sox, 5-4, 
at Baltimore on Craig Worthington's 11th-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in attendance with Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, threw out the 
ceremonial first pitch, but left in the seventh inning with the score tied, 
4-4. Boston's Roger Clemens was chased the next inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Baltimore put runners on first and third for Worthington, who 
grounded out. But the rookie came through in the 11th, after Mickey Tettleton 
walked and took third on Randy Milligan's hit-and-run single. 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Smithson replaced Bob Stanley, Worthington flared a 1-and-0 pitch 
into left-center field past a diving Ellis Burks, foiling a Boston formation of 
five infielders. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important for the players out there," Baltimore Manager Frank 
Robinson said of the first victory. "They're a young ballclub and they're 
relatively new to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good win because now we can concentrate on other things and not have 
to worry about, 'Uh oh, when are they going to win one in the 1989 season?' " 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holton, acquired in an off-season trade that sent Eddie Murray to the 
Dodgers, pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings for the victory. Stanley entered after 
Lee Smith left with a pulled groin and took the loss, Boston's fourth straight 
defeat on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun to win the first one, especially after last year," Holton said. "I 
wasn't here, but I talked with some of the guys and I know they were relieved." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, 6-2 lifetime against the Orioles, left after Brady Anderson led off 
the eighth inning with his second double. Clemens pitched seven innings, 
allowing seven hits and four runs, earning his second no-decision in two 
opening day starts. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, a five-time American League batting champion, went two for four. 
The Red Sox have tried to trade him because of the commotion caused by his 
affair with Margo Adams, but have been unable to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Kansas City 3 -- Jimmy Key won on opening day for the third 
consecutive season, and Fred McGriff and Lloyd Moseby got two hits each to lead 
the Blue Jays at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Key, who also beat the Royals in the 1988 season opener, gave up two runs on 
six hits in six innings. Mark Gubicza, drawing his first opening-day assignment 
after a 20-8 record, allowed four runs on nine hits in seven innings and took 
the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Tabler's run-scoring double chased Key during a three-run seventh that made 
it 4-3. Bo Jackson led off the Royal ninth with a double and was sacrificed to 
third, but Duane Ward struck out Frank White and Tom Henke retired Kurt 
Stillwell on a popup to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson went two for four. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 2, Milwaukee 1 -- Oddibe McDowell doubled in two runs in his first 
game for the Indians and Greg Swindell allowed five hits in 8 1/3 innings at 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell retired the first 12 batters he faced until Rob Deer and Glenn Braggs 
hit consecutive singles to open the fifth. Deer scored from third when Terry 
Francona grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell struck out six and walked none. Mike Felder reached on a bunt single 
to open the ninth and Gary Sheffield sacrificed. Doug Jones came in and got 
Robin Yount on a groundout and then struck out Deer for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Don August, the loser, allowed two runs, one of them unearned, on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Seattle 2 -- Mark McGwire drove in all the runs for the Athletics 
with a two-run homer and a sacrifice fly as Dave Stewart, with help from three 
relief pitchers, outdueled Mark Langston at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Langston allowed just five hits, but one was McGwire's homer in the third 
inning that staked Stewart to a 3-0 lead.

"Rain Man" is well on its way toward fulfilling predictions that the winner of 
the best picture Oscar can count on a $20-million windfall at the box office. 
During the first weekend after the Academy Awards, receipts for "Rain Man," 
winner of four Oscars, jumped 84% to $5.5 million at 1,581 theaters, an average 
of $3,502 per screen. Other Oscar winners also enjoyed a boost at the box 
office over the weekend: Sales for "Dangerous Liaisons," with total receipts 
now at $27.5 million, rose 24%; "Working Girl," at $58 million, jumped 40%; 
"Accidental Tourist," at $30.2 million, increased 54%; and "Mississippi 
Burning," now at $32 million, jumped 55%. 
</P>
<P>
*"Heathers," first-time director Michael Lehmann's controversial look at 
teenage social structures, enjoyed a healthy opening, grossing $177,247 in 
limited release at 35 theaters, a per-screen average of $5,064.

Foreign Film File: "The Commissar," a Soviet film briefly banned in East 
Germany, has been voted best movie distributed in the last year by East German 
critics. The film, about a Red Army soldier who faces a dilemma when she has a 
baby and can no longer fight, questions heroic cliches that used to dominate 
Soviet films about the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought the communists to 
power. . . . The makers of a South African anti-war film titled "The Stick" 
have decided not to release it in their homeland because censors ordered 48 
cuts. Censors also barred anyone under 21 from seeing the movie and ruled that 
it could only be shown in theaters with fewer than 200 seats. "The Stick" is 
based loosely on the undeclared border war fought by South African forces in 
recent years in northern Namibia and southern Angola.ALEENE MacMINN

NBC's television movie about the Billionaire Boys Club, broadcast between 
murder trials of club founder Joe Hunt, did not violate his right to a fair 
trial, a federal appeal court ruled Monday. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals affirmed a federal judge's rejection of Hunt's October, 1987, request 
for an injunction preventing the NBC network from showing the "docudrama." NBC 
scheduled the docudrama about Hunt and his gang of wealthy thrill-seekers to 
air nationally on Nov. 8-9, 1987. Hunt was appealing a murder conviction and 
was awaiting trial in another murder case when he filed a complaint against 
NBC, contending that broadcast of "Billionaire Boys Club" would infringe on his 
Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. When the movie was aired, Hunt had 
already been found guilty in Los Angeles of the murder of Ronald Levin and was 
awaiting trial in San Mateo County for his alleged role in the murder of 
Hedayat Eslaminia. The movie used Hunt's real name, but not Eslaminia's. The 
movie portrayed Hunt planning and committing the murder and established his 
motive for the crime. The cast of the two-part movie included Judd Nelson, Ron 
Silver and Raphael Sbarge. ALEENE MacMINN

The National Council on the Arts Monday officially denounced the banning of 
"The Satanic Verses" by various countries and the death threat imposed by the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the novel's author, Salman Rushdie. The council 
also urged Americans to speak out against "any attempt to impose silence by 
terror upon a writer." The council is made up of 27 private citizens appointed 
by the President to provide advice to the National Endowment of the Arts on 
arts policies and programs. The statement was endorsed by 25 of the 27 members. 
It read, in part: "The National Council on the Arts resolves that all efforts 
to suppress, ban or otherwise prevent the distribution of "The Satanic Verses" 
and all threats made against its author, and against publishers and booksellers 
associated with the work, should be condemned." ALEENE MacMINN

25-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE OF RUDY PEREZ CAREER AT LACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) for two weekends, the invaluable 
25-year survey of Rudy Perez's choreographic career also offers a cavalcade of 
American self-delusion: the subject of so many of his finest pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Danced by Anne Goodman, Jeffrey Grimaldo, Anet Margot Ris and Robert Keane 
(Perez's current company), the six-part program traces the evolution of 
postmodern camouflage, from the unyielding, proletarian, warrior-woman facade 
shown in the 1964 "Bang-Bang" solo to the mindlessly ingratiating, unisex 
veneer of the group in Perez's new untitled work-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond their bold spatial statements and inventive sequencing ploys, most of 
these works are character portraits. Nearly all of them heighten and abstract 
the defensive subterfuges of our society and then provide startling revelations 
of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, isolated and self-absorbed individuals may huddle together 
protectively as in "Parallax" (1975). Or a face-in-the-crowd may stop 
methodically measuring himself by his job and touch himself tenderly, as in 
"System" (1975). Perez has a sharp eye for the way we define ourselves by 
stance and style -- but these works are filled with compassion for the fear and 
pain under all that role-playing. 
</P>
<P>
In the solos "Coverage" (1970) and "In Plain Sight" (1981), he explores 
shopworn symbols of masculinity and femininity in our culture: the jock 
construction worker and the vixen in lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
The movement cliches adopted by these archetypes may be different -- forceful 
athleticism for the man, seductive undulation for the woman -- but Perez finds 
the same desperation underneath, the same agonizing loss of control. 
</P>
<P>
Even the smirking imbeciles of the newest piece periodically slap their necks 
and wince, as if stung by insects, and doesn't the pole-wielding Amazon of 
"Bang-Bang" momentarily slump (soften), too? 
</P>
<P>
If the Perez retrospective confirms that the focus of our counterculture has 
shifted over the past quarter century from social activism to 
fashion-mongering, it suggests that we are still unable to efficiently insulate 
ourselves from our humanity. And that may be our only hope. 
</P>
<P>
To perform these pieces requires great clarity of gesture and pose, plus 
mastery of their demanding, interlocking movement disciplines. But none of this 
is worth very much if the soul doesn't speak -- and the level of eloquence 
proved definitely muted at LACE last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular exception -- Keane's meticulous portrayal of eroding machismo 
in "Coverage" -- supplied exactly the kind of moment-by-moment permutation that 
makes time stop in a Rudy Perez work and a chain of hidden insights become 
brilliantly coherent. If Keane's colleagues often looked tentative or 
generalized in comparison, this was still a major event in local dance-theater. 
</P>
<P>
The final three performances of the Perez retrospective take place Thursday 
through Saturday , with changes in casting for the solos on alternate nights.

GILAD, KARASIK WITH SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his seven years as its conductor, Yehuda Gilad has established the Santa 
Monica Symphony as a first-rate community orchestra, an ensemble worthy of the 
company of many of the Southland's fully professional orchestras. Thus his 
decision to step down from the post must engender some regret. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunday evening concert at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Gilad's fine 
sense of drama helped insure dynamic, propulsive music-making; his clear 
economical beat assured a tight, unified ensemble. Opening with a transparent, 
flowing account of Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll," the conductor evoked telling 
contrasts and maintained mostly consistent balances, the latter no easy task in 
the hangar-like auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
In Sibelius' First Symphony, however, those balances frequently went askew; at 
one point in the Finale, for instance, the strings virtually obliterated an 
important trumpet passage. The string choir tended to be bottom-heavy -- not 
surprisingly, since first violin and cello sections were about equal in 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was much to admire in this reading: the superb solos (clarinetist 
Emily Bernstein's opening solo is just one example), the brass section's heroic 
sound and Gilad's attention to detail. One would have welcomed, however, a bit 
more flexibility of tempo, particularly in the Andante. 
</P>
<P>
Between the orchestra works, pianist Gita Karasik delivered an assured, elegant 
reading of Mozart's Concerto in C, K. 467 (the D-minor concerto had originally 
been scheduled). 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles native eschewed flashiness and instead opted for a thoughtful, 
controlled reading marked by refinement, nuance and subtlety. Gilad's orchestra 
provided sensitive and rhythmically secure support. TERRY McQUILKIN

A PITCHED BATTLE IN 'THE DALLAS DRUG WAR' ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There isn't much in "The Dallas Drug War," tonight's edition of "Frontline" 
(9-10 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 10-11 p.m. on Channel 50), that will be new 
to anyone who lives in a large American city and watches television. But this 
investigation of all that troubles poverty-stricken, drug-stricken south Dallas 
(where most of the city's minority population lives) is so thorough that it 
might put your view of the issues into fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Hector Galan's camera sweeps over the entire panorama of "the war 
zone," and all sorts of voices are heard -- from frightened, disgusted 
residents to the police and politicians to the drug dealers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There are the crime-show segments you'd expect: on-camera raids and arrests, a 
gun battle that rages outside a black family's house. But then we follow one of 
the members of that family as she tries to express her desperation to a City 
Council that seems so jaded to the crisis that the effort only adds to the 
feeling of futility. 
</P>
<P>
Even bleaker is what we learn about those given the chief burden of doing 
something about drug-related crime -- the city's Police Department. We ride 
with policemen who point out apartments they say are definitely crack houses, 
and we see people in them and milling around them. Then we see police raid an 
alleged crack house . . . and it turns out to be completely abandoned. The 
camera crew catches people selling drugs and even holding regular gun battles, 
but the police can't. What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
It's a vicious circle of a system that outlaws drugs and then cannot enforce 
the laws, and the principal victims are the residents of the black 
neighborhoods. The program returns to them in its slightly redundant final 15 
minutes, focusing on the attempts of some to scare off crack dealers by forming 
marching citizens' groups. 
</P>
<P>
There's a glimmer of hope in this, and in the recent hiring of a new, possibly 
more efficient and intelligent police chief. But all in all, the cure seems to 
be killing the patient as much as the disease, and "The Dallas Drug War" paints 
a picture of utter hopelessness, spiraling downwards. TERRY ATKINSON

'DEAD LUCKY': NO WINNER IN THIS DARK THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clearly, Great Britain has not succumbed en masse to "We Are the World"-style 
public altruism fever, if the wildly cynical BBC suspense film "Dead Lucky" 
(premiering tonight at 6 and again at 10 on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable 
network) is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
As cheerlessly amoral as it is entertaining, this dark thriller centers around 
a nervous but nice young accountant, Martin Urban (Nicholas Farrell), who wins 
a massive amount of tax-free money -- 150,000, to be precise -- in a football 
pool. Rather than invest the windfall, Urban opts to quietly give fully half of 
his bonanza away to needy cases of the elderly, sick and impoverished -- a 
generous decision that results in confusion, suspicion, subterfuge and, 
ultimately, murder. 
</P>
<P>
What a message! Wake the kids! 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, some of Urban's planned beneficiaries rebuff his donations, wary 
of strings that might be attached. That turns out to be the least of his 
problems. Urban has made the terrible mistake of not giving a penny to Tim Sage 
(William Gaminara), a client and former friend who actually filled out the 
winning entry form for him. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, a love interest appears on the scene, and any dimwit -- well, any 
dimwit but the naive protagonist, that is -- can guess that Francesca (Harriet 
Bagnall) and her boyfriend Sage are playing their victim for a sap in much the 
same way that poor Edward G. Robinson was hoodwinked by a similarly capricious 
couple back in "Scarlet Street." 
</P>
<P>
In adapting Ruth Rendall's novel "Lake of Darkness," writer-director Barbara 
Rennie shows a sure touch handling her actors and their purposefully mundane 
dialogue, even if the ordinariness on the visual end is unfortunate. (The film 
could use a noir flair, or any kind of stylistic edge.) 
</P>
<P>
Parents may want to exercise the proverbial discretion -- not so much on 
account of the nudity (very brief), violence (mostly implied) or barely 
developed gay subtext (the hero is latently homosexual), but mostly for the 
utter bleakness of theme. Suffice it to say that the only luck in "Dead Lucky" 
is of the bad sort.CHRIS WILLMAN

Northwest May Stay in St. Paul: Minnesota Atty. Gen. Hubert H. Humphrey III 
said John Davis, son of millionaire Marvin Davis, assured him that his father 
would keep Northwest Airlines' operations in St. Paul and expand the airline if 
Davis' $90-a-share bid for the airline is accepted. Minnesota officials have 
vowed to fight any effort to break up the airline. Meanwhile, NWA said it 
reached a contract agreement with 10,500 clerical workers and reservation and

OSHA PROBE HELPS SUITS, LOCKHEED WORKERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Gillaspie , a 29-year-old La Crescenta man, is one of 88 current and 
former Lockheed workers who are suing the big aerospace company, alleging that 
their exposure to harmful chemicals at Lockheed's Burbank manufacturing plant 
made them seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
Gillaspie, who went on medical leave last fall complaining of rashes, 
headaches, memory loss and other maladies, has yet to have his day in court. 
The workers' eight lawsuits, the first of which was filed more than two years 
ago in Superior Court in Burbank, are still pending, and no trial dates have 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gillaspie said last week that he and his fellow workers are already 
victorious -- thanks to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"I myself feel that our case has been won," Gillaspie said. "Whether it was a 
mistake or not, the fact still remains we were exposed to dangerous chemicals 
and OSHA has proved it." 
</P>
<P>
OSHA is the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which March 24 
cited the Lockheed plant for 440 alleged violations of safety rules and 
proposed $1.5 million in fines. The citations followed a four-month 
investigation of some sections of the plant that began last September. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling plant is where Lockheed is building, among other things, a 
top-secret stealth fighter. Stealth aircraft typically are made with 
plastic-like composites -- materials made of chemicals and fibers that are 
lightweight, strong and that absorb radar signals, making the planes harder to 
detect than metal-bodied jets. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, which is reviewing OSHA's report, can contest all or some of the 
citations before a review commission. The company also is defending itself 
against the lawsuits, some of which allege that Lockheed was negligent and 
intentionally concealed the fact that workers were being exposed to dangerous 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
If many of OSHA's allegations are upheld, the question becomes: What effect 
will OSHA's report have on the workers' pending lawsuits? 
</P>
<P>
That answer could be: Plenty. If the workers can first establish in court that 
Lockheed "fraudulently concealed" the chemicals' danger from the workers, as 
the workers are trying to do, "then they can bring the OSHA results in to 
buttress their case that there were indeed unsafe working conditions," said 
Merle Rabine, head of the California Applicants Attorneys Assn., a group of 
lawyers who represent employees in workers' compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
Rabine, who is not involved in the Lockheed case, said the "fraudulent 
concealment" aspect is important because it is a test that often must be met 
for an employee-vs.-employer lawsuit to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, workers' compensation systems are supposed to prevent such suits. 
Workers' compensation is meant to be the "exclusive remedy" for employees 
looking to get reimbursed for illness or injury caused at the work site. And in 
California, workers' compensation is a "no-fault" system, which means that a 
worker's claim depends on whether the injury or sickness was caused at work -- 
regardless of who was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Further Corroboration' 
</P>
<P>
But if an employee can establish that the employer fraudulently concealed the 
cause of the injury, or engaged in "serious and willful misconduct" that led to 
the injury, then an employee's suit can proceed, Rabine said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy A. Larson, an Encino lawyer who is representing many of the Lockheed 
workers in their lawsuit, said the courts will see the OSHA report "as further 
corroboration and verification of what our clients had indicated regarding 
their health." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman James Ragsdale acknowledged that "it seems possible" that 
OSHA's report could find its way into the courtroom. "But Lockheed is not in a 
position to speculate about what effect any OSHA findings may have on any of 
the litigation that's now pending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 workers' compensation claims have also been filed against Lockheed by 
workers at the Burbank plant, also on grounds they were harmed at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's Burbank plant is actually 200 buildings spread around the city with 
about 14,000 employees, with some of its biggest facilities located just east 
of the Burbank airport. Some of the buildings can be toured by the public. 
</P>
<P>
But other Lockheed buildings are top secret, and workers there are prohibited 
from discussing any classified projects. Even in their lawsuits, the workers 
did not spell out what their jobs entailed if they worked in secret areas. a 
</P>
<P>
One of the lawsuits listed all the chemicals that allegedly caused the workers' 
illnesses as being found in Lockheed's Building 351. Many of the alleged 
violations found by OSHA also were located in Building 351 and Building 199. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's Ragsdale would say only that both buildings are used in 
manufacturing and that other information is not disclosed because the buildings 
are involved "in classified Department of Defense projects." 
</P>
<P>
But Gillaspie and other workers suing Lockheed said that in the mid-1980s some 
of the contents of the buildings were extremely dangerous. There, employees 
worked with poisonous chemicals and other substances without protective 
clothing, proper warnings on how to use the materials and adequate ventilation, 
they alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"Pure silver and pure copper was being sprayed out of paint guns," Gillaspie 
asserted. "Nobody thought a damn thing about it, including me." 
</P>
<P>
OSHA's 461-page report found dozens of instances in which Lockheed allegedly 
failed to correctly label drums of hazardous chemicals on the site, failed to 
ensure that workers wore gloves and had other adequate protection from the 
substances, and failed to record illnesses and injuries that occurred at the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA also allegedly found several containers of chemicals unmarked or poorly 
labeled. In one instance, OSHA said there were three 30-gallon drums and one 
55-gallon drum in Building 199 that contained a surface-coating mix of various 
dangerous chemicals, but they were labeled only as "skybond mix" and did not 
display "appropriate hazard warnings," OSHA said. 
</P>
<P>
The "very nature and sheer volume" of the alleged safety violations has 
prompted OSHA to send its inspectors back for a "wall-to-wall" inspection of 
the entire Burbank plant. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers expressed surprise that OSHA still found hundreds of alleged 
violations more than two years after the workers' lawsuits asserted that there 
were problems at the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeared on 'Nightline' 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed "knew OSHA was coming in, had a good length of time to prepare and 
they screwed up royally," said Clyde Glasser in Burbank, who retired in 1985 
after more than 30 years with Lockheed and who also is a plaintiff in the 
lawsuits. "Just think what would have happened if they would have looked in 
1985." 
</P>
<P>
Gillaspie criticized OSHA for not immediately responding to the workers' 
lawsuits and says the agency stepped in only after Gillaspie appeared on ABC 
News' "Nightline" television program last Sept. 22 to comment on the Lockheed 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"They were embarrassed on national television," Gillaspie said. "They were 
exposed for not doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gravitt, head of OSHA's Los Angeles office and who led the inspection of 
Lockheed, noted that until July, 1987, responsibility for enforcing job safety 
and health laws in California's private sector was handled by state officials. 
At that point, federal OSHA officials took over, but it was not until August, 
1988, that complaints about Lockheed's site began coming to OSHA, Gravitt said.

CHRYSLER TOPS RIVALS WITH INTEREST-FREE LOANS

Chrysler Corp. on Monday began offering interest-free, two-year loans on all of 
its cars and some light trucks, in an escalation of the latest round of buyer 
incentives from the auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
The move came after Ford Motor Co. dropped its interest rate for 24-month loans 
to 2.9% last Wednesday. General Motors Corp. followed that lead a day later. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put an end to one-upmanship right now," said Bennett Bidwell, chairman 
of Chrysler Motors Corp., the company's car-making arm. 
</P>
<P>
Interest-free automobile financing was last offered in September, 1986, by 
American Motors Corp., which Chrysler bought less than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to interest-free financing on two-year notes, Chrysler matched Ford 
and GM programs offering 5.9% for three-year loans and 6.9% for four-year 
terms. Chrysler's 10.9% interest for five-year loans is 1 percentage point more 
than Ford's and GM's deals. 
</P>
<P>
The auto makers also increased their cash rebates, which vary from vehicle to 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's program runs indefinitely. Ford's expires May 31 and GM's runs out 
June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's plan includes all the car lines it sells, and all but one of its 
pickup trucks, a full-size diesel-powered vehicle. About half of the Jeep 
models qualify, but some of the most popular models don't. 
</P>
<P>
The incentive war comes on the heels of unexpectedly low early 1989 sales and 
inventories that have been causing some worry, but no panic, among auto makers. 
Each of the Big Three auto makers set ambitious production schedules for the 
first few months of this year, and there are no large-scale moves to curtail 
them yet. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bidwell said a driving force in slashing financing rates and 
increasing rebates was to help the No. 3 auto maker avoid cutting production. 
</P>
<P>
Other reasons included pressure by the Ford and GM moves and, Bidwell said, "We 
believe Americans want to buy cars and buy cars right now." 
</P>
<P>
Car and light truck sales through the first 80 days of 1989 have been running 
5.4% behind the same period last year, the second-best in the industry's 
history. Typically, March and April are strong sales months as Americans look 
forward to summer vacations and weekend driving trips. 
</P>
<P>
Sales figures for the first quarter of the year are due out today. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives, whether rebates or low-interest financing, cut directly into auto 
makers' profits. On Wednesday, Bidwell acknowledged that the corporation 
expected its earnings for the first half of the year to be lower than last 
year, reflecting higher incentive costs. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives were less costly than cutting production, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last half of the year, I think (earnings) will start going up," Bidwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest-free financing affects only two-year loans, which in the past have 
made up about 12% of Chrysler Credit Corp.'s business. Jerry Farrell, president 
of the loan-making company, said he expected that percentage to double with the 
new program. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the 6.9% interest rate for 48-month loans, down from 8.9% in 
Chrysler's previous incentive program, will attract buyers who may have been 
considering five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, unlike Ford and GM, has not seen a growing number of repossessions 
and loan defaults in the five-year loan category, which makes up about 60% of 
the company's vehicle-loan business. 
</P>
<P>
The interest-free loan deal was well received by dealers the corporation talked 
with during the weekend, said Tom Pappert, vice president for sales at Chrysler 
Motors. 
</P>
<P>
The program is likely to face criticism from Ron Tonkin, president of the 
National Automobile Dealers Assn. Late last week, after Ford and GM announced 
their new incentive programs, Tonkin called the incentive war a "circus."

CSX Corp.: The Richmond, Va.-based energy and transportation holding company 
reported first-quarter profit of $82 million, a gain of 26% over a year ago. 
Revenue grew 6% to $1.8 billion. The results were credited to higher rail 
revenue due to improved rates and strong coal shipments and increased 
container-shipping income due to expanded operations in the Pacific as well as 
stronger rates for exports to Pacific Rim countries. The firm also cited a gain 
on the sale of Trailer Train Co. stock.

Pickens Buys Japanese Shares: Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. has become 
the largest shareholder of Koito Manufacturing Co., a leading auto parts 
supplier closely affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp., securities industry 
sources said in Tokyo. It's thought to be the first time a U.S. raider has made 
a major investment in a Japanese-listed company, sources said. Pickens appears 
to have purchased 20% of the outstanding common shares of Koito from Azabu 
Jidosha, a prominent real estate speculator, the sources said. The purchase 
made Toyota, with a 19% interest, the firm's second-largest shareholder, they 
said. Koito's share price has been rising in recent months, apparently because 
of Pickens' purchases, sources said.

Carson Pirie Stock Rises on Bid: Shares of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. shot 
higher after a Swiss-owned retailing company based in Milwaukee launched a 
$280-million buyout for the Chicago-based department store chain. Carson Pirie, 
struggling with an attempt to rebound from financial setbacks in recent years, 
responded coolly to the $20-a-share bid from P. A. Bergner &amp; Co. But Wall 
Street warmed to the idea that the long-rumored takeover target had finally 
received some interest, pushing its stock to a $7.625 gain at $21.50. Carson 
said it was "not for sale" but that its board would consider the Bergner offer 
"in due course." Bergner has 31 department stores in Illinois and Wisconsin; 
Carson Pirie has 33 department stores in Chicago and Minnesota and owns County 
Seat casual wear stores.

CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS EDGE UP IN FEBRUARY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Construction spending was nearly flat in February as a small increase in 
government projects was offset by slower work on housing and other 
non-government buildings, the Commerce Department reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Spending for new construction took place at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of $423 billion, inching up from $422.8 billion during the previous month. 
Construction spending had risen 0.4% in January. 
</P>
<P>
February's performance was the weakest since construction spending declined 
0.2% last August. Analysts said rising interest rates and caution about the 
economic outlook were holding back building activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing interest rates upward in 
an effort to slow economic growth and restrain inflation. Recent government 
reports on the economy's performance in February have suggested that growth may 
be slowing as the expansion extends into its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
Economist John Savacool of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said people 
don't expect the economic recovery to continue indefinitely and are becoming 
more cautious about construction projects in anticipation of the next downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people say: 'There's a recession coming. We don't know when, but we've 
got a feeling there's going to be one,' " Savacool said. "I wouldn't expect too 
much of any substantial construction activity until we get into the early part 
of the new year." 
</P>
<P>
In February, spending on residential construction declined 0.2% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $203.4 billion. The pace of building activity on 
single-family homes was unchanged, while spending on apartment construction 
rose 5.8% and home improvements decreased. 
</P>
<P>
Housing is one of the most interest rate-sensitive parts of the economy, 
although the availability of adjustable-rate mortgages has helped to ease the 
impact of rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages last week were averaging 11.19%, compared to 9.87% a year 
earlier. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also have risen sharply, 
with lenders asking an average initial rate of 9.31% last week, up from 7.53% a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Non-residential construction declined 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of $97.8 billion. Spending on industrial projects such as factories 
was down 1.9%, hotel and motel spending was down 4.2% and work on offices rose 
1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Spending on government construction, meanwhile, rose 0.7% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $82.7 billion. The largest category of government 
construction, highways and streets, was down 3.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Most other government categories posted gains or were unchanged, with spending 
on construction of educational facilities rising 4.8%.

UEBERROTH MAY LOWER BID FOR EASTERN

<P>
A group led by ex-baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth plans to lower its 
$464-million bid for strike-torn Eastern Airlines, sources close to Ueberroth 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to reduce its offer to reflect developer Donald J. Trump's 
agreement with Texas Air Corp. to buy Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle for 
$365 million, the sources said. Ueberroth's original proposal -- which was 
withdrawn last week after he was informed that it had been topped by another 
suitor -- was for all of Eastern, including the Boston-New York-Washington 
shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, union and airline sources said Monday that a 15-member committee 
representing unsecured creditors of Eastern was asking those interested in 
buying Miami-based Eastern to present their offers at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Union sources also said the Air Line Pilots Assn. has agreed to meet in the 
next few days with possible Eastern suitor Jay A. Pritzker, head of the Hyatt 
Corp. hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group on Thursday withdrew its $464-million offer for Eastern 
after Texas Air said it had been "materially" outbid by another suitor, 
identified by sources as Pritzker. 
</P>
<P>
However, Texas Air hasn't eliminated Ueberroth's bid from consideration, 
sources close to the company have said. 
</P>
<P>
Pritzker offered around $500 million for the whole airline, according to 
sources close to the situation. The Hyatt chairman is expected to meet soon 
with the Eastern pilots union, possibly today, union sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World 
Airlines Inc., also has expressed interest in Eastern and has garnered support 
from its unions. But he has not yet presented an offer to the Texas Air board. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group offered to give Eastern employees a 30% stake in the 
airline in exchange for salary concessions. The proposals by Pritzker and Icahn 
would involve similar arrangements, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Discuss Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, Icahn and Pritzker were unavailable for comment when contacted 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reviewing bids, the creditors committee also may discuss 
strategy and organizational issues related to Eastern's reorganization under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, according to people familiar with the 
proceedings who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's 
reorganization, has asked members of the creditors committee not to discuss 
developments at today's meeting with the press, the sources said. The meeting, 
possibly the first of a weekly series, is expected to be held in the offices of 
lawyers representing one of the creditors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee includes representatives of major aircraft and engine 
manufacturers, banks acting as trustees for Eastern bondholders, and the 
Eastern machinists and pilots and non-union employees. 
</P>
<P>
The panel has the right to review any reorganization plan proposed by Eastern 
and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy judge. It represents unsecured 
creditors, who are the most likely to lose money in the bankruptcy 
reorganization because they have no collateral, or security, from Eastern in 
case of default. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists union at Eastern struck the airline March 4, drawing the support 
of pilots and flight attendants and bringing operations to a virtual halt.

SUPPLY REPORT HURTS GRAIN, LIVESTOCK FUTURES

<P>
Most grain and livestock futures prices closed mostly lower Monday in response 
to supply figures released last week by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals prices were mostly higher and most energy 
futures declined. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the grain and soybean declines on the Chicago Board of 
Trade to the government report of higher-than-expected supplies of wheat, corn 
and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Also weighing on prices were weekend rains in growing areas, said grains 
analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Prices regained some ground after soybean contracts fell under the 
psychologically-important $7-a-bushel level, said analyst Steve Freed of Dean 
Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 4.75 cents to 7.50 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in May at $4.085 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 9.5 cents lower, with May at 
$2.59 a bushel; oats were 1 cent higher to 10 cents lower, with May at $1.87 a 
bushel, and soybeans were 10 cents to 28.25 cents lower, with May at $7.10 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat prices generally fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
Only one contract, for April live hogs, managed to finish higher. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's report on the supply of hogs and pigs indicated no shortage of hogs at 
any time soon, said livestock analyst Chuck Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures also suffered from the government's pork report, Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
He explained: "It showed competition from pork would be heavy." 
</P>
<P>
Record high prices at retail counters also has reduced consumer demand, Levitt 
said.

WICKES WILL SELL FURNITURE CHAIN, SOURCES SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wickes Furniture, a retail chain owned by Wickes Cos. of Santa Monica, is being 
sold to a group including the retailer's management and a company that 
specializes in selling companies to employees, reliable sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The price will be between $150 million and $200 million, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Since buying Wickes Cos. last December for $538.9 million, a New York 
partnership formed by the investment firms of Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. 
and Blackstone Group has been looking for buyers for the retailing portions of 
the conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said deals are expected to be announced soon for the sales of 
Builders Emporium and Orchard Supply Hardware. There has been "a substantial 
amount of interest in both," one source said, adding that the deal possibly 
would include Japanese or other foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wickes Cos. sold its credit card subsidiary for about $300 million to 
a corporation founded by two company executives. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Klein, president of Wickes Furniture, is participating in the purchase 
and is expected to remain in his post, as are other members of management. The 
other big investor is Kelso &amp; Co., a firm that specializes in setting up 
employee stock ownership plans, often after a leveraged buyout of a company. 
</P>
<P>
Founder Louis Kelso, a San Francisco investment banker, has helped create some 
form of employee ownership and profit sharing at more than 8,000 companies. 
</P>
<P>
Wickes Furniture, started in Fridley, Minn., in 1971, operates 23 retail 
outlets and two clearance stores in Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Minnesota, 
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, where it has seven locations. The company, which 
operates out of offices in Wheeling, Ill., plans to open a 24th retail store in 
Oxnard in September. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, the Wasserstein-Blackstone partnership will retain 
ownership of some of Wickes Furniture's real estate and lease the land back to 
the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership has been seeking to unload Wickes' non-manufacturing 
operations.

REPORTS THAT ECONOMY IS SLOWING GIVE BONDS A LIFT

Bond prices strengthened Monday, although they were knocked off their highs of 
the day by central bank action to reduce the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose $3.13 per $1,000 in face amount and its 
yield, which moves inversely, fell to 9.06% from 9.09% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The central banks' dollar sales were more effective than usual because the Bank 
of Japan joined in the dollar-lowering efforts after a long absence from 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers of seven major industrialized democracies said Sunday after a 
meeting that they would combat the dollar's appreciation by selling the 
currency in coordinated intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds held their gains for awhile after the dollar began its descent but 
eventually weakened, said Marilyn Cohen, an analyst at Capital Insight Inc. in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
An outlook for a declining dollar makes investors reluctant to invest in 
dollar-denominated securities as well as raising the risk of inflation spurred 
by more costly imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market was helped by a report the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Management released over the weekend that suggested economic growth slowed 
significantly in March. 
</P>
<P>
The report further eased fears of inflation and higher interest rates, which 
hurt the value of fixed-income investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Another report released Monday by the Commerce Department showed construction 
spending remained unchanged in February, viewed as another signal the economy 
is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-, medium- and 
long-term governments rose about 1/4 to about 3/8 point, financial information 
service Telerate Inc. reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 4.07 to 1,124.77. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials also strengthened. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.92 to 299.07. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds rose 1/4 point to 90 1/4. The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.78% 
from 7.79% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.875%, down from 10% late Friday.

NISSAN PLANS BIG EXPANSION OF ITS U.S. AUTO PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SMYRNA, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nissan announced Monday that it plans to dramatically expand its U.S. car and 
truck manufacturing operations here by 1992 and make its Tennessee complex the 
largest single auto plant -- American or Japanese -- in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will create 2,000 new jobs, increasing employment at the complex 
to 5,100 within three years, the Japanese auto maker said. The plant's 
production capacity will jump to a staggering 440,000 cars and trucks a year, 
up from the current annual rate of 240,000. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, most auto plants in this country produce only about 250,000 cars 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan's U.S. manufacturing operations, said the 
firm will also add a third car line at the plant but refused to identify which 
model. Industry analysts, however, said it will be a redesigned Stanza, 
Nissan's compact model. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Nissan produces its Sentra subcompact car, as well as all of its 
light pickup trucks, on Smyrna's assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan said it will invest $490 million to add 1.2 million square feet of space 
to the massive Smyrna facility -- which currently has 3.4 million square feet 
of space -- making it the largest plant under one roof in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's Smryna complex will remain slightly smaller than Honda's rapidly 
expanding Ohio operations, which will soon have the capacity to produce more 
than 500,000 units annually. But Honda's assembly and components manufacturing 
operations are spread out among several plants in different small towns in 
central Ohio; Honda is now building a second final-assembly plant in East 
Liberty, Ohio, not far from its first in Marysville. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to final assembly of a third vehicle, the expansion will also allow 
Smyrna to produce major components for Nissan's proposed joint venture with 
Ford to build minivans in a Ford plant in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's announcement comes at a time when Japan's second largest auto maker 
seems poised for a recovery in the American market, where its aging products 
and unoriginal car designs have led to slumping sales in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
To counter its image as a dull car maker, Nissan has launched an ambitious new 
product strategy in the 1989 model year. The company is introducing four 
all-new products during this model year. A new Maxima sedan and a new 240SX 
performance model came last October, the Axxess minivan replaced the Stanza 
wagon last month and a new Z car, the 300 ZX, designed to appeal to sports car 
enthusiasts, will come in May. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, next fall, Nissan will launch its new Infiniti line of luxury cars 
to compete against Honda's successful Acura line, and Toyota's new Lexus luxury 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the turnaround year for us," Benefield said. "Last year we 
didn't have any new cars, and this year we have four, with more to come later." 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts still wonder whether the increasingly glutted auto market can 
absorb additional domestic production capacity. With every major Japanese auto 
maker now producing cars here, they are finding it increasingly difficult to 
sell all of the cars they ship here from Japan. As a result, many analysts 
warn, some of the new Japanese plants in the United States will fail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a real turkey shoot, it'll be difficult for anyone to come in 
and get another 200,000 units like Nissan wants to do," said Bill Pochiluk, an 
analyst with Autofacts, a Paoli, Pa., research firm. 
</P>
<P>
One setback that Nissan has already suffered recently came when the Treasury 
Department ruled earlier this year that two-door utility vehicles imported from 
Japan, notably Nissan's popular Pathfinder, must be classified as trucks, and 
thus must be levied with a 25% import duty. Previously, they had been defined 
as cars, and so were hit with only a 2.5% tariff. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan has been forced to significantly increase Pathfinder prices as a result, 
potentially damaging the momentum of one of its hottest products. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Benefield said Nissan may eventually produce Pathfinders in Smyrna 
in order to avoid the duties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not currently being studied, but it's something we might look at," 
Benefield said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nissan expansion, to be completed in the summer of 1992, seems 
to deal a blow to the efforts of the United Auto Workers to organize Nissan's 
work force. With thousands of new employees entering the plant, the union may 
find it difficult to win over the majority needed to win a certification 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, UAW officials said they had enough signed union cards to call for 
an election at Nissan, but planned to wait until they had a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Benefield said the company, which opposes the union's 
campaign, has not heard from the union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been over a year since they had their ceremony to celebrate their 
card-signing drive," Benefield said, "and they still haven't called for any 
election." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Joyce, a UAW spokesman, said the expansion shouldn't have any impact on 
its drive at Nissan, which he described as "ongoing."

MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF SANTA ANA GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ and HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man has been arrested in Texas in connection with the murder of 
Nadia Puente, the 9-year-old Santa Ana girl who was abducted 2 weeks ago on her 
way home from school. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lucio DeHoyos, 31, was arrested Saturday by Santa Ana and San Antonio 
police at a taco stand in San Antonio but escaped the next day. He was arrested 
again less than an hour later sitting on a bus bench a few blocks from the 
jail, according to police and other reports. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, DeHoyos has told newspaper and TV reporters in San Antonio 
that he killed the schoolgirl in a Santa Ana hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"DeHoyos has been positively linked to the murder through physical evidence 
found at the scene," Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said at a news 
conference Monday. Walters and other police officials declined to elaborate on 
the evidence that led them to DeHoyos, who police said was a drifter who has 
lived in Los Angeles, Santa Ana and other parts of Orange County during the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Walters declined to say whether Santa Ana police have been able to question 
DeHoyos about the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Police did say, however, that a gray 1989 Nissan coupe that belonged to DeHoyos 
and matched the description of a car given by students at Nadia's school was 
found at Los Angeles International 
</P>
<P>
Airport. It has been impounded by police and will be searched for evidence, 
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police obtained a warrant for DeHoyos' arrest Friday before flying to 
San Antonio, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos' grandmother, contacted at her home in Los Angeles, said DeHoyos left 
Los Angeles for San Antonio to visit his mother about 2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-grader from Diamond Elementary School disappeared March 20 on her 
way home from school. Transients found her body the next day in Griffith Park. 
An autopsy found that she had been sexually molested and killed by asphyxiation 
caused by pressure against her chest. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos told reporters from a San Antonio newspaper that he had killed the girl 
in a Santa Ana hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"I drowned her in a bathtub," he calmly told a reporter from the San Antonio 
Light. "I didn't know her. I just picked her up. I was on drugs -- cocaine. I 
was angry. I'd lost my job. I was out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles coroner's office spokesman said DeHoyos' statement that he 
drowned the girl in a bathtub was not inconsistent with the autopsy findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statements Not Inconsistent 
</P>
<P>
"He might have pressed her chest and then put her in the water," spokesman Bob 
Dambacher said. "The object (that was pressed against her chest) could very 
well have been the floor . . . or the floor of the bathtub." 
</P>
<P>
Police said that DeHoyos' comments should not be considered a confession and 
asked that they not be given too much attention. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos' comments came Sunday night after he was arrested a second time in 
about 24 hours. After authorities booked him into Bexar County Jail early 
Sunday morning, he escaped. He wadded up a piece of paper and stuck it in the 
lock to his cell in the jail's intake area, preventing the lock from catching, 
Bexar County Jail Administrator Tom Barry told the San Antonio Express-News on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, he left his cell and took an elevator to the basement of the 
building, explaining to sheriff's deputies that he was there to get a prisoner 
released on bond and had become lost. 
</P>
<P>
Jailers escorted DeHoyos out of the jail -- a new, multimillion-dollar facility 
-- and told him not to come back in, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, jailers discovered that DeHoyos was missing and issued an 
all-points bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
He was found about an hour later at a bus bench a few blocks from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
The San Antonio Express-News reported Monday that Barry said he had ordered the 
firing of the jail's shift commander, a captain, as well as another jailer. Two 
other sheriff's deputies were to be placed on probation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos waived extradition at a court hearing in San Antonio on Monday. He was 
to leave for Los Angeles today, Texas authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, DeHoyos lived in a wood-frame boardinghouse on 24th Street in the 
Pico-Union section of Los Angeles, just north of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Cepeda, DeHoyos' former landlady, said he told her that he worked at the 
United States Aluminum Corp. in Vernon. "He came at 7 at night from work," 
Cepeda said. "He would cook his dinner and go to sleep, and that's all he ever 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Tenants at the boardinghouse described DeHoyos as a calm, quiet man who 
couldn't stand the smell of cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very quiet, never disrespectful," said Rita Comas, 27, a housekeeper 
for a Beverly Hills family. "He invited us to a picnic once, but we didn't go." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have any vices," Comas said in Spanish. "In the time I knew him I 
never saw him drink." 
</P>
<P>
Comas said DeHoyos shared a room in the three-room boardinghouse with two other 
men. "He moved to another room in the house because he had a new roommate who 
smoked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another boarder, Irma Vasquez, 28, said DeHoyos held various jobs, as a 
deliveryman and as a worker at a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
DeHoyos' grandmother, reached at her South-Central Los Angeles home, said he 
had stayed at her home for about 4 months before leaving suddenly for San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"He went by airplane about 2 weeks ago," said the elderly woman, who did not 
wish to give her name. "He said he wanted to see his mother." 
</P>
<P>
She said her grandson was raised in San Antonio and had come to Los Angeles 
after spending some time in Central America. His uncle got him a job at a 
nearby glass factory, but DeHoyos left the job because of "difficulties," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she could imagine DeHoyos committing a crime like the slaying of Nadia 
Puente, she answered in Spanish: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Behaved' 
</P>
<P>
"Here in the house he was good. He behaved." 
</P>
<P>
Police said DeHoyos that has no record as a sex offender in California and that 
his only apparent conviction was in Texas more than a decade ago. Details of 
that case were not immediately available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nadia's parents were taken by police to an undisclosed location just before the 
news conference and could not be reached for comment. The girl's uncle, Adan 
Arreola, said that he was glad an arrest had been made but that it was too 
early to feel relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's true or if it's the right person," Arreola said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Nadia was slain, Santa Ana police arrested another man and held 
a news conference much like Monday's, saying that physical evidence linked the 
man to the slaying and that they were confident they had the right suspect. 
</P>
<P>
But police released the man a few hours later after checking his alibi. Sgt. 
John McClain said Monday that the man had been "caught up in a web of 
circumstances" that was untangled only after he was arrested and questioned. 
</P>
<P>
The same physical evidence that had implicated the first suspect ultimately led 
police to DeHoyos, McClain said.

U.S., EGYPT SHARE GOALS FOR MIDEAST, BUSH SAYS; 
</P>

PRESIDENT MEETS MUBARAK, SUPPORTS 'PROPERLY STRUCTURED' TALKS, ASKS ARABS, 
ISRAEL TO YIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, opening a week of intense Middle East diplomacy, renewed 
American support Monday for "a properly structured" international conference to 
begin a new round of Arab-Israeli negotiations on ending the Israeli occupation 
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
With Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak standing at his side in the White House 
Rose Garden, Bush said that both Israel and the Palestinians must be prepared 
to yield some of their long-held positions in the dispute. But his remarks 
seemed certain to put far more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir, who confers with Bush later this week, than on the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and the United States share the goals of security for Israel, the end of 
the occupation and achievement of Palestinian political rights," Bush said. 
"These are the promises held out by a sustained commitment to a negotiated 
settlement, toward which a properly structured international conference could 
play a useful role at an appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
The President's carefully qualified endorsement of an international conference 
was virtually identical to the position staked out by the Reagan 
Administration. But it marked an abrupt change in emphasis for the Bush 
Administration after weeks in which Secretary of State James A. Baker III had 
said that it was far too early to consider a high-profile international 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings with Mubarak and Shamir represent the new Administration's first 
major venture into Middle East diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not spell out the sort of conference he would consider "properly 
structured." The Reagan Administration used the same phrase to provide room for 
diplomatic maneuvering, especially on the issue of Palestinian representation. 
U.S. officials refused to be more specific, although they said a conference 
attended by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would 
surely win approval if other conditions were acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir adamantly opposes any sort of international conference, insisting 
instead on direct negotiations between Israel and the neighboring Arab states. 
During his Washington visit, Shamir is expected to offer elections in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip to pick Palestinian leaders who might be brought into peace 
talks with Israel. But Shamir insists that Israel will never negotiate with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, which many Arab residents of the occupied 
territories see as their representative.

A senior U.S. official said Mubarak told Bush that Shamir's election plan would 
never get off the ground because Palestinians never would recognize elections 
supervised by the Israeli military government. Asked to characterize Bush's 
response, the official said that the President asked Mubarak if there were any 
conditions under which Palestinians would accept the balloting. The official 
refused to provide additional information, although PLO spokesmen have said 
that the organization would not object to an election organized by the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
In their comments to reporters, Bush and Mubarak used very similar language in 
calling for renewed peace talks. The Egyptian president wants a settlement 
"achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and all Arab partners, 
within the framework of the international conference." 
</P>
<P>
Bush urged a settlement that would achieve the "legitimate political rights" of 
Palestinians, and Mubarak said that the settlement should recognize the 
"legitimate national rights" of the Palestinians. Both phrases are 
intentionally ambiguous, covering anything from an independent Palestinian 
state to some form of limited self-rule. But both presidents emphasized that 
the Israeli occupation must be brought to an end. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent concession to the Israelis, Mubarak said that his government 
opposes "irredentist claims," a reference to Palestinian demands to return to 
cities and towns in Israel from which they or their ancestors fled during 
Israel's 1948 war of independence. In effect, Mubarak said that, although Egypt 
supports a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, it does not support 
Palestinian claims to Israel proper. 
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official said that the United States and Egypt remain far apart 
on the timing of an international conference. He said Mubarak wants the meeting 
to take place by early next year at the latest while "we believe that there's a 
lot of ground that has to be covered before there could be a possibly useful 
role for an international conference." 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian sources hailed Bush's endorsement of the concept of an international 
conference despite the conditions he attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is now a better indication of where the peace process is going," one 
source said. "Everything else that will be taking place will be taking place en 
route to the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mubarak clearly objected to Bush's deliberate pace. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the area stands at a historic crossroads certain to affect the 
future of many generations," he said. "The situation is ripe for an active 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Mubarak met for a little more than an hour at the White House. Then 
Mubarak accompanied Bush to Baltimore to attend the Orioles-Red Sox 
season-opening game, although baseball is virtually unknown in Egypt. Mubarak 
said it was the first game he had ever attended.

RIGHT TO STOP DRUG SUSPECTS WIDENED; 
</P>
<P>
AGENTS MAY SEARCH AIR TRAVELERS WHO ACT LIKE COURIERS, HIGH COURT HOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, giving the government another weapon in the war on drugs, 
ruled Monday that agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and 
act like drug couriers. 
</P>
<P>
If agents have a "reasonable suspicion" that a traveler is carrying drugs, they 
may question him and search his bags without violating his privacy rights under 
the Fourth Amendment, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in 7-2 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate opinion, the court ruled that a city may set up separate dance 
halls for teen-agers to protect them from the "corrupting influences" of older 
customers of such establishments. 
</P>
<P>
In the drug case (U.S. vs. Sokolow, 87-1295), the court upheld the airport 
arrest of a Honolulu man who was returning home from a quick trip to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid for Ticket With Cash 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said that the combined weight of several pieces of evidence can give 
agents sufficient reason to detain a suspect. Agents saw the passenger, Andrew 
Sokolow, pay for his $2,100 ticket with a wad of $20 bills. His ticket called 
for a two-day round trip to a city known for its drug trafficking. He was 
traveling under an assumed name. He did not check any baggage. He was said to 
be "very nervous" when seen by agents on a stopover at Los Angeles 
International Airport. And he was wearing a black jump suit with a gold chain. 
</P>
<P>
"Any one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is 
quite consistent with innocent travel," Rehnquist said. "But we think, taken 
together, they amount to reasonable suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. narcotics agents found 1,063 grams of cocaine in a shoulder bag when they 
stopped Sokolow outside the Honolulu airport on July 25, 1984. But the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco threw out Sokolow's conviction and 
five-year prison sentence, ruling that drug agents may not stop passengers 
simply because they look or act like criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has operated a 
surveillance program in the nation's major airports in an effort to spot and 
apprehend drug traffickers. Agents rely in part on a "drug courier profile" of 
suspicious characteristics to choose their targets. 
</P>
<P>
If the 9th Circuit standard were followed, it "would outlaw a large percentage 
of the stops of suspected narcotics traffickers who pass through the nation's 
airports," government attorneys had told the justices. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling goes further than previous Supreme Court decisions toward upholding 
the detention and subsequent search of a person based on evidence that is not 
criminal in itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Endorse Profile 
</P>
<P>
The high court did not specifically endorse the DEA's use of a drug courier 
profile. Instead, Rehnquist said that the evidence gathered by agents gave them 
sufficient reason to detain Sokolow. 
</P>
<P>
In two splintered decisions in the early 1980s, the court was unable to achieve 
a consensus on whether drug agents may stop and search an airline passenger 
whose behavior was suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
However, in more than a dozen rulings over the last three years, the justices 
have given government officials more leeway to pursue drug suspects. The court 
has not ruled that government agents violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on 
unreasonable searches and seizures in any drug case considered since Rehnquist 
became chief justice in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Check Garbage Cans 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the court has ruled that police officers may inspect garbage 
cans left at curb side, that low-flying helicopters may be used to spot 
marijuana plants, that policemen may pursue a person who flees on seeing a 
squad car and that government employees may be required to take drug tests on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar, a criminal law expert, 
criticized the Rehnquist court for "down-sizing the Fourth Amendment" to allow 
law enforcement to fight the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they feel pressure because of the horrors of drug trafficking, so they 
are trying to bring into line the few liberal courts we have left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. dissented in the drug 
courier case, arguing that drug agents should not be permitted to seize a 
suspect unless they have "at least some evidence of criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court overturned a Texas decision that said that young people 
have a right of "social association" that bars the creation of separate dance 
halls for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a Texas appellate court struck down a Dallas ordinance creating 
special dance halls for people 14 to 18 years old on the grounds that the law 
restricted their freedom of association under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
There is no constitutionally protected right of social association for 
teen-agers or anyone else, Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous court. If Dallas 
city officials believe it would be beneficial to segregate teen-agers from 
older persons, they are free to do so without running afoul of the U.S. 
Constitution, he said in the case (Dallas vs. Stanglin, 87-1848). 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution makes no mention of freedom of association, but the Supreme 
Court has said that protecting the free speech of political groups requires 
that their members be free to associate with anyone they choose. In other 
cases, the court has referred to a freedom of "intimate association" among 
members of a family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000 Youths in Dance Hall 
</P>
<P>
Neither has anything to do with dance halls, Rehnquist said. Of the more than 
1,000 young people who gather at the Twilight Skating Rink and dance hall in 
Dallas, many are strangers to one another, he said, and those young people 
certainly do not "take positions on public questions." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, members of all-male private clubs have argued that their right 
to freedom of association permitted them to exclude women, but they have fared 
no better before the high court than the Dallas teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled 6 to 3 that Indian tribal courts have jurisdiction over the custody 
of Indian babies, even if the parents leave a reservation to give up their 
children for adoption. Citing a 1978 law, Justice Brennan said that Congress 
intended to keep Indian children on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"Tribal jurisdiction under (the 1978) law was not meant to be defeated by the 
actions of individual members of the tribe," Brennan said in the case 
(Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians vs. Holyfield, 87-980). Rehnquist and 
Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Up Boeing Case 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether the Boeing Co. violated a federal 
conflict-of-interest law by giving large severance payments to five employees 
who were leaving to take top jobs in the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
One of the five, Melvin R. Paisley, was awarded $183,000 before becoming 
assistant secretary of the Navy for research. Since leaving the Defense 
Department, Paisley has become a subject of the government's investigation of 
fraud in defense procurement. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said that its payments were intended to "encourage public service," but 
a federal appeals court in Richmond said that they appeared designed to give 
extra compensation to influential government officials. The case (Boeing vs. 
United States, 88-938) will be heard in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether a Baltimore mother may be kept in jail until she 
tells where her abused child is being kept (Baltimore Department of Social 
Services vs. Bouknight, 88-1182). Authorities suspect that the woman may have 
killed her baby, but a Maryland appellate court ruled that she has a right to 
remain silent and may not be held in jail for refusing to talk. In December, 
acting on an emergency appeal by city officials, Rehnquist had ordered the 
woman held.

FLOW OF OIL TO STATE RISES; SO DO GAS PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The flow of Alaskan oil to California quickened Monday when the Coast Guard 
lifted some restrictions on tanker traffic, but the erratic spurt in gasoline 
prices on the West Coast showed no sign of abating. 
</P>
<P>
The prices charged by refiners for unleaded gasoline jumped anywhere from 2 
cents to 15 cents a gallon in Los Angeles early in the day, and further price 
increases were to take effect at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up 27 at Pump 
</P>
<P>
The price hikes were being passed on to consumers to widely varying degrees -- 
in some cases, the increases have been as much as 27 cents a gallon at the pump 
since the March 24 oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
An early sign of a backlash against the retail price run-up in the wake of the 
spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound came in a lawsuit by an Orange County 
group demanding that Exxon Corp., whose tanker released the massive spill, 
repay motorists for the higher consumer costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford to put gas in my car anymore -- just because of some sailor 
who'd been out drinking," said Katherine D. White, a Newport Beach legal 
secretary who is a plaintiff in the class-action suit. "Exxon should have to 
pay for this. Then maybe, next time, they'll be a little more careful." 
</P>
<P>
The suit reflects another dimension to the public relations beating the oil 
industry is taking as a result of the spill as consumers feel they are paying 
at the pump for Exxon's negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon had no comment on the suit, but Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said, 
"There's no question there are people who think we are trying to take advantage 
of a situation. But we're not gouging customers, we're passing on real costs." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued price run-up, the resumption of a full schedule of oil 
shipments from the port of Valdez was cited by Energy Department officials as 
evidence that the tight supplies and sharp price increases on the West Coast 
are temporary and that the situation is likely to ease in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker news took some of the pressure off crude oil prices on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, where the price for future shipments of a benchmark U.S. 
crude oil fell by 24 cents after a series of steep climbs last week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the price of unleaded gasoline for immediate delivery continued its 
climb, rising an additional 0.88 of a cent to 67.85 cents a gallon, the highest 
level in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
But late Monday, operators of the trans-Alaska pipeline said that they had been 
notified at midday that some restrictions were being reimposed by the Coast 
Guard -- at the request of Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper -- limiting the tankers 
once again to daylight operation. 
</P>
<P>
But Alyeska Pipeline Co. said it hoped that three or four tankers could move 
out of Valdez each day, versus the one a day allowed since Tuesday, despite the 
reimposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield, the biggest producer in Alaska and the leading gasoline 
retailer in California, voiced concern that shipping lanes would be closed 
altogether for at least a day when the crippled tanker, the Exxon Valdez, is 
refloated later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The normal 2-million-barrel-a-day flow of Alaskan crude was stopped altogether 
for four days after the oil spill, then was resumed at a rate of 800,000 
barrels a day. Flow through the pipeline was raised Monday to 1.4 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
California normally gets 40% of its oil from Alaska; regions on the West Coast 
that lack domestic oil production get 50% or more of their crude from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Arco and the other main shippers of oil from Alaska's North Slope, Exxon and BP 
America, have all cut back refinery operations to varying degrees in the Puget 
Sound and San Francisco Bay area while delaying or cutting deliveries to their 
crude oil customers. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, has touched off a scramble by refining companies for crude oil 
from other sources in anticipation of having trouble finding oil, and some 
refiners and middlemen were apparently paying a premium for such oil or 
exacting a premium price from their own anxious customers. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the "rack," or wholesale, prices charged by 16 Southern California 
refiners had jumped an average of 20 cents a gallon to an average of 90 cents 
for regular unleaded gasoline since the March 24 incident, according to 
PetroScan, an information service. 
</P>
<P>
The increases over the last six days range from 4 cents a gallon at the Chevron 
refinery in El Segundo to nearly 33 cents a gallon by Powerine, an independent 
refiner in Santa Fe Springs, according to PetroScan. 
</P>
<P>
Those wholesale prices, which don't include the nearly 19 cents in state and 
federal taxes on gasoline or transportation charges to service stations, would 
typically be at least 25 cents below the retail price ultimately paid by 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
However, price increases are affected by marketing strategies of the bigger oil 
companies and by the prices charged by stations down the street, dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll Hansen, a Shell Oil Co. dealer in an affluent Westside area, said 
Monday that his wholesale price climbed an additional 1.6 cents a gallon Monday 
but that a Shell dealer in another Shell "price zone" was charged an extra 4.6 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
It was not uncommon Monday to see retail price differentials of 10 to 12 cents 
a gallon from one brand to the next within a few blocks of each other, 
depending on which refiner those dealers bought their gasoline from. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were rumors that refiners were holding gasoline off the market 
because stocks were running low and they wanted to satisfy the needs of regular 
customers -- leaving distributors and dealers without long-term supply 
arrangements in dire straits. 
</P>

<P>
Chart, Wholesale Gasoline Price -- The spread between lowest and highest 
wholesale gasoline prices has widened significantly in the past week. The 
average, meanwhile, has jumped nearly 20 cents a gallon. The range is based on 
prices charged by 16 refiners in Southern California for a gallon of unleaded 
gasoline. Prices at the pump (including taxes) are typically at least 25 cents 
per gallon higher. Price range Monday: 73 cents-$1.07. Average price Monday: 
90.3 cents. Los Angeles Times

JUSTICE BENKE -- WAS SHE PUT ON 'MOMMY TRACK' ON WAY TO HIGH COURT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Patricia Benke is sitting at her desk, below a smiling, autographed 
picture of Gov. George Deukmejian, insisting that she is not washed up. It is 
odd that she feels compelled to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Benke is, after all, something of a Wunderkind. Ever since Deukmejian named her 
to the Municipal Court bench in mid-1983, Benke has powered through the 
judicial ranks at a dazzling pace. Today, at age 39, she is the youngest member 
and only woman on the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, Deukmejian bypassed Benke for a seat on the California Supreme 
Court. The aftermath for her has been downright bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started when Justice Marcus Kaufman remarked that Benke -- widely 
viewed as the favorite among four candidates for the prestigious post -- may 
well have lost the job because she refused to uproot her family and move to San 
Francisco, where the court is based. 
</P>
<P>
Benke, who said she wanted to be "completely honest" with the governor's 
appointments staff, also told them she would have trouble spending more than 
three days a week away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Benke conceded that managing the workload of a state Supreme Court justice 
while spending just three days a week in the office would have been difficult. 
But she said she would have "given it my darndest" and would have "patterned 
myself after the men up there," two of whom spend shortened workweeks in San 
Francisco because of long commutes. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office will not confirm whether Benke's unwillingness to 
relocate was, in fact, the deciding strike against her, and the justice says 
it's all a mystery to her. Nonetheless, the possibility that it played a 
pivotal role has created quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kaufman's observation provoked a rousing debate: Had Benke been 
relegated to the "Mommy Track"? 
</P>
<P>
"After Justice Kaufman made that comment, people from all over started sending 
me articles on this 'mommy track' thing," Benke said in a recent interview. "I 
had no idea the sensitive chord that was struck out there. It just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
The "mommy track" concept was outlined in January in the Harvard Business 
Review by veteran feminist Felice Schwartz, who suggested that some working 
mothers might be willing to sacrifice a degree or career advancement and 
compensation in exchange for flexible hours. The proposition has since been 
subject to a bitter assault by those who contend that such a track would 
institutionalize unequal treatment of women in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
After Kaufman's remark, Benke was deluged with requests for interviews, as well 
as invitations to appear on television talk shows around California. A few 
colleagues, believing that Benke indeed had been mommy-tracked, grumbled that 
it was unfair. Women lawyer groups throughout the state also took an interest. 
</P>
<P>
The hubbub over Benke all but stole the spotlight from the true woman of the 
hour -- Court of Appeal Justice Joyce Kennard in Los Angeles, Deukmejian's 
choice to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice John A. Arguelles. 
</P>
<P>
Benke, meanwhile, was beginning to feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, she said that if her desire to commute to the high court job had 
tipped the scales against her, then that in itself was "an absolutely 
legitimate" reason. Although Benke stands by that statement today, she said she 
might have "given off the wrong signal" -- or led people to believe that she 
has in fact been mommy-tracked and that it's just dandy with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up and said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on out there in the world? Am 
I pushing myself into a position of saying, 'Well, I'm just going to raise my 
children now and go to plays and bake blueberry muffins?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's not where I see myself at all," Benke said emphatically. "I'm 39 years 
old. I plan on being around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committed to Husband 
</P>
<P>
Benke calls herself "a fairly traditional mom" and said she is unswervingly 
committed to her husband, Don, and two young sons. But all of the "mommy track" 
talk made her uneasy -- worried that "people might think I was removing myself 
from consideration for something else." 
</P>
<P>
"The way this was being portrayed, I was afraid there was this perception I had 
cut off my career," she said. "I can roll with the punches, but I'm certainly 
not ready to sit back and retire." 
</P>
<P>
As the news spread, speculation became contagious. Court watchers and feminists 
-- who had tabbed Benke as the favorite because she was the only contender who 
was on the governor's list when he last made appointments to the court in 1987 
-- began offering their own, often conflicting opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the governor may have been justifiably leery of appointing another 
justice whose home base was outside the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles, who stepped down after just two years on the court, says the burden 
of commuting and being separated from his family in Orange County was 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson live in 
Southern California and spend a shortened workweek in San Francisco, typically 
arriving at the court Monday morning and returning home Thursday night. Some 
scholars have warned that the strain of such commutes, coupled with the court's 
heavy workload, could contribute to early "burnout." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge's Assessment 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very onerous job, and many of those who have tried commuting have 
found it does not work for them personally," said San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Judith McConnell, immediate past president of the National Assn. of Women 
Judges. "Clearly, the governor wants to appoint people who are going to stay 
there for a significant length of time." 
</P>
<P>
Given that goal, and given the governor's knowledge that commuters have 
complained of "an unhappy marriage between work and home life," Benke's 
decision not to relocate "may have been the telling mark against her," 
McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of my contacts with the governor's office have indicated he's prejudiced 
against mothers," McConnell said. "I'm unwilling to say there was a double 
standard at work. I haven't seen it in other appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Others have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Benke's desire to keep her 
residence in San Diego might have stacked the odds against her. 
</P>
<P>
The president of California Women Lawyers, Los Angeles attorney Janice 
Kamenir-Reznik, said it would be "an inappropriate sort of invasion into 
someone's personal life to mandate how close they live to their job if they are 
in fact qualified for the job." 
</P>
<P>
"The only question is, can they be at work and are they capable of conducting 
the work they need to conduct," Kamenir-Reznik said. "That's the only thing 
relevant." 
</P>
<P>
Kamenir-Reznik stressed that she has no evidence other than "scuttlebutt" to 
suggest that the governor chose Kennard because she was willing to move to San 
Francisco and Benke was not. And she lauded Kennard, 47, as "an excellent 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kamenir-Reznik and others in feminist legal circlesargue that if 
Lucas and Eagleson live outside the Bay Area and make long treks to work, Benke 
could too. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that Deukmejian had passed her over in favor of Kennard, Benke 
spent a while pondering the episode alone in the quiet of her sixth-floor 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting because the first time through, I was a long shot . . . and 
this time there was this expectation out there (that I would be selected)," 
Benke said. "I had to find a way emotionally to let go of it, to get rid of the 
trappings." 
</P>
<P>
It took a few days. There was a leisurely fishing trip with a son, lots of 
second-guessing, a ton of "what ifs." 
</P>
<P>
Would the job have been hers if she had persuaded her husband, a production 
supervisor at KPBS-TV, to abandon their sprawling, custom-built home near San 
Diego State University for a new life in the Bay Area? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Benke said, "I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Was it wrong to tell the governor's office that, if appointed, she would be 
reluctant to spend more than three days a week away from her husband and sons, 
Michael, 7, and Pete, 5? 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to be honest," Benke said. "If I were a different person, I could 
say, 'No problem. I'll leave my kids with the housekeeper.' But that's not me. 
. . . I just couldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Did that place her at a competitive disadvantage from the outset? 
</P>
<P>
No one said it was a liability, "but I think I knew from the beginning it was," 
Benke said. "If you've got somebody who says, 'My bags are packed and if the 
call comes, I'm gone. I'll give 110%.' And you've got another person who says, 
'I'd love the job. I'll do my best. But I need to tell you, this is my 
limitation.' 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do? Your highest priority has to be what's good for the court." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's one other possibility to confront: "Maybe they just liked 
Joyce better than me." 
</P>
<P>
Benke is upbeat about her career, her life. It is time, she said, to "really 
dig in here and concentrate," to develop a writing style and a judicial 
philosophy, to make a mark on the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, Benke admits that she still has her eye on a state Supreme 
Court job, which she calls "an incredible opportunity" and something that 
"someone who loves the law just doesn't pass up." 
</P>
<P>
"Will it happen? Maybe someday. I don't know. It's one of those things that 
really is in the laps of the gods."

TEAMSTERS SPLIT DESPITE SUIT ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
NO. 2 OFFICIAL HITS SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. BY UNION LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fratricidal warfare in the Teamsters Union, precipitated by the Justice 
Department's anti-racketeering suit against the 1.6-million-member union, has 
intensified, despite the fact that the case was settled last month. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Teamster officials all over the country received a letter from 
Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis, the union's No. 2 official, 
attacking the settlement that Teamster President William J. McCarthy and 10 
Teamster vice presidents approved March 13. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, McCarthy and his general counsel, James T. Grady, held meetings 
around the country defending the settlement, attempting to minimize its impact 
on the union and vociferously attacking Mathis as a traitor to the union for 
making a separate settlement with the government earlier in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presser Attacked 
</P>
<P>
Sources attending the meetings also said that McCarthy attacked his 
predecessor, the late Jackie Presser, as a "stool pigeon" because Presser had 
served as an FBI informant for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, persons attending meetings on the settlement said they were given 
the impression that top Teamster leaders will campaign against direct, 
secret-ballot election of union officers in 1991. Changing the Teamster 
constitution to hold elections this way was one of the key provisions of the 
settlement that was reached on March 13. 
</P>
<P>
Mathis' letter defends his own conduct and a settlement he and Teamster Vice 
Presidents Donald West of Birmingham, Ala., and Edward Lawson of Vancouver, 
Canada, reached with the government, where they pledge to support direct 
election of union officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential difference between the five-page agreement entered into by Vice 
Presidents Lawson, West and me and the 30-page McCarthy consent order is that 
our agreement did not relinquish control of our union to the government," the 
Mathis letter states. 
</P>
<P>
"The McCarthy agreement, for example, provides the court-appointed 
administrator with authority over such things as appointments, expenditures and 
union contracts; ours did not," the letter adds. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also attacks McCarthy for bringing a proposed settlement to the 
Teamster executive board that would have required five executive board members 
to resign. The board unanimously rejected the proposal, and ultimately the 
government dropped that demand. 
</P>
<P>
(However, in connection with the settlement, Teamster Vice President Donald 
Peters of Chicago agreed to resign, and Vice President Harold Friedman of 
Cleveland agreed to take a leave of absence until appeals of his criminal 
conviction are concluded.) 
</P>
<P>
Other Teamster officials and attorneys say that the Mathis letter misrepresents 
the union's settlement with the government. One characterized the letter as 
"the start of Mathis' campaign to run for president against McCarthy in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Last July, in a special election held by the board after the death of Presser, 
McCarthy defeated Mathis, 9 to 8, to be the new president. Mathis had been 
Presser's choice to succeed him and had been considered the likely winner until 
the day before the vote. Sources close to Mathis say that he was deeply 
embittered about his surprise defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters' settlement with the Justice Department does not relinquish 
control of the union to the government, but it does provide that three 
court-appointed officials will have the power to review union appointments and 
expenditures until the union's convention in 1991, with an eye toward 
preventing any corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In a Teamster brochure on the settlement, Grady states that a court-appointed 
investigations officer can "look for corruption anywhere he can find it within 
the IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters)." The investigator can look at 
Teamster books and records and interview persons who may have information on 
allegations of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
At the meetings last week, Grady told Teamster officials that only Mathis, West 
and Lawson are obligated to support direct elections when that issue comes up 
for a vote at the 1991 convention. In the past, top Teamster officers have been 
elected by voice vote of delegates at conventions held every five years. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement provides that the union's constitution be amended to provide for 
direct secret-ballot election of these officers. However, the settlement also 
provides that changes to the constitution are to be ratified by delegates at 
the 1991 convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free-Speech Rights 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also provides that the Teamster board members do not surrender 
any of their free-speech rights in regard to terms of the settlement, and Grady 
reiterated that point in explaining the settlement to persons who attended the 
meetings in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
This left many attending with the impression that Teamster board members will 
campaign against a change in election procedures. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about this possibility, Randy M. Mastro, the assistant U.S. attorney 
in New York who was the chief prosecutor in the case, said: "That system 
(direct elections) is now part of the Teamster constitution and not subject to 
change, without prior government approval," or court approval. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event the Teamsters are in breach (of the agreement), the government 
retains its right to enforce the order," seek a contempt order against the 
union or reopen the litigation, Mastro said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mastro, McCarthy and Grady are all scheduled to testify at a hearing by 
the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the government's use of 
the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to impose 
trusteeships on labor unions and other entities.

3 TELEDYNE EXECUTIVES CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY, BRIBERY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST DEFENSE FRAUD PROBE TRIAL OPENS

<P>
The first trial in the federal government's massive Ill Wind defense fraud 
inquiry opened Monday with prosecutors alleging that the case against three 
Teledyne Industries Inc. executives is "about bribery, about cheating, about 
lying." 
</P>
<P>
The executives went on trial in U.S. District Court here, 2 1/2 years after 
federal agents began gathering evidence that defense consultants were bribing 
Pentagon officials for inside information on military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the defendants told the jury that their clients were unaware of any 
illegal activities by consultants hired to help Teledyne obtain a $24-million 
Pentagon electronics contract. 
</P>
<P>
On trial are George H. Kaub, a vice president in charge of contracts at 
Teledyne Electronics, a unit of Teledyne Industries based in Newbury Park, 
Calif.; Eugene R. Sullivan, Teledyne Electronics' former vice president for 
finance; and Dale Schnittjer, the current Teledyne Electronics vice president 
for finance. 
</P>
<P>
They were indicted on Jan. 6 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery 
of a public official. Each faces at least 50 years in prison and fines of $1.5 
million. All three have been suspended with pay, a Teledyne spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert J. Dehenzel Jr. said the 
government would prove that the three Teledyne executives participated in an 
elaborate scheme to bribe a Navy official to obtain confidential data on Navy 
plans to buy the electronics gear, which is used to test radar sets on 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Dehenzel cited extensive wiretapped conversations between the Teledyne 
executives and the consultants as proof that the Teledyne officers were aware 
that the consulting fees they authorized were used to corrupt the Pentagon 
procurement process. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the prosecutor said, consultant William L. Parkin of Alexandria 
pressed Schnittjer for payments for his confederates in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody works for nothing anymore," Parkin allegedly told the Teledyne 
executive in one wiretapped telephone conversation. "It takes a lot of 
spaghetti and meatballs to grease the skids on some of these things." 
</P>
<P>
Four individuals and two companies -- including Teledyne -- already have 
pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, fraud, bribery and filing false 
statements in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$8.4 Million in Penalties 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne admitted its role in the conspiracy last month and agreed to pay fines 
and reimbursements of as much as $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed its involvement on its former Washington marketing manager, 
Michael Savaides, who also has pleaded guilty to charges in the case. Woodland 
Hills, Calif., defense consultant Fred H. Lackner and Navy Deparment 
electronics procurement supervisor Stuart E. Berlin also have admitted to the 
federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the three Teledyne executives acknowledged that the procurement 
system had been corrupted but said that their clients were unaware of the 
conspiracy and had in fact been its victims. 
</P>
<P>
"This conspiracy was directed at Teledyne as much as at the government," said 
George O'Connell, representing Sullivan. "This was a conspiracy not only to 
defraud the United States but to conceal, to actively hide from Mr. Sullivan 
what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged that Sullivan, Kaub and Schnittjer agreed to pay Parkin 
$160,000 for his role in helping Teledyne obtain the Navy contract. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parkin has admitted using the money to pay Lackner and Berlin for 
inside information on the contract, the Teledyne executives contended Monday 
that they had no idea what he was doing.

DRUG ISSUE RAISED IN HAVANA TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
CASTRO AND GORBACHEV REPORTEDLY SEEK FRESH APPROACH 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began his first full day of talks with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro on Monday amid indications that the two may be 
looking for a fresh approach to fighting the growing flow of drugs from Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
During their first 90 minutes of formal talks in the morning, both Gorbachev 
and Castro addressed the drug problem, according to Soviet spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov, who sketchily described the meeting to reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev believes "something must be done," Gerasimov said, even though 
"Colombia is a long way from Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
But he said it was Castro who first raised the drug issue. Characterizing the 
Cuban Communist leader's remarks, Gerasimov said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Even More Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
"But for the United States' market, the narcotics business would be dead. Now 
those who supply the market have become consumers, and that is even more 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
He said Castro seemed especially distressed by the spread of drug use among 
Latin American youth and appeared anxious to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have long expressed the hope that Cuba will do its share in the 
drug war by at least cracking down on traffickers they say now fly with 
impunity over the island country to drop cocaine shipments destined for North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of diplomatic relations, the United States has not formally 
asked for cooperation, nor has Castro volunteered it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gerasimov, Gorbachev told Castro that even though the drug crisis 
is a long way from Moscow, he, too, is anxious to do more, "under the auspices 
of the United Nations," to fight it. By stressing the drugs aspect of the talks 
between the two Communist leaders, the Soviet spokesman appeared to be 
suggesting that they may do more than simply talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
During the first day of the first visit by a Soviet leader here since the late 
Leonid I. Brezhnev came in 1974, Gorbachev and Castro held an hour-and-a-half 
of formal "negotiations," as Gerasimov described the talks, and another two 
hours of "private" face-to-face discussion. Cuban officials have been careful 
to describe the meetings as "conversations" to avoid the implication that they 
have any issues to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The pair also chatted informally and sometimes animatedly at several ceremonial 
appearances, including a wreath laying at the monument to 19th-Century Cuban 
independence hero Jose Marti in downtown Havana and a tour of ExpoCuba, a newly 
constructed permanent trade fairground. But their remarks could not be 
overheard by spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a reported strain in their relations brought on by orthodox Marxist 
Castro's rejection of Soviet-style political and economic reforms under 
Gorbachev's programs of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), 
there was little open evidence of a rift between the two men. However, 
Moscow-based journalists did note that Gorbachev appeared to have adopted a 
somewhat cool manner toward Castro that was noticeably more polite and 
businesslike than the amiable public personality he has displayed while 
visiting other countries such as Britain and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In his one public remark to reporters at the wreath laying, Gorbachev 
diplomatically evaded a question about how perestroika should apply to Cuba by 
replying with a Russian play on words, using perestroika to mean "these are 
times of change (restructuring)" rather than its specific application to 
reforms in the Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
In their formal talks, the two men avoided specific problems facing Latin 
America other than its "enormous debt" problem, said Gerasimov. "The situation 
in Latin America is a burning one," he said, referring to the debt burden of 
many of the Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a small group of American reporters later, Gerasimov hinted that 
Gorbachev may make a public show of forgiving Cuba's estimated $9-billion to 
$20-billion debt to the Soviet Union when he makes his only major speech of the 
three-day visit at the Cuban National Assembly this afternoon. Diplomats here 
anticipated such a move as an inexpensive gesture designed to pressure Western 
nations into forgiving their own Third World debt. 
</P>
<P>
But the other burning question of the Gorbachev trip -- what he might have to 
say about Central America, where the Soviets fund the Sandinista government of 
Nicaragua and Cuba supports El Salvador rebels -- remained unanswered. 
Gerasimov said the two men touched on the subject but did not get into a 
detailed discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had speculated before Gorbachev's arrival here Sunday that the Soviet 
leader might unveil a fresh peace plan for Central America in response to pleas 
last week from President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III for 
"new thinking" about the region, including an end to Nicaragua military aid. 
Referring to news reports of Bush's message to Gorbachev, Gerasimov said only 
that "I believe the subject will be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Later he told American reporters that Moscow opposes exporting revolution, long 
a staple of Cuban foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Indigenous Revolutions' 
</P>
<P>
"'This exportation is what we are against," Gerasimov said. "Like Cuba, these 
are indigenous revolutions that start at home. . . . You cannot make other 
peoples happy (by exporting it to them.)" 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, wearing the same pale blue dress, snakeskin shoes and 
simple necklace that she had on when they arrived Sunday, accompanied the 
Soviet leader to the wreath-laying ceremony and placed her own bouquet of red 
roses beneath his more elaborate display at the foot of the monument. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting the Soviet-Cuba Friendship Assn. and a child day-care center, 
she changed her jewelry for a more elaborate silver necklace and bracelet 
before touring the former home of American writer Ernest Hemingway, now a 
museum, at San Francisco de Paula near Havana. Expressing a fondness for the 
author's works, she named "The Sun Also Rises" and "The Old Man and the Sea" as 
particular favorites and said, "It is impossible for me to think of a cultured 
person who hasn't read Hemingway."

EX-CIA OFFICIAL RELATES PLAN TO AVOID CONGRESSIONAL BAN; 
</P>
<P>
CASEY WANTED NORTH TO HELP CONTRAS, JURY TOLD

<P>
A former CIA official testified Monday that William J. Casey, the late CIA 
director, designated Oliver L. North to assist the Nicaraguan Contras after 
Congress cut off U.S. government funding for the rebel forces in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-official, Vincent M. Cannistraro, said he attended a meeting that year 
at which Casey announced that he had obtained the approval of then-President 
Ronald Reagan to make North "the reference point" for aiding the Contras when 
Congress barred the CIA from continuing to play that role. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro's testimony came as North's attorneys opened their defense of the 
retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council aide who 
is being tried on 12 felony counts in the Iran-Contra scandal. North's 
attorneys are expected to call witnesses for the next few days, after which the 
two-month-old case will go to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Cannistraro, a former CIA supervisor who was permitted by the 
judge to avoid giving his exact job title in the agency, bolstered contentions 
of defense lawyers that North was acting at the direction of his superiors when 
he helped organize efforts to assist the Contras during a two-year period when 
Congress prohibited government aid. 
</P>
<P>
The principal charges against North are not that he helped the Contras but that 
he gave false statements to Congress about his activities and obstructed 
congressional inquiries into his affairs. But Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's 
chief defense attorney, has argued that the Reagan Administration's overall 
plan envisioned keeping the extent of North's activities secret from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers have not disclosed whether he will take the witness stand at 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro testified about two meetings called by Casey in early 1984 to 
outline North's role in the event Congress cut off funding for the Contras, as 
it did later that year. He said that Casey, who died in 1987, "wanted to assure 
the Nicaraguan freedom fighters that the United States would find a way" to 
support them after the congressional ban took effect. 
</P>
<P>
In the second meeting, attended also by North, Contra leader Adolfo Calero and 
two other CIA officials, Cannistraro said that Casey reported he had discussed 
North's prospective Contra role with Reagan and that "he (Casey) agreed with 
the President that this is how it should be handled." 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony by defense witnesses, Stanley Sporkin, the CIA's former 
general counsel, told of drafting a "presidential finding" signed by Reagan in 
early 1986 to authorize covert efforts to free American hostages in Lebanon 
through the sale of U.S. arms to so-called moderates in the Iranian government. 
Some money from the sale was later diverted to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin said that the finding included a provision that Reagan could wait some 
time before notifying Congress of the covert hostage mission, although timely 
notification of such operations generally is given to members of the House and 
Senate Intelligence committees. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Sullivan why such a provision was included, Sporkin, now a 
federal district judge in Washington, replied: "You want to keep the 
information as tightly as possible to make sure the operation doesn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan has contended that North feared his own secret assistance to the 
Contras would have been jeopardized if he had answered questions honestly from 
congressional committees about his private fund-raising efforts for the rebels 
and the military advice he was providing them. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked Sporkin whether lying to 
Congress would have been permissible regardless of what Reagan had signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, sir. Of course not," Sporkin shot back. "You know better than that!" 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, prosecutor John W. Keker also brought out that the 
presidential finding dealt only with secret efforts aimed at freeing hostages 
and did not include any matters relating to Contra aid. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Ellen Garwood, a wealthy Texas widow, testified that she 
claimed an income tax deduction of more than $2 million for money she gave to a 
North associate, Carl (Spitz) Channell, for food, clothing and military 
equipment for the Contras. But Garwood said she gave her donation in good faith 
through a nonprofit foundation operated by Channell, and that North never asked 
for the funds directly or advised her on tax matters. 
</P>
<P>
The last count in North's indictment accuses him of conspiring with Channell to 
defraud the United States of income tax revenue.

CHINA TO LEARN FROM WEST -- BUT WON'T END SOCIALISM

China intends to learn from Hong Kong and Western countries in building a 
stronger economy, but this does not mean that the country is abandoning 
socialism, Premier Li Peng said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of reform and opening to the outside world, we will draw on some 
of the worthwhile experiences and methods of Western countries," Li said during 
a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. "But whatever is done must 
be appropriate for the actual conditions of China." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking specifically of the role played by Hong Kong as a model for Chinese 
development, Li stressed that China does not plan to copy Hong Kong's entire 
economic and social system. 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will keep its current capitalist system and the Chinese mainland 
will cling to its socialist system," Li said. 
</P>
<P>
But Li said there is much China can learn from the British colony, which is due 
to revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Experiences 
</P>
<P>
"If some regions and cities . . . want to experiment with or draw on some of 
the experiences of Hong Kong in order to reach the same level of prosperity as 
in Hong Kong, I think this is understandable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Li, speaking in a similar fashion about political reform, said that China will 
gradually institute greater democracy, but that democratization must not 
proceed too quickly or too far. 
</P>
<P>
"If the democratic process is not well attended to -- say if work in this 
regard is carried out in haste or to an excessive extent -- then it will 
certainly affect the situation of unity and stability," the premier said. "If 
the stable situation is undermined then it won't make our work of construction 
of reform smooth." 
</P>
<P>
China also will not copy the political reforms now under way in the Soviet 
Union, Li added. "China's conditions are different from those in the Soviet 
Union, and we cannot copy the Soviet Union's methods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech two weeks ago at the opening of the current 16-day annual session 
of the National People's Congress, Li spoke at length about errors made last 
year in economic policies. He was especially critical of a failure to take 
action quickly enough to fight inflation, which according to official 
statistics ran at 26% in 1988. Inflation, which has run at an even higher rate 
for food and other daily necessities, has aroused widespread dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's press conference, Li stressed that the mistakes made last year came 
"in the course of progress and development." 
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed out that major policy decisions in China are made by the 
Communist Party Politburo and its Standing Committee. The State Council, 
China's Cabinet -- which he heads as premier -- is responsible for implementing 
these decisions. He said that he shares responsibility for errors last year but 
that the responsibility is not his alone. 
</P>
<P>
China's three vice premiers -- Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian -- also 
appeared at the press conference and spoke in response to a few questions that 
Li turned over to them. 
</P>
<P>
Yao, answering a question about a controversial proposal to build a huge dam 
that would flood the scenic Three Gorges section of the Yangtze River, said 
that both supporters and opponents of the project have "strong arguments." More 
study is needed, he said, but in any case, China's economic situation will not 
allow the project to be started anytime during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think now we can stop arguing about this project for a while," he concluded.

DELAY IN RESTARTING OF A-PLANT ORDERED

<P>
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday ordered the operators of 
the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear power plant to delay restarting the nuclear 
reactor pending a federal investigation into concerns that the plant could be 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
New questions about the plant's safety are raised in a letter from the 
Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an Atlanta-based group made up of 
nuclear plant owners, NRC spokesman Greg Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was scheduled to be delivered Wednesday to the Sacramento Municipal 
Utility District, which operates the 913-megawatt plant. Although senior NRC 
officials were aware of the letter, Cook said, he had not been briefed on its 
contents and the nature of the institute's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"(The institute) has raised an issue with us about Rancho Seco. Our people felt 
that the issue was potentially safety significant and should be evaluated 
before Rancho was restarted," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant automatically shut down last Tuesday -- the third closure since 
December -- because of a malfunctioning water pump. Sacramento district 
officials have not determined what caused the mishap and have not set a date to 
restart the plant's nuclear generator. 
</P>
<P>
When notified by the NRC of new questions about the plant's safety, utility 
district officials immediately agreed to delay restarting the plant until 
federal regulators and company officials could investigate the concerns stated 
in the institute's letter, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Shearer, a spokesman for Rancho Seco, characterized the NRC request as 
"informal." He said the Sacramento utility district would comply with NRC 
wishes and keep the plant closed "until issues raised in a forthcoming letter" 
from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations can be resolved by the utility 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Shearer said an institute team last visited the plant in February, but did not 
notify utility district officials about any safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly more anxious than anyone to see what the letter says," 
Shearer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento area voters gave the 15-year-old plant a reprieve last year, 
allowing it to continue operating on a trial basis, but are scheduled to vote 
June 6 on closing it permanently. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial plant, located 25 miles southeast of Sacramento, reopened a 
year ago after a 27-month shutdown prompted by an overcooling accident. It has 
been closed more frequently than it has operated during its troubled history. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations conducts inspections of nuclear power 
plants and presents reports to owners of the utilities. These reports are 
normally not made public, but are considered proprietary information. However, 
the institute is required to notify the NRC about safety concerns.

SDG&amp;E TO TRY TO PREVENT RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will try to keep O. Morris Sievert, a San Diego 
businessman who in December resigned from SDG&amp;E's board of directors, from 
discussing the utility's proposed merger with Southern California Edison during 
a Wednesday deposition requested by the city of San Diego, according to 
documents filed with state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
According to those documents, SDG&amp;E wants to prevent Sievert, who resigned 
to protest the proposed utility merger, from making public a long list of 
documents that SDG&amp;E's board generated while considering the proposed 
merger with Edison. The utility's New York-based law firm last month asked the 
state Public Utilities Commission to prohibit Sievert from making the documents 
public during Wednesday's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert last week told the PUC that he has "no personal objection" to making 
public dozens of documents that he collected during the past year because full 
disclosure of the documents would lead to "a full public hearing on the 
proposed merger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sievert Argument 
</P>
<P>
Public concern in San Diego County over the proposed merger "appears to 
outweigh any interest in maintaining the 'confidential' or 'privileged' status 
of the documents in question," according to Sievert's filing. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spokesman Tom Murnane declined Monday to comment on SDG&amp;E's 
request for a protective order, saying, "We will not comment on that until the 
day of the deposition. During the deposition, we will discuss our objections in 
detail." 
</P>
<P>
"SDG&amp;E is doing a fine job of trying to keep the city and the public from 
learning anything about this merger," San Diego City Atty. John Witt said 
Monday. "We're taking the position that this stuff should be handled publicly . 
. . and we're going to get this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The documents filed last week by Sievert's attorney include an extensive list 
of records generated by meetings that SDG&amp;E's board held to consider 
Edison's proposed stock-swap merger. The list also includes records that detail 
the SDG&amp;E board meetings held to discuss an ill-fated attempt to complete a 
merger with Tucson Electric Power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Documents 
</P>
<P>
Sievert also hopes to introduce personal documents that SDG&amp;E Chairman 
Thomas Page and other SDG&amp;E executives and directors have maintained since 
Edison proposed the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of documents that Sievert plans to introduce "is very 
telling," according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers 
Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "It showed that there are 
huge numbers of documents that have not been seen by the interested parties. It 
also proves that (the board's) discussion about this merger was contentious and 
long-ranging." 
</P>
<P>
The city has subpoenaed Sievert to learn if Edison and SCEcorp, Edison's parent 
company, coerced or threatened SDG&amp;E's board members in order to gain 
support for the proposed merger. SDG&amp;E's board voted to accept the merger 
offer in November, 1988. Shareholders of the two utilities will vote on the 
merger later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Similar issues are expected to surface Monday, when the city attempts to gather 
testimony from businessman Charles (Red) Scott, who also resigned from the 
SDG&amp;E board in protest of the merger.

CANCER TREATMENT, BURIAL COST $43,000; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY ACCUSES NEVADA OF 'DUMPING' DYING PRISONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angry San Diego County leaders charged Monday that Nevada officials released a 
terminally ill inmate from prison early and gave him a one-way airline ticket 
to San Diego, where he received about $43,000 in public aid before dying in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter of protest to be sent to Nevada Gov. Bob Miller, Board of 
Supervisors Chairwoman Susan Golding accused Nevada of sending 64-year-old 
David Jackson "to San Diego to die," thereby unfairly burdening San Diego 
taxpayers for the health treatments, social services and burial costs of the 
longtime Nevada prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers of San Diego and California have been burdened with a very large 
bill," Golding said. "It is unconscionable to expect us to absorb the (costs) 
associated with the dying prisoner of another state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nevada Denies Dumping 
</P>
<P>
Nevada prison officials, however, denied "dumping" Jackson, who spent most of 
his adult life in prison, on San Diego after his release last September. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada would never dump someone on another state simply to avoid a medical 
expense," said John Slansky, the chief of Nevada's Department of Parole and 
Probation. "As heartless as we're accused of being, we don't do things like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual case came to light when investigators in the county's Public 
Administrator Department unsuccessfully attempted to locate relatives of 
Jackson to recoup the county's expense in cremating him after his death from 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
During that investigation, county officials learned that Jackson had been given 
a one-way airline ticket to San Diego by the Nevada Prisons Department last 
September after serving only one year of a four-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
That fact -- and other disputed ones -- led county officials to infer that 
Jackson's release had less to do with humanitarian considerations than with 
Nevada's desire to send a dying, longtime prisoner to another state. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for human care services in each of our jurisdictions, I am certain, 
outstrips the available resources," Golding wrote in the letter to Miller. "We 
need to have mutual respect for these limitations. . . I would appreciate your 
examining this incident to hopefully validate that it was simply an isolated 
episode." 
</P>
<P>
During his four months in San Diego, Jackson received about $43,000 in various 
forms of public assistance, with most of that being incurred during a 10-day 
stay in the UC San Diego Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, and 16 
subsequent days of chemotherapy treatments. Other public aid paid for his stay 
as an indigent resident of a Lemon Grove intermediate care facility, general 
welfare payments and social services assistance from the Logan Heights Family 
Health Center, according to Judith Gretton, the county's acting assistant 
public administrator. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Nevada officials differ, however, on several key points 
concerning Jackson's release and how he ended up in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Role in Release 
</P>
<P>
According to county officials, the Nevada governor's office played a central 
role in Jackson's early release. In Golding's letter, she states that county 
investigators determined that "the Nevada governor's office relieved the 
uncompleted sentence" of Jackson because of his terminal illness. (Jackson's 
release occurred during the tenure of Miller's predecessor as governor, Richard 
Bryan.) 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks of Jackson's cancer being diagnosed at a Reno hospital in late 
August, 1988, the governor's office approved his release from the Northern 
Nevada Correctional Facility in Carson City, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada parole administrator Slansky, however, contended that the governor's 
office was not directly involved in Jackson's release and did nothing to 
expedite it. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Jackson's release, Slansky explained, he had "expired" his 
sentence, even though he had served only about 51 weeks of a four-year term for 
attempted grand larceny. However, Jackson had spent nearly six months in a 
county jail before beginning his prison sentence. That time, combined with time 
off for good behavior and work credits, explains the "early" release of 
Jackson, Slansky said. 
</P>
<P>
As it does for all inmates who have completed their sentence, the Nevada 
Department of Prisons bought Jackson an airline ticket to San Diego, the 
destination that he requested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Free Agent' 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he flew to San Diego," Slansky said. "But, was that an effort on the part 
of this department or the state of Nevada to get him out of the state to 
relieve ourselves of a medical obligation? Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Bryn Armstrong, chairman of the Nevada Pardons Board, added: "Once a guy's 
released, he's a free agent. He can go anywhere he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's record at the time of his release included 54 arrests, 7 felony 
convictions, 5 prison sentences and 18 jail sentences. One of those sentences 
was for a first-degree robbery conviction in San Diego in 1961, Slansky said. 
</P>
<P>
"So he had a San Diego connection of some kind," Slansky added. "It may not 
have been a big connection, but he obviously had been there before." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter informed Golding's staff of the factual discrepancies, her 
aides said the letter to Miller, originally set to be mailed Monday, probably 
would be delayed so that the details in dispute can be rechecked. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else, the details are certainly very curious," said Bob Lerner, a 
spokesman for Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey. "It seems more than 
coincidental that he ended up here just after Nevada found out he had cancer."

WHO'S ON THIRD? WHO CARES!;

SUSHI IS THE ONLY THING HARD TO SWALLOW ON OPENING NIGHT

Howard Esterson, a local insurance agent, says the Padres' only weakness in 
1989 is third base. Otherwise, they're a lock for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all we're looking for," said Esterson, who lives in San Carlos. 
"Otherwise, we've got it." 
</P>
<P>
So, who's on third? 
</P>
<P>
That was THE question being debated Monday evening, as the Padres ushered in 
the new season at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Over hot dogs and barbecued 
chicken -- "Please, no sushi!" cried one fan -- the paying customers threw 
their pregame bashes and demanded to know . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who's on third? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Your Pick 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about Wade Boggs, the superstar third baseman for the Boston Red Sox, 
who are busy trying to trade him? 
</P>
<P>
"Noooooooo!" a chorus of fans, including Esterson, screamed out in unison, at 
the mere mention of the gifted hitter's name. Boggs has been sullied in an ugly 
sex scandal, and these fans clearly didn't want him. 
</P>
<P>
"We need Wade Boggs like we need a hole in the head," Esterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs' public involvement in an extramarital affair was being talked about by 
many in the tailgating crowd, as were Steve Garvey's possible extramarital 
fatherhood problems and Pete Rose's gambling problems. No matter how unsavory 
the controversies, though, no one seemed to think that the grand old game had 
been the least bit tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, no one wanted the likes of Boggs or Rose near the Padres, 
even if a hot-hitting Boggs could fill that hole at third and virtually ensure 
a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from all the chatter about infidelity and gambling -- hardly the usual 
fare at tailgate parties -- the mood in the parking lot was decidedly upbeat 
and just a little bit smug about the home team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Like Barbecue 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good shot, a better shot than most," said Edward Catano, who was 
barbecuing 75 pounds of sirloin steak and 130 half-breasts of chicken for a 
private party. "We look terrific on paper. We've just got to remember the 
fundamentals. Baseball is like barbecue -- just remember the fundamentals, and 
you'll bring home a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Catano said his favorite day of the year is opening day of the baseball season, 
which brings to mind rebirth -- a feeling that the best of life is just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the start of summer," he said. "Opening day is symbolic more than 
anything else. Everybody's in first place on opening day. It's the start of 
baseball -- and barbecue -- season." 
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. Monday, the parking lot was its own kind of weird mardi gras. Men 
wore cowboy hats, a group of women wore fringe dresses (a la the Roaring '20s), 
and a herd of children was being entertained by a robot. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, a robot -- wearing a Padres' jersey, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Carol and Harry Muzynski, who live in Del Cerro, spent $25,000 for their 
6-foot-high robot, whose name is Cornelius Rolboltz Robot. He's nicknamed 
Corny. 
</P>
<P>
Corny doesn't do floors and windows, unfortunately, but he does entertain kids. 
About a half dozen were camped around him, hanging on his every beep. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't know if the Padres will win or not," Carol said. "He just came from 
the planet Krupnik. He didn't know anything about baseball, so he came down 
here to find out what it was all about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strutting Their Stuff 
</P>
<P>
In another corner of the parking lot, Stella Reed and the San Diego Parasol 
Strutters were waving parasols and strutting. She described her group as women 
in their 50s, 60s and 70s who dance, armed with parasols, to the sounds of 
Dixieland jazz. They performed during the game with the High Society Band, 
which specializes in the music they love. 
</P>
<P>
"Dixieland music is full of happiness, jubilation and love," Reed said. "And 
that's what opening day is all about." 
</P>
<P>
The mood was happy, but a few folks were unhappy about two recent developments 
at the stadium -- the sale of sushi and the periodic scoreboard message that, 
if you smoke, please be courteous to your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"This sushi stuff is ridiculous," said San Diego Police Officer Rick Schnell. 
"They ought to be selling hot dogs and hamburgers. They've never done those 
that good to begin with. Sushi makes us the wimp capital of baseball -- at 
least until October, when we'll beat everybody. But in October, when the World 
Series comes here, selling sushi will be embarrassing. We'll have to be extra 
good just to cover up the scorn." 
</P>
<P>
George Lefferts, the uncle of San Francisco Giants relief pitcher and former 
Padre Craig Lefferts, was lighting up a big fat stogie at a tailgate party. 
He's aware of the new smoking policy and says he will try not to smoke in the 
stands, but he will never put out his cigar -- they cost $3.50 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'll be the first stadium to ban smoking," Lefferts said. "We're 
kooks in San Diego. We like to do things different." 
</P>
<P>
But unconventionality stops at third. Nobody in the parking lot wanted the 
inimitable Mr. Boggs at third, even if he could hit .380 for the Pads. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't want that Boggs fella," said Phyllis Komaroff, who helps sponsor 
40 Little League teams as a member of the San Diego Madres' women's 
organization. "We don't need that kind of thing in San Diego."

DEATH OF 5-YEAR-OLD UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton police and Orange County social services officials are investigating 
the death of a 5-year-old girl whose immigrant parents knew she was seriously 
ill with chicken pox but did not seek medical care because they had no money, 
didn't speak English and didn't know where to go. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy has ruled out any obvious trauma to the body of Sandra Navarrete, 
but toxicological tests to pinpoint the exact cause of death may take 6 to 12 
weeks, Fullerton Police Sgt. Don Kimbro said. 
</P>
<P>
If the tests show that Sandra died of complications from chicken pox, "now 
we're in that gray area where someone has to determine whether a child can die 
of chicken pox in this day and age," Kimbro said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mom and Dad did do what a reasonable person should do, it's a tragic 
circumstance. The other side is if . . . the people just allowed this to 
happen, you're looking at negligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Florencia Navarrete, 33, a recent immigrant from Michoacan, Mexico, said Monday 
that she and her husband, Emilio, also 33, did not seek any medical help after 
their daughter became ill March 22 and steadily grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sandra's death March 28, Florencia Navarrete has received telephone 
numbers and addresses of clinics in her neighborhood that offer free medical 
help. "Now we have them, " Navarrete said, "but when she was sick, we didn't 
have any. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know. I speak only Spanish and we didn't know how to get one. I 
didn't know how to speak English." 
</P>
<P>
Navarrete said she did not know about the 911 emergency telephone line. She 
also said she didn't know she could go to any hospital and receive emergency 
medical care. And she said she didn't look for a hospital or clinic because "we 
didn't have enough money to get to a clinic. We knew there were many in 
Fullerton (but) we didn't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Navarrete has supported his wife and four children with earnings of $740 
a month from his job as a dishwasher at a Fullerton restaurant, Navarrete said. 
The family shares a two-bedroom, $625-a-month apartment with another woman and 
her 9-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
Sobbing as she recounted the events of last week, Florencia Navarrete said she 
knew that her daughter was very sick and that her temperature was high but that 
she did not have a thermometer in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Day-to-Day Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"She was very, very hot, but sometimes it (the fever) would go down. It (the 
sickness) was a day-to-day thing. That's how it was for us, day by day." 
</P>
<P>
During her illness, Sandra cried often, Navarrete said. "She kept saying, 
'Mommy, Mommy,' every time she would see me." She was crying "Mommy" when she 
died in Navarrete's brother's car on the way to a hospital in Long Beach, 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
By now, all the Navarrete children have contracted chicken pox. Eight-year-old 
Areli got a mild case of the disease in February, and Emilio, 7, and Carolina, 
10 months, came down with the disease on the day Sandra died. All are well now, 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts described chicken pox as a highly communicable but generally 
mild childhood disease that rarely results in death. But county public health 
director L. Rex Ehling, a pediatrician, said that an occasional complication of 
chicken pox is encephalitis and that "it can cause death, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Ehling said that he did not know what caused Sandra's death but added that he 
has been advised that the Navarrete family had visited one of Orange County's 
immunization clinics and that Florencia Navarrete had once visited a county 
family planning clinic. Dr. Gary Wagner, pediatrician in charge of the county's 
immunization clinics, declined to provide a date or purpose for the family's 
visit, citing confidentiality rules. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Fullerton police probe, Sgt. Kimbro said, the Orange County 
Social Services Agency is investigating the child's death for negligence. 
Social Services officials declined to confirm whether such an investigation is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very, Very Nice Family' 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who knew the Navarretes described them as caring parents who 
simply did not understand how to get medical care for their child. 
</P>
<P>
Said a spokesman from the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana who helped the family 
after Sandra's death: "I don't think there's any negligence or child abuse. 
It's a matter of a different culture. It is a matter of a person who doesn't 
speak the language, from a little town." 
</P>
<P>
At Richman Elementary School, where Sandra attended kindergarten, Principal 
Maynard Duncan described the Navarretes as "a very, very nice family -- 
concerned about the children." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that when a child was ill, Florencia Navarrete would come by the 
school to pick up homework. 
</P>
<P>
She was "a very responsible mother" who also visited the school the day before 
her daughter died to inform a clerk that Sandra had chicken pox, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just a normal thing . . . so we were not alarmed. We sent home 
chicken pox notices. 'Your child has been exposed to chicken pox.' We had no 
indication that the child was that ill," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not think that the parents were negligent but rather 
uninformed about where to turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy that for the Navarretes and other families uncertain where to turn, 
Duncan said the school would soon send out a list "of names and places where 
families can take children in cases of emergency," as well as basic first- aid 
measures parents can take to lower a child's fever. 
</P>
<P>
The school of 720 students located in southwest Fullerton is 55% Latino, 18.5% 
Anglo and 13% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
And like the Navarretes, "quite a few" of the students speak limited English 
and are new to the United States, Duncan said.

LA HABRA; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 3 1/2-HOUR CHASE, SUSPECT HELD IN ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of sexually assaulting a Brea woman and stealing her car was 
arrested Monday after leading police on a 3 1/2-hour foot chase through La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Johnnie Ray Fraijo, 24, of La Habra early Saturday morning sexually 
assaulted a 21-year-old woman whom he knew, then stole her car. 
</P>
<P>
The woman immediately reported the incident, but police did not find Fraijo 
until Sunday evening, when Brea Detective Jon Strash spotted him at a phone 
booth at Whittier and Harbor boulevards in La Habra about 5:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He was apparently calling the woman he is suspected of assaulting, Strash said. 
</P>
<P>
Fraijo fled and led up to 20 officers, police dogs and an Anaheim Police 
Department helicopter on a chase through La Habra residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Strash said Fraijo hid in front and back yards of homes: "We'd chase him for a 
while, and he'd disappear. It just kept going. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going through somebody's yard, and he was confronted by a couple of 
citizens. He stopped for a second, and an officer caught him." 
</P>
<P>
Fraijo is being held on $250,000 bail at Orange County Jail on suspicion of 
sexual assault, auto theft and resisting arrest.

HEARING ON ASSAULT GUN BAN DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge delayed a hearing on a lawsuit challenging Los Angeles' ban on 
military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Two Los Angeles gun owners and the operator of a Culver City gun store filed 
the lawsuit in March and sought an injunction Monday that would have prevented 
enforcement of the ordinance approved by the City Council on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter said he could not rule on the matter, 
however, because the same issue is pending before a state Court of Appeal in 
San Francisco. He told the parties to return for a hearing June 26. 
</P>
<P>
The gun owners' suit alleges that the city ordinance violates their 
constitutional right to bear arms and runs counter to federal laws allowing 
interstate transportation of firearms.

$1,700 TAKEN AT BANK AFTER ROBBER PULLS GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wells Fargo Bank branch in Buena Park was robbed Monday when a man who had 
waited in a bank line pulled a handgun out of a leather attache case and gave a 
note to the teller that said: "I'm holding you up. Don't push any buttons, and 
give me all the big bills too." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Sgt. Terry Branum said the teller obliged, and the man ran 
away with $1,700 in cash from the bank in the 8700 block of Knott Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as a Latino man about 35 years old, 5 feet, 2 inches 
and 150 pounds. Branum said he had long, dark hair and was wearing a 
short-sleeve dress shirt with dark tie, dark dress pants and sunglasses.

TUSTIN DENIES 2 ANTI-ABORTION BIDS; 
</P>
<P>
'COP-OUT,' SAYS KELLY AS COUNCIL TURNS HIM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin City Council refused Monday night to consider a highly controversial 
resolution that would have put the city on record as opposing a local 
family-planning clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 3 to 2, the council tabled the resolution by Councilman John Kelly, who 
called the Doctors Family Planning Clinic and its doctors "champions of 
infanticide." The action prompted loud and prolonged applause by pro-choice 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action came after 2 hours of emotional public debate before about 
175 people on a similar measure aimed at endorsing repeal of Roe vs. Wade, the 
U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortions. That 
resolution also was defeated 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says City Could Be Sued 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ursula Kennedy, in moving to table Kelly's proposal, told her colleagues 
that Tustin City Atty. James G. Rourke had advised her that adoption of Kelly's 
resolution could result in the city being sued by the clinic. She did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, angered when the vote did not go his way, shouted: "This is an unlawful 
cop-out." 
</P>
<P>
During testimony on the two motions before the council, anti-abortion activists 
quoted the Bible and showed graphic photographs of aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I teach children in my Sunday school that God loves them when people 
in their community are killing them?" asked Sheila Smith, a Tustin mother. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-choice contingent, which greatly outnumbered anti-abortionists in the 
packed council chambers, defended the clinic and questioned why the City 
Council was debating a national issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am one who chose abortion," said Jeanette Reese of Tustin. "It was not an 
easy choice, but it was clearly the best choice at the time and was one that I 
was glad I could exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the pro-choice group chose not to speak before the council. Instead, 
they applauded loudly whenever one of their number spoke. 
</P>
<P>
All told, more than 25 speakers made their views on abortion known to council. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's proposal called for the council to formally declare that the city of 
Tustin disapproves "as morally reprehensible and as ethically unconscionable" 
the presence of the family planning clinic, where abortions are performed. It 
further requested that the owners of the building immediately break their lease 
with the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's effort came as debate over abortion rages both locally and on the 
national level. Thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators with Operation Rescue, 
a New York-based anti-abortion group, and large numbers of pro-choice 
demonstrators went head-to-head at family planning clinics across the Southland 
last month to publicize their respective views. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice activists also plan a major demonstration Sunday in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the appeal of a Missouri case, is 
preparing to reconsider the extent to which states may restrict a woman's right 
to an abortion. Political observers believe that the conservative majority on 
the court may now attempt to scale back or even overturn Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly rejected critics' charges that he is grandstanding on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous. The (people) that I'm standing up for aren't even born yet, 
and they won't be able to vote for me for at least 18 years," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The other anti-abortion measure, sponsored by City Councilman Earl Prescott, 
called for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no more divisive an issue in this country since the Civil War," 
Prescott argued. "We have mothers turning against daughters and fathers against 
sons. We must let the debate begin. And as President Bush said, the debate 
should not center on just regional, state or federal levels, but the local 
town-hall level as well." 
</P>
<P>
The Kelly measure asked the 11 partners who are landlords of the building known 
as the Santa Ana-Tustin Medical Pavilion to immediately rescind the clinic's 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kennedy and Councilmen Richard B. Edgar and Ronald Hoesterey voted 
against both resolutions, with Kelly and Prescott voting in favor. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach the owners of the building were unsuccessful Monday. City 
documents identify the partners as Karl Nishimura of Tustin and Robert Amato of 
Villa Park, along with W.L. Barville Jr., William T. Parks, Lawrence Lee, 
Donald R. Dicus, John H. Holiday, Edgar B. Steward, Carl Selin, Tad Lonergran 
and Lawrence A. Strait, all of Santa Ana.

FUEL PROBLEMS RULED OUT IN NEWPORT PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. air safety investigators Monday ruled out contaminated or mislabeled fuel 
as the cause of Friday's fatal crash of a twin-engine Piper Aerostar at the 
Newport Beach Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanics at John Wayne Airport had speculated that the wrong fuel had been 
used in the plane or that the fuel was contaminated, causing the crash that 
killed Canadian pilot-owner Anthony Deis, his wife, Marilyn, and the couple's 
three daughters. No one on the ground was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But federal investigators said they have found no evidence of a problem with 
the type or quality of the fuel pumped into planes at the airport last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Canada, preparations were being made for a memorial service. 
Schoolmates of the two older daughters -- Amanda, 10, and Jaclyn, 7 -- will say 
prayers and recite poems at the service today in the small town of Camrose, 
near Edmonton, Alberta, where the Deis family lived. Also killed was 5-year-old 
Kimberly Deis. 
</P>
<P>
One poem was chosen from each of the nine grades at the school, according to 
the Edmonton Journal. "God picked five roses," one of them says of the Deis 
family. "The roses he picked were the most beautiful in the garden." 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, mechanics said the "popping" sound of the engines 
immediately after Deis' take off and his plane's inability to gain altitude 
suggested a problem with the fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We checked out the fuel at the airport and it was OK," said Gary Mucho, a 
National Transportation Safety Board supervisor in Los Angeles. "It wasn't 
contaminated, and it wasn't mislabeled." 
</P>
<P>
Mucho was referring to tests of fuel supplies at the airport. It was not 
immediately known Monday if traces of unburned fuel have been found and tested 
from engine parts recovered from the wreckage of the PA-60, which exploded on 
impact, leaving only part of a propeller readily recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
Pumping the wrong fuel accidentally is rare, officials said, because of 
federally mandated safeguards, including additives that color different types 
of fuel. The PA-60 requires 100-octane general aviation gasoline, but other 
fuels with lower octane ratings are also available at John Wayne Airport, 
officials said. Although fuel used in jets is colorless, they said it has a 
distinctively smelly, greasy, kerosene odor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus Still on Repairs 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were still focusing on repairs that were made on the plane 
at John Wayne Airport when the Deis family arrived in Orange County on vacation 
last week. Anthony Deis had reported an oil leak that reportedly was repaired, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Mucho said examination of the wreckage at a warehouse in Carson probably would 
conclude today. However, officials cautioned that it could be several months 
before they make an official determination about what caused the crash.

SUCCESSFUL HEART TRANSPLANT ENDS PATIENT'S LONG WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An excruciating wait and more than 50 days on a mechanical life-support system 
ended for a young Costa Mesa man Sunday when doctors replaced his virus-damaged 
heart in a successful transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Smallcomb, 22, was recuperating Monday after surgery in which Sharp 
Memorial Hospital doctors attached a donor heart taken from a Central 
California man in his early 20s, according to Judy Coburn, transplant 
coordinator at Sharp. Smallcomb's liver and kidneys were functioning normally 
with the transplant, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The new heart was in place and working by 3 a.m. Sunday, Coburn said. It had 
earlier been flown to San Diego, packed in a sterile plastic bag and kept at 5 
degrees Celsius in a saline solution in a cooler. It arrived at Lindbergh Field 
just after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A transplant team of doctors, nurses and assistants from Sharp flew to Central 
California Saturday night to retrieve the heart with blood type O, Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Smallcomb was alert Monday after the surgery that ended at 8:30 a.m. Sunday. He 
had been up from his bed twice, said his father, Thomas Smallcomb, adding that 
the transplant "was right, and we knew that it would eventually happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although his son was in some pain from the surgery, "he is doing 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing he did is, we have this little sign language and squeezing 
each other's hand means I love you. He squeezed my hand the hardest . . . he 
has since he's been here." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's surgery marked the painful end of Smallcomb's dependance on an acute 
ventricular assist device that had been pumping oxygen-rich blood in place of 
his heart's left side, which had been devastated by an unknown virus. The same 
virus has claimed the lives of his mother, a sister and seven other blood 
relatives.

EX-HEAD OF MEALS PROGRAM SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former director of the La Mesa Nutrition Center was sentenced Monday to 13 
months in federal prison for defrauding the center out of more than $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sons of Jerrilyn Poitra, 46, of Chula Vista, ran from the courtroom 
in tears after hearing U. S. District Court Judge Leland Nielsen impose the 
sentence on his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen ordered her to repay the center, which runs a federally funded meals 
program for senior citizens, the total alleged loss: $42,193.12. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen set payments at $200 a month, to begin after Poitra finishes her 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Poitra was director of the center for at least three years. In the 89-count 
indictment handed down Nov. 29, she was charged with making 87 Nutrition Center 
checks payable to herself. 
</P>
<P>
She pleaded guilty Jan. 10 to theft of public funds and to tax evasion on her 
1987 return, in which she failed to report the extra money as income. The other 
charges were then dismissed.

PROTECTED NEIGHBOR'S TRUCK; 
</P>
<P>
MAN KILLED DURING CHASE OF YOUTHS CAUGHT IN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A North Hollywood man died Monday after he was shot while chasing a group of 
auto thieves he had surprised as they attempted to steal a neighbor's pickup 
truck, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Darris Garvin, 37, died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank at 12:40 a.m., 
about 2 1/2 hours after he was shot at the intersection of Troost Avenue and 
Burbank Boulevard, police said. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of playing softball and eating dinner with friends, Garvin, a film 
editor and part-time bartender, returned at 10:10 p.m. Sunday to the California 
Club apartment complex in the 5600 block of Colfax Avenue where he lived, 
Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised Thieves 
</P>
<P>
As Garvin drove through the electronic security gate into the large complex's 
underground parking garage, he apparently surprised three or four thieves who 
were in the garage attempting to steal a pickup truck that belonged to another 
tenant, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves, described as ranging in age from 17 to 22, fled from the garage as 
Garvin parked his car. Garvin then went after them. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran after them and chased them for a block," Coffey said. "He may have 
thought they were just juveniles, and it may have gone through his mind that he 
could scare them. The last thing you ever think of is being confronted by a 
lethal weapon." 
</P>
<P>
At Burbank and Troost, one of the suspects turned and fired a gun at Garvin. 
Shot in the stomach, Garvin stumbled into a convenience store at the corner, 
and police and paramedics were called. Police said the suspects may have fled 
from the area in a light-colored delivery van with graffiti marking the side of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wanted to Do Right' 
</P>
<P>
Garvin's roommate, Tim Biddle, said Garvin had lived in the complex for more 
than two years, knew most of the tenants and probably knew the suspects did not 
belong there. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to do right, that is all," Biddle said. "That was Darris. I didn't 
think it was like him to go jumping into a situation. But he worked hard for 
everything he had. He probably saw those guys and thought, 'Why should they 
take what somebody else has worked hard for?' He went after them." 
</P>
<P>
Biddle said Garvin, originally from Hedgesville, W. Va., came to Los Angeles 2 
1/2 years ago to work in the film business after working as a film and TV 
editor in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they do not know how the thieves got into the garage. Coffey said 
it was not unusual for car thieves to be armed, though shootings involving car 
thefts are infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows who's carrying a gun these days," he said.

TRIAL TO BEGIN FOR OBSTETRICIAN IN DEATHS OF 8 INFANTS, 1 FETUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 2 1/2 years after his arrest, a Valencia obstetrician is scheduled to go 
on trial today on second-degree murder charges, accusing him of responsibility 
for the deaths of eight infants and a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Milos Klvana, 47, is being prosecuted on charges that he proceeded with 
high-risk deliveries -- and bungled them -- despite knowing that he did not 
have the skill or the equipment to perform them safely at his obstetrical 
clinics in Valencia and Temple City, according to the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Brian R. Kelberg. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana's sometime assistant, Delores Doyle, 36, of Montclair, is being tried 
with the doctor on two counts of second-degree murder and one count of 
involuntary manslaughter. Klvana and Doyle are also being tried on charges of 
insurance fraud and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana is representing himself with the aid of two court-appointed advisory 
lawyers, Rita-Jane Baird and Richard A. Leonard. His defense so far has been an 
attack on Kelberg, who the doctor said is obsessed with the case and is 
singling him out for prosecution because his practice of avoiding hospitals is 
unorthodox. Klvana is being held in County Jail in lieu of $750,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Secondary Role 
</P>
<P>
Doyle, who is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail, is being represented by 
Maxwell S. Keith. Keith has argued in pretrial motions that Doyle played only a 
secondary role in the deliveries and should not be charged with murder. He said 
Klvana, as the doctor, bears the final responsibility for the care of the 
mothers and the babies. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last more than a year. Included among about 400 
witnesses are medical experts, friends of Klvana and parents of the dead 
infants. The court record will include thousands of pages of exhibits, which 
Kelberg has said occupy 45 boxes in his office. The preliminary hearing for 
Klvana and Doyle lasted four months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With opening statements to begin today, the district attorney's staff set up a 
video camera and six television sets Monday in the courtroom of Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin so court personnel and jurors can read 
the documents on the screens. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the case is the prosecution's argument that Klvana knew that deaths 
or stillbirths could result from his decisions not to recommend hospitalization 
for the mothers in the nine deaths between 1982 and 1986. The legal theory is 
one of "implied malice," which is used in murder prosecutions against drunk 
drivers who cause deaths despite previously having been convicted of drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
"The charge is not that he has an intent to kill any one of these babies or to 
harm intentionally the mother or baby, but that he acts with a subjective 
awareness of the complications associated with these high-risk cases," Kelberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-risk cases included an insulin-dependent diabetic mother. Infants in 
such cases sometimes are born prematurely with underdeveloped lungs, 
necessitating close monitoring in a hospital, Kelberg said. He said Klvana's 
decision not to have Debbie Friel deliver in a hospital resulted in the death 
of her son, Jason, a day after his birth in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Another high-risk situation alleged by Kelberg is known as "RH sensitization" 
in which a conflict of blood factors between mother and child causes the 
mother's immune system to treat the fetus as a foreign invader. Blood tests 
before delivery can detect this condition so it can be treated with a drug. But 
in the cases of two deliveries by Mira Ginsberg in 1982 and 1984, no such tests 
or treatments were done, resulting in a stillbirth and an infant's death one 
day after birth, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
A third condition expected to be cited at the trial is known as "meconium 
staining." Meconium, or fecal matter, can kill the fetus if ingested. Kelberg 
has said in court papers that during Kim Ennis' labor in 1984, Klvana and Doyle 
noticed stains of meconium, indicating trouble, but did nothing to extract the 
material from baby Tyrone Ennis' lungs and did not send him to a hospital. The 
boy died seven days later. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact is that all of the cases involve common textbook obstetrical 
complications . . . mandating transfer of each mother prior to delivery to a 
hospital setting," Kelberg said.

SAN FERNANDO MAYOR RESIGNS, CITING NEED TO CARE FOR WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Mayor Roy Richardson, the city's most popular politician for 11 
years, resigned Monday night, saying he needs to devote more time to his ailing 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Daniel Acuna was appointed by the San Fernando City Council as 
his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, 64, a retired merchant, has been the council's top vote-getter in 
the three elections held since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He was in his third term as mayor, a position that rotates among City Council 
members. Richardson is best known for his soft-spoken manner in leading council 
discussions on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with a heavy heart that effective April 30, I will resign my post," 
Richardson told the City Council at its regular meeting Monday night, his voice 
breaking with emotion. "I have called this city home for more than 60 years. I 
can't tell you how much it hurts to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said he and his wife, Frankie, who is recovering from a series of 
operations brought on by cancer treatments, have moved to a home they bought in 
Los Osos, south of Morro Bay. Richardson said they were planning to retire 
there after his four-year term ended in 1990, but he is acting now so he can 
look for work to pay his wife's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the City Council has until May 30 to fill his council seat by 
appointment or call for a special election, said City Administrator Donald E. 
Penman. In the past five years, the council has twice opted to fill vacant 
seats by appointment rather than conduct an election, which would cost the 
small town between $10,000 and $15,000.

PESTICIDE TRUCK DRIVER KILLED IN 2-CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a truck carrying pesticides was fatally injured when his vehicle 
overturned after hitting two cars on the southbound Hollywood Freeway near 
Oxnard Street in North Hollywood, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No chemicals were spilled in the 11 a.m. accident, according to California 
Highway Patrol Officer Dave Grajeda. The driver, who was not identified since 
relatives had not been notified, died of head, chest and abdominal injuries 
shortly after being taken to Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, hospital 
spokeswoman Lori Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide truck made an erratic lane change, clipped the right rear end of 
one car, struck the rear of another car and overturned, Grajeda said. The 
driver was thrown from the truck, he said. No other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities closed the southbound off-ramp to Oxnard Street for about 45 
minutes after the accident, causing heavy delays for southbound traffic, 
Grajeda said. Witnesses told the CHP that other vehicles -- in addition to the 
truck and the two autos -- were involved in the accident, but the drivers left 
the scene and made no reports, Grajeda said.

GIAMATTI INHERITS MANY PROBLEMS AS NEW COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HYMAN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has served as commander in chief of the National League. He has slapped the 
wrist of a man who bumped an umpire. And Saturday, he ascended to a baseball 
job whose fringe benefits include free box-seat tickets to any game at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when you ask A. Bartlett Giamatti to choose the most lasting memory of his 
association with baseball as a fan, author and administrator, he chooses none 
of these high-profile moments. Instead, he ponders a moment, thumbing the 
salt-and-pepper goatee that sets him apart from, say, Sparky Anderson, before 
reluctantly reaching back four decades. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard," Giamatti said. "But I guess it would be my first memory of 
Fenway Park, about 1945 or '46." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's recall of the game and the circumstances of his attendance were 
remarkable. He ticked off a number of unrelated details, including the facts 
that his father and uncle had escorted him to the park that afternoon, that he 
was 7 or 8 years old at the time, that the Red Sox' starting pitcher had been 
Boo Ferris and that he had been unable to close his mouth throughout the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember feeling as if I were gaping," said Giamatti, who grew up a Red Sox 
fan in South Hadley, Mass. "I just remember sitting there and feeling, 'I am 
overwhelmed by this. This is absolutely extraordinary.' And it was. It was very 
much out of the ordinary from what I was accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
The little boy with the slack jaw still attends games and still admits to 
rooting, though more discreetly, for the Red Sox. But, as of Saturday, when he 
officially became the seventh commissioner of major league baseball, Giamatti's 
ties to the sport are certain to become a good bit closer. And infinitely more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner, he inherits from Peter V. Ueberroth, his predecessor, a 
lengthy list of problems, uncertainties and annoyances. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the investigation of the alleged gambling habits of Cincinnati 
Reds manager Pete Rose, which began on Ueberroth's watch, figures to be 
completed soon. Depending on the findings, Giamatti could be called on to 
perform the unenviable task of hitting Rose with a one-year suspension (if he 
wagered on baseball games) or a lifetime ban (for placing bets on games 
involving the Reds). 
</P>
<P>
And there are other matters: 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball's record for hiring minority workers into front office 
positions, though improved over the last year, remains dubious. Giamatti will 
be held accountable for continued progress on that front. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on baseball to grant expansion franchises continues to mount. 
Giamatti is certain to be called upon either to minimize the political fallout 
from further delays or to oversee the addition of two teams. 
</P>
<P>
And looming above all else is the possibility of a players strike that could 
knock out a good portion of the 1990 season. With the current labor agreement 
between players and owners due to expire in December, that possibility is 
considered ominously real by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Into this mine field walks a man who is a scholar of Renaissance literature, 
who served eight years as president of Yale University and who was hired into 
his first baseball job just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those credentials, which would seem to qualify him to direct the 
Library of Congress, but not baseball, Giamatti, who turns 51 Tuesday, was the 
resounding choice to take over the reins. When Ueberroth announced he would 
step down last fall, the owners so delighted in the opportunity to fill the job 
with Giamatti, the National League president, that they did not seriously 
consider other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those baseball executives say that Giamatti fulfills the needs of 
baseball for a bright, able man who has cares about the sport and can help to 
repair strained relations between players and owners. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep having the off-season blood-letting that we've had every single 
year on contracts. The threats, charges, allegations. Who does that help?" said 
Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten, who is hopeful that Giamatti can work to 
lower the tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody can do it, Bart will," Kasten said. "He is a sincere person, he 
loves the game and he has an appreciation for its players - that's a starting 
point." 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who described himself as "a strong 
Giamatti supporter," also praised the commissioner-elect's talents for thinking 
through problems and arriving at reasonable solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart is a Renaissance man, a brilliant man," Steinbrenner said. "He has great, 
sound reasoning powers. And that is what we need now." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the support of Kasten, Steinbrenner and other baseball executives, 
however, it is unclear what role Giamatti can play in the upcoming labor talks. 
As Yale president, he publicly lamented the 1981 players strike, which 
stretched from June until August, and even authored a piece about it for The 
New York Times. However, when his university became embroiled in a strike of 
clerical workers in 1984, Giamatti was unable to resolve the dispute quickly or 
without ill feeling. Before an agreement could be reached, the Yale workers had 
stayed off their jobs 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Giamatti has said repeatedly that he will do his best to convince 
the baseball players and owners that they should commit themselves to reaching 
a settlement before the strike deadline. However, as commissioner, he is hired 
and paid by the owners. Despite the popular beliefs that he can command the 
parties to behave, the commissioner has virtually no authority to impose a 
labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Asked recently what he would do to prevent a players' strike, Giamatti shot 
back, "I'm not going to do anything if both sides are intent on having a 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
Then, speaking to a group of reporters, he added, "You guys love to promote the 
fiction that the commissioner can fix it all up, that the commissioner somehow 
has total suasion over everybody ..." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Giamatti said, he would welcome the opportunity to write an agreement 
fair to both the players and owners. "If both sides want to come to me and say, 
'Listen, we don't want a strike. We want to present it to you, and you, in your 
wisdom, adjudicate' -- wonderful," he said. "Then I'll perform that function 
beautifully and superbly, and everyone will be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Until that unlikely request is presented to him, however, Giamatti said he 
intends only to continue to talk about the senselessness of picket lines and a 
padlocked ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
"My stake is to maintain the integrity of the season," he said. "That's what 
the commissioner worries about because (he) ought to be worrying about a season 
that is meaningful and coherent, whose statistics make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Labor questions, though they seem to dominate all his public comments of late, 
were the furthest thing from Giamatti's mind when he left Yale to become the NL 
president in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That career move, like his appointment to the commissioner's post, was not 
planned, Giamatti said. Instead, he was happily ensconced on the Yale campus in 
New Haven, Conn., when he received a phone call from Los Angeles Dodgers 
president Peter O'Malley, wanting to discuss Giamatti's interest in the league 
president's job. 
</P>
<P>
In placing the call, O'Malley has said he simply was following up on a broad 
hint dropped by Giamatti several years earlier concerning his interest in a 
top-level baseball post. "I remember clearly, reading in the paper, the day he 
became president of Yale," O'Malley once recalled. "It's a famous quote picked 
up by all the wires and sports pages. He said the only thing he ever dreamed 
about being president of was the American League." 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues in academia were stunned by Giamatti's decision to abandon his 
university post for a baseball job - one Yale faculty member, in a note to the 
college president, asked, "Do you really think that you can be of service to a 
nation which desperately needs the best and most experienced minds by serving 
as president of the National League?" 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti ignored the advice, accepted the baseball job and had a busy and 
highly publicized three-year term. 
</P>
<P>
During his years as National League president, for instance, Giamatti gained a 
reputation for dealing severely with batters who were discovered using corked 
bats and pitchers found doctoring baseballs. When Philadelphia Phillies pitcher 
Kevin Gross was caught with sandpaper in his baseball glove, Giamatti suspended 
him for 10 days. The circumstances were repeated during the National League 
playoffs last season when an inspection of Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell's glove 
turned up a foreign substance. Again, Giamatti suspended the player. 
</P>
<P>
If there was any ambiguity concerning Giamatti's insistence that the rules of 
the game be observed, his handling of an incident concerning Rose last season, 
laid them to rest. In the most publicized and controversial act of his term as 
National League president, Giamatti handed down a 30- day suspension for the 
Reds manager after he twice bumped umpire Dave Pallone during a heated argument 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, Giamatti's judgment was questioned by the offending player and by 
others who wondered whether a former English professor is best qualified to 
preside over affairs of the National League. But Giamatti has remained 
unperturbed. Had Ueberroth not decided to eschew a second term, the National 
League president said, he would have remained at his job through the end of his 
five-year contract, then would have stood by to see "if (the owners) wanted me 
to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, being National League president is a wonderful job. You are in 
touch with the game on the field in a much more realistic and intimate way," 
said Giamatti, who counted daily supervision of umpires and frequent dealings 
with players and managers among the job's appealing duties. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner, however, Giamatti's job description has changed, and perhaps 
not all to his liking. He'll attend fewer games and, except in rare cases, no 
longer will be fashioning penalties to fit the crimes of baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
"So why would you give up one for the other?" Giamatti asked. "Well, that's not 
absolutely clear to me. I suppose because if you really care about baseball and 
somebody asked you to be commissioner, you don't ask them to rethink it, lest 
they will. Rather, you say, 'OK. Sure.' Because at least you have a capacity to 
try to shape things overall." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he formally has been installed as commissioner, Giamatti will continue 
to lobby aggressively for a variety of issues he holds dear. Perhaps most 
prominent among them are a package of controls, fine-tunes and changes that the 
commissioner refers to as "ambiance issues." 
</P>
<P>
Under this heading, Giamatti files all matters that directly affect the viewing 
of games at ballparks, either by distracting attention from the game itself or 
by creating potentially dangerous situations in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
During his term as National League president, for instance, Giamatti took steps 
to try to curb alcohol consumption and the disturbances that inevitably result 
when too many fans have too much to drink. At his direction, National League 
clubs have developed alcohol policies that include attempting to restrict 
excessive drinking in parking lots before games and a training program to 
assist ushers and security guards in spotting drunks before they become 
nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti emphasized that he does not advocate a ban on ballpark beer. "I've 
never been interested in having someone think the best way to do this is to 
declare prohibition," he said. "The point is to keep people from acting in an 
excessive or immoderate manner." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti also has adopted a "less is more" attitude concerning the operation of 
stadium scoreboards, public-address systems and other electronic accoutrements 
that has turned many a modern ballpark into an open-air video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, Giamatti issued to National League teams what he 
refers to as "very stringent" guidelines covering the use and misuse of 
electronic wizardry. Among other things, Giamatti's policies established bans 
on the playing of loud music when hitters step into the batter's box and on 
showing live TV pictures of the game on the stadium scoreboard -- a practice 
that strikes Giamatti both as redundant and just plain dumb. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is that you go to the game to watch the game," he said. "You don't go 
to the game to watch the scoreboard watch the game." 
</P>
<P>
On this score, Giamatti's influence has been felt even in the American League. 
And even in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"He has had some impact on us," said Baltimore Orioles president Larry 
Lucchino, referring to Giamatti's calls for electronic and alcoholic restraint. 
"We have tried to be more thoughtful about ambiance questions, in part, because 
of our own concerns but also because we have been listening to him address 
these sorts of issues." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Lucchino said the Orioles have been more mindful of "turning 
down the volume level" of other activities at the ballpark, and of pushing the 
feeling that "baseball is the main event." 
</P>
<P>
These are words that Giamatti himself could have spoken. In the next few years, 
expect that he will. Often.

ANGELS, RADER OPEN WHAT WILL HAVE TO BE A HIT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is neither overstatement nor cause for concern to report that the best pitch 
made by an Angel this spring belongs to the new manager, Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
These Angels need pitching, to be sure, but more than that, they need 
direction. They need a fresh start after last September's 2-18 fiasco, a heart 
transplant after that season-ending 12-game losing streak, a reason to believe 
and someone to believe in. 
</P>
<P>
Is Rader that someone? Angel management hopes so, which is why they appointed 
him to replace Cookie Rojas last fall. But Rader is as dogged by his past as 
the team he inherits, having flamed out in his first managerial assignment, a 2 
1/2-year reign of terror with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Hired last November, Rader has spent all spring trying to prove he's worthy of 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Rader's pitch has been: 
</P>
<P>
 I screwed up in Texas, but I've learned from my mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm keeping an open mind and I hope you will, too. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm really not that bad a guy and the Angels really aren't that bad a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Any takers? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for starters, the Angels appear willing. Alienated by Gene Mauch's 
detachment and amused by Rojas' on-the-job training, most of the young players 
that form this club's nucleus have yet to connect with a manager. 
</P>
<P>
Mauch could go weeks without talking to certain players. Rojas could 
inadvertently break up team meetings by railing at his troops, "You've hit 
bottom rock." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels say Rader talks to them. He makes them laugh, too, usually 
intentionally. Canvass the Angel clubhouse these days and you'll hear the same 
cliches: Rader communicates. Rader's door is always open. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps the game fun," third baseman Jack Howell says. "He can joke about a 
mistake if you play a ball wrong, but he can also take you aside and say, 'Hey, 
look.' So far, it's been very relaxing, very enjoyable to play for him." 
</P>
<P>
Adds pitcher Kirk McCaskill: "You can communicate with him, but at the same 
time, you get the feeling you shouldn't cross him. That's a good combination. 
That's what this team has needed." 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the same Doug Rader who was fired amid a player revolt in May of 
1985? Can this be the same Doug Rader who closed the door on Dave Stewart, Tom 
Henke and Jim Sundberg, who threw clothes and vitriol in an ever-escalating war 
with Texas reporters? 
</P>
<P>
With the Southern California media, Doug Rader has been, well, charming. He has 
been accommodating and amiable and witty, capable of quoting both ZZ Top and 
John Steinbeck -- "Ol' Steiny," Rader calls him -- willing to serve as 
peacemaker between writer and offended ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that was Rader's evil twin in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe this new and improved look is merely a desert mirage, destined to fade 
at the outset of the first Angel losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's reasonable for people to think that way," Rader says. "It's like 
everything else. You've got to demonstrate it, you can't just say it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the demonstration begins in earnest, with the Angels opening their 1989 
season against the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim Stadium. Angel pitching will 
test Rader's nerve, no doubt, but the manager claims to hold "a reasonable 
expectation of success." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "I think we're going to score some runs and I think we're going to 
take some chances and I think they're going to work out." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have already taken a chance with Rader. Will it work out? 
</P>
<P>
A few things to mull over while awaiting an answer: 
</P>
<P>
Why the Angel offense will be better in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, dh 
</P>
<P>
Ray, 2b 
</P>
<P>
White, cf 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, 1b 
</P>
<P>
Davis, lf 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, c 
</P>
<P>
Washington, rf 
</P>
<P>
Howell, 3b 
</P>
<P>
Schofield, ss 
</P>
<P>
This is how the basic Angel batting order should read, pending the imminent 
arrival of Dante Bichette as an everyday player. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, solid. Not a Gary Pettis in the bunch. Dick Schofield is the closest 
thing to a weak link in this lineup, but even he has a little pop in his bat -- 
he hit 13 home runs in 1986 -- and is coming off a .300 spring. 
</P>
<P>
The black hole is no longer required in the Angel lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Go down the list," an excited Wally Joyner says. "Who do you pitch around? You 
can't afford to pitch around anybody anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Brian Downing: "Last year, we had only a couple guys capable of hitting 
the ball out of the ballpark. Now, we've got six or seven legitimate spots in 
the lineup -- guys who can, and have, hit 20 home runs (in a season). 
</P>
<P>
"That's not bad. That's what it's going to take." 
</P>
<P>
Why Jim Abbott is in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Because 20 home runs from six or seven guys is what it's going to take to keep 
the Angels, and their millstone-like rotation, afloat in the American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
These aren't the '65 Dodgers we're talking about. These aren't even the '86 
Angels. Last season, no Angel starter won more than 13 games or had an 
earned-run average below 4.10. Combined, Angel starting pitchers in 1988 won 50 
games, lost 68 and fashioned a 4.56 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
To this crew was added 38-year old Bert Blyleven, who, in 1988, led the 
American League in defeats with 17, earned runs with 125, and the highest ERA 
among pitchers with 30 or more starts, 5.43. 
</P>
<P>
Add in some ERAs from this spring -- Kirk McCaskill, 8.19; Dan Petry, 8.04; 
Chuck Finley, 4.36; Blyleven, 4.05 -- and you should have your answer to the 
Jim Abbott question. 
</P>
<P>
But in case you're not convinced ... 
</P>
<P>
Three more reasons why Jim Abbott makes sense: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's a left-handed starter who throws hard. Once you get past Mark 
Langston, name another in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 21, he's older than Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., 19, and 
Milwaukee shortstop Gary Sheffield, 20, two touted rookies who are supposedly 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's pitched in the Pan American Games and the Olympics, played in foreign 
countries and already conducted more interviews than many big leaguers do in a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
He still needs two months in Midland? 
</P>
<P>
Why Johnny Ray beat out Mark McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
Ray batted .346 with the Angels in 1987, .306 last season and .340 this spring. 
In 1988, he drove in 83 runs, two fewer than Joyner; had 42 doubles, as many as 
Kirby Puckett, and batted .342 with runners on base, which was better than Dave 
Winfield, Don Mattingly and Mike Greenwell. He is the only active major leaguer 
with 30 or more doubles in each of his last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Angels would like to trade Ray and make room for McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
After moving in from left field, where he committed five errors in 40 games 
last season, Ray made 15 errors in 104 games at second base. He had a .972 
fielding percentage at second base -- the lowest among regular American League 
second basemen in 1988. He turned just 64 double plays -- nearly half as many 
as Seattle's Harold Reynolds. He stole four bases -- or two more than Bob 
Boone. 
</P>
<P>
Two reasons why this year's outfield should be better than last year's: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chili Davis in left can't be any worse than Johnny Ray in left. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Claudell Washington in right can't be any worse than Chili Davis in right. 
</P>
<P>
Why you should draft Devon White for your Rotisserie League team. 
</P>
<P>
When all is well with White, he's one of the league's finest all-around 
talents, cut from the same cloth as Boston's Ellis Burks and Texas' Ruben 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
And all appears to be well with White in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The knee is fine. The confidence is high after last year's Gold Glove and this 
spring's .350 batting average. He's out of the leadoff spot, which he hated, 
and will bat third, ahead of Joyner, which means he should see a few more 
fastballs. And, of course, there's the carrot of arbitration eligibility come 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels haven't had a 30-30 man since Bobby Bonds in 1977, but White is 
capable of ending that streak as early as this year. 
</P>
<P>
How to tell Jack Howell apart from Jay Howell: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack uses pine tar on his bat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack would probably get along just fine with Don Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jay doesn't have a .198 career batting average against left-handed 
pitchers; wasn't pinch-hit for last season by Domingo Ramos, Gus Polidor and 
Chico Walker; wasn't crushed by Arizona's playoff loss to Nevada Las Vegas -- 
Jack attended the U of A -- and has yet to be mentioned in a trade rumor 
involving Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Why Dick Schofield is a millionaire: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has led league shortstops in fielding in each of the last two seasons 
and three times in the last five years. Fabled Baltimore shortstop Mark 
Belanger finished his career with three league fielding titles. Phil Rizzuto 
did it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He committed 13 errors last year and only nine in 1987. That's 22 errors in 
two years at baseball's most demanding position -- three fewer than Chili Davis 
committed in right field last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's beginning his sixth season as the Angels' starting shortstop. Only Jim 
Fregosi, who stayed for nine years, manned the position longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' regular shortstops in between Fregosi and Schofield: Leo Cardenas, 
1972; Rudy Meoli, 1973; Dave Chalk, 1974; Mike Miley, 1975; Chalk again, 1976; 
Bobby Grich, 1977; Chalk a third time, 1978; Bert Campaneris and Jimmy 
Anderson, 1979; Freddie Patek, 1980; Rick Burleson, 1981, and Tim Foli, 1982 
and '83. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Angels trust in the concept of the rechargeable battery. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the pairing of former All-Stars Mike Witt and Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's victory totals since 1986: 18, 16, 13. Witt's loss totals since 1986: 
10, 14, 16. Witt's strikeout totals since 1986: 208, 192, 133. Witt's ERAs 
since 1986: 2.84, 4.01, 4.15. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's home run totals since 1985: 28, 22, 17, 15. Parrish's RBI totals 
since 1985: 98, 62, 67, 60. Parrish's batting averages since 1985: .273, .257, 
.245, .215. 
</P>
<P>
Witt is still just 28 years old. Parrish is 32. They can't be over the hill 
already. 
</P>
<P>
Can they? 
</P>
<P>
Why the Angels will finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, Minnesota and Kansas City have better teams. Texas could, too, 
provided that Jeff Russell is the answer in the Ranger bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have improved, but so has the division, clearly the stronger in the 
American League in 1989. Two years ago, 85 games won the West for Minnesota. 
This year, 85 victories may not be enough for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
This Angel team is capable of scoring 800 runs -- and giving up 820. The 8-7 
ballgame could become an Anaheim Stadium staple this summer, which means the 
fans should have a lot more fun than the Angel bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
If the offense can carry the starting pitching to 80 victories, and the Angels 
break even in September, Rader will have this team on the right track and the 
season should be declared a resounding success. Things will have worked out.

Photo, OUT OF CONTROL -- Stopping Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is tough enough for his 
opponents. But Sunday night, it didn't compare to the task of NBA official Ron 
Olesiak, who tries pull the Laker center away from a first-quarter, 
bench-clearing battle that began when Buck forward Larry Krystkowiak apparently 
struck Abdul-Jabbar in the forehead. Krystkowiak was called for the foul, but 
Abdul-Jabbar came away with a technical foul after retaliating as Olesiak and 
Laker forward A.C. Green tried to separate the two combatants. In his way, 
Abdul-Jabbar had the last word: the Lakers won, 118-117. KIRK McKOY / Los

<P>
In time, perhaps, the lies will be separated from the legends, and the 
brokenhearted will scarcely remember the echoes of glory reverberating on a 
happier day. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it was opening day, when Pete Rose stood not as a mortal accused 
but as a hero unbowed, and a simple game offered atonement for all 
transgressions, real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
They played baseball here in Riverfront Stadium Monday, the Dodgers and the 
Cincinnati Reds -- Pete Rose's Reds -- and although the Reds faltered early, 
making three errors in their very first time afield, the Dodgers were every bit 
as forgiving as the sellout crowd of 55,385 in Riverfront Stadium that 
thundered its support for an embattled native son. 
</P>
<P>
And despite a resounding show of resolve by their own larger-than-life 
character, Kirk Gibson, whose daring on the basepaths created one run and whose 
home run accounted for another, the Dodgers could not spoil a day that belonged 
to Rose and the Reds, who prevailed, 6-4, in the first game of the National 
League season. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who stood up and booed Pete Rose today should be ashamed of 
themselves," said Gibson, an unabashed admirer of the Cincinnati manager, 
despite allegations of gambling that could lead to Rose's banishment from the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I support that man. I admire him. He has been an inspiration to me, and my 
opinion will never change. He's a Hall of Famer. I don't care what he's done, 
he's a Hall of Famer." 
</P>
<P>
For Dodger starting pitcher Tim Belcher, who grew up a fan of the Reds in the 
tiny Ohio town of Sparta, there was less shame than embarrassment, especially 
for his throwing error in the second inning, when he heaved Red pitcher Danny 
Jackson's bunt into left field in what became a three-run Cincinnati rally. 
</P>
<P>
"If I make the throw to third base, it's a double play easy and I'm out of the 
inning," said Belcher, who drew the Dodgers' opening-day assignment because 
Orel Hershiser had been set back by the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"But I got too excited. (Jackson) couldn't have thrown it to me any better than 
he bunted it. But I just wheeled and threw the ball wildly. 
</P>
<P>
"They still may have gotten 12 runs in the next inning, but I would have gotten 
out of the second." 
</P>
<P>
It might have appeared that way to the unhappy Belcher, but the Reds did not 
push across a dozen runs the next inning, only three, all scoring on a home run 
by Paul O'Neill, one of four hits by the Cincinnati right fielder in a perfect 
afternoon -- a double in the second and two singles filling out his dance card 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time O'Neill has taken advantage of Dodger pitching. In 
one August series last season, he had home runs in three consecutive games and 
had nine hits in 12 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have stopped after the first ball was thrown out by my childhood 
idol," said Belcher, referring to the ceremonial toss made by Johnny Bench, the 
former Red catcher who is to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in August. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably made a better pitch than I did," Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Bench undoubtedly went with his best pitch, unlike Belcher, who chastised 
himself for insisting on throwing his curveball, the pitch he has been working 
on all spring but at the moment is no better than the fourth-best offering in 
his repertoire, behind his fastball, slider and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't do that," Belcher said. "I kept throwing the stupid thing right 
down the middle. I'm still in a spring-training mode, I guess. I kept trying to 
work on it." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill deposited one of Belcher's curves over the 375-foot sign in right 
field, catcher Jeff Reed followed with an opposite-field single to left, and 
after Belcher's next pitch to Ron Oester was wide, the second-year right-hander 
was lifted after only 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger corps of middle relievers -- Mike Morgan, Tim Crews and Ricky Horton 
-- blanked the Reds the rest of the way. But whereas the Dodgers were able to 
knock out 23-game winner Jackson after Mike Scioscia's run-scoring single in 
the fourth and Gibson's home run in the fifth, they could not overtake the 
Reds, who have now won seven straight openers and 14 of their last 16. 
</P>
<P>
"We started our game in the second inning," said first baseman Todd Benzinger, 
a newcomer from the Boston Red Sox who was charged with one of Cincinnati's 
errors when he obstructed Willie Randolph's path to second base. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, leading off the game, reached base when third baseman Chris Sabo 
threw away his grounder. Randolph was awarded second after colliding with 
Benzinger and scored when Gibson lined a sharp single to right in his first 
regulation at-bat since his dramatic World Series home run. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, who also singled in the seventh, scored the first National League run 
of 1989 after spending the previous 13 seasons in the American League with the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that qualify for a trivia question?" Randolph said with a smile. "It's 
kind of lightweight, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
There had been some question whether the Dodgers' heavyweight, Gibson, would be 
able to go nine rounds Monday. Two or three days ago, Manager Tom Lasorda said 
he was convinced that Gibson was really hurting, and even after the game 
Monday, Gibson said he was a "mess." 
</P>
<P>
Try telling that to the Reds, especially since Gibson -- who advanced to second 
on an infield out -- raced for third with two out and Mike Marshall at the 
plate. Catcher Reed's throw escaped third baseman Sabo, and Gibson pumped his 
fist in triumph as he crossed the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance I took, but it was the first inning and I wanted to force the 
issue early," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm on the field I'm going to play hard, I'm going to force myself to 
play my game. I wouldn't have been out there if I was only going to run 
half-speed and not steal bases. . . . The other (team) doesn't care if I'm 
hurting, so when I go out on the field I don't ask for a get-well card." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's home run in the fifth -- Jackson gave up only one to a left-handed 
hitter in 260 2/3 innings last season -- reinforced the message that he's in 
the lineup to stay, at least indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a manager's dream," Rose said, tossing a bouquet back to one of his 
biggest fans. "He plays so hard, he makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
But outside of Gibson, the Dodgers made little happen, managing only five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray, the new cleanup hitter, failed to get the ball out of the infield 
in four at-bats and also dropped a throw by Alfredo Griffin in the seventh for 
an error. John Shelby, who tied a playoff record by striking out 12 times in 
seven games against the Mets, fanned three more times. And neither Mickey 
Hatcher nor Franklin Stubbs, pinch-hitters employed by Lasorda, was able to 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, meanwhile, had 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of talk in our camp during spring training was about gambling," 
Benzinger said. "It was relaxing that a lot of media were here today, talking 
about baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Red left-hander Danny Jackson gave up only one home run to a 
left-handed hitter -- Will Clark of the Giants, in his last start of the 
season, Sept. 28 in San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Kirk Gibson matched that 
total with his fifth-inning home run Monday. Gibson hit only .172 and struck 
out 10 times in 29 at-bats against Jackson last season. . . . Willie Randolph's 
seventh-inning single, his first hit as a National Leaguer, ended an 0-for-33 
string, including his last 30 at-bats as a New York Yankee. . . . Randolph took 
his wife Gretchen, who had an appendectomy last week in Vero Beach, back to 
their home in New Jersey before rejoining the team. He said she is resting 
comfortably.

TAC WANTS ASTAPHAN TO NAME U.S. ATHLETES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Athletics Congress, which governs track and field in the United States, has 
asked Ben Johnson's physician to name American athletes who received anabolic 
steroids and other banned substances from him. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jamie Astaphan recently told a French sports newspaper, L'Equipe, that he 
has a list of athletes he supplied with drugs and would "name names" when 
called to testify in either late April or early May before the Canadian 
government's commission of inquiry into drug use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are American athletes named, we want to see Astaphan's list," TAC's 
executive director, Ollan Cassell, told the Associated Press from his 
Indianapolis office. "If we're going to nail the drug users, we need real 
evidence, not just words. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, neither Astaphan nor anyone else has provided anything substantial. If 
he's got something, we want it. Otherwise, we have to regard him as nothing 
more than a cheater who got caught by the system and is now trying to wiggle 
out of it by muddying the waters." 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who lives on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, also was central to 
testimony at the Canadian hearings, which resumed in Toronto Monday after a 
two-week recess. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Bethune, a former Canadian sprinter, provided further evidence indicating 
that Astaphan might have treated Johnson with the anabolic steroid stanozolol. 
Johnson was disqualified after winning the 100 meters in the Summer Olympics at 
Seoul after traces of stanozolol were discovered in his system. 
</P>
<P>
In previous testimony, Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, said that Johnson used 
another anabolic steroid up to 22 days before the 100-meter final at Seoul and 
speculated that the sprinter's positive test for stanozolol was the result of 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
But Angella Taylor Issajenko, another Canadian sprinter coached by Francis, 
suggested in later testimony that Astaphan had given stanozolol to her and 
other athletes, including Johnson, but called it by a different name. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony Monday, Bethune said that he asked Astaphan in September, 
1985, to put him "on Ben's program." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Astaphan, who had a Toronto office at the time, injected him with 
human growth hormone and emptied a bottle of pink pills into a white envelope, 
instructing him to take them over the course of a week. Bethune said the 
process was repeated during weekly visits for the next five months. 
</P>
<P>
After one visit, Bethune said, he retrieved from the garbage can the empty 
bottle that had contained the pink pills. 
</P>
<P>
"It said: 'Winstrol-V -- For Veterinary use only,' " Bethune said. 
</P>
<P>
Winstrol-V is a brand name for stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
The first athlete to testify Monday, Tony Sharpe, another former sprinter, said 
that he became aware of steroid use in track and field in August, 1980, while 
on a track scholarship at Clemson University in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it around," he said. "I didn't really see anyone using it. It was talked 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe said that he began using steroids a year later, after returning to 
Toronto to train under Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my belief all along and all through my career that it would take some 
help (to compete at a world-class level), and that meant steroids," he said. "A 
high percentage of world-class sprinters are steroid users. No one's going to 
say, 'I use them,' but we were all clean until tested positive." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he does not believe athletes can be deterred from using the drugs.

SCOTT OSTLER: CUTTING THROUGH TO FIND THE ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Answer Man ... 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA basketball tournament exposed college fans to an awful lot of 
net-cutting. Though the practice probably makes for a dandy bunch of souvenirs, 
I still wonder why the nets are cut down. As most cagers should know, a 
basketball net unloops quickly and easily. Do you suppose the players also cut 
off their trunks and jerseys after a big win? Or, maybe their jocks? Or is this 
just another sad example of our higher educational system failing the athlete? 
</P>
<P>
 I have decided to respond to this query even though it is an actual letter 
from an actual reader, Dave Michel of Westminster, and normally I prefer to 
field questions received from a higher source, i.e.: my own head. But this 
issue is too important to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
I think we're dealing with symbolism here, Dave. It's the same principle 
demonstrated when happy football fans tear down the goal posts, or when happy 
English soccer fans tear down the stadium and the adjacent city. Basketball 
players don't cut down the nets, they slash 'em down. 
</P>
<P>
True, it's like watching a doctor use a chain saw to perform a tonsillectomy, 
but hey, kids will be kids. And so will coaches, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gwynn hits .449 for the Dodgers in spring training, shows some power and 
has few strikeouts, and he gets shipped out to Albuquerque. How can this be, 
seeing as how the Dodgers' two big-stick outfielders, Gibson and Marshall, will 
spend the rest of their careers on a medical day-to-day basis? What does a guy 
have to do to make the big club? 
</P>
<P>
 That was spring training. What if the Dodgers keep Gwynn and he goes into a 
horrible slump, batting only .320 or so during the regular season? Besides, how 
often does a team have a need for a left-handed, line-drive-hitting, 
contact-type pinch-hitter? 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Johnson's doctor, Jamie Astaphan, will testify in a couple weeks in that 
Canadian inquiry into performance-enhancing drugs. Astaphan says he is ready to 
"spill every detail." What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
 I think they shouldn't let him handle any urine specimens. 
</P>
<P>
Do you join the world in saluting the career of retiring NFL Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, with some minor reservations. Rozelle allowed steroids to rage unchecked 
in his league until 13 years after they were banned in the Olympic Games. 
Whatever Pete did to encourage the hiring of even one black head coach did not 
work. He burned bundles and bales of the league's money in his futile, 
decade-long legal Wrestlemania grudge match with Al (Macho Man) Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, from me, Pete gets high marks, accolades, kudos and huzzahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon Mitchell of the Detroit Lions says that when he attended Iowa, his 
academic career consisted mainly of classes in such subjects as billiards, 
jogging, recreational leisure, advanced bowling and advanced slow-pitch 
softball. Your thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 Finals week must have been a killer. 
</P>
<P>
People assume Mitchell had it easy, but think about it: With classes like 
those, when he was studying hard and got the urge to just bust out and goof off 
for a few hours, what could he do? Go to the library and read a textbook on 
quantum physics? 
</P>
<P>
Also, critics who knock Mitchell's curriculum fail to note that it is almost 
identical to the college course-load of vice president Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's major prepared him well for life after college, assuming, of course, 
his life after college is spent as a guest at Hugh Hefner's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Wade Boggs be featured on Wheaties boxes? 
</P>
<P>
 No, but I understand Boggs' agent has secured him an even better deal, with 
the company that markets a cereal similar to Wheaties, but cheese-flavored. 
Look for Boggs on the front of boxes of Cheaties. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a popular belief in basketball that refs should swallow their 
whistles in the last two or three minutes of a game. Temple Coach John Chaney, 
for example, says the refs should never get involved in the final minute of a 
game. "Let the kids decide it," he says. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
 Makes sense. I'm sure total anarchy would produce some artistic and memorable 
finishes. Why clutter up a nice game with rules and their enforcement? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, if anyone should disappear during the final minutes of a basketball 
game it should be the two coaches and their 14 assistants. They could be tied 
to tree branches outside and the winning team could celebrate by cutting down 
the nets, then cutting down the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice mayor of Bejing has pledged to leap off the top of a 50-story 
building if the city's preparations for the 1990 Asian Games are not completed 
by September. What would you call this? A good-natured bluff? A show of 
confidence? An act of courage?

CINCINNATI SHOWS ROSE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT ON OPENING DAY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city was outfitted in red for the traditional parade and pageantry of 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
On a mild and gray Monday, the Cincinnati Reds participated in their 105th 
opener in the National League, their 103rd at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 27th as a major league player and manager for Pete Rose, 47, who 
came out of Western Hills High here to fashion a career of such magnitude -- a 
career spent almost entirely in a Red uniform -- that both a street and pier 
now carry his name. 
</P>
<P>
Rose played in his first Cincinnati opener at Crosley Field in 1963. Monday 
morning he stood by the batting cage at Riverfront Stadium and remembered how 
his rookie jitters soon yielded to a feeling of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought the stage was the place to be," he said. "You wait all winter 
for opening day. You bust your butt all summer to get in the playoffs. You play 
like hell in the playoffs to get in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the challenges you want, and I'd rather do it here in Cincinnati 
than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to so many others, but also so different for Peter Edward Rose. 
</P>
<P>
This time the standing ovation during the pregame ceremony seemed to convey 
something other than appreciation for a remarkable career. This time the 
message was one of support, as expressed by the banners hanging from the upper 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
"We're Betting on You Pete," read one, eventually removed by ushers. 
</P>
<P>
A continuing investigation into Rose's gambling activities and the uncertainty 
it has created about Rose's future as the Reds' manager separated this opener 
from any of his previous 26, any of the Reds' previous 104. 
</P>
<P>
"Couldn't ask for a better day," Rose said after the Reds' 6-4 victory over the 
Dodgers, but you knew he could have. 
</P>
<P>
A judgment day would be better. An end to the allegations. A day that would 
settle the speculation that he may be suspended for a year or barred for life. 
A day that would put a stop to the questions that the always glib Rose answers 
with, "No comment," on advice from counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 55,385 here Monday included three of his attorneys, sitting apart 
from one another. "To make it harder for you guys to find them," Rose said to 
reporters before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Is he worried? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't worry about things I have no control over," he said of the 
investigation. "I know I'm going to the Hall of Fame. I can't worry about how 
many votes I'm going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Is he confident he will be cleared? 
</P>
<P>
"Very confident." 
</P>
<P>
Did he ever bet on a baseball game? 
</P>
<P>
"The time will come when I can answer that, but for now, no comment," he said 
with a measure of sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
Annoyed? 
</P>
<P>
"Not as long as we're talking baseball," he said. "But as you can see, I'm 
starting to get upset. 
</P>
<P>
"I may go sit in a corner of the dugout, watch batting practice and not talk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's freedom of speech, or in my case, freedom of no speech." 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been a question you guys have asked that I don't have an answer 
for," he agreed, prompting a semi-wise guy to ask for an explanation of 
Einstein's theory of relativity. 
</P>
<P>
Rose smiled and said: "Einstein is one guy I missed. Him and George Herman 
Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a new theory concerning Rose. 
</P>
<P>
It is being speculated now that the length of an inquiry said to have begun in 
September and the fact that Rose was allowed to open the season as the Reds' 
manager indicate that all anyone has on him is guilt by association. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is expected to continue for two or three weeks, but Rose 
knows he can feed off the support of his home fans, who stood up after his 
pregame introduction and overrode a smattering of initial boos. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, at a news conference that began with the team's publicity 
director saying that only baseball questions would be accepted, Rose said 
Cincinnati fans have always treated him as a king, that it is never old hat, 
that he again had goose bumps standing near home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"They appreciate effort and I've always given them that," he said. "I wouldn't 
have expected them to react badly. I've never done anything but try to give 
them my best and give them a winner. I know what I stand for and so do they. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand for baseball, Cincinnati Reds baseball. I always have and always 
will." 
</P>
<P>
It began when Rose's father, the original Charlie Hustle, would take him out of 
school to attend Red openers. All it required to be excused from class -- then 
as now -- was a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other opening day like Cincinnati's," Rose said. "Can't be because 
it's been going on so long. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a lot of tears shed by fathers who are here with their sons and 
remember coming with their own dads, like I do." 
</P>
<P>
Now, for Rose, there is the threat that the association may be severed. He has 
told his players to keep their minds on their job, that he will deal with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds open with 19 straight games against Western Division rivals and 
believe a strong start is imperative if they are to shake the bridesmaid image 
of four consecutive second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Rick Mahler has joined an already strong rotation. Experienced role 
players Joel Youngblood, Manny Trillo and Ken Griffey have strengthened the 
utility corps. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a second great bench to go along with Johnny," Rose said, adding 
that this is his best team and that, more important, the players now believe it 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, center fielder Eric Davis seemed to imply, because Rose is communicating 
better than he has before. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real good about this team and this year," Davis said. "I think our 
unity is really going to help us. The last three or four years, we never knew 
who was going to play or if we were going to platoon or what. It would take 
half the year to figure out our roles. This year we know from the start and 
that's going to help. 
</P>
<P>

So does Pete Rose, of course. And, for openers at least, he was.

ANDERSON EARNS SPURS BUT PROBABLY WON'T GET ROOKIE AWARD

<P>
Accustomed to losing by now, forward Willie Anderson of the San Antonio Spurs 
already has reconciled himself to probably losing the voting for National 
Basketball Assn. rookie of the year to guard Mitch Richmond of the Golden State 
Warriors, despite comparable statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, Mitch has had a better year than any other rookie," Anderson 
said. "He's scored more. And, another thing is, his team is winning. I have no 
problem with it. Mitch is my friend." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond certainly would seem to be deserving. The Warrior guard began the week 
ranking 16th in the league scoring race with a 22.1-point average. He most 
likely will finish with the highest rookie scoring average in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"People notice Mitch the most because he scores a lot of points," Anderson 
said. "The main thing (the voting reporters look) at is points, not the 
all-around game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think if our ballclub was even close to .500, I'd have a legitimate chance 
to get it. But (Richmond's) team is winning, and mine's not. I have no hard 
feelings about it." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a 6-foot-7 forward from the University of Georgia, has quietly put 
together a consistent, well-rounded game. Not that it is being noticed much, 
since the 19-52 Spurs are routinely buried. 
</P>
<P>
Going into tonight's game between the Spurs and the 13-58 Miami Heat, Anderson 
is averaging 18.4 points, five rebounds and 4.3 assists a game. He also has 
played 33 minutes a game, a record for a Spur rookie, and is one steal away 
from passing Alvin Robertson's record of 127 as a rookie in 1984-85. In another 
season, on another team, that might make Anderson the leading candidate for 
rookie honors. 
</P>
<P>
But, whereas Richmond has had an easy transition, playing in Coach Don Nelson's 
system at Golden State where Chris Mullin primarily is responsible for the 
scoring and Winston Garland the ballhandling, Anderson mostly has had to go it 
alone in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
With little offensive help, almost no leadership from veteran players, and a 
coach, Larry Brown, who has feuded with some players, Anderson admitted that it 
has been a frustrating season. 
</P>
<P>
Spending part of last weekend in Los Angeles, Anderson's talent was 
overshadowed by the Spurs' two latest losses. He scored 17 points in a blowout 
by the Lakers and 24 in a narrow loss to the Clippers. "Very frustrating, man," 
Anderson said. "The way things have gone, you try not to carry a (losing) 
attitude into the game. It's especially tough, because we thought we had a 
pretty good team coming into the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to think about how bad we've been. You can't accept losing, but you 
can't expect to go too far without a big guy in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, that big guy will be 7-foot David Robinson, the first overall pick 
in the 1987 draft whose active-duty commitment to the Navy will end in time for 
the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
So, Spur hopes for better things depend largely on Robinson and continued 
success by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
With nothing else but the draft lottery to look forward to, Anderson already is 
thinking how his role on the team will change when Robinson arrives. For one 
thing, Anderson said he would like to move from small forward back to shooting 
guard, his position in college, and maybe even become a sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, I'd like to come off the bench," Anderson said. "I'll ask to do 
that. With (Robinson) coming in, a lot of people's roles will change. I don't 
particularly like starting as a small forward, and I could come in off the 
bench and replace Alvin (Robertson). 
</P>
<P>
"Having Robinson will open up our perimeter shooting. Right now, we don't have 
a good inside game, and teams are defending our guards." 
</P>
<P>
So, Anderson will play out the season, most likely finish second to Richmond in 
the rookie voting and wait for the Spurs' ship -- with Robinson aboard -- to 
come in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an interesting year," Anderson said. "I've learned a lot. I sort of 
wish I could have been in a situation like (Richmond's). I've had to play a lot 
right away, learn things quickly on my own, and we've lost a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they will catch a Wayne Newton show: Doug Moe, Denver's unconventional 
coach, plans to house his team in Las Vegas, instead of Los Angeles, on a day 
off before a game against the Lakers on April 18. The Nuggets will arrive in 
Los Angeles on game day. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Too many distractions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Moe believes that Las Vegas will have a calming effect on his team. 
He came up with the idea after the Nuggets lost their second straight game to 
the Clippers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Moe also is a self-described gambler. His preference is for the dog tracks 
in rural Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Bullets have signed forward Bernard King, who would have been an 
unrestricted free agent after this season, to a contract extension reportedly 
calling for $3 million for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
King, who has resurrected his career in Washington after recovering from a torn 
knee ligament that required surgery similar to Danny Manning's, probably could 
have received a more lucrative offer through free agency. But he said that 
loyalty toward the Bullets, who took a chance signing him three seasons ago, 
prompted him to agree to terms. 
</P>
<P>
Bullet guard Darrell Walker, a teammate of King's in New York before the knee 
injury, said that King has come almost all the way back from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way he can ever be 100% after that operation," Walker said. "He 
knows that better than anybody and has adjusted to that. But he's at least 75% 
to 80%, and that's better than a lot of players in the league. He can still 
make those moves; he's just not as explosive. He can still run the court. That 
hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
King is the Bullets' leading scorer with a 21.3 average. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Another in a series of of NBA-travel horror stories: Last Tuesday, the Seattle 
SuperSonics' flight, leaving Salt Lake City for Houston was four hours late. 
The reason was burned food on board the plane. SuperSonic players went directly 
to the game less than an hour before tipoff, while Coach Bernie Bickerstaff and 
his staff arrived during introductions after checking in at the hotel, 
showering and briefly going over game strategy. Without pregame instruction, 
Seattle made 57% of their shots in the first half. After receiving guidance 
from the coaching staff, the SuperSonics lost, 120-117. "This was unreal," 
forward Michael Cage said. "Teams should not have to play under these 
conditions." . . . Last week, New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing made 18 of 
25 shots against the Charlotte Hornets, who chose not double-team the Knicks' 
center. "I don't know what they were thinking," Knick forward Gerald Wilkins 
told Newsday. "I saw the one on one and I said, 'Are they serious?' " Dick 
Harter, Hornet coach, defended his strategy. "He's beaten us when we've doubled 
him," Harter said. "He's beaten us when we didn't. He's a superior player. No, 
he's the best in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Reynolds of the Sacramento Kings said that his pick as the league's 
most valuable player is point guard Mark Price of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 
which might surprise supporters of Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Charles 
Barkley, et al. "There's a rule that little bitty guys won't get it, but 
(Price) is deserving as anybody," Reynolds said. "He's not as good a passer as 
John Stockton, but he's a better offensive player. He's so quick you need a 
brick to smack him upside the head to stop him.". . . Even after a three-game 
winning streak, the Miami Heat is ridiculed in public. The latest incident 
happened on an airplane heading to Indianapolis. The Heat had won three 
straight and the players were loudly celebrating. Eventually, the pilot made 
the following announcement: "To the Heat players. Settle down or we're going to 
have to take this plane to Boston or Chicago so you can play a real team."

IRVINE RALLIES TO GET PAST MISSION VIEJO

David Goldstein, Irvine High School pitcher, huddled with his teammates outside 
the dugout before the Vaqueros came to bat in the bottom of the seventh inning 
Monday in their South Coast League game with Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein had watched a 3-2 lead disappear in the top of the inning when he 
threw a wild pitch that allowed Mission Viejo to tie the score, but the senior 
right-hander had nothing but encouraging words for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Score a run here and we'll make headlines tomorrow," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Scott Vollmer's run-scoring double in the inning won't stop the presses, 
but it was enough to give Irvine a 4-3 victory, handing Mission Viejo its first 
league defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein (5-1) earned a victory and a save, leaving the game in the fifth 
inning and re-entering in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that very often, but I didn't know what else to do," Irvine Coach 
Bob Flint said. "I felt like the whole team was a glass of water. We weren't 
very good, we weren't lousy. We were stuck and going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed this one. This is the first time in a long while where I felt, 'Wow, 
we played really well,' and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (7-6, 2-1) held a 2-0 lead going into the fifth inning with Goldstein 
containing a good-hitting Mission Viejo team. Goldstein had six strikeouts 
after four innings, but Mission Viejo tied the score, 2-2, in the fifth when 
Goldstein struggled with his control. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein walked Rick Marian and Eric Ekdahl with one out, and both runners 
eventually scored off relief pitcher Kevin Obergfell. Left fielder Don Disbro 
had the big hit of the inning, a run-scoring double down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine regained the lead, 3-2, in the bottom of the fifth when losing pitcher 
Troy Kopp (4-2) walked Scott Brandino with the bases loaded. Kopp pitched well, 
but the Diablos committed four errors that led to three unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many errors to win, but I was proud of the way we battled back," 
Mission Viejo Coach Ron Drake said. "We had our chances to score, but credit 
their pitcher. He was tough when he had to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein struck out the side in the fourth inning after Mission Viejo (9-3, 
2-1) put a runner on third base with nobody out. He also struck out two in the 
seventh inning with runners on second and third and one out, finishing with 10 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was Goldstein's vision of fame. Obergfell opened the seventh with a 
single and moved to second when second baseman Mike Boucher couldn't handle 
Mike Scale's hard-hit grounder. Then it was up to Vollmer to line a double down 
the right-field line, scoring Obergfell with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"When the chips are on the line, Scott Vollmer is a tough out," Drake said. "We 
walked him intentionally in the fifth, and it ended up costing us a run. I 
wasn't going to do that again, and so he hits the double to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
In other South Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 9, Dana Hills 0 -- Starter Mike Mosebrook (5-1) threw a 
seven-hitter and struck out eight as host Capistrano Valley (9-4, 2-1) used 10 
hits, three walks and three errors to win easily. David Guillen led the offense 
with two doubles and teammate Doug Bame had two hits and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 6, San Clemente 3 -- Shortstop Sean Drinkwater had two hits and 
teammate Dave Schachter drove in two runs to give starter Greg Pearce (2-0) the 
victory at San Clemente.

Rich Daly, the University of Missouri basketball recruiter who took over the 
team after Coach Norm Stewart became ill, turned in vouchers for Detroit area 
recruiting trips that had many similar names, The Kansas City (Mo.) Star 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it was unable to locate most of the people named on the 
vouchers, saying they were neither listed in the Detroit telephone directory or 
known to athletic officials familiar with area basketball programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Glazier, a member of a Chicago law firm retained by Missouri to 
investigate alleged National Collegiate Athletic Assn. violations in the Tiger 
basketball program, said an examination of expense vouchers is part of his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people whose names are the same as those included on vouchers 
for the period 1985-1988 said they had not been taken to lunch by Daly or 
Stewart, who also filed some of the vouchers examined by the Star. 
</P>
<P>
The name Orlando Crockett appeared on eight meal vouchers turned in by Daly and 
two turned in by Stewart, the Star reported. An Orlando Crockett who is a 
well-known basketball referee in the Detroit area said he had never or been 
taken to lunch by a Missouri representative. 
</P>
<P>
The Star said Daly vouchers mentioned six people named Whitehead, representing 
10 separate entries. A Jerome Whitehead was listed twice, a Charles Whitehead 
three times, a George Whitehead twice and a Greg, Larry and David Whitehead 
once each. Also listed were the similar names of Charles Whitchild, Henry 
Whitehurst and Charles Whiteher Jr.

NEWSWIRE: NANCE IS SELECTED AT WASHINGTON; MAJERUS TO TAKE OVER AT UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three college basketball coaching jobs were filled Monday, as Washington picked 
Lynn Nance, Utah tabbed Rick Majerus and Tennessee named Wade Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Nance, a former player and assistant coach at Washington, led St. Mary's to a 
25-4 record and the West Coast Athletic Conference regular-season championship 
last season. He was a candidate for the job four years ago, when it went to 
Andy Russo, who resigned under pressure March 22. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official announcement at Utah, but the university has called a 
press conference for today and Ball State president John E. Worthen announced 
that Majerus has resigned there. Majerus, the coach at Marquette from 1983-86, 
had been at Ball State for two seasons and guided the Cardinals to a 29-3 
record and the Mid-American Conference title in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, an assistant at Louisville, became the first black head basketball 
coach in the Southeastern Conference when he agreed to a five-year, $850,000 
contract with Tennessee. He was an assistant to Denny Crum at Louisville since 
1976.

NCAA DECIDES THREE-POINT DISTANCE TO REMAIN SAME, LENGTHENS TIMEOUTS

The distance for the three-point field goal will remain the same in college 
basketball, but timeouts will be lengthened by 15 seconds and two free throws 
will be awarded for all technical fouls, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
basketball rules committee decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee agreed that conferences could experiment with 
allowing players to accumulate six personal fouls before leaving the game and 
giving three free throws to a player fouled while trying a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were announced just before the national championship game was 
played. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping the three-point distance at 19 feet 9 inches, the rules committee 
went against the recommendation of many coaches who would like to see that 
distance lengthened. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall accuracy actually went down . . . plus the feeling is there's 
nothing wrong with it," said Ed Steitz, executive secretary of the rules 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's given a new dimension to the game and it's added excitement."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL;

ORANGE COAST HAS FEW FAULTS AGAIN IN TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Kresal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news is pretty much the same every spring when it comes to women's 
community college tennis in Orange County: Orange Coast is far and away the 
best team. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, under Coach Janice Maran, are 11-0 overall and lead the Orange 
Empire Conference with a 7-0 record. But this is hardly news for Maran, who 
took over the program in 1977. Her teams have won 11 consecutive conference 
titles starting in 1978. Orange Coast has a record of 133-5 in conference 
matches and an overall record of 158-12 in 11 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has also won state titles in four of the last five years, missing 
in 1986 when Fullerton won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Two main reasons for the success of this year's team are Julie Slattery and 
Natalie Hastings. Slattery is the defending state singles champion and has a 
record of 10-0. She is 120-32 in games. She and Hastings teamed to win the 
state doubles title last season and are 10-0 this season. They are 122-33 in 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Softball: Fullerton, behind sophomore pitcher Kirstin Jacobs, has taken the 
lead in the Orange Empire Conference. Jacobs is 19-7 overall and 5-1 in 
conference play for Fullerton, which leads with a 7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Saddleback (5-2) is second, Golden West (4-4) third, 
Riverside (3-5) fourth, Rancho Santiago (3-6) fifth, Cypress (2-5) sixth and 
Orange Coast (2-6) seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Golf: Orange Coast defeated Saddleback, 370-374, Friday to take the lead in the 
Orange Empire Conference race. John Harding, OCC's No. 5 player, shot a 69 to 
lead host Orange Coast at the Costa Mesa Golf Course. It was the lowest round 
for any Orange Coast player this season. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has a record of 13-2. Saddleback (8-2) is second. Saddleback will 
get a chance to pull even in the standings when the Gauchos play host to a 
conference match at Mission Viejo Country Club April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Teams on the road just play the host team, but the host team plays the four 
visiting teams under the conference's scoring format. 
</P>
<P>
Men's and women's swimming: Orange Coast's women and men have dominated Orange 
Empire Conference opponents. The Orange Coast teams are both 5-0 and in first 
place in conference play. It's pretty much the same story in the South Coast 
Conference, where the Golden West men's and women's teams are 3-0 with three 
meets left. 
</P>
<P>
Men's tennis: Saddleback, the top-ranked team in the state, and Orange Coast, 
ranked third, have made it a two-team race. Saddleback won the first meeting, 
6-3, over Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team has lost more than two points to any other conference team. OCC 
(6-1 in conference) is at Saddleback (7-0) April 18. 
</P>
<P>
Track and field: The Riverside teams won the conference titles last Friday with 
a sweep of Fullerton at Riverside. The men won, 88-45, to finish the conference 
dual-meet season at 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Both women's teams were 4-0 going in, but Riverside clinched the conference 
title with a 77-51 victory. The conference meet will be at Riverside on April 
28. 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball: Orange Coast (12-1) leads L.A. Pierce (11-1) by a half game in the 
South Coast Conference race. Golden West (8-4) is third and LaVerne (8-6) 
fourth. The top three conference teams qualify for the Southern California 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The northern half of the state has a conference this season and its winner will 
fill the other playoff spot. The four teams will play a single-elimination 
tournament May 5 at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley: Pam Deegan, who heads Irvine Valley College's Athletic 
Commission, said that a sports program is still a ways off. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is holding planning meetings that will continue for the next few 
months. After the recommendations, there is the chance of some club teams 
playing as early as next fall. However, nothing is official, according to 
Deegan, who is also head of the health life and earth sciences programs at 
Irvine Valley, which opened in 1979 as Saddleback North. The college's name was 
changed to Irvine Valley in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Scott Talanoa of Orange Coast hit a three-run home run against Fullerton 
Saturday to take the Orange Empire Conference lead with 10. Talanoa has hit 
seven home runs in his last 13 games. . . . El Camino and Cypress will play the 
championship game of the Cypress baseball tournament Friday at 1 p.m. at 
Cypress. . . . Alisha Bokano of Cypress is hitting .400 (42 of 105), and 
teammate Rose Ferrante is at .398 (43 of 108) with three doubles, seven 
triples, seven home runs and 32 RBIs.

GARDEN GROVE FIRM IN $10-MILLION STOCK SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
DENSE-PAC TO ACQUIRE COMPETITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to expand its European sales, Dense-Pac Microsystems, a Garden Grove 
computer microchip maker, has agreed to acquire a European competitor in a 
stock swap valued at roughly $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger agreement, Dense-Pac will acquire all the stock of 
Scotland-based Hybrid Memory Products in exchange for issuing 8 million new 
Dense-Pac shares to the Scottish firm's stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies are expected to have combined sales of more than $25 million 
for the year ended February, 1990, Dense-Pac Chairman James G. Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Dense-Pac has been trying to establish a presence in Europe. Earlier this year, 
the firm announced the acquisition of its European affiliate, EMM Dense-Pac 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Stowell, Dense-Pac's chief financial officer, said Hybrid's 
experience in Europe will help in improving the profitability of the EMM 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Dense-Pac will play a role in boosting sales in the United States of 
commercial products made by Hybrid's U.S. subsidiary, San Diego-based Mosaic 
Semiconductor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 10% of Dense-Pac's present sales are in Europe. After the 
acquisition, which is subject to the signing of a definitive agreement, more 
than 40% of the sales of the combined firm will come from Europe, Stowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Dense-Pac and Hybrid have complementary product lines and are strong in 
different markets, he said. Dense-Pac produces custom memory chips, mostly for 
U.S. defense customers. Hybrid does most of its business in Europe and is 
stronger in the commercial, industrial and aerospace markets. 
</P>
<P>
Since emerging from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1987, Dense-Pac 
has been on the financial mend. The company earned $821,000 on revenue of $6 
million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It expects to earn about $900,000 on revenue of $7 million for its fiscal 1989 
year that ended Feb. 28, Stowell said.

ALMANAC: ASIAN MOTOR COMPANIES IN COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRMS SETTLE IN 'PACIFIC MOTOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese motorcycle makers were the first Asian motor companies to open 
distribution and marketing headquarters in Orange County when they came here in 
the 1960s. Since then, several Asian car companies have made Orange County 
their American home. Although no cars are made here, one industry analyst 
describes the county as "Motown on the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The largest Japanese motor companies -- Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- are in Los 
Angeles County, where they settled more than 25 years ago. But most of those 
arriving from Asia in the 1980s have chosen Orange County, citing the 
availability of land, the attractiveness of the area, the increase of ethnic 
diversity. 
</P>

COUNTY GROUP'S SUIT BLAMES HIKE IN GASOLINE PRICES ON EXXON SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of county residents sought Monday to hold Exxon Corp. financially 
responsible for a recent increase in gasoline prices that they allege was 
caused by the firm's oil spill in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The demand came in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, seeking 
unspecified damages from Exxon. The eight local residents named as plaintiffs 
hope to turn their case into a class-action suit that could in theory include 
millions of California motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The worst oil spill in North American history occurred March 24 when an Exxon 
tanker hit a reef near the port of Valdez, spilling 10 million gallons of oil. 
The captain of the tanker has been charged with operating a ship while under 
the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the lawsuit may carry a symbolic message of anger and frustration, 
even the Newport Beach lawyer who filed the action acknowledged that it faces 
rough sailing in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
At least four other class-action lawsuits have already been filed in state and 
federal courts in Alaska on behalf of commercial fishermen, tour operators and 
others who allege that their livelihoods are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday's suit in Santa Ana is the first known action to seek such a broad 
recourse -- demanding compensation for any consumers who can show financial 
harm from the loss of the spilled oil and the industry havoc it created. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly novel," Michelle A. Reinglass, head of the Orange County Bar 
Assn.'s business litigation unit, said about the suit. "The idea of a 
class-action suit for a group that broad seems a bit farfetched, but it might 
be reasonable in that people who buy gas all have something in common." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond getting the lawsuit certified as a class action, tougher still may be 
proving in court that the spill was the direct cause of a price surge with 
increases of up to 27 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Experts have disagreed over the cause of the increase, with some officials 
within the industry suggesting that public panic -- more than market economics 
-- has created the inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But Newport Beach attorney Peter Seidenberg, representing the gas buyers named 
in the suit, asserted that Exxon's negligence in failing to secure its oil 
properly or take prompt cleanup action produced "a real shortage" of oil and 
created the price increase. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California consumers have been particularly hard hit by the situation 
because 40% of the Southland's oil supply comes from Alaska, Seidenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
He called the lawsuit "an opportunity here to make some noise and perhaps be 
compensated and to show that we're mad and we're not going to take this 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials could not be reached for comment. The Alyeska Pipeline Service 
Co., also named as a defendant, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
NO RELIEF IN SIGHT Alaskan oil's flow to California is increasing, but gasoline 
prices keep rising. Page 1, Part I.

COST OF AVERAGE NEW HOME UP $90,000 IN NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Spurred by the rapid increase in the cost of subdivision lots, the average 
price of a new single-family house in North County has increased by nearly 
$90,000, or 51%, over the past year to $261,000. The study by Market Profiles 
of San Diego compared average subdivision sale prices over the first quarter of 
1989 with the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, the average price of a new house in southern San Diego 
County was $234,800, an increase of $54,000, or 30%, over the same quarter the 
previous year, according to Market Profiles. The study used California 52 as 
the dividing line for the two regions. 
</P>
<P>
Similar price increases were logged by Meyers Group, a La Jolla-based market 
research firm that also tracks subdivision sales. Meyers reported that 
first-quarter median sales price of new homes, countywide, was $227,990, a 46% 
increase over the $154,990 median price during the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
Median prices are those at which half of all houses sell for more and half for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Lot prices are being squeezed by the declining supply of developable land in 
San Diego County and by the increasingly restrictive zoning policies governing 
the land that is available, several industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical undeveloped, 5,000-square-foot lot in the so-called California 163 
corridor from Rancho Bernardo south to Tierrasanta now sells for $100,000 to 
$120,000, up from $60,000 to $70,000 a year ago, said Bill Fontana, a partner 
in Westana Builders/Developers, a San Diego home builder. 
</P>
<P>
The high prices of new housing reflect the fact that most new units being built 
these days are geared to the so-called "move-up" buyer market: that is, buyers 
who are selling smaller and cheaper houses and using the equity they have built 
up to buy larger and more expensive abodes, Market Profiles president Russell 
Valone said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high price of new housing, most first-time buyers are buying 
resold existing houses, which are showing less-dramatic price increases, Valone 
said. The average price of an existing house sold in metropolitan San Diego in 
February was $187,636, a 14% increase over the February, 1988, average price, 
the San Diego Board of Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the thinning inventory of available new housing, the actual number 
of new houses sold during the first quarter this year declined to 1,643 units, 
a 48% drop from the 3,138 units sold in first quarter of 1988. Sales in the 
souther part of the county totaled 858 units, down from the 913 sold last year. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of new condominiums and townhouses have remained flat to down, Market 
profiles said. A typical North County condo sold for $136,800 over the first 
quarter, down from $140,500 last year, Valone said. South County condominiums' 
average price increased to $126,000, up from last year's average $117,600.

S.D. DEVELOPERS GROW WARY THAT MARKET WILL TOP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Building houses outside San Diego County is something Bill Fontana and Wes 
Mudge hoped never to do when they formed Westana Builders/Developers in 1980. 
But the rising cost -- and risk -- of home building is making such a move 
practically inevitable, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Their main objective in forming Westana was to stay local and to avoid the 
management responsibilities, the airplane travel and the delegation of duties 
attendant to their former jobs as executives at Pacific Scene, a San 
Diego-based residential developer with projects located out of the county, even 
out of state. 
</P>
<P>
Both native San Diegans, Fontana, 48, and Mudge, 42, wanted to keep their 
company small enough that they could look after details of their projects 
themselves, from roof lines and colors to floor plans and fixtures, making the 
intuitive design and marketing decisions that mean the difference between a 
project's success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,300 Homes Sold 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, their approach has been successful. Swept along by the 
county's six-year housing boom, Westana has sold 1,300 houses in nine years, 
building a reputation as a low-key, high-value developer, making its two 
founders wealthy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Starting out in 1980 with houses in a South Bay project starting at $80,000 
that were marketed to first-time buyers with VA loans, Westana has evolved to 
the point that the firm now specializes in more expensive "move-up" product 
geared to homeowners looking to step up in size and quality. Prices at 
Westana's newest subdivision, for example, Westridge in Rancho Penasquitos, 
will start at $250,000 when sales begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
But Fontana and Mudge have been growing increasingly cautious in recent months. 
They fear that a downturn in the housing market -- caused by a jump in interest 
rates or unaffordably high prices -- could leave them holding every developer's 
nightmare: unsold inventory. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Westana has gradually scaled back its construction from a peak of 
350 houses sold in 1984 to the 100 units they expect to sell this year. And 
they envision a time soon when they may have to build projects outside the 
county if they are to remain in the business at all. 
</P>
<P>
The principal cause of caution is the high cost of residential lots in San 
Diego. Finished lots along the desirable California 163 "corridor" in San Diego 
from Rancho Bernardo south to Tierrasanta now cost upward of $120,000 each, 
more than 50% more than a year ago and roughly five times the cost when Westana 
began business in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The cost has been pushed up, Fontana said, by the increased competition among 
local builders for finished lots, a commodity that has grown increasingly 
scarce as San Diego County communities put slow-growth ordinances and 
restrictive planning policies into place. 
</P>
<P>
While the supply of land has diminished, the number of home builders vying for 
it has increased in recent years. Several out-of-state and foreign developers 
have entered the local market, attracted by tales of San Diego's booming 
economy and sharply increasing housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a speculative frenzy in land that has yet to peak, Fontana 
said. Developers are buying lots knowing that the deals do not "make economic 
sense" at current housing prices, but betting that the double-digit price 
increases will make the land a sound investment a few months down the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, people in our business always give their success back in a 
downturn because they anticipate price increases that don't come to pass," 
Fontana said. "When the market turns down, the ones on the edge find themselves 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Both Fontana and Mudge concede that they have guessed wrong over the past year 
or so by refusing to pay San Diego's inflated lot prices. As a result, they 
have cut themselves out of the tremendous profits that their competitors have 
made. "The rising market has cured an awful lot of ills," Fontana said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Buie, president of Buie Corp., a San Diego developer that has seen its 
sales grow from zero to $200 million in five years, made a decision similar to 
Westana's a couple of years ago, deciding to pass on many San Diego land deals, 
and building instead in Riverside County, Nevada and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been more conservative than others because we were worried about 
affordability," Buie said. What worries Buie most is the increasing 
"unaffordability" of entry-level housing in San Diego, making it more difficult 
for people to sell their existing houses to move up to more expensive houses 
such as those Buie sells. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller, more cautious developers such as Westana are also handicapped by the 
fact that more and more developable lots are in the hands of giant land 
developers who expect merchant builders -- developers who buy only finished 
lots as opposed to those who start with raw land -- to accept marginally 
economic land or be dropped from the list of preferred customers. 
</P>
<P>
This is a game that Westana refuses to play, said Mudge and Fontana, both of 
whom are second-generation home builders and who remember San Diego County's 
housing depression in the early 1980s, when builders were stuck with hundreds 
of unsold houses in a high-interest, deflationary market. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a point where we wonder how much more can the market take, how much 
higher can prices go," Mudge said.

HEADQUARTERS FOR AEROJET TO LEAVE S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerojet's corporate headquarters staff, which moved to La Jolla from El Monte 
in 1979, soon will move to Sacramento as part of an "overall cost reduction," 
Aerojet spokesman Tom Sprague said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters move will be accompanied by layoffs for an as-yet undetermined 
number of Aerojet's 72 corporate headquarters employees, Sprague said. Aerojet 
plans to sell or lease its 54,000-square-foot building in La Jolla, and the 
company's acclaimed contemporary art collection will be put up for sale, 
according to Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
Civic leaders on Monday acknowledged that the loss would hurt San Diego, which 
faces the prospect of losing San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's corporate 
headquarters through a proposed merger with Rosemead-based Southern California 
Edison. In recent years, San Diego has lost the corporate headquarters of 
Pacific Southwest Airlines, Signal Co. and Wickes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cost Benefit' 
</P>
<P>
"Moving the headquarters to Sacramento will provide a substantial cost 
benefit," according to a prepared statement by Aerojet President Roger 
Ramseier. "The savings will be realized since Aerojet has available space in 
Sacramento, and (La Jolla-based) headquarters staff spend a substantial amount 
of time traveling to and from that location." 
</P>
<P>
Ramseier described the move as necessary if the company is to remain 
competitive in the defense-contracting arena. More than half of Aerojet's 8,000 
employees already live and work in the Sacramento area, Sprague said. The 
corporate headquarters staff is Aerojet's only operation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet, a defense contractor that specializes in aerospace products, 
previously was known as Aerojet General. The company, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Akron-based Gencorp, does not report profit figures but reported $1 billion 
in 1988 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its Sacramento complex, Aerojet maintains large operations in 
Azusa and Downey, both in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseier, who "was raised in Sacramento, has strong personal ties to that city 
and is committed to returning there," according to San Diego Economic 
Development Corp. President Dan Pegg. 
</P>
<P>
The EDC, a quasi-public organization that is charged with attracting 
corporations and retaining existing companies, "offered to do anything within 
our power to keep (Aerojet) here," Pegg said. "We're terribly sorry to lose a 
good corporate citizen like Aerojet." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor is "obviously disappointed whenever any 
corporate headquarters moves out of San Diego," mayoral spokesman Paul Downey 
said Monday. "But, as we understand it, (Aerojet's) new president lives in the 
Sacramento area and wanted to relocate back to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Any departure hurts, but this situation is obviously not as great as the 
SDG&amp;E situation," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet's La Jolla staff reached a high of about 100 several years ago. 
However, Aerojet cut about 30 staff members at its headquarters building 
shortly after Gencorp, its parent company, was threatened by a hostile takeover 
in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs were part of a restructuring that Gencorp initiated to fend off 
that takeover attempt. As part of that successful restructuring, Gencorp sold 
off its General Tire operation, several broadcast businesses and a bottling 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1987 layoffs, "the building in La Jolla has been too big for us," 
Sprague said. "We're only using about half of it now."

VALLEY EARNINGS: $21-MILLION LOSS IN QUARTER NEGATES TANDON'S '88 PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp., struggling with high advertising costs, soft sales and shortages 
of chips for its personal computers, lost $21.1 million in the fourth quarter 
that ended Dec. 31, wiping out the company's profit for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the year-earlier quarter, the Moorpark-based maker of personal computers 
earned $6.3 million from its continuing operations. For all of 1988, Tandon 
lost $19.9 million, compared to a $17.1-million profit from its 
personal-computer business a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon's sales in the fourth quarter fell 5% to $90.3 million. For all of 1988, 
Tandon's sales increased 7% to $309.3 million from $289.1 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon said European sales, which account for more than 80% of the company's 
revenue, recovered from a soft summer period. But Tandon said it was hurt by 
shortages and high prices for computer chips, which are the "brains" of the 
personal computer. In addition, Tandon said it was hurt by heavy marketing and 
advertising costs as part of an effort to increase its share of the market.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SIERRACIN REPORTS PROFIT DOUBLED IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sierracin Corp. in Sylmar said that its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled 
from a year earlier and that its full-year 1988 earnings rose 54%. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which principally builds cockpit windows and other equipment for 
the aircraft industry, said profit for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 climbed 
to $1.22 million from $530,000, and revenue rose to $21.1 million from $17.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Sierracin said its quarterly profit would have been higher had it not been for 
cost overruns on certain contracts and other operating cost increases. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Sierracin's net income rose to $3.12 million from $2.03 
million, and its annual revenue increased to $82.7 million from $72.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, company Chairman Christoph Tribble and some other executives said 
they were considering making an offer to buy the company.

HEART DRUGS DO EQUALLY WELL IN STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most consuming questions in heart-attack treatment -- which of two 
revolutionary clot-dissolving drugs is preferable -- has received a surprising 
partial answer from one of the first studies to compare the two therapies. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 
that the two competing drugs -- one priced at $2,200 per treatment, the other 
costing one-tenth as much -- are equally effective in preserving the pumping 
power of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
That unexpected conclusion emerged from an examination of 270 patients treated 
with one or the other of the drugs -- a much ballyhooed biotechnology product 
known as TPA and an ordinary enzyme called streptokinase extracted from 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very intriguing and it's an excellent study," said Dr. Eric Topol, a 
University of Michigan associate professor who has done research on TPA. "It's 
going to heat up the controversy one more notch." 
</P>
<P>
The two drugs, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for 
intravenous use, have helped revolutionize the treatment of heart attack, which 
strikes 1.5 million Americans annually when one or more of their coronary 
arteries become blocked. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, physicians were largely unable to intervene to stop a heart attack 
while it was occurring. Instead, they attempted to reduce the patient's chest 
pain and avert other problems that might be prompted by the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The new drugs actually dissolve the clots that lodge in narrowed arteries, 
cutting off blood flow to the heart. Studies suggest that these and other 
clot-dissolving drugs could reduce heart-attack deaths by as much as 50% if 
used within hours of initial symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers disagree, however, on which drug is preferable. TPA appears to 
clear arteries more quickly, but is much more expensive. There have been few 
attempts to directly compare TPA and streptokinase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Is Focus of Study 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the drugs' relative merits, and concern about the rising costs 
of medicine, prompted federal health-care financing officials last year to 
decline for the time being to reimburse hospitals at a higher rate for TPA 
treatment of Medicare patients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the new biology versus the old, the expensive versus the inexpensive," 
Topol said of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of all heart-attack patients are eligible for clot-dissolving 
therapy, currently recommended for use in patients under 75 and within four to 
six hours of the onset of symptoms. Researchers believe that percentage would 
rise with improved public awareness of symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of heart-attack patients actually receiving the therapy is 
believed to be much lower, however, because many small hospitals lack the 
facilities to administer the treatment and because some general practitioners 
are unwilling to use it. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, by researchers in New Zealand, half the 270 patients received 
streptokinase, an enzyme extracted from streptococcus bacteria. The other half 
received TPA, a genetically engineered replica of a protein produced naturally 
in the body. 
</P>
<P>
All of the patients were having their first heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
The two drugs had similar effects on the heart's pumping capacity, measured by 
the percentage of blood ejected on each heartbeat. When measured three weeks 
after treatment, that percentage was 58% in both groups. The norm in healthy 
hearts is 71%, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reopening Arteries 
</P>
<P>
The drugs also were equally effective in reopening clogged arteries, which is 
important in minimizing damage to the heart muscle and the organ's ability to 
pump. Although 10 patients on streptokinase died within 30 days, compared to 
five on TPA, the researchers said the gap was not statistically significant 
because the numbers were so small. 
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand study did not attempt to compare the drugs' effects on 
long-term survival, considered the most important measure of a clot-dissolver's 
effectiveness. Pumping power, however, is considered a powerful predictor of 
survival, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
A larger study, comparing the two drugs in thousands of patients in Western 
Europe, is expected to produce preliminary results in 1990. An even more 
extensive trial examining the two drugs and a third called APSAC is also in the 
works.

YOUR BODY: BAD CALLS IN AN EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the heels of an emergency care crunch in Los Angeles County -- with several 
hospitals curtailing emergency services because of financial problems and 
patient overloads -- comes more dismal news for patients. 
</P>
<P>
The common practice of seeking medical advice by telephone from emergency 
departments can be iffy, researchers suggested recently in the Annals of 
Emergency Medicine, noting that such advice can be inconsistent, inadequate and 
harmful to patients' welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to determine the consistency and accuracy of phone medical advice from 
emergency departments, Dr. Vincent P. Verdile of the University of Pittsburgh 
and his researchers asked an assistant to call 46 emergency departments in 
Western Pennsylvania and present the same scenario: Her 56-year-old father, a 
non-drinking smoker with no history of heart disease, was suffering a bad case 
of indigestion and heartburn. What should she do? 
</P>
<P>
The scenario easily could have been interpreted, the authors note, as a patient 
experiencing myocardial ischemia, in which there is inadequate blood flow to 
the heart. In each case, the caller first asked to speak to a physician. 
</P>
<P>
The results: Only two of 46 emergency departments let her speak to a doctor, 
though each had one on duty at the time. Staff nurses took 40 calls; ward 
clerks or secretaries answered the other four. No one asked to speak to the 
patient; three refused any phone advice, two citing hospital policy. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 20 departments questioned the caller, suggesting they were considering 
heart problems but only four advised the caller to dial 911, call paramedics or 
an ambulance to bring the patient in immediately; 28 departments did suggest 
the patient be brought in, though not necessarily on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen of . . . respondents (32%) instructed the caller to give the patient 
antacids, several after receiving a response from the caller that suggested 
myocardial ischemia was likely," the authors noted. 
</P>
<P>
One department suggested the caller put a nitroglycerin tablet under the 
patient's tongue every five minutes, suggesting that persistent heartburn then 
would rule out a cardiac problem. "When the caller asked what nitroglycerin was 
and how to obtain it, the respondent told the caller to 'Ask any cardiac 
patient; they all have nitroglycerin.' " 
</P>
<P>
A widespread lack of policies governing phone advice from emergency departments 
worsens problems, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Position Statement 
</P>
<P>
The American College of Emergency Physicians, the Dallas, Tex.,-based national 
professional group for emergency physicians that publishes the Annals, now is 
"developing a position statement on phone advice from emergency departments," 
which it expects to issue in June, said Judy Young-Drexler, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumers can try to be their own advocates, said Dr. Joseph Beezy, 
an emergency department physician at Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles. When 
calling emergency departments, "ask to whom you're speaking," he suggested. 
"Try to obtain advice from a physician or an RN. Check the source first. The 
lesson from this study is that when you call an emergency department for advice 
you may not be getting it from a licensed health care provider." 
</P>
<P>
If the problem isn't life-threatening, calling family doctors or pediatricians 
may be a better idea, he added, since they are more likely to know your medical 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Aiding Breast Exams 
</P>
<P>
Monthly breast self-exams long have been recommended by doctors and the 
American Cancer Society as a sound preventive way to detect cancer in its early 
stages. But studies show only a minority of women do the exams; those who 
remember often say they are unsure they're doing them well. 
</P>
<P>
Now, several companies are marketing videotapes, breast model kits and other 
tools designed to help women with the exam. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- MammaCare's "personal learning system," designed for home use, introduced 
in February by Mammatech Corp. of Gainesville, Fla. The $64 kit includes a 
breast model with simulated tumors, a how-to booklet and an interactive 
videotape that guides the viewer through a new breast exam technique developed 
by H. S. Pennypacker, a psychologist at the University of Florida, Gainesville. 
(Information: (800) 626-2273.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Videotapes such as "Breast Self-Exam," seven minutes of instruction 
produced by the Scripps Memorial Hospitals Stevens Cancer Center, La Jolla, 
selling for $10.50. (Information: (800) 248-6848.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sensor Pad, a latex pad with a silicone lubricant designed to be placed 
over the breast to amplify the sense of touch. The "stethoscope for fingers" 
can detect lumps "no bigger than a human hair," claims Earl Wright, vice 
president of Inventive Products Inc., the Decatur, Ill. firm that introduced 
the $14.95 pad nearly a year ago. (Information: (800) 747-2525.) 
</P>
<P>
How necessary are these products, and do they help improve the breast 
self-exam? Here are some experts' opinions: 
</P>
<P>
"It is worthwhile to buy these patient aids and to attend a class," said Dr. 
Richard Dorsay, chief of radiology at Kaiser Permanente, South San Francisco. 
"A brochure is not enough." In his recent study of 459 women, conducted to 
determine the best approach to teaching the exam, he found that women who took 
a class and had a chance to ask questions learned best. 
</P>
<P>
When performing exams, women make common mistakes, he found: "They don't 
examine the entire breast. They use compressions that are too gentle and they 
don't palpate deeply and firmly enough. They pick up their hands and move them, 
and there's a tendency to skip areas that way." 
</P>
<P>
Helene Brown, director of community applications of research for Jonsson Cancer 
Center/UCLA, observed: "I wouldn't spend a penny on learning the breast 
self-exam from any of these commercial ventures." She recommended that women 
simply obtain the cancer society brochure on the exam, adding, "The best 
message we can send out is to get a mammogram (after age 35)." 
</P>
<P>
Another expert's view on the patient aids: "In and of itself, breast self-exam 
has not made a major impact in early detection of breast cancer," said Dr. R. 
James Brenner, chief, mammography section, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los 
Angeles. Still, he said that by focusing on the problem of breast cancer, the 
aids may encourage women to "participate regularly in screening mammography," 
the breast X-rays also recommended to detect cancer.

AN ACTIVIST GROUP FOR THE '80S AIMS TO 'SHAME PEOPLE INTO ACTION'

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Staley, a $200,000-a-year bond trader, was on his way to work on Wall 
Street one morning when he ran across a group of boisterous demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Many carried black signs bearing pink triangles -- the symbol of Nazi 
oppression of homosexuals -- and the words "SILENCE = DEATH." Others dramatized 
their rage at the slow testing of potential drugs for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by "hanging" an effigy of U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration chief Dr. Frank Young. A handful blocked traffic on lower 
Broadway and were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"ACT UP! FIGHT BACK! FIGHT AIDS!" the 250 men and women shouted. "ACT UP! FIGHT 
BACK! FIGHT AIDS!" 
</P>
<P>
"That night, when I turned on the TV, I was blown away by how they were able to 
transmit their anger to an entire nation," said Staley, diagnosed with an 
AIDS-related condition in 1985. "I decided that these were my people." 
</P>
<P>
That was two years ago. Staley, 28, since has left Wall Street to become the 
unpaid fund-raising chairman of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, a 
burgeoning alliance of elite professionals and street activists "united in 
anger and committed to direct action to end the AIDS crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The group includes art directors who design eye-catching posters, television 
producers who teach demonstrators to talk in "sound bites" and lawyers who 
defend group members arrested for acts of civil disobedience. There is even a 
pharmaceutical chemist, Dr. Iris Long, who critically analyzes research 
protocols for clinical trials of experimental drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Fight to Streets 
</P>
<P>
At a time when other AIDS groups lobby quietly behind the scenes or tend to 
dying patients, ACT UP is taking the AIDS battle into the streets. Its members 
say they are fed up with a system they are convinced is not doing all it can to 
prevent the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Its activities range from guerrilla theater -- tossing condoms at officials who 
oppose safe-sex education, say, or staging "die-ins" at offices of companies 
making exorbitant priced drugs -- to elaborately choreographed acts of civil 
disobedience like last week's siege of New York's City Hall, where 200 were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP has supporters and detractors among other AIDS activist groups and the 
public. Critics say its tactics may do as much harm as good by alienating 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not out to make friends," Staley said. "We are out to shame people into 
action." 
</P>
<P>
As the movement has grown, it has come to encompass women, blacks and Latinos, 
as well as the gay white men who launched the group two years ago. "We have 
tapped into the fear, anger and grief surrounding the epidemic, and have turned 
it into action," said Avram Finkelstein, the art director who designed ACT UP's 
SILENCE = DEATH logo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life-and-Death Stakes 
</P>
<P>
It is as if the passion and activism of the '60s have been updated for the 
careerist and entrepreneurial decade of the '80s. And it all comes with an 
intensity of energy that could only be justified by the life-or-death stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I am getting tired of candlelight vigils when, in fact, blow torches may be 
necessary," said Mark Sikorowski, 37, a managing partner of a New York design 
firm. Actually, while ACT UP members court arrest, the group eschews violence, 
preferring nonviolent civil disobedience in the Gandhi tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Before last week's demonstration in New York, its biggest action occurred in 
October, when demonstrators surrounded and shut the FDA headquarters in 
Rockville, Md., and 187 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Born, appropriately, in New York City, ACT UP now has chapters in two dozen 
cities and perhaps 5,000 adherents who regularly attend meetings and take part 
in its actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Change System 
</P>
<P>
"We come from the system that we are trying to change," explained Ken Woodard, 
an art director for DDB Needham Worldwide who designs advertisements for 
Volkswagen and Seagrams by day and for ACT UP by night. 
</P>
<P>
Though of the system, ACT UP's members work within and outside the system to 
achieve group goals. ACT UP's initial goal was to increase availability of 
experimental treatments to people with AIDS and those infected with the virus. 
More recently, the group has sought better prevention and treatment services 
from cities like New York. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard's latest creation for ACT UP, which ran as a full-page ad in last 
week's Village Voice, is an arresting portrait of New York Mayor Edward I. Koch 
in front of a sea of graves. "What does Koch plan to do about AIDS?" the ad 
asks. "Invest in marble and granite." 
</P>
<P>
Koch has drawn the activists' ire for refusing to meet with them in the 
epidemic's early years and for presiding over a crumbling health-care system in 
which patients must sometimes wait days for a bed in overcrowded hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact of the Group 
</P>
<P>
While ACT UP has been unable to bring forth a cure for AIDS, whose death toll 
is approaching 50,000 in this country, some of its chapters around the country 
have started to have an impact: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Los Angeles, the County Board of Supervisors voted to speed creation of 
a 20-bed AIDS ward at County-USC Medical Center after ACT UP staged a 
seven-day, around-the-clock vigil at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In San Francisco, producers of the television drama "Midnight Caller" 
revised a script after ACT UP disrupted filming an episode that activists 
claimed would incite violence against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Boston, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. reversed its policy 
and began paying for treatments of aerosol pentamidine to prevent pneumocystis 
pneumonia, the biggest killer of AIDS patients, after ACT UP members blocked an 
entrance at the insurer's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And in New York, a sit-in at the offices of a Japanese pharmaceutical firm 
ensured that supplies of a potentially promising anti-viral drug sold over the 
counter in Japan would continue to flow to the U.S. The group's ubiquitous 
posters and stickers have also forced into the public consciousness an epidemic 
that most New Yorkers would rather not think about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Altered AIDS Debate 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, ACT UP has helped to alter terms of the national 
debate on AIDS. "We have refocused the discussion to the rights of people with 
AIDS to gain access to drugs and decent health care," said Ann Northrop, a 
former CBS News producer and ACT UP member who trains fellow activists to 
deliver pithy sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, earlier this year, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National 
Institute on Allergies and Infectious Diseases, took the unprecedented step of 
publicly urging the FDA to ease its restrictions on a pair of drugs that appear 
to prevent AIDS patients from going blind. 
</P>
<P>
"You had Tony Fauci, the nation's top AIDS official, sounding like ACT UP," 
said Steve Morin, an aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has also unveiled reforms aimed at speeding drugs to critically ill 
patients, though activists claim the changes are largely cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
Though mainstream AIDS groups sometimes cringe at ACT UP's confrontational 
tactics, especially its penchant for personal attacks, they generally support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"The people with the power to change things must be made to know the extent of 
the anger and sadness and frustration," said Dr. Mathilde Krim, the founding 
chair of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. "In a democracy, it is 
almost a necessity, a duty, to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rocks the Boat' 
</P>
<P>
Urvashi Vaid, communications director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task 
Force, added: "There's a certain complacency that sets in as the epidemic 
drones on and on. ACT UP rocks the boat, and that is good. But tactics that 
confront and provoke can alienate too." 
</P>
<P>
FDA chief Young -- who was hanged in effigy at ACT UP's first rally two years 
ago -- has mixed feelings about the group. "On one hand, seeing demonstrators 
can make people realize some of the deep, deep concerns," he said. "I worry, on 
the other hand, that scientific decisions won't be made objectively if they are 
subjected to political pressure. And that might slow things down." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he fully understands the demands of AIDS patients and people 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus for access to experimental 
drugs. "I had a melanoma myself. If it ever mestatasizes (spreads), do I want 
to have access to experimental drugs? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP traces its roots to March 10, 1987, when playwright and activist Larry 
Kramer delivered a fiery speech to about 70 people at the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Center as part of its monthly speakers series. He had long felt that 
the gay community's political energy was being sapped by grief and denial. His 
goal was to shatter denial about with the magnitude of the epidemic -- with a 
sledgehammer, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of this room could be dead within five years," Kramer thundered. 
"How many dead brothers have to be piled up in front of your faces in a heap 
before you learn to fight back and scream and yell and demand and take some 
responsibility for your own lifes?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politicized Gay Men 
</P>
<P>
While Kramer supplied the rhetoric, art director Finkelstein had begun a 
separate effort to politicize gay men using visual imagery. He and a group of 
five friends came up with the idea of using the pink triangle, which 
homosexuals were forced to wear in Hitler's concentration camps, over the words 
SILENCE = DEATH. 
</P>
<P>
When Finkelstein's group learned about ACT UP, the two groups joined forces. 
ACT UP printed 1,000 SILENCE = DEATH buttons for $160 and sold them for $1 
apiece, clearing an $840 profit, "enough to finance a good-sized demo," 
Finkelstein noted with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The logo has turned out to be quite marketable," said Staley, the former Wall 
Street bond trader. "We've put it on T-shirts, sweat shirts and, now, tank 
tops." 
</P>
<P>
Staley has used his financial acumen to build ACT UP into a $300,000 a year 
group, deriving roughly equal amounts from merchandising, direct mail and 
benefits and foundation grants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More New Members 
</P>
<P>
The group is constantly renewing itself with new members. In New York, about 
4,000 people are on ACT UP's mailing list and 300 to 400 attend its weekly 
meetings, where chaos often reigns; ACT UP has no president or board of 
directors and tries to operate by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting are sometimes punctuated by the announcement that a member has died, 
reminding people why they are there. 
</P>
<P>
"I am HIV-positive," said Gregg Bordowitz, who trains ACT UP members for civil 
disobedience, "and I feel, very simply, that a war is being played out in my 
body. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways I can wrest power from that situation is to literally put my 
body on the line, to be arrested. So let them drag me through the streets, take 
my fingerprints, put me in court. Because I am not going away."

JACK SMITH: GIRDING UP TO LOIN TO TALK NEW YORKESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My recent essay on New York talk, as derived from "How to Speak New Yorkese," 
by Judy Levine and Nancy Jackson, has got some New Yorkers (or former New 
Yorkers) talking back. 
</P>
<P>
"When will the odious comparisons between Angelenos and New Yorkers by local 
journalists cease?" asks Joseph Di Gianni. "As a native New Yorker residing in 
this town (Los Angeles) I find being subjected to constant statements and petty 
remarks about my former home an indication of how provincial Los Angeles 
remains in spite of its burgeoning growth. If Los Angeles is truly poised to 
overtake the preeminence of New York (alluded to in Mr. Smith's article) its 
citizenry should try to eschew the xenophobic attitudes which are 
embarrassingly prevalent even in the most sophisticated quarters." 
</P>
<P>
Surely anyone sophisticated enough to use words like xenophobic and eschew is 
sophisticated enough to take a little innocent ribbing about his birthplace. 
After all, no city on Earth has inspired so much literary abuse over the 
decades as Los Angeles, and much of it originated in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It began back in 1913 when the sophisticated Willard Huntington Wright 
described Los Angeles in Smart Set magazine as being settled by yokels from the 
Midwest -- "yokels who were nourished by rural pieties and superstitions and 
had a righteous abhorrence of shapely legs, late dinners, malt liquors, grand 
opera and hussies." 
</P>
<P>
To quote from a previous essay of mine: "Ever since those words were published 
Mr. Wright's rococo and sardonic style has been echoed, imitated and 
plagiarized by almost every journalist who has come this way. Oddly, though, 
the coin has been turned. We no longer are accused of piety, abstinence and 
righteousness, but of their opposites. No matter, the indictment is still 
delivered in the same tone of moral and intellectual superiority." 
</P>
<P>
The syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler flailed away in his own hyperbolic 
style: "It is hereby earnestly proposed that the U.S.A. would be much better 
off if that big, sprawling, incoherent, shapeless, slobbering civic idiot, the 
city of Los Angeles, could be declared incompetent and placed in charge of a 
guardian." 
</P>
<P>
I am not angered by such verbal assaults. To have inspired such vilification is 
one of the charms of living here. I have never responded in kind; and a little 
innocent merriment of the kind provided by Levine and Jackson's amiable little 
book is hardly "xenophobia." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously all New Yorkers don't say "don't ax" for "don't ask," or call that 
island southeast of Manhattan "Lawn Guyland," or say "boat" for "both." 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who has ever visited New York could hear some echoes of New York 
street talk in Levine and Jackson's book. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Elfer of Whittier notes that Angelenos have their own speech 
idiosyncrasies. "There are many other speech patterns which add color and help 
prevent the homogenization of America. And most of all, the sun doesn't rise 
and set on L.A. alone. Adam and Eve were not natives here." 
</P>
<P>
If they were still living, though, I'll bet they'd be retired here. They would 
probably have loved hot tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Troxey Kemper complained that I said New Yorkers say "close 
horse" instead of "clotheshorse." "He seems to be saying 'close' as in 'close 
the door.' New Yorkers say 'close horse' as in 'close encounters of the third 
kind.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another former New Yorker, Sherry Terzian, was more amused than annoyed, though 
she scolded me for doubting that there are any former New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
"About our lingo," she says, "when I was a graduate student at Columbia 
University, I found myself in the unexpected role of interpreter for my 
classmates. 'Whaddidhesay? Whaddidhesay?' someone from the hinterland would ask 
me while confronted with the twists and twangs of a New Englander." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marvin H. Leaf notes that I overlooked "one salient characteristic of Big 
Apple jargon (shared, interestingly enough, by the late J.F.K. and such 
cultured Britons as ubiquitous radio commentator Michael Jackson): the 
consistent insertion of an extraneous r between a word ending in a vowel and 
another beginning with same, such as 'Californiarindustry' or 'TulsarOklahoma.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Another New York native, Fred Hillegas, of Scottsdale, Ariz., recalls a 
Syracuse (N.Y.) lawyer who studied law at Brooklyn Law College. 
</P>
<P>
"His name is Earl Boyle, and he'd chuckle as he told how fellow students at 
Brooklyn always pronounced his name 'Oil Berl." 
</P>
<P>
But it's a great place to visit.

'TOUR OF DUTY' PROBES RACISM IN THE RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After returning from Vietnam in the late 1960s, Stephen Philip Smith, now a 
writer-producer on CBS-TV's "Tour of Duty," found himself stationed at Ft. 
Benning, Ga. There, he ran into some friends he'd met in Vietnam -- and one 
day, he and one of those friends headed for nearby Phenix City, Ala., to have a 
drink at a local bar. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived, Smith was told he could have a drink -- and that his friend 
could go around back and wait for him. Smith is white and his friend was black. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like such a horrendous thing, that they could send this guy over 
there to die -- and he almost did get killed in Vietnam -- and still he could 
come back here and not be able to get a drink because he was black," Smith 
recalled in a recent conversation, shaking his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
It was that incident, Smith said, that prompted him 20 years later to write 
"The Promised Land," a "Tour of Duty" episode exploring the effect of the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination on race relations among troops in 
Vietnam. The episode airs at 8 tonight on Channels 2 and 8, on the 21st 
anniversary of King's death. (Coincidentally, TV's other Vietnam series, ABC's 
"China Beach," will focus on the same subject in its April 12 episode, also 
titled "The Promised Land.") 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you don't want to forget -- you want people to remember that kind of 
stuff happened," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Tour of Duty" episode, King's death shakes the platoon at about the 
same time a black soldier sacrifices his life by throwing his body over a live 
grenade to save his compatriots. Before his death, the soldier had requested 
that, in the event of his death, his best friend, Sgt. Zeke Anderson (Terence 
Knox), escort his body home. Anderson faces the wrath of his friend's 
brother-in-law in the United States when he arrives and the family discovers 
Anderson is white. 
</P>
<P>
The story also looks at the inner conflict of a black lieutenant (played by 
Randy Brooks) assigned to keep the troops in line despite their anger and 
disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who served in the 1st Cavalry Division in 1966 as a helicopter door 
gunner and personnel clerk and is the author of the 1975 novel "American Boys," 
was not in Vietnam when King was shot. But he researched the subject and found 
to his surprise that, while the Army feared a revolt, black soldiers reacted 
quietly to the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"Things went back to normal without the kind of unrest there was here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Smith still saw King's assassination as an opportunity to depict 
racial strife in Vietnam, a topic rarely dealt with in "Tour of Duty." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we have a squad of guys who are both black and white and they 
get along very well -- that's necessary for the show, to have it go forward," 
he said. "But it's also anachronistic in a way. Because you did get along, but 
you didn't get along. Our guys sacrifice for each other, but often that wasn't 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there's a chance to show that deep tension, both there and back in 
the States, you want to do it."

PICKETS BLOCK DELIVERY OF OPERA SCENERY 
</P>

Members of a local stagehands union refused Monday to cross a picket line set 
up by wig makers and makeup artists, throwing in doubt the April 15 opening of 
the San Diego Opera's production of "Madama Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
The five pickets outside the San Diego Civic Theater on Monday were protesting 
the opera's withdrawal of their 1989 season contracts. The opera also is named 
in an unfair labor practices petition the group filed Jan. 5 with the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 stagehands at the Civic Theater refused to unload scenery from a 
trailer-tractor rig when they saw the pickets set up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a legal (picket) line," said stagehand Bruce McCoy, a member of San Diego 
Local 122, Stagehands, of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage 
and Employees. "We should honor it." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, a spokesman for the National Labor Relations Board said 
the NLRB plans to file a temporary injunction in U. S. District Court on 
Tuesday, requiring the opera company to offer the five wig makers and makeup 
artists the employment contracts that the opera company allegedly withdrew Dec. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera General Director Ian Campbell on Monday called the picket line 
"a transparent effort outside the legal system." 
</P>
<P>
"It should come as no surprise that IATSE Make-Up Artists and Hairstylists, 
Local 706, of Los Angeles, feels so little confidence in the correctness of its 
position that it has resorted to picketing in an effort to force the opera's 
San Diego employees to stop work," Campbell said in the statement read by a 
spokeswoman. "They don't mention that pay lost by other workers who honor their 
picket line will be lost forever," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out here defending the whole issue," said picket Paul Best, who before 
the 1989 season headed the San Diego Opera's makeup and wig department. "We'll 
picket as long as it takes, as long as the IATSE tells us." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Opera stated in a news release Friday that it would defend itself 
against the unfair labor practice charges, saying employment offers to three 
individuals "were rejected and the contracts were returned unsigned." 
</P>
<P>
Best and other former employees of the opera's makeup and wig department claim 
that the opera's production director ordered them to return the contracts 
unsigned before they could accept or reject them. Instead of using Best and 
other local workers, the opera hired Elsen Associates, a New York company, to 
provide wigs for the current season. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary injunction is being sought because "there is reasonable cause to 
believe the opera violated the law," said NLRB investigator Steven Sorensen. 
Also, an NLRB spokesman in San Diego said, a motion will be filed asking the 
court to speed up the normal procedures to allow the matter to be heard before 
the last scheduled performance of the opera season April 26. 
</P>
<P>
The scenery for "Madama Butterfly" was supposed to be loaded into the theater 
Monday and today. The first rehearsal using the scenery was scheduled for 
Wednesday, an opera spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dilts, an opera spokeswoman, said the company does not think the April 15 
opening will be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anticipating a problem," Dilts said. "We're expecting this to be 
settled by then."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: BALANCING THE UPS, DOWNS 
OF MUSICAL COMPETITIONS 
</P>

The spring season may occasion many things, but musical competitions tend to 
sprout as densely as crab grass after a heavy spring rain. One of the area's 
more venerable competitions, the La Jolla Civic-University Symphony's Young 
Artists Competition, takes place this weekend at UC San Diego. Now in its 34th 
year, the annual competition for young musicians who live or study in San Diego 
County boasts a number of past winners whose careers have fulfilled the promise 
of these early accolades. 
</P>
<P>
The list of past winners includes concert pianist Gregory Allen, San Diego 
Symphony assistant concertmaster Nicholas Grant, tenor Jose Medina, who sang 
with Joan Sutherland in Pacific Opera's "Norma" last month, and pianist Kenneth 
Bookstein. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who won the La Jolla competition in 1966, went on to win second prize in 
Belgium's Queen Elisabeth Competition in 1978 and grand prize in the 1980 
Arthur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv. Allen has balanced his subsequent 
performing career -- concerts with the Israel Philharmonic and San Francisco 
Symphony, as well as recitals at the Kennedy Center and Ambassador Auditorium 
-- with teaching at the University of Texas at Austin. Locally, he has 
performed with the San Diego Symphony. Last month, he gave a solo recital at 
Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone last week at his university music studio, he spoke about 
winning the La Jolla competition as an aspiring 17-year-old musician. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first competition, although I had won some Musical Merit Foundation 
scholarships that same year. The winners' concert for the La Jolla competition 
was the first professional orchestra that I had ever played a concerto with." 
</P>
<P>
Allen recalled that he played Mendelssohn's G Minor Piano Concerto, a work 
which has long since fallen out of his repertory. He continued to beat the 
competition trail until his final triumph in the Rubinstein Competition. As a 
teacher, Allen encourages his piano students to consider the competition route, 
though he does have reservations about the process. 
</P>
<P>
"From my own experience, I felt that entering a competition was like being in 
horse race. There was a time when competitions had a negative influence on my 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
He described what he calls the competition player's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of aggressiveness, an extra musical chip on the shoulder. In terms 
of playing, it is a gratuitous emphasis on fast and loud -- something that is 
easy to fall into." 
</P>
<P>
Allen was quick to admit, however, that competitions did spur him on to greater 
musical accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I won the Rubinstein, I had learned to treat the jury simply as 
part of the audience. I coach my own students that they can't second-guess the 
jury. The judges will sense if a flashy interpretation is being superimposed on 
the performance for their benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Farewell to the Fisch Competition. Three years ago, Gregory Allen returned to 
San Diego to serve on the panel of judges for the first Joseph Fisch Piano 
Competition, held at San Diego State University. After three competitions, 
Fisch, a local arts patron and enthusiast, has decided to discontinue the 
competition. According to SDSU music faculty member Karen Follingstad, Fisch 
decided instead to underwrite a summer music camp for deserving high-school 
pianists. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen young pianists will be chosen for the mid-July music institute, which 
will be held at SDSU. Follingstad said she and the other members of the piano 
faculty were unsuccessful in their attempts to persuade Fisch to continue 
supporting the competition. She admitted, however, that the summer institute 
would help the university in recruiting freshman students into the music 
department. 
</P>
<P>
They met him in St. Louis. Tom Morgan, the San Diego Symphony's acting 
assistant principal viola, returned to his hometown just outside St. Louis, 
Mo., as a soloist last month. With violinist Rebecca Boyer, Morgan soloed in 
Mozart's "Sinfonia Concertante," K. 364, with the University City Symphony, a 
community orchestra that performs at St. Louis' Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, which included Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony and three of Dvorak's 
Slavonic Dances, was a family affair. Morgan's father, Robert, observed his 
son's performance from the cello section of the orchestra. An engineer by 
profession, the senior Morgan took up the cello about 12 years ago and is a 
regular member of the University City Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting the Phantom. Gregory Hirsch, San Diego Opera's director of 
productions, won a San Francisco Bay Area Critics' Circle award for his 
lighting design in Ken Hill's "Phantom of the Opera." This satirical stage 
production -- not to be confused with the Andrew Lloyd Webber extravaganza -- 
opened last September at San Francisco's Theater on the Square and is still 
running strong. 
</P>
<P>
More Opera Leaks. When San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell came home 
from his trip to the Soviet Union a few days before Easter, he brought with him 
some disappointing news. Noted mezzo-soprano Elana Obraztsova will not be 
singing in San Diego's production of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov." Her 
replacement in the local company's grand-opening salvo for the mayor's Soviet 
Arts Festival is Irina Bogacheva, a regular of Leningrad's Kirov Opera.

PROSECUTOR SUSPENDED; LED PROBE OF ALLEGED MAFIOSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal prosecutor who headed a controversial investigation into a reputed 
organized crime figure's business ties to MCA Inc. has been suspended from his 
job and barred from his office at the Los Angeles organized crime strike force, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Rudnick, who had been at odds with his Justice Department superiors 
since 1987 over the Salvatore Pisello-MCA investigation, was notified last 
Thursday that he has been placed on paid leave pending a decision on whether to 
fire him, according to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
Rudnick was called into the office of strike force chief John L. Newcomer, 
ordered to hand over his keys to the office and then escorted out of the 
Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials refused to confirm the report, calling it a 
"personnel matter," and Rudnick's lawyer said he was warned by department 
officials in Washington not to make any statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been, I guess you could say, warned by the Justice Department in 
Washington not to make any statement about this, and we intend to abide by 
that," said the attorney, Michael L. Kadish. 
</P>
<P>
Rudnick, 41, has been the subject of an internal Justice Department inquiry 
stemming from his handling of a strike force investigation into Pisello's 
business dealings with MCA Records from 1983 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, MCA lawyers met with top officials of the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles and later hired an influential Washington attorney to 
contact the top leadership of the Justice Department's organized crime and 
racketeering section about Rudnick's handling of the investigation, which they 
characterized as irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
After complaints from MCA that the prosecutor was maligning the company with 
unsupported organized crime allegations, Rudnick's superiors reportedly ordered 
him to limit the investigation to allegations that Pisello had evaded taxes on 
his income from MCA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted of Tax Evasion 
</P>
<P>
Pisello, who has been identified by the FBI as a member of New York's Gambino 
crime family, was convicted last year of evading taxes on more than $300,000 in 
income earned in a series of transactions with MCA's records division. Rudnick 
tried the case under Newcomer's close supervision. 
</P>
<P>
None of the MCA executives who dealt with Pisello were charged with any 
wrongdoing. All said they had been unaware of Pisello's alleged Mafia ties, 
which he himself has vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
According to a variety of federal sources, the Justice Department's office of 
professional responsibility opened an investigation to determine, among other 
things, whether Rudnick had violated federal grand jury secrecy laws by 
publicly revealing that top MCA executives had notified him of their intention 
to exercise their 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if called 
to testify about the Pisello case. 
</P>
<P>
The office's findings have not been made public, but sources close to the probe 
have said the report supported Rudnick on the grand jury secrecy issue. The 
report did, however, conclude that Rudnick has been insubordinate with his 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, sources said, Newcomer handed Rudnick a one-page letter signed by 
Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., acting assistant attorney general for the department's 
criminal division. Attached to the letter was a memorandum to Dennis from David 
Margolis, chief of the Justice Department's organized crime unit, which stated, 
in effect, that Rudnick had not been following orders from Newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to notify you that you are being placed in a temporary non-duty status 
with pay effective immediately upon your receipt of this letter for the period 
of time necessary to consider and resolve the accompanying proposal to remove 
you from federal service," said the letter, the contents of which were read to 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rudnick may be entitled to an internal hearing, some sources said, and is 
expected to seek help from current and former Justice Department attorneys, 
some of whom have told The Times they believe he is being "railroaded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Barbaric and Unconscionable' 
</P>
<P>
John DuBois, a former strike force attorney who worked with Rudnick on the 
Pisello case, said he does not believe Rudnick did anything wrong. "Their 
action is barbaric and unconscionable," he said of the decision to suspend 
Rudnick. 
</P>
<P>
Rudnick has prosecuted a number of high-profile white-collar crime cases during 
his 13-year government career. He has been a special attorney with the Los 
Angeles strike force for the last nine years. Rudnick is married to Times staff 
writer Kathryn Harris.

L. Soble.

ILLEGAL HOUSING IS CITED BY CITY INSPECTORS

Miguel Torres showed off the illegal garage dwelling to Los Angeles building 
inspectors Monday as if he were guiding a model home tour. 
</P>
<P>
In order to rent out his home for $450 a month, he had converted his two-car 
garage on 111th Street in South-Central Los Angeles into three rooms -- 
bathroom, bedroom and living room -- for his family of seven. Torres proudly 
pointed out the bootlegged plumbing and electrical outlets -- work of his hands 
done to convert a shelter for automobiles into a home for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing I want to hide," said Torres, 42, a gas station attendant. 
"This is the best I can provide." 
</P>
<P>
But his best is illegal and possibly dangerous, inspectors told him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action by the City 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Torres was among the first of about 60 property owners to be cited 
in the city's first attempt in more than 20 years to crack down on building and 
safety code violations in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program in the 8th Council District, which is expected to take 
several months, began quietly with four inspectors walking from house to house 
in a two-block area, peering into back yards and scanning houses for building 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family houses -- mostly small, wood-framed stucco homes -- lined the 
area surveyed Monday. About half passed muster. They were generally neatly 
kept, adorned with flower gardens and trim lawns. 
</P>
<P>
At the others, Supervising Building Inspector Heikes Powell and his four-man 
crew found abandoned automobiles parked in the yards or out front on the 
street. Several car engines were spotted in overgrown weeds on front lawns. 
Some driveways and patios looked like junk yards, a violation of city laws that 
prohibit open storage of debris. 
</P>
<P>
One vacant lot had become a dumping ground for old appliances and damaged 
furniture. Another lot served as grounds for a squatter in a trailer, a man who 
told inspectors he didn't know who owned the land. 
</P>
<P>
Sagging roofs, crumbling cement walkways and broken windows were noted by 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Powell became intrigued by a two-story back yard structure in the 
framing stages. When he looked in the back, he saw that the do-it-yourself home 
builder had left exposed electrical wiring and the posts and beams were tilting 
to one side. Each stair was about two feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to catch these things early before this guy goes any further," 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell's crew also spotted four garages that had been illegally converted into 
housing -- a violation city officials said will be the most difficult to solve. 
</P>
<P>
In a city staggering under a shortage of affordable homes and waves of poor 
immigrants, the garages, estimated at 42,000 in Los Angeles County, have become 
the shelter of last resort. But they are illegal, usually dangerous and often 
unfit for human habitation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
As the inspectors made their way down 110th and 111th streets, many residents 
and passers-by glared at them. But the handful of residents who were at home to 
answer the inspector's knock appeared to be supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand what they are trying to do. There are quite a few houses around 
here that need fixing," said Marvin Thompson, a homeowner with a ramshackle 
garage that is weakened and leaning. "In a way it's cool, as long as they don't 
force you to do it right away and give you a loan." 
</P>
<P>
As the building inspectors wrote up a notice for Thompson, ordering him to fix 
the garage, he said he had already applied for a $40,000 no-interest loan to 
repair it as well as remodel his 40-year-old house. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, property owners will be sent letters detailing the 
violations and ordering them to comply with the law. Property owners will be 
offered low-interest or no-interest loans and ample time to do the repairs, 
said Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, who pushed for the pilot 
program in his district. 
</P>
<P>
If the violations are not corrected, property owners could face misdemeanor or 
felony charges, depending on the magnitude of the hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what will happen to the illegally converted garages, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can help me," garage dweller Torres said. "If the city tells us we 
have to move out of the garage I don't know what we will do. I need to rent the 
house to support my family." 
</P>

AN ASSAULT ON URBAN BLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CITY INSPECTOR NOW WARS AGAINST A DOMESTIC ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The night before the Allied invasion of Normandy, Milford Bliss parachuted 
behind enemy lines. After the war, he spent some time traveling around a Europe 
in ruins. Whole towns "just flattened," he recalled. "It changes your 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer Bliss returned to see a continent rebuilt. Buildings that were 200 
to 300 years old were repaired so they were as sturdy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
As a Los Angeles building inspector for 41 years, Bliss has seen a different 
sort of destruction at home: urban blight, communities victimized by neglect 
and apathy. But to him, the postwar reconstruction of Europe is a model for 
what the bureau of city inspectors he heads might be able to accomplish in the 
decaying neighborhoods of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors fanned out Monday through South-Central Los Angeles in search of 
shoddy and substandard housing, citing a new "community-based" approach to 
monitoring housing conditions around the city. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach was adopted after criticism by the City Council almost two 
years ago that inspection efforts were too slow and unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, the Community Safety Bureau of the Department of Building and 
Safety was revamped and expanded to keep pace with a soaring number of 
residential property violations. Complaints of illegal and unregulated 
construction had doubled in the previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
About $2 million was spent to hire 40 inspectors and station them in different 
areas of the city. Before then, inspectors were based downtown and drove to 
their areas -- and drove back again at the end of the day. Now they work in 
those communities and, in many cases, also live there, Bliss said. 
</P>
<P>
"It made a hell of a lot of difference," he said. "Suddenly they're interested 
in Watts; it's not just a miserable neighborhood. . . . This is their territory 
and they'd like to take care of it too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22 Offices and Growing 
</P>
<P>
Now 105 inspectors work out of 22 offices, with more scheduled to open. 
Complaints are answered in days, not weeks, Bliss said. Investigations have 
increased almost threefold. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been pretty much a reactionary bureau for many years," said Frank 
Kroeger, chief of the Building and Safety Department. "The council said it 
wasn't getting the job done. (Now) we're going to deliver the right kind of 
product." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Bliss said, the idea is to inspire residents to maintain their own 
neighborhoods, to develop a sense of pride and not tolerate blatant violations. 
</P>
<P>
Blight grows house by house, he said, until a whole neighborhood has decayed. 
"When you lose one, you lose all," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But the 68-year-old city official said that, in his experience, the traditional 
punitive approach -- sometimes called "find them and fine them" -- doesn't work 
too well. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't come in with a bunch of hard-hitting jackboot types," he said. "I 
don't like to threaten. I like to convince." 
</P>
<P>
Convince people, that is, that property values will go up and life will be more 
pleasant if safety threats and eyesores are removed. At the same time, the 
inspectors must take the onus off people living in squalor and hold the 
landlords responsible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bliss said, when the city learns that people are living in garages 
illegally converted into housing, the city should not simply throw the tenants 
into the streets.

Compromise Measure 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal being worked on by Councilman Robert Farrell, the owner of a 
converted garage would have to pay for improvements to make the structure safe 
to live in. Bliss said such a measure would be a stopgap until some sort of 
long-term affordable housing can be found. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of people living in garages, living in a sub-habitable 
environment," he said. "But it should be to minium housing standards. It should 
be healthy." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could make some of these places habitable and safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bliss, who was placed in charge of the bureau when it was reorganized, has had 
his inspectors meet with neighborhood leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working with them quite a bit," said Rick Ruiz, an aide to 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. The goal is to not let neighborhoods become 
problems, he said. "If you stay on top of it you can avoid problems that happen 
after years of neglect." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like any other disease," he said, "if you catch it quickly you can save 
it; if you let it go, you have to amputate."

PARENTS SAY 23 JORDAN STUDENTS RECEIVED 'F' GRADES AS RETALIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 23 Jordan High School students were given Fs in many classes last 
semester in "retaliation" for charges that the school was unsafe and 
academically unsound, a group of parents alleged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Charges that the Los Angeles Unified School District has "illegally retaliated" 
against the students were made in a complaint filed Monday with the U.S. 
Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The students who received the failing grades had remained out of school for 
months because they said they were afraid of gang attacks and had requested 
transfers to other schools that they considered safer. In granting the 
transfers, district officials said they wanted to help the students get back in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents were really outraged" when they received the report cards with the 
failing grades a few weeks ago, said Leslie Dutton, president of the American 
Assn. of Women, a Santa Monica-based organization that has been supporting the 
parents. "(The school) could have given them an incomplete (instead). To have 
these fails go on their record . . . this is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The school never tried to find out why the students were absent, Dutton added. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Principal Grace B. Strauther said: "I'm sure some of them (the students) 
got some failing grades." But she could not say how many had received Fs or 
give the exact reason why the low marks may have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diana Munatones denied that the district has retaliated in 
any way against the students or their parents. "Every action the district has 
taken was to accommodate students and see to their welfare," she said. "The 
failing grades were not retaliation. . . . It is inappropriate to keep students 
out of school for any extended length of time." 
</P>
<P>
Strauther said district policy forbids giving Fs for absences alone. But it 
does allow a teacher to issue an F if a student consistently fails to turn in 
class work or make up assignments that were missed. 
</P>
<P>
A student who plans a prolonged absence, such as for medical reasons, can 
request that class work be sent home. But "to my knowledge," Strauther said, 
"we did not get requests from those parents for work at home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slander Complaint 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, comments in the media by district officials have 
slandered the students and parents who sought transfers out of Jordan, which is 
in Watts. The district denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second civil rights complaint the parents have brought against the 
district and the school since February. 
</P>
<P>
The first complaint alleged that the district discriminates against black 
students at Jordan High by providing an unsafe and academically inferior 
environment. The American Assn. of Women helped 23 students who said they were 
afraid to attend Jordan obtain transfers to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dutton, the new schools that the students were transferred to are 
helping them make up credits.

EX-UCLA ATHLETE'S SENTENCING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sentencing of Darrell Allums -- the former UCLA basketball player convicted 
last month of robbing eight Domino's Pizza deliverymen -- was postponed Monday 
until May 15 at the request of Allums' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old athlete who spent nearly two years in County Jail awaiting 
trial could be sentenced to up to 13 years more in state prison when he returns 
to Torrance Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Allums is expected to ask that any incarceration be in a drug rehabilitation 
center rather than in state prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Frances J. Sulman. 
Defense attorney J. Patrick Maginnis declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Allums apparently robbed the Domino's deliverymen to raise money for cocaine, a 
county probation reports says.

 MAN ARMED AT BUSH RALLY SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A paralegal worker who plotted a "symbolic assassination" of President Bush 
just before the November election was sentenced Monday to time served for 
bringing a starter pistol to a Bush rally in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
John Arthur Junot was sentenced to four months in prison, but he faces 
immediate release because he has already served five months. He was also 
ordered to pay a $250 fine and $1,000 to cover the cost of his three-year 
supervision after his release. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a very bright individual, but between the left ear and the right ear 
something's gone astray," U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said during the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Junot, 40, told a psychologist he wanted to fire the nonlethal pistol near Bush 
in Warner Park on Nov. 6 to "remind Americans of Bush's mortality and the 
consequences of (Vice President Dan) Quayle's inadequacies."

WANTED: A NEW HOUSING DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leila Gonzalez-Correa has resigned as executive director of the Los Angeles 
Housing Authority after accusations of cronyism, breaking promises and trying 
to impose gag orders not only on staff members but also on complaining tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and the city's housing board have their second chance in four 
years to find a strong, skillful and sensitive leader who can make life at 
least bearable, and, in many cases better, for poor families who live in the 
city's 21 housing projects and 22,000 federally subsidized leased apartments 
administered by the authority. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer with housing experience, Gonzalez-Correa came to her tough job with 
good credentials. She was hired 2 1/2 years ago to direct the troubled housing 
agency after another controversial executive director, Homer Smith, resigned 
under criticism of poor management practices, including a failure to follow the 
required competitive bidding process. When Gonzalez-Correa tackled glaring 
problems in the city's 35,000 low-income housing units, she quickly got into 
similar trouble. 
</P>
<P>
She awarded contracts exceeding $10,000 to acquaintances without seeking 
competitive bids. She refused to inform the housing board about major projects. 
Her proposal to sell the Jordan Downs project in Watts to private developers 
ultimately cost the housing agency $5 million in scarce federal improvement 
funds. She alienated tenants by making promises she couldn't keep and by 
excluding them from decisions that directly affected their lives. Finally, she 
tried to forbid housing authority staff and tenants from speaking publicly 
without permission, prompting the mayor to issue a strong rebuke last week. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and the housing board now will look again for an executive director 
with housing experience and strong management skills to run a large and complex 
public agency with 750 employees, a budget of $135 million and 96,000 tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But the job involves more than taking care of the buildings, collecting the 
rent and trying, often in vain, to evict troublemakers. The new director must 
serve the tenants, typically the poorest of the city's low-income families, 
many of them impoverished single mothers trying to raise families in a safe and 
decent environment 
</P>
<P>
Until a new housing executive director is selected, Gary Squier, the mayor's 
housing adviser, will serve in the job. Squier, pragmatic and accessible, knows 
low-income housing and he knows how City Hall works. He will start today to 
rebuild the tenants' trust in the housing authority. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley and a more demanding Los Angeles Housing Authority Board of 
Commissioners must find a first-rate housing director and strongly insist that 
the housing chief translate sound ideas into better lives for thousands of poor 
families.

James Bond star Timothy Dalton and actress Vanessa Redgrave won undisclosed 
libel damages today for newspaper allegations that he was rude to his producer 
and that colleagues dreaded her arrival on a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer, Oscar Beuselinck, told High Court Judge Michael Davies the 
settlement had been reached with Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mirror alleged in October that Dalton was rude and behaved 
unprofessionally toward producer Cubby Broccoli during filming of "License to 
Kill." The newspaper also claimed that Redgrave "was in the habit of making 
life impossible whenever she appeared on a film set." The Sunday Mirror 
withdrew the allegations and apologized.

Exxon crews today finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker 
Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of North 
America's worst-ever oil spill. 
</P>

Exxon said it had finished transferring 48 million gallons of crude from the 
Exxon Valdez to three other ships. About 25 million gallons of oily waste water 
remained aboard the ship, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude 
into Prince William Sound when it struck a reef March 24. The company said 
crews will attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef 
at high tide Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes about 20 feet long in 
its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs.

N. HOLLYWOOD MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN OFFICERS' BOMB DEATHS

<P>
A North Hollywood makeup man was convicted today of the murders of two police 
demolitions experts who were killed when a pipe bomb exploded as they were 
trying to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury, after only hours of deliberation, found Donald Morse 
guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder and possessing explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, 39, was also convicted of special circumstance allegations that would 
have qualified him for the death penalty, but the district attorney's office 
had decided not to seek a death sentence against him. Morse will be sentenced 
to a mandatory term of life in prison without parole May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
bomb squad, and squad veteran Ron Ball, 43, were killed Feb. 8, 1986, as they 
tried to defuse two pipe bombs found in Morse's North Hollywood garage.

INS DETAINS DUTCH AIDS SUFFERER EN ROUTE TO S.F.

A Dutch visitor was in custody today in a Minnesota jail after immigration 
officials declared that he cannot enter the United States because he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Paul Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam has requested a hearing on Friday before an 
immigration judge to determine whether he can be allowed to continue to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoef had planned to attend the national Lesbian and Gay Health Conference 
that begins in San Francisco on Wednesday, according to Steve Huber, a 
spokesman for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this detention of this individual at this particular time has an 
irony to it given the fact that he's coming here as part of AIDS prevention," 
said Huber, noting that Verhoef is an AIDS prevention worker in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service declared that he cannot enter the 
United States because he has an infectious and communicable disease, according 
to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Verhoef was taken to the Scott County Jail, about 20 miles from the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, after U.S. Customs officials discovered the drug 
AZT in his baggage on Sunday, according to a friend who was with him. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Morin, an aide to Pelosi, said Verhoef told customs and immigration 
employees that he had AIDS when he was questioned about the AZT, an approved 
drug used to treat people infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Pelosi and Bea Roman, executive director of the National Lesbian and Gay Health 
Foundation, among others, are appealing to the U.S. attorney general's office 
for a waiver that would free Verhoef to visit San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits people with AIDS from visiting the United States without 
such a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to exclude 
tourists," said Pelosi, who noted that her staff has been in touch with federal 
immigration officials in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't try to hide it," Morin said. "We also question this on humanitarian 
grounds, putting someone in jail under these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Before the hearing, Verhoef must be tested to certify that he has AIDS, said 
Tom Schiltgen, INS district director in St. Paul.

Ousted former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos will be embalmed and 
preserved for display in Hawaii if he dies in exile, his wife, Imelda, said in 
an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
She told the Manila daily Business World she would make a deliberate spectacle 
of her husband if the government of President Corazon Aquino refuses to allow a 
Philippine burial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep Marcos here (in Hawaii) until 1992. Then I'll bring him home. My 
mother-in-law is also waiting to be buried," she said. Marcos's mother died 
last May and was embalmed so that her son could attend her burial. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferdinand does not wish to be buried (in the United States)," Imelda Marcos 
said. "If he is to be cremated after 1992, then his wish is for his ashes to be 
scattered across the Philippines to fertilize his country."

180 PROMINENT AMERICAN JEWS CALL FOR JERUSALEM'S DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH PLO

<P>
A group of 180 prominent American Jews called on Israel today to change its 
policies in the occupied territories and to engage in direct negotiations with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Many American Jews do not support the suppression of the Palestine people and 
the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza," the group said in a 
statement released as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
</P>
<P>
Shamir arrived in the United States for talks Wednesday with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The statement addressed to Shamir said, "There are millions of American Jews 
who find your current policies immoral, contrary to what is best in our Jewish 
tradition and destructive to the best interests of Israel and American Jewry." 
</P>
<P>
It urged Shamir to "begin negotiations now with the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
"If you are serious about seeking peace, you must be prepared to talk directly 
with your enemies, and you cannot expect to pick their representatives for 
them," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Signers of the statement included television producer Norman Lear, novelist 
Philip Roth, poet Allen Ginsberg, playwright Arthur Miller, film maker Woody 
Allen, civil rights and labor activist Joseph Rauh, author Grace Paley, 
feminist leader Betty Friedan, critics Irving Howe and Michael Walzer, novelist 
and poet Marge Piercy and journalist Carl Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Israel should "not rule out the possibility that the 
outcome of negotiations" with the PLO might be the creation of a Palestinian 
state -- an outcome Israel has fiercely resisted. 
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Bush, "American Jews will be delighted if Shamir has 
something substantive to offer," said Michael Lerner, editor of the Jewish 
magazine Tikkun and coordinator of the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"But unless Shamir agrees to direct negotiations with the PLO aimed at allowing 
them the same national self-determination that Israel rightly claims for 
itself, he will simply prolong the agony and immorality of the occupation."

LOCKHEED CREATES ESOP TO PREEMPT SIMMONS TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed Corp., acting swiftly to preempt a takeover by investor Harold 
Simmons, said today that it will sell some units, boost its dividend and create 
a stock ownership plan that puts 17% of its shares in employee hands. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Calabasas-based defense and aerospace company said it 
expects profits to decline 40% in the first quarter and 25% in the year as a 
whole. A lackluster earnings performance has been cited by analysts as a key 
factor making the company vulnerable to a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the new anti-takeover measures and the outlook for lower earnings, 
Lockheed's shares opened 87.5 cents lower at $48.875 today. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, a wealthy Dallas financier, said Monday that a group he heads has 
acquired 5.3% of Lockheed and will consider taking control. Lockheed's shares 
Monday jumped to a sharp gain on takeover speculation, even though Simmons said 
he has no immediate plans for a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Polaroid's Defense 
</P>
<P>
The maker of such top-secret defense weapons as the stealth bomber and the 
Trident missile, Lockheed began preparing a takeover defense in December when 
Simmons first said he was buying Lockheed shares. 
</P>
<P>
In the employee stock ownership plan announced today, the company will create 
an ESOP with a combined value of about $1 billion by creating 10.5 million new 
shares and acquiring 10.5 million existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated takeover defense by Polaroid Corp. against Roy Disney's Shamrock 
Holdings Inc. successfully employed such a plan and many companies are adopting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In another measure that will reduce its vulnerability, Lockheed said, it will 
phase out its Information Systems Group, selling its CalComp, CADAM, Metier and 
Lockheed DataPlan units. Analysts have said the information group could be sold 
off by a corporate raider to fund part of a buyout. The four units had 1988 
revenues of $589 million, out of the company's total of $10.59 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said the moves renew its focus on missiles and space, aircraft and 
electronics, and place new emphasis on technology services. 
</P>
<P>
"They will enhance our competitiveness in a rapidly changing environment where 
premiums are placed on innovation, efficiency and quality and focused 
management," said Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep. 
</P>
<P>
But on another front that analysts see as vital to winning any takeover battle, 
the company will find no immediate relief. It said first-quarter profits will 
be hurt by the end of its C-5B military transport production program, higher 
effective tax rates and expected adjustments for cost increases in certain 
aircraft modification programs. 
</P>
<P>
That will slash Lockheed's earnings 40% from the $114 million in the first 
quarter last year. Earnings for the year as a whole will be only slightly 
better than the first quarter, and are expected to be down 25% from the $624 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the short-term setbacks, Lockheed said it is confident that earnings 
growth will resume in 1990 and beyond.

Auto making titan Ford Motor Co. moved into second place among Fortune 500 
industrial companies last year, bumping oil giant Exxon Corp. to third place, 
and General Motors Corp. remained No. 1, the magazine reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The annual listing, which showed 1988 as the best year ever for corporate 
America's sales and profits, also had General Electric Co. moving into the No. 
5 spot, pushing Mobil Corp. to No. 6, and Chrysler Corp. jumping from No. 10 to 
No. 7, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other top 10, International Business Machines Corp. remained 
unchanged in the No. 4 spot; Texaco Inc. dropped to the No. 8 spot from seventh 
last year; and E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. remained unchanged at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos. moved to the 10th spot from 12th place, helped by its 
acquisition of Kraft Co., which ranked No. 31 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"By virtually every measure, 1988 was the best year ever for the Fortune 500," 
the magazine said in an advance release of the list, to be published in April 
24 editions and available on newsstands Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"As the U.S. economy expanded for the sixth straight year, demand continued to 
surge, and factories and refineries operated near capacity," Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
The new list shows sales by the Fortune 500 topped $2 trillion for the first 
time and profits jumped a record 27%. 
</P>
<P>
It said nearly all of the 27 industrial categories enjoyed double-digit 
earnings growth in 1988, led by metal companies, which showed a 100% jump, 
boosted by soaring copper prices and the steel industry's successful 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Large oil refiners posted a 63% increase in profits, benefiting from what 
Fortune called "a double-dose of luck; OPEC squabbling drove crude oil prices 
down, lowering costs, while demand strengthened, increasing prices." 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping Philip Morris, takeovers also moved other companies up the 
list. Eastman Kodak Co. jumped from No. 25 to No. 18 with the acquisition of 
Sterling Drug Co., ranked No. 174 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune ranks the top 500 industrial companies in terms of annual sales. It 
also publishes a list later in the year ranking the top 500 U.S. service 
companies.

Katharine Graham, publisher of the Washington Post, and a senior British High 
Court judge, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, were named today as trustees of 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 trustees' function is to safeguard Reuters' independence and integrity, 
said the chairman of the Reuters Founders Share Co., Lord McGregor of Durris. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, 71, took over the Washington Post media empire in 1963 and put her own 
stamp on the powerful newspaper that exposed the Watergate scandal. 
Browne-Wilkinson, 59, Britain's vice chancellor, lifted a court order in 1987 
that banned three newspapers from publishing extracts from "Spycatcher," the 
memoirs of retired counterintelligence agent Peter Wright. 
</P>
<P>
The Reuters Founders Share Co. controls a "golden share" in Reuters Holdings 
PLC that can overrule other shareholders in the event of a takeover threat.

The head of the Canadian federal inquiry into drug use in amateur sports today 
criticized the Ontario Track and Field Assn. for its decision to erase from its 
books records set by athletes who admit to steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm puzzled that the message is if you come forth and tell the truth you will 
be penalized," Charles Dubin said. "The actions of the OTFA can only discourage 
people from coming forth." 
</P>
<P>
Dubin said he has asked the association for an explanation of its action. The 
group decided over the weekend that it will wipe out the Ontario records of any 
athlete who admits using banned drugs before their record-setting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Association President Rolf Lund said the move was not meant to undermine the 
commission's work but to show where the organization stands on the issue. The 
association has voided provincial records set by Angella Taylor Issajenko, who 
admitted to the inquiry that she used steroids for almost a decade.

Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders was granted admission to the NFL draft 
today, just three days after the Oklahoma State junior running back asked for a 
special exemption to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Sanders, a true junior with a year of eligibility 
left, is being allowed into the April 23 draft because Oklahoma State is on 
NCAA probation and because he is leaving school with the blessing both of Coach 
Pat Jones and Athletic Director Myron Roderick. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 183-pound Sanders rushed for 2,628 yards -- including four games 
of at least 300 yards -- and 39 touchdowns last season. He is expected to be 
chosen extremely high -- perhaps third by the Detroit Lions, who have expressed 
a strong interest in him.

<P>
Thousands of fans went on a wild, five-hour rampage in the streets early today 
to celebrate Michigan's first NCAA basketball championship, leading to eight 
arrests, widespread property damage and several injuries. 
</P>
<P>
It took riot-equipped State Police, Washtenaw County deputies, city police and 
security officers from the University of Michigan until about 4 a.m. to control 
the estimated 5,000 rowdy fans who wildly celebrated Michigan's 80-79 overtime 
win over Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The area's been cleared," Lt. Craig Roderick said in the predawn hours today. 
"There's damage all over the place. We have not documented it, but it is 
extensive to both public and private property." 
</P>
<P>
He said eight of the rowdy fans were arrested and an undetermined number of 
others were injured from flying beer and liquor bottles as well as rocks. 
</P>
<P>
During the spontaneous celebration, an awning on the China Gate restaurant was 
pulled down, a main traffic light was destroyed and a Detroit television 
station van had its windows smashed and tires slashed. 
</P>
<P>
At least one car was overturned, numerous windows were smashed, street signs 
were torn down and the pavement was littered with glass from broken beer 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
One Ann Arbor police officer was rushed from the scene shortly after the melee 
began and was successfully treated for chest pains, Roderick said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Rumeal Robinson made two free throws to guarantee Michigan its 
first national basketball title, thousands of Michigan fans stormed out of 
restaurants, bars and dorms to begin their celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded quickly, blocking off a central part of the campus to 
vehicular traffic. Within an hour, campus and city police called for 
reinforcements from State Police and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," Roderick said as the size and activity of the crowd swelled. For 
the next couple of hours, it was pretty much a standoff between police and the 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks filled the sky, at times, and some of the fans stripped off their 
clothes while perched on rooftops along South University Road on campus.
