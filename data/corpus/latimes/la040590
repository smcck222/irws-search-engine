I am writing you in response to the article "MCA/Spectacor to Take Over L.A. 
Coliseum" (March 27). 
</P>
<P>
I agree with the idea of the takeover of the Coliseum. Al Davis is going to 
make the best decision between Oakland and Los Angeles which will help him 
financially. Even though the Coliseum is a historical landmark, it could use 
the revisions that Davis has asked for. Davis was told when he first came to 
Los Angeles that he would get the changes and he is still waiting. The Los 
Angeles area needs a professional football team and the Raiders "bad boy" 
influence is what we need.

You may be disinterested to know that gardening is my hobby and that I have 
hybridized a new strain of broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be grown as an annual but rather as a shrub. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of our President I have named it the Broccoli Bush. Wish me luck.

Yes, I may use pork rinds for fertilizer.

THE 'LIGHT' FOOD MOVEMENT HAS EMBRACED A CULINARY HEAVY -- PASTA. LOW-FAT 
NOODLE DISHES FROM ITALY AND FROM ASIA -- SUCH AS SHRIMP-AND-SQUID CHOW MEIN, 
BELOW -- ARE AT THE HEART OF THE CHANGE.

Talk of pasta in Los Angeles' restaurants is lightening up at every turn. One 
hears: "We suggest the angel hair pasta. It has a very light sauce . . . fresh 
tomatoes, cut up and sauted lightly in their own juice with a thimbleful of 
olive oil and some basil. Very light." What has caused this sudden emphasis on 
lighter pasta dishes? 
</P>
<P>
Growing concern about fat and cholesterol intake is causing many Americans to 
find low-fat and low-cholesterol alternatives to foods that they love to eat. 
And pasta is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Many Italian restaurants today are suggesting light pasta, thus redefining the 
popular dish as something other than a high-calorie, heavily sauced entree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big movement," said Silvio di Mori, owner of Tuttobene in Los Angeles. 
His restaurant's menu states that most Tuttobene dishes can be prepared 
"diet-style." 
</P>
<P>
"Cream and butter are things of the past," di Mori said. "Today we suggest 
things like angel hair with fresh tomato and basil, and seafood pasta using 
natural juices, not oil or butter, to cook the sauce. We get into difficulty 
when people ask for no salt, however. Pasta without salt is bland, so we 
suggest arrabbiata, a pasta made with chiles, onion and olives, whose sharp 
flavors make up for the lack of salt." 
</P>
<P>
At La Famiglia in Beverly Hills, there is a separate section on the menu for 
low-fat, low-salt pastas. "It all started because of my own health concerns," 
owner Joe Patti said. "Our customers have responded in an overwhelming way to 
these dishes." (The restaurant's pasta de checca uses a brand of pasta from 
Italy, but any pasta may be used.) 
</P>
<P>
At Locanda Veneta in Los Angeles, owner-chef Antonio Tomassi prepares low-fat, 
low-calorie, low-salt pastas on request, based on items available on the day's 
menu. "If a diner is on a diet, there is always a way to make the pasta 
lighter," he said. One way is to cut down on the fat content of meats as well 
as on oils and butter used to cook meats and to increase use of fresh 
vegetables. Tomassi sometimes uses vegetable-based pastas to enhance nutrients 
and to reduce salt and calories. 
</P>
<P>
But Italian pastas are not the only types that offer a lighter approach to 
cooking. Oriental noodle dishes also are rich sources of light pasta ideas. 
Stir-fried noodle dishes, for example, require little or no fat, and noodle 
soups, such as ramen or udon, rarely contain much fat because the noodles are 
generally cooked in a fat-free broth that is naturally low in calories. If 
meats are added, they are often lean -- roast pork slices, shrimp, squid or 
other seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian noodles dishes also are abundant, with 
</P>
<P>
pad Thai among the most popular Asian dishes in the United States today. Pad 
Thai achieves its flavor from fish or shrimp sauce, seasonings used throughout 
Southeast Asia. Japanese and Chinese lo meins and chow meins also are conducive 
to low-fat treatments, if the stir-frying is done with a minimum of fat or if 
the fat is replaced with the natural liquids extracted from foods during 
sauteing. Using more vegetables, skinless poultry and seafood, and less fatty 
meat (or by trimming fat from meat) also helps keep fat and cholesterol to a 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Noodles or pastas alone are relatively low in calories because, like fruits and 
vegetables, they are complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates contain four calories 
per gram, compared with seven calories per gram for protein and fat's 9 
calories per gram. Most pastas contain about 250 calories per cooked cup. 
</P>
<P>
Add another 200 calories from meat, fish, poultry and/or vegetables and you 
will have a 450-calorie meal, or little more than one-fourth of the total 
calories of an average 1,600 calories per day diet. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes were selected that will show how to keep calories, especially in fat, 
to a minimum when cooking pasta. The pasta dishes reflect today's taste in 
Southeast Asian cuisine, modern Italian and Japanese/Chinese cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
At Horai Tei, a Japanese-Chinese stir-fry restaurant in Little Tokyo, chef 
Masao Shinkai prepares a chow mein containing shrimp, thinly sliced beef and 
pork, plus spinach, bean sprouts, mushroom, bamboo shoots and other vegetables. 
The dish contains such a variety of ingredients (in small amounts) as to make 
it highly nutritious and relatively low in calories. Vary the dish further by 
mixing and matching vegetables and meat to your liking. 
</P>
<P>
Shinkai's Yaki Soba, a traditional Japanese noodle dish based on the Chinese 
stir-fry, makes use of soba noodles, which are made with buckwheat and are 
highly nutritious. Red ginger and dried green seaweed serve as garnishes and 
add color to a nutrient-packed, low-calorie dish. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the menu at Giuseppe! is filled with light, airy pastas, such 
as Capellini Pomodoro (angel hair pasta with Maui onions, tomatoes, basil), and 
tubular pasta, called penne, teamed with fresh tomato and asparagus. "Any 
seasonal vegetable can be added to this dish in lieu of asparagus," said owner 
Giuseppe Bellisario. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Pritikin Program" by Robert Pritikin (Simon and Schuster: $19.95) 
provides a recipe for cannelloni that contains 185 calories per serving. 
(Pritikin is the son of founder of the Pritikin Institute, the late Nathan 
Pritikin, who espoused a diet very low in fat.) The marinara sauce uses 
defatted chicken stock as the sauteing liquid. The whole wheat-rice flour 
crepes are made with nonfat milk and egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta With Cauliflower, provided by Biba Caggiano, owner of Biba's in 
Sacramento and author of "Modern Italian Cooking (Simon and Schuster: $17.95), 
shows another way to make use of fresh vegetables in a pasta dish for a light 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
From Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, a new restaurant at the Wiltern Building in Los 
Angeles, comes a recipe for pad Thai, a noodle dish made with shrimp sauce 
(available at many Oriental food stores). 
</P>
<P>
Bow-tie pasta is used in an improvised Thai dish made with peanuts. A 
Southwestern pasta dish teams angel hair pasta with tomatoes and cilantro 
instead of the customary basil. An easy ramen dish that makes use of canned 
consomme rounds out our light pastas.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: NEW RESEARCH SUPPORTS OMEGA-3'S ROLE IN PREVENTION OF 
HEART DISEASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of international researchers, gathered here for the II International 
Conference on the Health Effects of Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Seafood, fell short 
of announcing a formal nutritional standard for the nutrient, but they did call 
for the U. S. National Research Council to reconsider its position and include 
omega-3 in the Recommended Dietary Allowances. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the U. S. government has refused to include omega-3 in its RDAs, 
explaining that further study of the fatty acids' role in metabolic function is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But, citing research done by members of the group, which charts the amount of 
omega-3 required to produce a variety of positive responses in either animal 
models or in patients in a clinical setting, the group described omega-3's 
protective effect against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and psoriasis and determined that it does indeed 
have an essential role in human growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, representatives from the United States and the United 
Kingdom suggested that a minimum of 1% of a day's total calories be derived 
from omega-3 fatty acids -- the type found primarily in fish that inhabit deep, 
cold waters. That percentage could be achieved by eating two to three meals of 
fish per week from sources such as tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring or sardines, 
the scientists said. The American Heart Assn. and the American Dietetic Assn. 
already encourage consumers to eat fish two to three times a week but no health 
organization has recommended a specific amount for omega-3. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical studies have proven that for proper functioning, the body needs to 
derive only about 2% of its total calories from fat -- of all types -- yet 
Americans currently consume about 30% -- most of it from saturated fat, 
according to health experts. Eating more fish would presumably replace some of 
the saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat and simultaneously supply omega-3 to 
the diet. Equal distribution of each type -- 10% saturated, 10% polyunsaturated 
and 10% monounsaturated -- is optimal, all health agencies concur. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (eating fish) is something very healthy to do," said Evelyn Tribole, a 
registered dietitian and media spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn. 
"Canned tuna contains omega-3, and (the nutrient) is available in the 
water-packed variety too. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer a recommendation in terms of an absolute number of grams rather 
than a percentage because it's not as absolute. There are a number of Americans 
who are dieting on any given day so that their total caloric intake is 
variable. But with two to three meals (of fish) a week you know you're at least 
in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Tribole also cautioned against meeting this requirement with supplements 
because they will add additional fat to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I recommend that my patients rotate the use of oils -- canola oil, then 
safflower, then olive. The more variety you have the more likely you are to 
maximize nutrients and minimize toxicity." (It is possible to eat too much of 
one type of fat and cause an imbalance, leading to toxicity, in the body.) 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Crawford of the Institute of Zoology, London, also believes in 
balance and explained that prevention of chronic diseases is one of the most 
logical applications of omega-3. He and many other scientists at the meeting 
agreed that even though the evidence examines intervention, the data should 
encourage consumers to seek balance in the diet and include nutrients from a 
variety of sources -- including those containing omega-3 -- to delay the onset 
of disease. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors explained that although American consumers have made an effort to 
switch from saturated fat to polyunsaturated fat, the United States still has a 
high mortality rate from degenerative disease. But, according to early studies 
of Greenland Eskimos, who also consume large amounts of saturated fat from 
whale blubber and very fatty fish, some of the negative effects of a 
high-saturated fat diet can be reduced by the omega-3s in the fatty fish. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is clear that the seeds of coronary artery disease are already 
being sewn in childhood so we're looking at doing things in terms of initial 
nutrition," Crawford said. "We're not just talking about giving people with 
heart disease or rheumatoid arthritis some fish oils. We're looking at stopping 
these (diseases) from starting in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lands, professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of Illinois, 
agreed. He described a study of 6,000 high-risk middle-aged men that noted a 
40% lower mortality rate among fish-eating Americans, compared to the non-fish 
eating group. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), 
participants were studied over a 10-to-12-year period to investigate a number 
of risk factors for coronary heart disease, including diet, blood pressure and 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
A similar result was observed in a significant study published last year in the 
Lancet, a British medical journal. It reported that of the nearly 2,000 men who 
had previously had a heart attack, those who were advised to eat at least two 
oil-rich fish meals per week had a 29% lower mortality rate over the next two 
years compared to those who were not advised to eat fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever is in the food chain is in the tissues. There's not much 
discrimination (by the body)," Lands said. "Epidemiology tells us that those 
with omega-3 (in their tissues) have a 40% lower mortality rate." Until all the 
evidence is in, consumers can follow the AHA recommendation to include more 
fish meals in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat Fish, Live Better" (Harper &amp; Row: $18.95) by Anne M. Fletcher, a 
registered dietitian, can help consumers further appreciate the benefits of 
fish oils. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recipes and some discussion of fish-oil capsules, the book 
features an easy-to-understand explanation of the role of omega-3 in the diet, 
including how it influences hormone function. Early population studies are 
discussed, and a detailed section on pesticides, pollutants and poisoning 
associated with eating fish is provided. 
</P>
<P>
There is an extensive glossary, which ranges from anchovy to wolfish. In it, 
each species is defined in terms of its pseudonyms, market forms, eating 
quality, methods of preparation and nutritional value.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONE SHOULD AVOID CATCH-AS-CATCH-CAN 
DINING HABIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who live alone can be divided, by diet, into two groups. At one extreme 
are those who plan, shop and prepare meals with the same vigor as if they were 
cooking for a family of four. At the other are those whose refrigerators may 
contain nothing more than a jar of mustard, a loaf of weary bread, a stick of 
margarine and a six-pack of diet soda. 
</P>
<P>
If you -- or someone you care about -- fits into the latter category, maybe 
it's time to consider a change. 
</P>
<P>
"Dinner for one, please, James . . . Madam will not be dining tonight" go the 
words to an old song. But most who dine solo don't have a "James" to prepare 
the meal for them. And although making single servings might sound easier than 
feeding an entire family, it sometimes turns out to be as hard or even harder. 
</P>
<P>
When eating alone, we frequently don't bother fixing a nutritious, balanced 
meal. Instead we grab whatever's quick and handy: Leftovers, snacks or 
over-processed convenience foods. Sometimes the meal consists of only one kind 
of food rather than an appetizing mix. Fruits and vegetables get forgotten in 
the rush. 
</P>
<P>
This type of dining can affect not only the composition of the meal but the 
whole experience as well. Such a repast might be eaten standing over the sink, 
in front of the videocassette recorder, while reading, or on the run. Food is 
consumed either rapidly, absent mindedly, or both, rather than in a relaxed 
manner in which each bite is savored. And thanks to the microwave, you can 
stick processed food in the oven, wait for the bell, eat it and, presto, you're 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everybody eats this way on occasion. But when the catch-as-catch-can 
style becomes a habit, you may need to work on improving a nutritional profile. 
</P>
<P>
A place to start is the supermarket. People playing shopper's solitaire rightly 
point out that it's hard to buy products in small enough quantities. Although 
some single-serving canned goods are available, most frozen foods (aside from 
complete dinners) come in large sizes. Half-loaves of bread are rare, and many 
fresh foods come in family-size packs. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous stores now offer serve-yourself salad bars, but some people find them 
too costly. Rather than buy a head of lettuce only to find half of it rotting 
in the refrigerator a week later, they may omit salad entirely. Their only 
choice, they say, is between wasting food or eating the same thing over and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
We recognize that it's not easy, but don't throw good nutrition to the wind. 
Eating alone doesn't make you less important. The same principles of prudent 
eating apply no matter how many or few are sitting at the table. And with a 
little extra effort, you can create varied, nutritious meals -- even if you're 
on your own. 
</P>
<P>
Planning is the key. At the supermarket, use a basic checklist. Included should 
be leafy greens and yellow vegetables, citrus fruits, low-fat dairy products, 
meats, fish, eggs, poultry, dried beans and peas, as well as whole-grain or 
enriched breads and cereals and rice and grain products such as pastas. Make 
selections with these important categories in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Plan to use highly perishable fruits and vegetables earlier in the week. Later 
in the week, you can depend on frozen vegetables. Buy these in pourable bags, 
which are easier to re-close than boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Plan ahead in cooking too. Think in broader terms than just meal by meal. If 
you've bought larger amounts of ingredients (an economical way to shop), you 
can cook extra servings and store them. Pasta sauces or soups with dried beans 
can be kept in the freezer in microwave containers for defrosting later on. 
Along with pasta, salad and a piece of fresh fruit, they make a delicious, 
nutritious meal. Or cook a sizeable pot of beef stew, which will serve you in 
good stead for two or three days. Any extra will last a few months in the 
freezer. 
</P>
<P>
Some people find it most convenient to do this type of larger-scale cooking on 
the weekend. If you're having guests over for a meal, you can also cook extra 
servings at that time and store them for later use too. An added advantage to 
relying on the freezer in this way: If you decide to go out to dinner with 
friends on the spur of the moment, the food will keep just fine. Or, if you 
invite a friend home, you'll have a full larder to share. 
</P>
<P>
The main message here is that while spontaneity in many matters adds zest to 
life, a little foresight in the supermarket and advance work in the kitchen 
lets you shop more economically and eat more nutritiously. It also gives the 
solo meal a touch of class.

ABOUT WINE: STILL MUCH HYPE OVER THE QUALITY OF BURGUNDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any wine lover who has tasted a sip of a great red or white Burgundy swoons at 
the thought of repeating the act. 
</P>
<P>
There is little like it -- the sublime spice and richness of the Chardonnay, 
the intense decadence of clove-scented cherries in the Pinot Noir. This is the 
essence of great Burgundy and it's what makes these wines so desirable and so 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
And yet it is with great sadness that I report my own disenchantment with 
Burgundy in the last decade. I know it can be great wine. I know it can offer 
some of the greatest and most expansive flavors and tastes the human body can 
grasp. And yet more and more I come away from tastings of young Burgundies with 
a growing feeling that there is a tad of prestidigitation going on here. 
</P>
<P>
No, it is not fraud. No one is intentionally putting anything over on us. It's 
just that after all the hype I have heard for some of the latest vintages of 
French Burgundy, I have been expecting nirvana-like exploitation of my palate. 
And what I have seen, in recent tastings, is some merely exceptionally good 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not angry about this, just wistfully sad that what I anticipate from 
Burgundy is rarely what I get. This is not true of Bordeaux. I had heard of the 
greatness of the 1986 Bordeaux and I tasted anticipating greatness. By and 
large, I got it. 
</P>
<P>
It reminded me of my feeling about the pre-Super Bowl hype, people talking 
about the greatness of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. I knew there was a chance 
both would flop in the Big Game, just as I knew the hype for the '86 Bordeaux 
might be overstating the case. But right on schedule, the '49ers and the '86 
Bordeaux both delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Burgundy? Well, that's another story. I have been mildly disappointed with what 
I have seen in the last few years. The wines are good to excellent, no question 
about it, but a lot of them lack a certain je ne sais quoi and leave me asking 
"Is that all there is?" 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the second half of my disappointment, which is best left for the tag 
line to the following story: 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Bouchard came to town the other day to show off some of the 
acclaimed 1989 Burgundies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the four white wines he poured was one I found wonderful -- 1989 Bouchard 
Chevalier-Montrachet, which has a magnificent textured aroma of earth/chalk, 
spice nuances and oak tones. It is rich and mouth-filling; and though it didn't 
remind me as much of a Chevalier-Montrachet as a Meursault with a trace of 
Chablis, it is appealing and rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know the price of the wine while evaluating it; I guessed it would be 
expensive, perhaps $50 to $75 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The press kit said suggested retail is $91. A bottle. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here, of course, is high worldwide demand for a product that is 
always in short supply. Not every Burgundy is this high in price, of course, 
but demand for all Burgundy is so high that virtually everything is priced 
higher than it ought to be based on quality alone, and too expensive for me to 
recommend for all but defrocked Wall Street brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I may be accused of having the dreaded California Palate, but a lot of 
what I tasted in the last few weeks of French Burgundy reminded me of the 
better California Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs, which sell for a fraction of the 
price. Examples abound. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A lovely Beaune I had at a tasting recently that retails for $30 a bottle 
reminded me of the Pinot Noir from Saintsbury in the Napa Valley -- reminding 
me also of Saintsbury's wonderful slogan "Beaune in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The '89 Chevalier-Montrachet mentioned above was superb, but I asked myself 
if it was that much better than the wines of Kistler or Chalone or Hanzell or 
Kalin or Sanford or Sterling or Ferrari-Carano or Babcock or Flora Springs -- 
wines that run less than a third of the price of the Bouchard wine. 
</P>
<P>
Red Burgundy causes a weakening of connoisseurs' knees, and the debate these 
days is not high pricing but merely whether 1988 or 1989 is a greater vintage. 
(It's fortunate for the French that they have this "problem" to deal with 
rather than the real question of high price.) 
</P>
<P>
Dale Sharp, wine buyer for Red Carpet Wine &amp; Spirits in Glendale, thinks 
the debate is a chance for buyers to find the excellent and "well priced" 
1987s, which he said are "very good and may get lost in the rush to get the 
'88s and '89s." Yet that phrase "well-priced" is only relative; the wines are 
still mighty dear. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said the French may be trying to recoup for a number of mediocre 
vintages. He said 1985 was a great year in Burgundy, but, "You have to go all 
the way back to '78 before you get to a substantial vintage," said Sharp, so 
the French may be trying to recoup a bit after lower prices in the years 1979 
through 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the high prices for the '85s, prices for the hard 1986s 
dropped only 10%. "That means that the '86s were too high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lynch, wine buyer for Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco, joked about high 
prices for Burgundy: "We do a direct deposit with a lot of our customers. They 
send us their paychecks, we send them Burgundy." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Breitstein of the Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park said: "I can't keep up 
with the French Burgundies because the prices are simply too high. I used to 
sell a lot of them when they were priced between $20 and $35. Now most of these 
wines are priced between $40 and $100 and our customers are not in the mood to 
spend these kinds of prices." 
</P>
<P>
He said today's high prices for Burgundy are a result of short supply, to be 
sure, but also due to a four-tier marketing system -- one tier more than the 
traditional three-tier system of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"This fourth tier is the national marketing company," said Breitstein. "For 
instance, Joseph Drouhin is being represented by Dreyfus Ashby. So you have the 
exporter, the importer, the marketing company and the wholesaler between us and 
the wine, and that means that a wine that's $10 FOB becomes $40 by the time it 
gets to the retail shelf." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp added, "The Japanese yen is so strong against the other currencies of the 
world, and the Japanese have all this extra disposable income and they are 
having a major impact on the supply of wines, to the detriment of the American 
consumer. They're buying wines that they never did ten years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wallace of Wally's in West Los Angeles sells a great deal of Burgundy, 
but he's nervous about the prices he must charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken a pretty strong position in '88 red Burgundies, and I'm concerned 
because the gamble is on the retailer," said Wallace. "The (West Coast) 
wholesaler will not take a strong position unless he pre-sells the wine. But on 
the East Coast, the wholesaler will take a position by keeping inventories in 
stock, and you can find the 'hot' wines after the first few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Burgundy is a real gamble. You never know what they're going to taste like, 
and even after you taste them you don't know what's going to happen in the 
bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said, additionally, that prices for French Burgundies are lower on the 
East Coast than they are in the West: "My biggest complaint as a retailer is 
that I get newsletters from (wine shops) in the east and they get stuff and 
sell them for prices we can't even buy the wines for," said Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said the East Coast is a better and thus more competitive Burgundy 
market "because it was there first and people understand it better. Our lack of 
experience has hurt our knowledge of it, and that hurts the price." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Wallace what he thought about lower prices for French Burgundies (and 
Bordeaux) on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I get real irritated when I see that. I asked Ab Simon (president of Seagram's 
Chateau and Estate division) why I pay more for the same wines than they do in 
the east, and he said he had to be more competitive back there. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real reason is that they can deal pretty much directly with the 
retailers, and here we have another 25% markup -- the wholesaler. Some of my 
potential buyers are actually buying wine back east and shipping it out here -- 
even though it's illegal to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Some small Burgundy producers do not deal through a major national house and 
thus prices for them are more consistent from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch of Pacific Wine Co. estimated that about 30% of the good Burgundies sell 
in California and New York at the same (or similar) prices. 
</P>
<P>
"But any of the national items, like stuff from Kobrand and Chateau and Estate, 
seems to be cheaper on the East Coast," said Lynch, "so we don't have much of 
that stuff in our inventory." 
</P>
<P>
A number of merchants interviewed said smaller wholesale houses such as Grape 
Expectations of Emeryville, Kermit Lynch of Berkeley and Martine Saunier of San 
Rafael do a marvelous job of importing fine Burgundies and keeping prices 
relatively reasonable. Martine's catalogue, in particular, shows a number of 
wines from respected wine makers at prices 10% to 20% lower than major-house 
wines from the same French districts. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that some of these producers are not well known. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said West Coast merchants face another problem in marketing Burgundy: 
supply. "Chateau and Estate makes sure their buddies on the East Coast get 
first pick. Their allocations are bigger than ours," said Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
He added that retailers who take a strong position in a wine are risking a lot. 
"We are at the mercy of the wine press, because if they are lukewarm to a 
vintage and you have taken a position in it, well, when you're talking about 
wines that are $30 to $40 a bottle and you can't sell them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Breitstein of Duke of Bourbon noted too that because of a greater competition 
and a greater volume of sales in major East Coast cities, many shops in the 
East buy huge amounts of wine at a time, getting a bigger discount. 
</P>
<P>
"There is almost no store in L.A. that's buying a container-load of wine to get 
a lower price, but every major store in New York is buying container-loads of 
wine," said Breitstein. "Our store is selling about 50% more wine this year 
than two years ago, yet we're selling virtually no Burgundy and two years ago 
it represented 20% of our business." 
</P>
<P>
Breitstein added, "The wine business is healthy, but if the producers and 
suppliers are not careful, they will lose certain segments of the market." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Sharp pointed out that some buyers are always optimistic 
about Burgundy: "I'm a Burgundy fanatic and I've been disappointed more times 
than I have been excited," said Sharp. "but the times I've been pleased make up 
for all the times I've been disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
A final word on the French Burgundies. At the Bouchard tasting the other day, I 
sat with a man who was chatting about the greatness of a new California 
Chardonnay. He raved about the superb qualities of the wine and said it was 
magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
Then he said, "Unfortunately, they are charging a lot for it -- $24." 
</P>
<P>
I replied, "But you don't think $91 is too much for Chevalier-Montrachet?" 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "Oh, but that's Burgundy." 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Jaboulet St. Joseph ($15) -- At a tasting of Burgundies 
a week ago, I sampled the line of Rhone wines from Jaboulet. Every wine was not 
only well made but well priced, and this Hermitage-like red wine is deep, 
richly fruity and brawny enough to mature nicely in a cellar. But it also is so 
appealing now it can be enjoyed immediately. A merchant at the tasting 
complained that St. Joseph had risen in price too fast. "I remember when I 
could sell St. Joseph for eight bucks," he said. True, but consider: Jaboulet's 
fabulous 1988 Hermitage La Chapelle sells for about $50 a bottle and this wine 
is a close approximation of it, making it a good value.

MICROWAVE: HOT CEREALS CAN HURRY MORNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because many hot cereals -- especially the instant varieties -- cook quickly on 
top of the stove, you may wonder if there is any reason to microwave them. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes. For starters, there's little danger of a cereal lumping or 
scorching in a microwave oven. Second, you needn't stir it nonstop or resort to 
the double boiler to keep it smooth and creamy. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, you save messy pot-scrubbing because cereals can be microwaved 
right in their serving bowls. It's such a snap that the children may want to 
fix their own breakfasts before they dash off to school. 
</P>
<P>
Oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat, cream of rice, even the Southerner's choice, 
grits, are cooked much the same way in the microwave. The only variable is the 
ratio of cereal to liquid. For best results, however, follow these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To prevent boil-overs, always use a bowl or casserole twice the volume of 
the ingredients that are placed in it. For each individual serving, use a deep 
1-pint bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To speed cooking, use hot tap water instead of cold. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover the cereal, if you like. A cover keeps the cereal uniformly creamy 
(no surface drying) but also increases the risk of boil-overs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If, at the end of the suggested cooking time, a cereal tests -- and tastes 
-- done but seems soupy, microwave in 15-second increments (for one serving) 
and in one-minute increments (for four-servings) until the mixture thickens 
properly. If, on the other hand, the cereal cooks dry before it's done, add a 
little hot water and microwave as directed for thickening the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always use potholders. Cereal bowls and casseroles get blistering hot in a 
microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always let cooked cereals cool slightly before tasting lest you scald your 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC MICROWAVED CEREAL 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup old-fashioned oats or 3 tablespoons grits or 2 tablespoons farina, 
cream of wheat or cream of rice 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup hot water 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
Combine cereal, water and salt in microwave-safe 1-pint bowl. Microwave 
(covered, if desired) on HIGH (100% power), stirring at half time, until all 
liquid is absorbed and cereal thickens. Allow 1 3/4 to 2 minutes for farina, 
cream of wheat or rice, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes for grits and 3 1/2 to 4 minutes for 
oats. 
</P>
<P>
Stir cereal again. Cool 30 seconds on heat-resistant surface. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
For 2 servings: Microwave single portions in 2 (1-pint) bowls, arranged 
side-by-side on microwave oven floor, 5 1/2 to 6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For 4 servings: Microwave single portions in 4 (1-pint) bowls, placing 1-inch 
apart and staggering 2 on oven shelf, 9 to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME QUICK WAYS TO IMPROVE COOKED CEREALS 
</P>
<P>
 Add any of following to each portion of cooked cereal (any kind), then cool 
briefly as recipe directs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 to 2 teaspoons light brown or maple sugar plus sprinkling of ground 
cinnamon, nutmeg, mace or allspice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons seedless raisins, diced dates, prunes, dried figs, 
apples, peaches or apricots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 tablespoon honey and/or wheat germ. 
</P>
<P>
 OR, JUST BEFORE SERVING 
</P>
<P>
 Top oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat or cream of rice with jam, jelly or 
preserves, any sliced or diced fresh fruit or whole ripe berries. Dollop of 
sour cream adds finishing touch. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR GRITS ONLY 
</P>
<P>
 Cook grits in chicken or beef broth instead of water, then serve in place of 
potatoes.

INSANE MIDDLE EAST ARMS RACE; 
</P>
<P>
WILL PROLIFERATION DETER EMPLOYMENT? OR ENCOURAGE USE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein rattles his enormous stockpile of mustard and 
nerve gases and promises to obliterate half of Israel if that country makes any 
military move against his own. Saddam Hussein is much given to bravado. This 
time, though, his words are more than an empty threat. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is known to have missiles able to carry chemical warheads to Israel's 
population centers or, for that matter, to cities in Iran and Syria, its other 
regional enemies. Would it try to do so? In the case of Israel, only if Iraq's 
leader took full leave of his senses. For the nation Saddam Hussein so 
murderously threatens has its own long-range missiles, and almost certainly 
nuclear warheads with which to arm them. Whatever damage Iraq might be able to 
inflict on Israel, Israel is capable of doing many times over to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the latest of the world's escalating arms races. This time the 
competitors aren't rushing to amass still more tanks, planes or artillery 
pieces. This time, they are hell-bent on acquiring chemical weapons, maybe 
biological ones, and in at least a number of cases, nuclear bombs. Ominously, 
the main players already have the means to deliver these weapons of mass 
slaughter over much of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, in the near-unanimous view of international experts on proliferation, 
has a significant if unacknowledged nuclear capability. The common estimate is 
that it has produced the components for at least 100 nuclear weapons. Israel 
regards this arsenal as its equalizer and the ultimate deterrent against the 
combined and vastly larger ground and air forces -- and now the chemical 
weapons -- of its hostile neighbors. Iraq, in the view of these same experts, 
is pursuing a crash program to develop nuclear weapons. Last week's foiled 
attempt to smuggle in U.S.-made triggering mechanisms for nuclear warheads was 
only the latest bit of evidence as to its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
A nuclear weapons program, though, is costly and demands an advanced 
technological base. It's far easier and cheaper to get hold of chemical and/or 
nerve agents, sometimes called the poor country's atomic bombs. Though long 
outlawed, chemical weapons were used with devastating results in the latter 
stages of the Persian Gulf war, particularly by Iraq. Their deadly and 
demoralizing effects are credited with finally persuading Iran's fanatical 
leaders, who had sworn never to compromise, to accept an armistice. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant international consequence of Iraq's use of dreaded and 
outlawed chemical and nerve gases was that it got away with it. The world 
community tut-tutted, but that concern didn't carry over into sanctions, even 
after Iraq used these horrible weapons to kill hundreds of its own Kurdish 
citizens. Iraq continues to get help from many nations, including economic 
credits from the United States. The implicit message was that chemical weapons 
no longer bear the taboo they carried since World War I. That conclusion hasn't 
been lost on Libya, Syria, Iran or other nations believed to be working 
feverishly to develop the means to wage chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirm that Libya, pursuing chemical weapons development, now 
has a system to refuel its Soviet-supplied Su-24 fighter bombers that will 
bring Israel within their range. Egypt is thought to be working on chemical 
weapons; it's known to be cooperating with Iraq on a missile, the Badr 2000, 
which has a range of up to 700 miles. Syria is trying to make chemical weapons; 
it already has Soviet-supplied missiles, including the SS-21, which can reach 
Israel only two minutes after launching. Iran has a confirmed chemical warfare 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Most formidable -- and most troubling -- is Iraq, which possesses a variety of 
missiles, the largest stockpile of chemical weapons in the Third World, and a 
vainglorious leader who covets acceptance as leader of the Arab world. U.S. 
intelligence agencies estimate that Iraq's annual poison-gas production 
capacity exceeds 13,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
What's to be done in the face of this swelling regional threat? Efforts must be 
made to control further transfers of the means to produce chemical or nuclear 
weapons, but cold reality requires recognizing that much damage has already 
been done. Terrible weapons are now in the hands of ambitious, bullying and 
perhaps even demented national leaders. The bleak and overriding question is 
whether the proliferation of these weapons and methods for delivering them will 
work to deter their further employment or, perhaps just as plausibly, encourage 
their mad and suicidal use.

LOVE AFFAIR WITH A VIRTUOSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, she would forget the words. Nobody cared as long as Sarah Vaughan 
just kept on singing. Summer evenings under the stars at the Hollywood Bowl 
won't be the same this year without the incomparable Vaughan, the jazz vocal 
virtuoso who died this week of lung cancer at age 66 in her Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
What a musical treasure was Sarah -- the sound of her silky, rich and versatile 
vocal instrument was instantly identifiable. She and her contemporaries, Ella 
Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae, define for most music lovers the very essence of 
great jazz singing. During nearly a half-century of performing for appreciative 
audiences all over the world, she never stopped challenging her considerable 
talent -- from "jamming" Brazilian style to collaborating with conductor 
Michael Tilson Thomas to scatting recently in the studio for Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Even now we can still hear her singing such standards such as "Send in the 
Clowns," using that phrasing that made the listener hear the familiar anew. 
That song often served in recent years as her closing concert number. But 
thanks to CDs, cassettes and albums, the world's musical love affair with Sarah 
Vaughan need never end.

DEALING WITH SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing illustrates the real problem faced by public schools better than the 
mentality behind "Toughen Discipline Policy, Report Urges L.A. Schools" (Part 
A, March 20). 
</P>
<P>
The board of education appoints a task force that takes 10 months to come to 
the brilliant conclusion that violent students should be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there is an established procedure to accomplish this end. Do they 
recommend that it simply be used? No, they recommend another "assistant 
superintendent" to oversee what is already in place. 
</P>
<P>
They also want a "computer tracking system" to alert receiving schools to 
violent students who are transferred within the district. I suppose a telephone 
call and the existing documented student file is too old-fashioned and might 
require actual contact with the real participants in this drama. 
</P>
<P>
Any teacher could have defined the problem in minutes, but the board finds new 
ways to reinvent the wheel and add layers of administrative costs in the 
process. It's the perfect example of the kind of bureaucratic thinking that 
entangles and chokes our schools.

SO WHY STOP WITH MURDERERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE V. DENNY III, George V. Denny III is a police misconduct attorney and 
former president of the Criminal Courts Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The horror and pain preceding death and the anguish thereafter caused to the 
survivors are seen these days as major criteria in imposing the death penalty. 
Indeed, some capital cases do involve the molestation and subsequent killing of 
small children. Some follow a rape. Some, a very small percentage, are 
accompanied by torture. 
</P>
<P>
But the great majority of murders giving rise to death-penalty verdicts are 
wanton and apparently senseless, and death comes with extraordinary, terrible 
swiftness. Thus, it is the survivors who suffer, not generally the murder 
victims, who are alive and well (though possibly frightened) one minute and 
very dead the next. 
</P>
<P>
So, since today's execution enthusiasts make vengeance a chief criterion, based 
on the rage and suffering of the survivors, perhaps they should seek support 
for extending the death penalty to avenge the bereaved and suffering parents, 
husbands or wives, children and friends of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Victims of the driver whose negligence rends and tears the body of his (or 
her) victim, who thereafter lingers days or months in a hospital in 
excruciating pain before dying; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Victims of the manufacturer who knowingly keeps from his employees 
information that the chemicals they are working with are toxic, therby leading 
to the agonizingly slow and painful deaths of some of his workers by cancer; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Victims of police killings where the district attorney refuses to prosecute 
for the murder but where the jury in a civil action brought by the grieving 
family ultimately finds that the officer (or officers) wrongfully and 
unlawfully gunned down the hapless citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The public is frightened. Afraid of crime. Afraid of "criminal" killings. But 
the will of the public to execute only a few of the perpetrators of the vast 
number of real, genuine criminal killings that daily occur in our complex 
society is misguided and, ultimately, self-defeating. If suffering is the 
criterion, let's kill all the "criminals" listed above. Or let's not kill 
anyone.

DEATH PENALTY THE DEFENDANT'S PLEA; 
</P>
<P>
BLAME HIS DISABILITIES, NOT A COLD AND CALCULATED HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is excerpted from the defense petition to the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of California that succeeded in gaining a stay of the 
scheduled April 3 execution of Robert Alton Harris. The defense appeal lawyers 
are Charles M. Sevilla, Michael K. McCabe and Michael Laurence of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Robert Harris' actions, both those "planned" and those which arose on 
the spur of the moment, were filtered through a brain that had been damaged by 
a sea of alcohol in utero and by fists and weapons wielded against him by his 
parents in early childhood. His plan to rob a bank was not a plan to violate 
social norms instinctively known to him but rejected out of selfishness and 
greed. It was merely a means of survival, learned from his parents and their 
associates and patterned after their behavior. Moreover, it was not even a 
"plan" in the sense of behavior chosen by one who had the ability to step back, 
recognize that bank robbery was socially inappropriate, and decide that he 
would carry out the robbery anyway because he rejected adherence to prevailing 
social mores. His "plan" was instead driven by impulse, without the mediation 
of that part of the brain capable of reflecting upon and weighing alternative 
courses of action in appreciation of the social fabric in which action takes 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Every sequence in the crime thereafter reflected Robert's inability to rein in 
or modulate his impulsivity with rational, socially conscious judgment. He 
could not steal a car, so he forced two young people into giving over their 
car. They attempted to assuage his fear of apprehension for taking their car, 
but as he got further and further into the events of the crime, the tension and 
stress grew, and with it, his already diminished ability to apply rational 
controls to his behavior became further subdued. The fear and paranoia 
associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) (added to) his already 
heightened impulsivity and, without apparent reasons to the outside observer -- 
in light of the victims' seemingly successful attempts to reassure Mr. Harris 
-- he began shooting. In the extraordinary stress of the moment, Mr. Harris' 
impaired ability to empathize with the victims was so reduced that he could 
shoot them without having made a conscious choice to do so. Thus, the hallmarks 
of his interconnected disabilities -- emotional lability, impaired rational 
control processes, inability to rely on instinctive guidance by social norms, 
and emotional distance from other human beings -- were, when unmasked, the 
hallmarks of Mr. Harris' crimes. Thus, the true answer to why he committed this 
crime could not have been more different from the answer given by the State at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
His apparently mean-spirited and cold-hearted behaviors thereafter were just as 
characteristic of his disabilities. His joking about the victims' deaths and 
his eating their food were classic forms of socially inappropriate behavior 
engaged in by one who has little ability to have concern for -- or to perceive 
others' concern for -- his transgressions. His violence in the jail is the 
violence of one (who) can be manipulated toward criminal behavior by anyone 
willing to show a modicum of kindness to him, and who has little ability to 
appreciate the gross impropriety of his actions -- even in the fact of the 
obvious negative consequences these behaviors would have for his case. And his 
lies to the jury about what happened at the time of the crime at the guilt 
phase were living exemplars of his incapacity to engage in socially appropriate 
behavior at the very time where there was absolutely nothing to be gained, and 
all to be lost, by readily transparent dissimulation. In short, Robert Harris 
couldn't make, even when his life depended on it, a judgment considerate of 
social conventions. 
</P>
<P>
Without the evidence that Robert Harris has brain damage, organic personality 
disorder, fetal alcohol effects and PTSD, the jury which convicted him and 
sentenced him to death was thus fundamentally misled. Without the State's 
misleading evidence to rely on, the jury could not help but conclude that 
Robert was, in truth, the mean-spirited, evil man which he appeared to be and 
which the prosecution said he was. Had the jury known instead that multiple, 
severe physical and emotional disabilities, not "a cold and calculated heart," 
produced Robert's repugnant behaviors, it would not, in all reasonable 
likelihood, have convicted Robert of capital murder or condemned him to die.

DEATH PENALTY TWO VIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
IS THERE JUSTICE IN THE GAS CHAMBER?; 
</P>
<P>
IT IS DISTORTING OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR POLITICS, AND PROVING TO BE AN 
ENORMOUS BURDEN FOR OUR SOCIETY TO BEAR.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOSEPH R. GRODIN, Joseph R. Grodin is a professor of law at Hastings College 
of Law and a former associate justice of the California Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now it is the federal courts that Gov. George Deukmejian finds "incompetent" in 
their administration of the death penalty, the state courts apparently having 
performed to the governor's satisfaction in the matter of Robert Alton Harris. 
But when a jurist as brilliant, morally principled and highly respected (not to 
mention conservative) as John Noonan of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
decides that a defendant has presented facts warranting a further careful look 
before we execute him, and when two-thirds of the justices of the U.S. Supreme 
Court agree, surely "incompetence" is not the explanation. Nor, given the 
background of the judges who participated, is it an unalterable opposition to 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, the explanation lies in the nature of the death penalty itself -- 
its irreversibility and, more fundamentally, its profound tension with the 
value that our civilization attaches to human life. Capital punishment is 
different from other sanctions, and the difference ought to, and apparently 
does, make those who are responsible for its implementation exceedingly 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that there are many people, and especially the families of 
victims, who regard this caution as excessive. We have created a system in 
which we look to the death penalty as the way of bringing about "justice" and 
"closure," and as long as we continue to accept those definitions, we will 
continue to be frustrated. This is so because even if we can expedite some 
aspects of death penalty appeals, unless we forsake our Constitution and our 
principles of fairness entirely, it will still take many years from the date of 
judgment to the date of execution. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, the death penalty is distorting our institutions and our politics. 
It has proved to be an enormous burden for our society to bear, not only 
financially but also in terms of social costs and the strain on our democratic 
values of life and equality. And, paradoxically, all of this is true because we 
continue to be a civilized people, unwilling to accept casually the taking of 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
Other democracies seem to have solved the problem of providing justice and 
closure to the friends and relatives of the victims through sanctions short of 
death. In California, while the polls are inconclusive, there appears to be 
substantial support for the alternative of life without possibility of parole, 
so long as people can be certain that the defendant will stay in prison and 
that the proceeds of his labor will go to compensate the families of victims. 
Instead of focusing on the death penalty, where the political harvest is 
immediate but tainted, responsible leaders should help us move in a direction 
less costly and more compatible with our democratic traditions.

EMBATTLED COLLEGE TRUSTEE FACES INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIT: TOM ELY, A SIMI VALLEY REPUBLICAN WHO IS A CANDIDATE FOR COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR, IS THE TARGET OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE 
MISAPPROPRIATION OF COLLEGE DISTRICT FUNDS. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has become the target of a 
county criminal probe into possible misappropriation of several thousand 
dollars in district funds, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said his office received a copy Tuesday of an audit of Ely's district 
expense records, which "raised sufficient concern for us to elevate the matter 
from inquiry status to a criminal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury would not reveal details of the alleged misappropriations nor would he 
discuss what criminal charges Ely might face. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to speculate on charges at this point," Bradbury said. "The 
issue is the possibility of misappropriation of government funds, of college 
district funds." 
</P>
<P>
Ely laughed when The Times informed him of the criminal probe and replied: "Oh 
really? Good." 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Simi Valley Republican, a candidate for the 4th District county 
supervisor seat, said he is not concerned by the investigation. "It's typical 
Mike Bradbury, trying to get public press coverage," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ely said he received a copy of the two-page audit and the financial records 
supporting it from district Chancellor Barbara Derryberry on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, there is not one implication of impropriety in the audit," said 
Ely, a trustee since 1979. "There are questions relative to the existence of 
receipts because the office of district administrative services either is doing 
a poor job of keeping the records sent to them, or the auditor was not 
understanding the effects and facts that were relative to the expenses." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ely would not comment further on which expenses were cited by auditors 
for the firm of Soares, Sandall, Bernacchi &amp; Petrovich. 
</P>
<P>
Derryberry declined to comment Wednesday on the contents of the audit, saying, 
"The trustees have not seen a copy yet. We're still in the process of doing the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Derryberry said the trustees expect Ely to give them a written response to the 
audit within two weeks. The audit and the response will then be forwarded to 
the full board, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The board commissioned the audit two weeks ago after learning of Ely's alleged 
gambling activities and after a disclosure that he used district telephones to 
call hotels and casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that he owed $3,000 in gambling debts to the Edgewater Hotel and 
Casino in Laughlin, Nev. In February, the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas 
sued Ely over alleged gambling debts of $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement source has told The Times that Ely had incurred a total of 
about $40,000 in gambling debts at a number of Las Vegas casinos and hotels.

TEACHER OF YEAR FROM SAN DIEGO LAUDED BY BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President Bush on Wednesday presented a crystal apple and a note of thanks to 
Janis T. Gabay of San Diego's Junipero Serra High School, the 1990 National 
Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 17 years, she has developed her power to motivate minds, to give 
kids a sense of wonder and bless them with a life of possibilities unimagined 
in ordinary moments," Bush said of Gabay. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Gabay, an English teacher, also was praised by Bill Honig, the 
California superintendent of public instruction, and Tom Payzant, 
superintendent of San Diego city schools. 
</P>
<P>
Gabay, standing on a box to see over Bush's lectern, fought back tears as she 
accepted the award, along with a handshake from the President and a kiss from 
Barbara Bush. She thanked officials for providing "a credible and assertive 
voice to this nation's concerns about education." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration originally had planned a Rose Garden ceremony for Gabay 
until bad weather forced the festivities to an auditorium in the Old Executive 
Office Building, next to the White House. Gabay and Secretary of Education 
Lauro Cavazos sat on stage, in front of an audience of members of the local 
congressional delegation, education officials and 10 of Gabay's relatives, as 
they waited for the President and Mrs. Bush to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Bush also introduced and praised a 100-year-old retired 
teacher, John Morton-Finney of Indianapolis, as "America's most seasoned 
scholar." Finney, Bush said, "taught school until he was 81" and now continues 
to practice law and attend law school seminars. "If he's still ready and 
willing to learn," the President said, "so can we all be." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, Gabay "understands that a real education goes far beyond 
acquiring skills. It instills a lifelong love of learning." 
</P>
<P>
Gabay, a 17-year veteran of the San Diego Unified School District, first came 
to the city from her native Hawaii as a child. She attended San Diego city 
schools, receiving her high school diploma from Madison High, then earned a 
bachelor's degree, a secondary teaching credential, a specialist teaching 
credential in gifted education and a community college instructor credential at 
San Diego State University.

POLICE CONCEDE THE POSSIBILITY OF SERIAL KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THEY ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE FATAL STABBINGS OF THREE 
YOUNG WOMEN IN CLAIREMONT MAY BE THE WORK OF THE SAME KILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators for the San Diego Police Department conceded for the first time 
Wednesday that Tuesday's killing in a Clairemont apartment complex may be 
related to two other stabbing slayings of young women in the same area since 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, police had been reluctant to comment on the growing fears 
about a serial killer stalking young women in the sprawling rows of apartment 
buildings on Clairemont Drive and Cowley Way. All three of the killings have 
occurred within two blocks in the residential neighborhood, which consists 
largely of apartment buildings in an area not far from Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
A statement prepared by the Police Department Wednesday said that, "because of 
two other similar cases in recent months, police do not discount the 
possibility that the crimes may be related." 
</P>
<P>
Police also announced that the probable weapon in Tuesday's killing -- a knife 
-- was found outside the one-bedroom apartment at 3410 Cowley Way, where 
18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was found stabbed to death in unit No. 3 at 
12:35 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said a 15-year-old boy, walking home from school, found the knife 
in an alley behind the apartment Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr, an aspiring actress and high school senior from Okemos, Mich., was in San 
Diego during spring break, visiting her brother, Richard Tarr, whom General 
Dynamics officials identified Wednesday as an engineer in the company's space 
systems division. 
</P>
<P>
Frank DeWald, choral director at Okemos High School and Kinawa Middle School in 
Okemos, said he had taught Tarr for seven years and considered her his most 
cherished student in a lengthy career. He said she had appeared in numerous 
productions since sixth grade, the most recent of which was the lead in a 
musical, "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody." 
</P>
<P>
DeWald said the last time he saw her, in his office last Thursday, just before 
she left for San Diego, "she stepped in to say how excited she was to sing this 
aria from an opera called 'The Tender Land' by Aaron Copeland. Her character 
was that of a young girl about to graduate from high school. She's singing 
about her future, and I'll always remember the last line of the piece, which 
asks, 'What will the future bring?' " 
</P>
<P>
A family friend of the Tarrs, who asked not to be quoted by name, said that 
Holly and a woman friend had come to San Diego "to visit Rich and the woman he 
lives with, who's also his fiancee." Spring break at Okemos High School lasts 
for a week, and, the friend said, Holly was scheduled back in class on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr's death, coming after two similar recent killings, has terrified 
neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of similarities in each of these cases," police spokeswoman 
Dorothy Powell said. "We can't discount the possibility that the three may have 
been committed by the same person. All of the victims were young women. All 
were students. All were murdered in upstairs apartments. And all were stabbed 
during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said authorities are looking for an "old, battered, small car" coated 
with "oxidized or primer paint and resembling a (Ford) Pinto (sedan), which may 
be involved in the crime." She said witnesses saw the suspect running west from 
the scene, and one man has said the suspect started a gray Pinto and drove 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Powell described the suspect as a "black male in his late teens, medium build, 
5-foot-8 to 5-foot-11, with short hair, wearing a red T-shirt and black 
Levi's." Police said the T-shirt was later found in a canyon near the Buena 
Vista Gardens apartments, where Tarr died from what the San Diego County 
Coroner termed "a single stab wound to the chest." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, Tiffany Paige Schultz, a 20-year-old English major at San Diego 
State University, was found dead in her apartment at 3187 Cowley Way, two 
blocks from where Tarr was killed. The autopsy report notes that Schultz was 
stabbed more than 50 times, and that some of the wounds were as deep as 6 1/2 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 16, Janene Marie Weinhold, a 21-year-old senior at UC San Diego, was 
found dead in her apartment at 3301 Clairemont Drive. The coroner lists 
Weinhold's cause of death as "stab wounds to the chest." 
</P>
<P>
Although the autopsy report on Schultz has been released, a deputy coroner said 
Wednesday that the inquiry into Weinhold's death has been sealed, at the 
request of homicide detectives, and will not be released or commented on. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours after Schultz's killing, her fiance, Christopher Jon Burns, a 
28-year-old construction worker with whom she shared the apartment in the 
Canyon Ridge complex next to Buena Vista Gardens, was arrested on suspicion of 
murder and held for five days in County Jail. Burns was released when the 
district attorney failed to issue a murder complaint. He has not been 
rearrested and has steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Weinhold's killing, homicide investigators said they continued to 
believe Schultz's death was "domestic in nature." Authorities maintained that 
the first two slayings were probably not related. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, police and almost everyone connected with the case conceded that 
evidence now points to a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a serial killer -- and it sure looks like it -- such killings can 
occur a dozen or 2 dozen times before the suspect is finally caught," said City 
Councilman Bruce Henderson, whose District 6 includes the neighborhood of the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said an elderly tenant, who lives downstairs from Richard Tarr's 
unit, heard a woman scream and notified the rental office. 
</P>
<P>
That woman has been identified as 84-year-old Elizabeth Langworthy, one of the 
last people to see Holly Tarr alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I pushed her hair back, and she rolled her eyes, and she tried to speak, but 
she just let out this gurgling noise like she was breathing through liquid," 
Langworthy told the San Diego Tribune. "And then she was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that Tarr died in a paramedic's arms. 
</P>
<P>
After Langworthy's call, the rental office summoned to the scene a 58-year-old 
maintenance man named Richard Williams. Williams said he briefly confronted the 
suspect, who wore a cloth bag over his head and a knife held high. 
</P>
<P>
"She screamed, and I thought, 'Well, she's inside, she probably just fell 
down,' " Williams said Wednesday, after a sleepless night. "I hit the door, and 
it opened right up. I took two to three steps, and the guy came out with a 
knife. I backed up and fell into a breezeway. I kicked at him, thought I'd mess 
him up or knock him down the stairs, but he was too far away. I couldn't reach 
him. He was probably more scared than I was." 
</P>
<P>
Williams made no mention of a security guard following him to the unit, and the 
question was raised about why he was summoned and not the beefed-up security 
detail that Buena Vista Gardens hired after the killing of Weinhold. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Rosborough, a spokeswoman for Anza Management Co., which oversees Buena 
Vista Gardens, where the second and third slayings occurred, and Canyon Ridge, 
where Schultz was slain, said Williams simply showed up first, before security 
guards could get there. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a voice pager and knew the address," she said. "The security guards had 
a digital pager and had to ask the address." 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding similarities in the three crimes, police spokeswoman Powell 
said, "It's entirely possible the first one (Schultz's killing) was not related 
to the second one, or the third one. It's all speculation at this point to say 
what is or isn't about any of these deaths." 
</P>
<P>
Tarr was a bright, well-liked teen-ager described by almost everyone who knew 
her as "talented," "extraordinary" or "very popular." Holly Suzanne Tarr had 
appeared in many school productions and had made frequent appearances on the 
stages of community theaters in nearby Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Her credits included "Carousel," "Charlotte's Web" and "Heidi." She and her 
father had recently auditioned for twin lead roles in the musical, "The 
Fantasticks." She was scheduled to return to school for the lead role in 
"Singin' in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Paul Tarr of Lansing, is divorced from her mother, Dorothy Rubin, 
with whom Holly and her stepfather lived in nearby Okemos. Holly was the 
youngest of three children, including Richard and her older sister, Christy, 
who is an actress in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly was sensational," said DeWald, her longtime mentor. "She was almost the 
perfect student. She was extremely talented. She sang, played the violin, acted 
and had a wonderful stage presence. She used her talent very, very well, which 
not every student will do. 
</P>
<P>
"She also had a wonderful attitude. She was not conceited or standoffish and 
had many, many friends. I think everyone admired her, and there wasn't the 
jealousy that sometimes results when students are so gifted." 
</P>
<P>
DeWald said that Tarr planned to attend the University of Michigan in the fall, 
majoring in both music and theater. He said she was slated to be honored April 
25 as the area's Outstanding Student of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
DeWald said Okemos High School had suffered a student's suicide a couple of 
years ago, but "a murder is what we thought happened to other people. None of 
us ever dreamed such a thing could happen to Holly."

CHULA VISTA JAIL ESCAPES WORRY, ANGER RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after a jail escape in Chula Vista -- the third since Dec. 13 -- 
inmates remained at large, sparking outrage Wednesday from residents and 
merchants around the jail who are concerned that their safety is being 
compromised. 
</P>
<P>
The latest escape occurred about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday when eight inmates cut 
through a metal bar, kicked out a window and then, using bedsheets, lowered 
themselves 35 feet to the ground. One of the escapees was captured when a Chula 
Vista policeman cornered him in the back yard of a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
Despite new security procedures that were authorized after 13 inmates escaped 
last month, area residents and community leaders are growing increasingly angry 
that not enough is being done to keep inmates inside the jail. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is in a crisis mode with its jail system," Chula Vista Mayor Greg 
Cox said Wednesday, a day in which his office was deluged with telephone calls 
from citizens worried for their safety. "This situation is intolerable. It's 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
In the three jailbreaks since December, 28, inmates have slid or sawed their 
way out of the jail. Eleven inmates remain at large. Several of the escapees 
had been jailed on murder charges. One of Tuesday night's escapees -- Roberto 
Cruz Loza -- is the alleged Blockbuster bandit who is suspected of robbing more 
than a dozen San Diego County video stores in four months. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the eight men who escaped Tuesday night had been charged with past 
escapes, and a third man had been charged with attempted escape. 
</P>
<P>
Built just eight years ago, the South Bay jail was originally to handle only 
pretrial detainees. Today it is three times over capacity and houses a large 
number of convicted felons bound for state prison. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Wednesday whether the rash of jailbreaks in Chula Vista is a 
record among county jails in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it is a real problem for county jails all over the nation," said 
Al Cooper, a spokesman for the California State Sheriff's Assn. "What's 
happenning is that the inmates spend all of their time figuring out how to get 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Mandeville, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, added: 
"As far as that being a record, I don't know. But three breaks in four months 
does seem like a lot. That's a lot of people getting out." 
</P>
<P>
That fact is not lost on Chula Vista community leaders, residents and 
merchants, many of whom said Wednesday that it seems that more inmates are 
breaking out of the jail these days than are going in. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Paul, 35, who lives with her husband at the El Primero Hotel just a 
block from the jail, said she came home Tuesday night as Sheriff's Department 
helicopters and police cars were converging around her building. 
</P>
<P>
"It concerns me because some of these people are murderers," she said, peeking 
through a slightly opened door. "It concerns me when these people are charged 
with murder and are breaking out of jail. What about people's safety? It's 
frightening. It really is." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Mora and her daughter, Julie, are used to seeing inmates who are 
legitimately released from the jail come straight to their convenience store to 
buy beer and cigarettes. But they do not like jail escapees running through the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"My employees are worried," said Marilyn Mora, the store owner. "We don't have 
a gun that we keep here, but we do have a bat. But who knows what the inmates 
are armed with?" 
</P>
<P>
Said her daughter, Julie, who was working the late shift Tuesday, "This has got 
me real scared. They could have been anywhere around the store." 
</P>
<P>
The recent series of jailbreaks began Dec. 5, when seven inmates escaped by 
covering their bodies with hand lotion and squeezing through a 6-inch window 
opening on the third floor. They tied together bedsheets and shinnied 80 feet 
to the ground. As of Wednesday, two of those escapees were still missing. 
</P>
<P>
The second incident occurred March 7 in what was the county's largest jailbreak 
ever. Thirteen inmates broke out that night, and four remain at large today. 
They sawed through two bars, each about 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick, 
then smashed the bars through a second-floor plate glass window. 
</P>
<P>
That same scenario was replayed Tuesday night, when eight inmates from a nearby 
cell sawed through the bars, kicked out a window, then lowered themselves on 
bedsheets 35 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not been determined yet what they used to cut through the steel bars," 
said Deputy Robbie Hill. "It hasn't been determined what tools were used or how 
the tools were brought into the facility. Or they could have used something 
already in the facility." 
</P>
<P>
The second jailbreak prompted county officials to spend $251,000 to upgrade 
security measures at the jail, which were still being put in place at the time 
of Tuesday night's escape. The new security measures include guards posted 
outside, fencing around the outside perimeter, electronic vibration sensors to 
detect sawing or breaking of metal, more cameras and monitors and extra alarm 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
John Woodard, chief of staff for County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, whose 
district includes Chula Vista, says his office wants the security work 
completed more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We want it done faster," Woodard said. "We've had quite a few phone calls 
today, at this point about 40. And that's the most we've ever got in any 
compressed period of time. The residents down there are saying that this many 
escapes is enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bud Pocklington, who lives near the jail and has beseeched the Chula Vista City 
Council to force the county to improve security at the jail, was recently 
nominated to a citizen's committee to ensure safety in the neighborhood. A 
public meeting with county and sheriff's officials is scheduled for Monday to 
address the residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Pocklington said Wednesday that many elderly residents genuinely fear they will 
be harmed by escapees. 
</P>
<P>
"If they tried to put something like that jail in here today, we wouldn't stand 
for it," he said. "There are a lot of elderly people around here. One elderly 
lady was out walking her dog when the prisoners broke out last night." 
</P>
<P>
The jail, at 500 3rd Avenue, is in a residential and commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
The inmate who was recaptured Tuesday night was arrested after a short foot 
chase not far from the jail. He is Johnnie Smith, 20, who is charged with 
possession of a controlled substance and is being held under no bail. 
</P>
<P>
The other seven escapees being sought and the charges that they were being held 
on, are: 
</P>
<P>
Loza, 31, the alleged Blockbuster video bandit, armed robbery; Fernando 
Martinez, 24, attempted escape, driving under the influence of intoxicants, 
possession of narcotics for sale; Manuel Salmeron, 28, two counts of murder and 
robbery; Yldefonso Barahona, 19, murder and assault with a deadly weapon; 
Arturo Robles, 29, escape and damage to jail property; Jorge Renteria, 28, 
burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest; Salvador

<P>
The board of Ventura County's largest water district declared war on the waste 
of the precious liquid Wednesday as the area enters its fourth year of drought. 
</P>
<P>
"We must save, save, save," said James A. Hubert, engineer-manager of the 
Calleguas Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Although current supplies will meet this year's needs, Hubert said, a 
continuing drought could cause a shortage of 3,000 to 4,000 acre-feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Hubert said most home water waste comes from toilets, showers, watering lawns 
and washing cars. 
</P>
<P>
Calleguas directors voted to declare May "Water Awareness Month" and two weeks 
ago endorsed a call by the district's supplier, the Metropolitan Water 
District, for increased conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Information on saving water is available from the Ventura County Water 
Conservation Office, (805) 654-2471 or 654-2440. GLENN BRIGGS

<P>
About 75 firearms impounded by Santa Paula authorities since last July will be 
sold at public auction, rather than destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is in timesaving," Police Chief Walter Adair said. "The sale will 
be more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
While selling the guns will contribute little cash to the city, Adair said, the 
new procedure will prove more economical for Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council authorized the new procedures earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Auctioneer Roger Ernst said the city can recoup 75% of the proceeds from guns 
that are sold, usually to gunsmiths who use their parts for repair. JANET

LAGOMARSINO SEEKS WATER SOURCE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of emergency sources of water -- including the use of portable military 
desalination plants -- was proposed Wednesday by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ojai). 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a congressional subcommittee, Lagomarsino listed several of 
the options to be considered, including the use of portable desalination plants 
in extreme emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the fourth year of a drought, and we need to explore all the 
possibilities," Lagomarsino said. 
</P>
<P>
John Doherty, an aide to Lagomarsino, said it might be May before the House 
Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water decides whether to finance the 
$300,000 study. "We hope we can start it in the meantime and reimburse the Army 
Corps of Engineers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said the Corps has indicated a willingness to do "a quick survey" 
that could take "three to six months." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the options that could aid Ventura County, according to Lagomarsino's 
office, would be the desalination plants and an exchange agreement with water 
officials in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
"There are over 100 unused desalination plants at Army bases in California, 
capable of producing 14,000 gallons a day each," Lagomarsino said. "It would be 
expensive -- about $43 a month to supply a family of four -- but if there's no 
other way of getting water, it becomes a viable option." 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said the desalination plants, which filter seawater into usable water, 
have been used in the past by Marines and the U.S. naval base in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange agreement between water districts could benefit Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties, Doherty said. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara County has an entitlement to state water but doesn't have a 
pipeline," he said. "Ventura County would get the water and give some of it to 
Santa Barbara." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WIDENING OF ROAD NEARS COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The expansion of Olsen Road to four lanes at the Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley 
city limits is expected to be finished by the end of April, the Simi Valley 
director of public works said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The director, Ron Coons, said the Wood Ranch developer who is widening the road 
in both cities expects it to be finished this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council agreed Tuesday to pay the $30,000 needed for the 
grading, paving, striping and landscaping costs of the expansion on its portion 
of the road. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Simi Valley had rejected a Thousand Oaks proposal to widen Olsen Road 
because it was concerned about traffic diversions from the Ventura 
Freeway-widening project, according to a report from John Clement, Thousand 
Oaks director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1989 Simi Valley approved a development permit for a day-care center on 
Olsen Road, on condition that the developer make road improvements on the Simi 
Valley side. Simi Valley agreed to have the developer improve the Thousand Oaks 
portion of Olsen Road only if Thousand Oaks funded the improvement, Clement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out to be a very good arrangement," Coons said. "The cities are 
working well together." DAWN PURCELL

2 SIDES SUBMIT BALLOT ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In final ballot arguments submitted Wednesday, opponents of a proposed 5% 
Oxnard utility tax contend that it would not be needed if city government would 
only operate more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the tax, including Councilman Manuel M. Lopez and Police 
Chief Robert P. Owens, say in their ballot arguments that the tax is essential 
to restoring badly needed police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which would cost the average household about $4 per month, would 
generate about $5 million annually for the city. An election is scheduled June 
5. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the additional revenue would be used to make up for a 
growing deficit and to fatten the emergency reserve fund, which has dropped by 
about $9 million over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
The tax was recommended in a recent management audit, which projected a city 
deficit of between $27 million and $67.5 million by 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the tax, including the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and a group of 
residents and business owners who call themselves Oxnard Residents for 
Responsible Government, blame the city's financial woes on government 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
According to their ballot argument, opponents also reject the measure because 
it would "approve a permanent utility tax to solve a temporary budget problem." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure say the financial problems stem from a decline in 
revenues and an increase in expenses. As a result, they say, the city has had 
to make cuts in police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the financial restraints, Lt. Tom Kady said that over the last year, 
the Oxnard Police Department has about 11 police positions unfilled, including 
four officers in the drunk-driving enforcement unit. The department has 155 
sworn officers. HUGO MARTIN

SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED IN WAKE OF SURPRISINGLY STRONG RAINSTORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The showers that drenched San Diego County are expected to be gone today, 
giving way to sunny afternoon skies that should last through the weekend, 
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly strong storm that began Tuesday night and continued through 
Wednesday morning caused nearly 100 minor traffic accidents throughout the 
area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although occasionally heavy rain fell in some parts of the county, the official 
measuring station at Lindbergh Field recorded only .30 inches of rain during 
the storm, National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Atkin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, slippery roads caused 98 traffic accidents, many of them during rush 
hour Wednesday morning, leaving Interstates 5 and 15 jammed for miles, 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Tim Santillan said. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
On I-5 near Hill Street in Oceanside, a van skidded into the center divider and 
overturned. On I-5 near La Costa Avenue in Carlsbad, a car spun into the center 
divider and landed sideways, and another driver braked and slid into the car. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly 8,000 customers experienced temporary power outages Wednesday 
morning, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. spokeswoman Laura Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
In Clairemont, 3,500 customers were without power for more than a hour 
beginning at 7:30 a.m. after a tree branch hit an electrical line. The same 
problem occurred in Mission Valley at 7:40 a.m., leaving another 3,500 
customers without power for almost an hour and a half. In La Jolla, 950 
customers were without power from 5:30 to 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure if the outages were storm-related," Farmer said. "Water on the 
lines could have broken them or made them hang low." 
</P>
<P>
Forecaster Atkin said, "We were expecting light showers, but heavy showers fell 
on and off from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning." 
</P>
<P>
The total rainfall for the season that began in July is 6.0 inches. The normal 
total for this date is 8.40 inches. Del Mar received the most rainfall with .62 
inches, and Mt. Laguna got the least with .13. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the seasonal cloudy mornings and sunny afternoons will 
continue today and throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs will range from the low to mid-70s today, with coastal highs 
ranging from the upper 60s to low 70s and mountain temperatures ranging from 
the mid-50s to low 60s.

ROCKWELL CALLS OFF ITS FINAL NUCLEAR TEST AT HOT LAB; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: THE COMPANY ENDS A LONG-RUNNING BATTLE BY ANNOUNCING THAT IT HAS 
CONTRACTED FOR REMAINING WORK TO BE DONE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI'S 
REACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a surprise announcement Wednesday, Rockwell International called off plans 
to carry out a final nuclear experiment at the hot lab of its Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, a victory for anti-nuclear activists. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said it has contracted for the work to be done instead at the 
University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended a long-running battle with anti-nuclear and homeowner 
activists opposed to Rockwell's request to renew a nuclear materials license so 
the experiment, known as the TRUMP-S, could be done before decommissioning of 
the hot lab, a heavily shielded workshop where nuclear materials are handled by 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Peter B. Bloch, the administrative law judge presiding over the license case, 
said Rockwell asked Wednesday to withdraw its license application and that he 
promptly dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
That means Rockwell no longer is authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to handle nuclear materials in the hot lab, except as part of 
decontamination and decommissioning work, Bloch said. Rockwell has estimated 
that cleanup will cost $11 million and be finished in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear activists who had fought to stop TRUMP-S had mixed emotions about 
Wednesday's announcement, saying they were glad the work will not be done at 
the Santa Susana complex but that they are concerned about safety risks in 
Missouri. However, Missouri officials said they were enthusiastic about the 
project, aimed at developing a process to shrink high-level nuclear waste, for 
which there are no permanent disposal sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell released copies of letters from top Missouri politicians endorsing the 
work in Columbia, Mo., at the school's research nuclear reactor, which Rockwell 
said is the nation's largest university research reactor. The arrangement was 
first disclosed Wednesday in Missouri, and a university spokesman said he did 
not expect the community opposition that the work encountered in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is going to contribute to a better understanding of how to deal 
with a major environmental problem," said Marty Oetting, the university 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
TRUMP-S, which stands for Transuranic Management by 
Pyropartitioning-Separation, is an effort to separate the most long-lived 
fractions of nuclear waste from short-lived ones through electrochemical 
reactions. The idea is to greatly reduce the volume of waste requiring 
perpetual isolation, making it possible to bury much of the waste in existing 
low-level radioactive waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell remains responsible for the TRUMP-S work under an agreement with the 
Japanese nuclear industry that will be worth $8 million to $10 million through 
1993. The company will continue to do engineering and chemistry for the project 
at Santa Susana without using nuclear material, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Wednesday, the university will carry out the part 
of the work that involves handling small amounts of plutonium, uranium and 
other radioactive substances. The university will receive about $2 million to 
$3 million for that part of the project, a Rockwell official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under contracts with the former Atomic Energy Commission and the U.S. 
Department of Energy, Rockwell once operated small nuclear reactors at Santa 
Susana and recycled spent nuclear fuel. The several grams of plutonium involved 
in TRUMP-S is considerably less than the amount Rockwell formerly handled in 
the hot lab. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sewell, spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which operates the 
Santa Susana lab, denied that pressure from anti-nuclear opponents caused the 
company to move the nuclear part of the work. Because Rockwell sought to renew 
the NRC license only through October, 1990, it eventually had to find another 
place to complete the contract, Sewell said. And he said the arrangement with 
the university clears the way for Rockwell to pursue additional TRUMP-S 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a business decision," Sewell said. "It wasn't based on the activists, 
or anything they said or did." 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los 
Angeles-based group that had fought the license renewal, called the move "a 
great victory and an indication that concerned members of the public can make a 
real difference." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch added that he was "not particularly happy about transferring risk from 
me to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
"It made my day, to be honest with you," but "I hate to see my friends in 
Missouri be stuck," said Jon Scott, a resident of Bell Canyon in eastern 
Ventura County and an intervenor in the license case. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Saxon of Los Angeles Physicians for Social Responsibility 
criticized moving the work to a college campus, and questioned the value of 
TRUMP-S because it is aimed at cutting the volume but not the radioactivity of 
nuclear waste. Saxon said he was against any project that could help resurrect 
the nuclear industry, which he called terribly dangerous even if its waste 
problem were solved. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear industry has been moribund for years, due to cost overruns at 
atomic plants, public fear of nuclear accidents and lack of permanent, safe 
waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of nuclear power hope it will win environmental acceptance as 
concern grows about carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels causing a 
greenhouse effect and as better ways are found to manage nuclear wastes. 
</P>
<P>
When the hot lab license lapsed last June, Rockwell first applied for a 10-year 
renewal. But facing community opposition and limited business for the hot lab, 
the company last fall amended the request, asking for a one-year renewal to do 
the TRUMP-S work through October. 
</P>
<P>
But most opponents of the 10-year relicensing request also fought the one-year 
renewal, contending that the public would be at risk if plutonium escaped 
during the TRUMP-S work. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said late last year that it would seek an alternative site for 
TRUMP-S, but in the meantime fought for the right to start the project in the 
hot lab this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell disclosed Wednesday that Rockwell had looked at more than 100 different 
facilities in the United States before reaching an agreement with the 
University of Missouri. In a news release, the university said it edged out the 
University of Michigan for the TRUMP-S work. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, Missouri's Republican Sens. John C. Danforth and 
Christopher Bond, and Rep. Harold L. Volkmer (D-Mo.) all wrote to Rockwell in 
January, urging the company to pick the school, according to letters released 
by Rockwell.

DESTROYER INVOLVED IN WRECK TO RETURN TO S.D.; 
</P>
<P>
THE NAVY: THE KINKAID WILL UNDERGO MORE REPAIRS AFTER COLLISION THAT LED TO 
STAND DOWN OF ALL NAVY SHIPS LAST FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Navy destroyer Kinkaid will return to its San Diego home port 
Saturday, after crashing into a merchant ship in the Strait of Malacca last 
fall and undergoing $7 million in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The collision killed the ship's navigator, injured five sailors, led to the 
court-martial of the duty officer and derailed the career of its 
then-commanding officer. It was also the last in a string of mishaps that led 
to the first Navywide safety stand-down last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid's commanding officer, Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, was relieved of duty 
five months ago by Vice Adm. H. H. Mauz, head of the Seventh Fleet, who said at 
the time that he "had lost confidence" in Cochrane's "ability to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, a San Diego resident, is scheduled to be court-martialed later this 
month, said Lt. Ken Wensing, a spokesman for the Seventh Fleet. Navy officials 
declined to explain the reasons for Cochrane's court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
The duty officer, Lt. (j.g.) Steven M. Williams, 25, was dismissed from the 
Navy in a court-martial after receiving a punitive letter of reprimand in 
February, Wensing said. Williams, the officer of the deck, was found guilty of 
dereliction of duty and negligently hazarding a vessel in charges associated 
with the collision. Navy officials declined to explain what Williams had done 
that resulted in those findings. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was found not guilty of willful failure to obey a lawful command with 
regard to notifying Commanding Officer Cochrane of a navigational situation. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kinkaid smashed into the merchant ship in the predawn darkness in 
November, Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, was killed as he slept in his bunk. His 
death brought the year's toll to 102 Navy personnel killed in training and 
operational procedures -- the highest in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although the collison occurred almost six months ago, officials say they don't 
know what caused it. They are still reviewing the investigation of the 
collision, which punched a 56-foot-by-15-foot hole in the Kinkaid's side, said 
Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Smallwood, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid, manned by 330 officers and sailors, will pull into Pier 7 at the 
32nd Street Naval Station Saturday morning -- having completed the 8,000-mile, 
19-day voyage from Singapore. The vessel was scheduled to return to San Diego 
four months ago, but the crash made it unfit for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
About $6 million in repairs were done on the destroyer at the Navy's Subic Bay 
base in the Philippines, Smallwood said. The vessel sailed to Singapore from 
the Philippines, where a private company placed a $1-million patch on the 
ship's gaping hole. 
</P>
<P>
But the repairs are not yet complete. In San Diego, the Kinkaid will undergo 
another estimated $2 million of work that will take place over seven weeks, 
Smallwood said. The Navy will soon be asking companies to bid on the project, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the Kinkaid was on its way from the Indian Ocean 
for a port call in Singapore. About 240 miles northwest of Singapore, the 
563-foot Kinkaid collided with the Kota Petani, a 493-foot Panamanian freighter 
that was leaving Singapore for the Middle East. No one aboard the Kota Petani 
was injured.

SCHOOLS: COMMUNITY RACE RELATIONS TRAINING AND AN OMBUDSMAN ARE AMONG STEPS THE 
TROUBLED HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY TAKE.

Two members of the Centinela Valley Union High School District's board of 
trustees, along with city and state officials, tried to salvage a 10-point plan 
to ease racial tensions in the school district at a hastily called gathering 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged early Wednesday after discussions of the plan at a 
special school board session the night before degenerated into shouts and 
insults. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the raucous night-time session at the school board headquarters, 
board member Pam Sturgeon described the private, morning meeting as "calm and 
level-headed." 
</P>
<P>
The two school board members at that meeting indicated their commitment to 
expand and approve the 10-point plan, which includes provisions for 
communitywide race relations training and an ombudsman to handle complaints in 
the district, according to Sturgeon, school board President Ruth Morales and 
others who were present. 
</P>
<P>
"After the chaos of the (school board) meeting, we knew we still had to 
implement the plan and had to find a different way to approach it," Sturgeon 
said in an interview Wednesday. "We are moving forward with the implementation 
of the plan." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-point plan was developed March 9 by Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) 
and other community leaders she called together to respond to massive student 
walkouts on March 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
The walkouts protested the resignation of Hawthorne High School Principal Ken 
Crowe, whom many in the racially mixed district believe is among several black 
administrators targetted for dismissal. Crowe said he resigned after being told 
he would be reassigned. He later asked the board to rescind his resignation, 
but the board instead has ordered him placed on medical leave, Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated that Tuesday's divisive board meeting had gone so badly, several 
board members and others talked that night about getting together the next day. 
The Wednesday session was arranged by phone and a group of community leaders 
gathered in private at 10 a.m. at the Hawthorne police station. 
</P>
<P>
Among those at the session were Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth; Kenneth 
Orduna, chief of staff for Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), Hawthorne 
Councilman Charles Bookhammer, Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue, school board 
members Morales and Sturgeon, police and fire officials from Hawthorne and 
Lawndale Councilwoman Carol Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Orduna said the private gathering was productive, and he is confident the 
10-point plan would bring peace to the divided district. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10-point plan will be addressed in its entirety to the satisfaction of 
everybody," Orduna said late Wednesday. "Even though the (Tuesday) meeting was 
disruptive, calm minds and dedicated hearts prevailed. The board is anxious to 
move on and get about educating the children." 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up session that is expected to include Dymally, Watson and board 
members, was scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The progress Wednesday was in contrast to the special board meeting, where more 
than 100 parents, teachers and others filled the district board room. The 
board's intention was to meet for as long as necessary, hear comments and 
suggestions from the community, then vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was angry. Though the 10-point plan was the only item on the agenda, 
many speakers expressed support for Crowe and demanded that the board rescind 
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticized, as a waste of money and effort, the board's decision last 
week to hire a private detective to find out whether any district employees 
instigated the student demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting later disintegrated into name calling and shouting matches after 
two students, pressed by members of the audience, took the podium to allege 
that some teachers have been harassing students who participated in the 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
Morales was unsuccessful in trying to control the discussion or cool the tone 
of the meeting. At one point, there was a chant of "Recall! Recall!" from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been under way less than two hours when board President Morales 
adjourned it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to be listeners . . . . But I refuse to have any meeting when in 
fact we can't listen and cannot be participants in any kind of order," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The abrupt adjournment was criticized by some parents and community activists, 
who were left in the meeting room after board members left for an executive 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the board was intolerant to what we had to say," said Laquanda Briggs, 
a member of the Committee for Racial Free Education. "We have tried for three 
months to communicate with this board, and tonight was a true example of what 
happens when we do." 
</P>
<P>
But others said the shouting and catcalls left the board with no choice but to 
cancel the meeting. "They couldn't get to the business at hand," said Linda 
Zirpoli, a Lawndale mother who has a 17-year-old son at Leuzinger High. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, who was silent during the board meeting, said afterward that he believed 
the board should have allowed the students to voice their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot condone any disruption, and I think that was unfortunate that 
occurred, but I do feel the students had something to say, and I hope at some 
point they have a chance to speak their minds," Crowe said.

P.V. ESTATES RESIDENTS FIGHT BID TO CLOSE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates residents turned out in force Wednesday to try to put the 
brakes on a proposal by some of their Torrance neighbors to close off Via 
Valmonte, one of five major access roads leading into and out of the peninsula 
city. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200 people, the vast majority of them peninsula residents, crowded 
into the Torrance City Council chambers to press their demand that Torrance 
officials prepare an environmental impact report on the proposal, which would 
close the road at the border of the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to more than two hours of testimony, the Environmental Review 
Board agreed, voting unanimously to order city planners to put together the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"Via Valmonte is our gateway to the world," one Palos Verdes Estates resident 
told the board before the vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people spoke in favor of the report. A handful of people who live 
in Torrance and Palos Verdes Estates spoke against the report, saying they 
favor closing the busy street. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance council members will ultimately decide whether to close the steep, 
S-shaped street, which motorists use as a shortcut between Hawthorne Boulevard 
and Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
For years, residents along Via Valmonte have pressured the council to erect a 
gate at the cities' borders because of increasing traffic. Last year, after the 
city's Traffic Commission recommended closing the street, the council turned 
the matter over to the Environmental Review Board before deciding the issue 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very sympathetic to the problem they have," Mayor Katy Geissert said 
before the hearing, adding that she is undecided on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Via Valmonte proposal is the latest round in the battle between Torrance 
and peninsula cities over how to handle growing traffic problems. In recent 
years, Torrance officials have complained that the cities have placed an unfair 
traffic burden on Torrance by failing to make needed roadway improvements and 
imposing restrictions on heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Torrance officials point to Rolling Hills Estates, which since the 
1970s has banned trucks weighing more than 6,000 pounds from using Palos Verdes 
Drive North, a major east-west artery. The ban forces more trucks onto Pacific 
Coast Highway in Torrance, the officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials estimate up to 6,000 vehicles use Via Valmonte each day. The 
curvy street snakes along for about 1,500 feet through a Torrance neighborhood 
before reaching the Palos Verdes Estates boundary, according to John Vance, 
traffic manager for the city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Schneider, a Torrance resident who has lived on Via Valmonte since 1968, 
said there has been a steady increase in traffic along the street in recent 
years. Many motorists speed down the narrow street, and there are frequent 
accidents, he said. Once, a car crashed into his home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who are going to be inconvenienced by (the road's closure) are 
those that live just inside the border in Palos Verdes Estates," Schneider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates officials say constructing a gate would close off one of 
five major access roads leading into their city. The road, which is most 
congested in the morning and evening when commuters use it, was built in the 
early 1920s specifically to provide access to the western part of the 
peninsula, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates City Manager James Hendrickson said in an interview that 
closing the road would create more congestion on Palos Verdes Drive North, the 
next closest major access road into the city. Moreover, residents living in the 
Valmonte neighborhood near Via Valmonte would be traveling significantly 
farther to reach Hawthorne Boulevard, and the response time for emergency 
vehicles could increase. Torrance's proposal calls for a gate that could easily 
be unlocked by emergency personnel such as firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"It befuddles us why out of the blue this proposal to close it would come at 
this time or why in fact it is being pursued," Hendrickson said. ". . . Why 
would you propose to shut a road which has been a major access as far back as 
1927?" 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has also upset some Torrance business owners. John Bauman, general 
manager of the Palos Verdes Begonia Farm, a nursery just inside the Torrance 
city limits and not far from Via Valmonte, said he is opposed to the road's 
closure because at least half his customers come from the peninsula. If those 
customers are forced to drive another route, they might choose a nursery closer 
to their homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling has always been . . . the answer is not to block off any more 
streets in the area," he said, referring to streets in the vicinity of Via 
Valmonte that have been closed because of traffic problems. "The answer, I 
believe, is to open up the streets that have been blocked off in the past."

EL SEGUNDO SUES LOS ANGELES OVER HYPERION SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Complaining of noxious odors and hazardous chemical releases, the city of El 
Segundo is suing Los Angeles to force environmental and safety improvements at 
the giant Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, asks the court to 
take jurisdiction over hazardous materials and construction projects at 
Hyperion. That would make the plant more responsive to residents' complaints 
about fumes, noise and dust, said El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks $8 million in punitive damages in connection with a March 
19 incident in which three residents near the plant suffered headaches, nausea 
and burning eyes, apparently from fumes. One woman was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn said he could not comment on 
the suit because his office had not yet received a copy. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo City Council announced in December that it would sue Los Angeles 
because of problems it blamed on Hyperion, which borders El Segundo on the 
west. The council authorized the suit March 23 after lawyers for the city had 
taken statements from more than 100 residents who complained about odors from 
the facility. Some said they suffered health problems as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the March 19 incident that prompted city leaders to unanimously 
approve the suit, said City Manager Ron Cano on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Hyperion officials covered up the causes of the chlorine 
smell that residents complained of March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials said at the time that a scrubbing device used to remove 
hydrogen sulfide gases had malfunctioned, but they added that it was unclear 
whether the problem had caused the smell cited by residents. Officials from the 
city and the South Coast Air Quality Management District said they could not 
pinpoint the source of the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that the problem stemmed from the mishandling of "chlorine or 
some other similarly harmful material" at Hyperion. In seeking the punitive 
cash damages, the city alleges that Hyperion officials "failed to be fully 
cooperative" with the El Segundo and AQMD investigators.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS IDENTIFY SPILLED SUBSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three hundred gallons of a substance spilled near the Ventura Harbor last month 
was identified Wednesday as a flammable, slightly toxic compound used in sewage 
treatment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill, under investigation by county prosecutors, has not been cleaned up, 
said Carol Green, a Ventura city official. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the city is still reviewing bids from two firms offering to clean up 
the spill, which was first reported by the county Department of Environmental 
Health on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
The substance spilled is a polymer called Clarifloc C-310, a coagulant that 
"conditions the sludge" and makes solids in sewage stick together to ease 
filtration of impurities from waste water, said Daniel E. Rayburn, 
superintendent of the nearby city waste-water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Rayburn said he has no information about the chemical properties of C-310 and 
does not know whether any sewage was in the spill at 1400 Spinnaker Drive, 
close to the treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the city's cleanup proposal first has to be approved by the 
Department of Environmental Health, the Regional Water Quality Control Board 
and state environmental agencies. The spill site is roped off but is not 
accessible to the public, he said. MACK REED

19 PEOPLE ARRESTED IN HIGH SCHOOL DRUG PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen people, including five Crawford High School students, were arrested 
Wednesday after a six-month undercover drug investigation based at the school, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second such operation in a week. On Monday, San Diego police 
arrested a total of 12 students at Point Loma and Mission Bay high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for seven other people believed to have been involved in 
the illegal sale of drugs at Crawford. In all, police have identified 26 people 
-- 11 students and 15 others -- who they say sold narcotics to a female 
undercover officer who had posed as a student at Crawford since September. 
</P>
<P>
Principal David LeMay said a police task force made the arrests beginning at 8 
a.m. Wednesday at the high school, which is in the 4100 block of Colts Way. 
Numerous arrests were also made off campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were targeting eight students, but three were absent and will be 
contacted at home," LeMay said. 
</P>
<P>
Police alleged that the 26 suspects sold cocaine, marijuana, LSD and 
methamphetamine to the officer, in a total of 40 transactions. Of the 26 
suspects, eight are minors and 18 are adults, ranging in age from 14 to 63. 
Twenty-two are males and four are females, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The minors will be released to their parents, and the adults will be booked 
into County Jail, police Lt. Skip DiCerchio said. If parents cannot be located 
or if the minors have violated probation, they will be sent to Juvenile Hall, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay said the students will be suspended for five days, then transferred to a 
home-study program until district officials hold an expulsion hearing. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay said he first learned of the undercover operation a week ago. It was the 
first such investigation at the school and the 16th at a high school in the San 
Diego Unified School District since 1983.

PEOPLE: CANCER VICTIM FINDS REPLENISHMENT AT HER POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joann Finucan leaves her Anaheim home at 4:30 every weekday morning to jump 
into her other "home," the swimming pool at the Anaheim Family YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
Some people might think the pool is her real home because she spends so much 
time there. 
</P>
<P>
It might as well be. It's named for her. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big shock when they said they were going to name the pool for me," 
said Finucan, 61, who specializes in getting senior citizens and handicapped 
youngsters into the pool for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Her years of service -- Finucan has worked at the Y pool since it opened 22 
years ago -- commitment and love for those who swim there were the reasons YMCA 
board members voted to name the pool the Joann Finucan Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
"You actually put your life into a swimming pool," she said. "It's no 9-to-5 
job. You get to be their friend, not just a teacher in the water or as a 
lifeguard. You get involved into their lives." 
</P>
<P>
While that motivates the people she instructs, it also works for her. 
</P>
<P>
"That helped me so much when I developed cancer and so many people were pulling 
for me." Finucan said that three years ago she was given five months to live 
after cancer raged through her body. After undergoing chemotherapy, the cancer 
went into remission. 
</P>
<P>
"Working and thinking positive all helped me," said the trim mother of six, who 
sometimes works nights and weekends for other instructors at the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to do something about what you think," she continued. "You can't 
just sit at home. You have to get off the davenport and do something that is 
fun every day." 
</P>
<P>
Finucan said she didn't pioneer the positive-thought method for wellness. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of people out there with cancer who are doing the same sort 
of thing and prolonging their lives," she said. "I talked with a lady today who 
had a cancer operation 17 years ago and she's still there," she said during a 
pool-side interview. 
</P>
<P>
While working with the elderly and young handicapped swimmers, "I don't have 
time to think of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Finucan has been involved in swimming since her early days in Ohio, where she 
grew up spending a lot of time in a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom wouldn't let me cross the busy street where we lived so I used to stay 
home a lot and my friends couldn't come to the cemetery to play with me." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from a family of morticians that began with her great-grandfather, 
Finucan said she had a strict upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom only allowed me to go to the Y where I was able to participate in a lot 
of sports," she said. "I especially loved swimming and now the days I don't get 
into the water I don't feel nearly as good." 
</P>
<P>
Finucan earned her physical education degree at the University of Toledo in 
1948. She planned to be a teacher before she fell in love and married while 
attending college. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years she had the first of her six children and stayed home to care 
for them after teaching one semester. 
</P>
<P>
The next time she taught was in 1968 when she was hired by the Anaheim Y. 
</P>
<P>
One day Maureen Sullivan came to work in Mission Viejo hopping mad after almost 
rear ending a driver who slowed to make a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Why can't they put something on cars to show they are 
making a U turn,' " said Sullivan, a registered nurse and Laguna Niguel 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
So with the help of Elizabeth Himelson, also a registered nurse, the duo 
patented a U-turn signal device that can be installed in the rear window of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're trying to get auto makers to buy their idea and make the device 
standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have $6,000 invested in it and we think the sky's the limit," Sullivan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Dr. Mark Sullivan, a urologist, made patents a family affair. 
About the same time, he got a patent for a condom shield to protect sex 
partners from diseases. His co-inventor is Gilbert Salz "I think our invention 
might be more marketable," said Maureen, "but you never know."

REAGAN LIBRARY TO RECEIVE BIG CHUNK OF BERLIN WALL; 
</P>
<P>
DONATION: THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL ATTEND AN APRIL 12 CEREMONY WHERE THE 
6,000-POUND PIECE WILL BE PRESENTED.

<P>
A 6,000-pound section of the Berlin Wall will become part of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous piece of the infamous wall is the first gift to be installed at 
the library, said Charles Jelloian, director of operations for the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Foundation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The section of wall will be presented to Reagan on April 12 by an East German 
organization during a special ceremony at the library site west of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent show of support for a unified Germany, officials from East and 
West Germany will be at the ceremony, said Reagan spokeswoman Cathy Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring 9 1/2 feet tall and 3 1/2 feet wide, the section was donated by the 
Berlin Wall Commemorative Group. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 1/2-mile-long Berlin Wall that divided the city of Berlin was erected by 
East Germany with help from the Soviet Union in 1961. The wall was built to 
prevent refugees from fleeing to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the wall between Brandenburg and the Allied crossing point were torn 
down in February. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not the first gift of a political nature given to Reagan, the 
wall may be the heaviest and bulkiest piece included in the museum collection, 
Jelloian said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike more than 30,000 presidential artifacts in storage, the wall section 
will immediately go into the completed portion of the library. 
</P>

However, the public will not be able to see the wall until the library opens in 
early 1991. The library is little more than half-completed.

<P>
The wall section does pose some problems in planning the exhibit that 
eventually will be stored in the 25,000-square-foot-museum, Jelloian said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navy public works personnel spilled about 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel into the 
Pacific near San Clemente Island on Wednesday, the Navy reported. 
</P>
<P>
The spill, which apparently took place at 12:30 p.m. while workers were 
transferring fuel to a truck on the Navy-owned island, was not near any 
environmentally sensitive areas, the Navy said. About 95% of the fuel 
evaporated by late Wednesday afternoon, said the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Island is about 60 miles northwest of San Diego.

MAN ARRESTED IN BOMB THREAT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda man has been arrested in connection with a bomb threat Tuesday that 
forced the evacuation of several buildings and clogged morning traffic in Van 
Nuys, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Deveraux, 36, was arrested at his home at 6:40 p.m. Tuesday, 10 hours 
after he allegedly called police and told them that he had left seven nuclear 
warheads in a brown Datsun parked outside the Church on the Way in the 14300 
block of Sherman Way, Detective Bob Muldrew said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found no explosives in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Muldrew said police traced the car, which was spray-painted with the number "7" 
and the words "Hot" and "The End," to Deveraux, who attended the church 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Deveraux confessed to police that he had called in the bomb threat, Muldrew 
said. No motive was established. 
</P>
<P>
"He just doesn't know what he's doing," Muldrew said. 
</P>
<P>
Deveraux was scheduled to be arraigned this morning in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court.

MAILER FROM PRO-GROWTH GROUP SHOWS CANDIDATE'S HISTORY OF BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pro-development group has taken aim at another of the leading challengers for 
the Palmdale City Council, sending out a mailer Wednesday showing that 
homeowner activist Patricia Alfred had financial troubles including a 
bankruptcy, liens for unpaid taxes, and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer was sponsored by the developer-backed Southern California Caucus. 
Public records checked by The Times verified that Alfred and her husband, 
Jerry, filed for bankruptcy in 1984, and in recent years incurred federal and 
state tax liens, and lawsuits over unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Alfred confirmed those problems and said she and her husband 
also had two earlier bankruptcies in 1968 and 1976. She blamed their debts on 
her medical problems and support for a daughter and granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred vowed to stay in the race, attacking the sponsor of the mailer as "such 
scum that they have to bring people's personal life into it like that and hurt 
a person's family." 
</P>
<P>
The same political group was behind a weekend mailer that disclosed the 1983 
drunk-driving conviction of city Planning Commissioner James Ledford, another 
leading challenger in the April 10 election. Ten candidates, eight challengers 
and two incumbents, are seeking two council seats. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the developers group, political consultant Tim Carey, 
had been advising Councilman Daniel Becker, one of the two councilmen seeking 
reelection. But Carey insisted Wednesday that both mailers were arranged and 
financed by his group, and not Becker's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Carey also said that Becker dismissed him as an adviser Sunday after the 
Ledford mailer. Becker and other city lawmakers had criticized it as an 
unwarranted personal attack on Ledford. But Carey said voters have the right to 
know the histories of candidates for public office. 
</P>
<P>
The latest salvo against Alfred, a 50-year-old paralegal and bookkeeper, comes 
just six days before the city's April 10 election and as most of the candidates 
are stepping up their activities. Alfred also is the president of the Joshua 
Hills Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, developers have sided strongly with the pro-growth incumbents in the 
campaign, supporting Becker, Councilman Tom Smith, and Mayor Pete Knight, who 
is seeking reelection in a separate mayoral race. In contrast, Ledford and 
Alfred say they favor tougher controls on development. 
</P>
<P>
The Alfred mailer, addressed to more than 6,600 voters in the city, recounted 
the bankruptcy, tax liens and lawsuits against Alfred and her husband under the 
title, "confidential investigators report." The mailer asked: "Is This What You 
Want Controlling Palmdale's City Finances?" 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the Alfreds filed for Chapter 7 or liquidation 
bankruptcy, under which debtors' assets can be sold off to pay bills, in July, 
1984, in federal court in Los Angeles. The case remains active, although the 
court file shows it is coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Property records show that the couple was hit with a federal tax lien in 
February, 1988, for $7,209 in unpaid taxes for 1981, 1982, 1985 and 1986, but 
that the lien was paid and removed by June, 1988. The state lien, for only $49 
in unpaid taxes and penalties from 1979, was filed in 1986 and paid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Court records also showed a 1984 Municipal Court judgment against the couple 
for $991.95 related to an unpaid hospital bill incurred by Patricia Alfred. At 
least two other lawsuits for unpaid debts also were filed against the couple, 
but their outcomes were not immediately available.

GLENDALE COLLEGE WORKERS VOTE TO END MERIT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers at Glendale Community College have voted to scrap the merit system that 
regulated hiring, firing and promotion of the college's clerical, custodial and 
other non-faculty employees, school officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One-hundred and fifty-nine of the college's 243 classified workers voted to 
overturn the system. 
</P>
<P>
The change takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The merit system was run by a three-member commission that oversaw hiring and 
testing procedures, promotions and employee complaints. The appointed 
commissioners operated independently of the Board of Education and the district 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The system had been in place at the college since 1981 when residents voted to 
separate the institution from the Glendale Unified School District, where the 
system has been in effect for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need the merit system," said Carolyn Payne, chairwoman of the 
Equitable Personnel Practices Task Force, an advisory committee that worked to 
overturn the merit system. "With the merit system, we had problem areas in 
testing, interviewing and hiring. They worked against us more often than for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said personnel matters can now be handled more efficiently by the 
college's board of trustees working with Supt. John A. Davitt. "We will now 
have one governing body for handling personnel problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar attempt in March to overturn the merit system in the Glendale Unified 
School District fell 66 votes short of the majority required.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 ARRESTED IN DEATH OF LANCASTER MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Lancaster residents were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of killing a 
Lancaster man whose body was found near the Antelope Valley Freeway last month, 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies raided the residences of Kenneth Massi, 33; George Costello, 34, and 
Christopher Dixon, 28 -- who live in separate units of the same Lancaster 
apartment complex -- and arrested the three men after finding evidence linking 
them to the slaying of Kyle McCabe, 29, Deputy Bill Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe's body was found about 200 yards east of the Antelope Valley Freeway 
near G Street on March 12. He had been shot several times and stabbed 
repeatedly in the upper body, Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Linnemeyer would not release further details about the case or the nature of 
the evidence recovered in the search. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were being held without bail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station and were scheduled to be arraigned today in Antelope Valley Municipal 
Court.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN SEEKS $272,000 FOR LAKE RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) asked a key House subcommittee on 
Wednesday to earmark $272,000 for restoration of a lake and recreational 
facilities at Hansen Dam in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great demand for recreational facilities in the San Fernando 
Valley," Berman told the House Appropriations Committee's energy and water 
development subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to provide a safe alternative to the streets for city youth." 
</P>
<P>
The money is set aside in a 4-year-old federal trust fund generated by the fees 
paid by Bill Blomgren, a contractor who is digging silt from flood control 
channels. Blomgren, who sells the silt to construction firms, pays 15 cents to 
25 cents into the fund for each ton removed. 
</P>
<P>
The $272,000 represents $167,000 expected to accrue from the silt dredging this 
year and $105,000 from the trust fund appropriated by Congress last year but 
returned to the Treasury under across-the-board budget cuts imposed by the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the 1,540-acre dam area, is 
completing a master plan and environmental impact statement for revitalization 
of the long-neglected lake property, which straddles Pacoima and Lake View 
Terrace. Berman also requested that the House subcommittee specifically direct 
the Army Corps to continue the dredging operation and commit all appropriated 
federal funds to complete the long-anticipated restoration.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS BILL ON METRO RAIL EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assembly Ways and Means Committee approved a bill Wednesday to require 
underground construction of an extension of Metro Rail through residential 
North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who introduced the measure, said it 
could be considered by the full Assembly as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
Under Robbins' proposal, approved 19 to 0 by the committee, 3.6 miles of the 
Metro Rail extension would be underground along a Southern Pacific railroad 
right of way, partly following Chandler Boulevard between the Hollywood Freeway 
and Hazeltine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have protested proposals to place the line above ground because they 
say it would divide neighborhoods and increase noise.

MANHATTAN BEACH TO HONOR MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manhattan Beach will honor City Manager David J. Thompson at a dinner next week 
to mark his retirement from a post he's held for 16 years. He's scheduled to 
leave the job May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is interviewing candidates to replace Thompson and may name 
his replacement as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 60, has been city manager since 1974. In a recent interview, he said 
the highlight of his tenure was supervising the transformation in the late 
1970s of a 187-acre Chevron U.S.A. Inc. tank farm into the complex that 
includes the Manhattan Village Mall, 540 homes and the Raddison Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The $38 dinner is April 14 at 6:30 p.m. at the Raddison. People are asked to 
sign up by Friday by calling the city Administrative and Community Services 
Department at 545-5621, Ext. 362.

OLD COINS GIVE MALLON THE EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
POWAY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meg Mallon admits it's silly. 
</P>
<P>
It probably doesn't even help her game. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case, she continued the little habit she has of spotting her golf 
ball with an old coin. She did it at last weekend's Nabisco Dinah Shore 
tournament and tied for ninth. And she will do it at the Red Robin Kyocera 
Inamori tournament, which begins today at the StoneRidge Country Club in Poway. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is that Mallon does not want to look at the date of a new coin 
staring up at her from the green. 
</P>
<P>
Weird? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, try putting on the 18th green at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho 
Mirage with the cheers of the gallery ringing in your ears. Or try playing in 
front of what seems like the entire citizenry of Ramona, where Mallon's parents 
have retired, as she will today through Sunday at StoneRidge. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon, 26, is playing the best golf in her four years on the LPGA tour. So why 
change? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see '1980' on a coin," she said. "Eighty is a high golf score. 
I'd rather see something like '1966.' " 
</P>
<P>
A 66 is what she shot on the final day of the Inamori last year. But by then 
she was so far behind that she never challenged the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad about the way I played on the third day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So she did something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed about 30 people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she arrives at StoneRidge ranked 29th on the LPGA money list with 
$42,772, more than the $42,574 she earned in all of 1989. Her third-place 
finish in the Phar-Mor Inverrary tournament in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., in 
mid-February qualified her for last weekend's Dinah Shore, one of the LPGA's 
majors. Her ninth-place tie with Pat Bradley was worth $12,699. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably could say I didn't know any better," she said. "It was pretty 
exciting to finish in the top 10. I felt like my concentration was very good. I 
putted really well. I got on those greens and loved them." 
</P>
<P>
Mallon joined the tour in 1987 after playing at Ohio State University. She said 
her first-year earnings -- $1,572 -- were both embarrassing and motivating. 
</P>
<P>
She won $25,002 in 1988 before reaching the $40,000 level last year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I turned professional, I put myself on a five-year plan," she said. "I 
said if I wasn't making a living and doing well, I'd retire. Fortunately, I had 
the support of my family and friends starting out. They knew it would take time 
to get to the level where I could compete. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a long way to go. I feel like I'm taking the blue-collar route, 
starting slowly and working my way up." 
</P>
<P>
Mallon is accustomed to working her way up. She walked onto the Ohio State golf 
team her freshman year and earned a full scholarship by her senior year. She 
likens the tour to her college experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a progression for me," she said. "I knew it was going to take some 
time to get better, and it seems to be happening. I always felt I could play 
here competitively. It was just a matter of time and getting the right 
instruction." 
</P>
<P>
Mike McGetrick of Austin, Tex., has been her coach for the past two years. 
McGetrick's wife, Sara Anne, is also on the tour but will not be playing this 
weekend because she is due to give birth to the couple's first child in about 
three weeks. The problem with that is that Mike has been staying home as well. 
Mallon hasn't seen him since early December. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of phone lessons, and those don't seem to cut it," 
Mallon said. "But he took me up to another level and gave me confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Her recent results have boosted that confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I get myself into situations like I have lately, the more confidence 
I'll feel," she said. "I still have a long way to go, and a lot more to 
achieve." 
</P>
<P>
The Dinah Shore is something she replays in her head. Dinah, the crowd, 
finishing in the top 10 . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The hair on my arms was standing straight up," she said. "I was walking down 
to the 18th green with Pat Bradley, and the crowd was just chanting, 'Pat! 
Pat!' They don't know me, but all those cheers . . . " 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, in front of her parents and several friends, Mallon will have the 
home-green advantage. The most difficult part of the week might be the scramble 
for tickets. Mallon only gets four, but she spent time scrounging extras from 
other players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm throwing my tickets at my parents," she said, "and I'll let them decide 
who gets them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she has no predictions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't control what happens with anybody else," she said. "You try to be as 
prepared as you can. I hope my putter stays hot. I feel like I'm hitting the 
ball well." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, she is looking forward to a bit of a break because the tour takes a 
three-week break after this weekend. With all the home-cooked meals and family 
reunions, this week starts her vacation. 
</P>
<P>
All Mallon will have to worry about is making sure she has enough old coins in 
her pocket when she reaches the greens. If she doesn't, she will follow her 
usual routine and ask her caddy for a coin. 
</P>
<P>
"But I won't look at it the whole time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon paused, then smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," she said. "It's silly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

BUSS WON'T BUILD ARENA UNTIL HE GETS EXPANSION TEAM;

Dr. Jerry Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers and Great Western Forum, said 
Wednesday he is waiting for word on NHL expansion and will not make plans to 
build an arena until he secures a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced obtaining a franchise is the first step, and, because 
the NHL is not expected to decide on expansion until at least December, he will 
lobby the league and wait. 
</P>
<P>
Buss detailed a plan Wednesday that entails obtaining a franchise, finding a 
community to support it and getting corporate backing. He said he will 
investigate Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties as possible franchise 
locations. He said he expects a city to grant him land or, at least, offer an 
extraordinary deal on leased land. Failing that, he said he will listen to 
offers from the proposed builders of arenas in Costa Mesa and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this project probably different than other people see it," Buss said. 
"To them, it's go out and get land, get an architect, talk to the city, etc. In 
my estimation, that's putting the cart before the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to have a franchise. If you get a franchise, it is no secret 
many communities desperately want sports teams. They realize the economic 
advantages to the community that a sports franchise brings. Therefore, they 
will cooperate with the franchise owner 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is no secret. Look at the bidding for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"The second step is to realize which community realizes the value of having a 
sports team to the point where it will work with you in a joint effort to make 
the arena happen. . . . that translates into free land, or at least an 
extremely favorable rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The third step is to get some large company behind you for advertising, such 
as the Great Western Forum. After that, everything is simple." 
</P>
<P>
Buss has written letters to key NHL executives in hopes of drawing interest in 
his quest for an expansion franchise. The NHL is not yet accepting formal 
applications for expansion franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've told them is that I'm interested in anything in Southern 
California," he said. "What I've thought is Orange County, Riverside and San 
Diego County. If I'm granted a franchise, those are the areas I'll 
investigate." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Helper, a spokesman for the NHL, said the league is planning to review 
conditions and terms for its expansion applications at the Board of Governors' 
meeting the first week of May. League Commissioner John Ziegler said at a Board 
of Governors' meeting in February that expansion decisions of "who, what and 
how many" won't be on the agenda until December at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
While Buss is planning to find a franchise and then decide where to put it, La 
Jolla millionaire and co-owner of the San Diego Sports Arena Harry Cooper has 
spent much of the past year attempting to obtain city permission to build a 
sports arena downtown at 12th and Imperial avenues. Buss said he has not 
decided if he will work with Cooper or anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
"(Cooper) expressed his interest in all possible ways to make it happen," Buss 
said. "He has done his homework. He knows traffic patterns, demographics. But 
when you decide to work with any existing group -- Harry or others -- it 
requires a lot of investigation, a lot of decisions, a lot of hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not willing to put them in unless I have a franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Buss was unconcerned about any possible competition between he and Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any competition," Buss said. "I guess anybody with enough money 
can build an arena. What I'm after is a hockey team and some fans. There can be 
two arenas, four arenas or six arenas, I don't care. There can be only one 
franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to published reports, Buss said he has not looked at land in San 
Diego's North County for prospective arena sites. He made it clear he intends 
to hold up his part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The city, the fans and myself have to go all out," he said. "If one of these 
fall apart, it's not going to happen. It's that simple. If I get a franchise, 
(building an arena) this is not a pipe dream. This will happen. If not, tough 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
"If a hockey franchise is awarded to the Southern California area, it seems to 
me there will be just one in the foreseeable future. It's either get it or it's 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Buss said he wants to bring an NBA team to San Diego as well. He thinks it is 
feasible to build an arena that would have just one tenant, such as an NHL 
team, but that it wouldn't be very profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many (professional) franchises playing in an arena in which there is 
just one tenant," Buss said. "A lot of single tenant buildings survive but 
clearly, the way to go is to get two." 
</P>
<P>
Because Buss owns the Lakers, he cannot purchase another NBA team but he said 
he would want an existing franchise move into his arena. 
</P>
<P>
As for the location, it all depends on finding a community in which the local 
government and a corporation are willing to help him financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Just what I put up to buy a team and build an arena will be well over $100 
million with everyone's assistance," he said. "Without it, it becomes 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Susan Golding said a land grant in San Diego would be 
difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be subject to negotiation," she said. "He's implying the government 
has some land to grant for a sports arena. We don't have land just sitting 
around to be granted. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even on ground zero yet. He'd need to come in and talk, and he 
hasn't done that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Buss is an avid sports fan who, in addition to owning the Lakers, promotes his 
own boxing, tennis and volleyball matches in the Forum. He is building a home 
in Rancho Santa Fe and one of his offices is in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this area," he said. "It's so healthy and beautiful. My house just 
broke ground. As much as this area offers me, I know if I had a sports team 
here it would be perfect. I tried to buy the Padres, and it didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't build a sports arena because I want to live near there. That would 
be nice and wonderful, and my first desire. Having been on the NBA advisory 
committee, I know how sports leagues look at expansion. They want a good owner 
who is well funded with a degree of appreciation of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"That's only half the game. The other is the community has to really be behind 
the franchise. That's why Charlotte and Orlando (were awarded NBA expansion 
franchises).It's not like before, when a city had to be a certain size."

LAST GOAL IS WRIGHT ON TIME

Count it. The referee did. 
</P>
<P>
Tie score. Clock winding down to nothing. A crowd of 10,342 Wednesday night at 
the San Diego Sports Arena is going bananas as the Sockers are desperately 
trying to break a tie with the Wichita Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Five, four . . . 
</P>
<P>
Forward Wes Wade takes a swipe at the ball at the top of the penalty box with 
his right foot. It bounces a few feet to his right. 
</P>
<P>
Three, two, one . . . 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Paul Wright steps up and boots a shot past goalie Ron Fearon. The 
Wichita players shake their heads and wave their hands. "No goal," they shout. 
</P>
<P>
The referee holds his hands skyward. Goal. Sockers 4, Wichita 3. 
</P>
<P>
What did Wright think? 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the referee," he said. "The referee had his hands up. That's all I 
needed to know. I knew I had the perfect opportunity if I could just beat the 
buzzer." 
</P>
<P>
Even Wade wasn't altogether certain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I was laying on the ground. It was real close." 
</P>
<P>
Close enough to make Socker Coach Ron Newman wonder if his team isn't trying to 
give him health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I'm getting older," said Newman, whose Sockers are now 21-24, tied 
for second in the Western Division with St. Louis. "I don't know if they're 
doing that on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the Sockers have now won their past six games at home. Of course, 
they have lost their past four on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Wichita had defeated the Sockers in seven consecutive meetings 
entering Wednesday's game. So this was a nice change, though the Sockers nearly 
fell apart after taking a 3-1 lead in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita (23-23) did everything it could to preserve its streak. Down by two 
late in the third quarter, Wing midfielder Dale Ervine caught the Sockers 
napping on their own powerplay and scored to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then, early in the fourth quarter, Ervine hit a crossing pass to midfielder 
Mike Fox, who knocked it off the boards and headed it in to tie the score. 
Newman called Wichita's three goals the worst in team history. Slight 
exaggeration? Maybe. But they weren't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a terrible loss if we'd lost that game," Newman said. "We 
had a battle in what should have been an easy game." 
</P>
<P>
Wing midfielder David Byrne always seems to be in the right place to hand the 
Sockers a little misery. It was Byrne, remember, who served as the sixth 
attacker for Baltimore late in last season's championship game and deflected a 
George Fernandez shot that would have made the Sockers' victory a whole lot 
easier. Because Byrne was out of the penalty box, the ref should have called a 
hand ball, but, legal or not, his ingenuity was to be commended. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne put the Wings ahead, slipping behind the defense to take a pass from 
midfielder Perry Van Der Beck, dribble left and send one into the right corner 
to make it 1-0. The play was set up by an off-target pass by Socker midfielder 
Jacques Ladouceur, who knocked it right to Van Der Beck. Byrne has scored 11 
points this season against the Sockers in two as a Wing and two with the Blast. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the first quarter, the Sockers bounced back, forward Damir 
Haramina scoring his fourth goal of the season after his flashy footwork left 
midfielder Tom Soehn looking as if he was counting sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Things began to roll for the Sockers in the third quarter, when defender Ralph 
Black scored with help from a Gregg Willin deflection. Two minutes later, 
Wright followed Cacho's shot off the boards to poke it into the left corner. 
That made it 3-1, and the Sockers looked as if they would breeze along the rest 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Waad Hirmez, who exited Saturday's 6-2 loss at Tacoma in the first 
quarter after taking an elbow to the head from Preki, was back in the lineup 
Wednesday. He still isn't thrilled that Preki was assessed only a yellow card 
for his action. "It should have been a red card," Hirmez said. "If anybody else 
had done it to Preki, or Tatu or (Jan) Goossens, it would have been." . . . 
Three teams in the MISL have clinched playoff spots: Baltimore (28-18), Kansas 
City (27-19) and Dallas (27-18). ... Defender George Fernandez upped his 
consecutive games-played streak to 125, longest currently in the MISL. . . . 
The Sockers are on the road for their next three games, playing Friday in 
Cleveland, Saturday in Baltimore and next Thursday in Tacoma. The Sockers' road 
record is 5-17.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS;

<P>
ANDERSON UP TO SPEED AS KENNEDY PITCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarado figures that a true test of a pitcher's mettle is 
how he fares against the Kennedy lineup. The same rule applies for his own 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Alvarado thinks Garret Anderson might have to be reckoned with when 
the Holt-Goodman tournament opens this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"God, he's been impressive in intrasquad workouts," Alvarado said of Anderson, 
an outfielder. "I figure if he can handle our guys -- we have to be one of the 
hottest-hitting teams around -- then he can handle anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's team batting average is .334, so Anderson, an All-City Section 
outfielder last season, must be doing something right. In practice last week, 
he even struck out catcher Lazaro Campos, who has fanned only once in 44 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws harder than anyone we have," Alvarado said of Anderson. "You never 
know, we might just see him when the tournament gets started." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a left-hander who has committed to play in the outfield next season 
at Fresno State, could give Alvarado's defending City 4-A champions yet another 
pitching option. That's a disconcerting thought for opponents, considering that 
entering the week, pitchers Cody Beaumaster, Denny Sharp and Richard Trujillo 
were 11-1 with a cumulative earned-run average of 1.55. 
</P>
<P>
Hunted: Notre Dame and Virginia are the latest schools to offer Westlake's 
Billy Hunter a full scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who finished third in the state meet at 175 pounds in March and 
finished 43-1, also is considering William &amp; Mary, Lehigh, and 
Pennsylvania. Considered one of California's top recruits by Amateur Wrestling 
News, Hunter will continue to visit schools through next week. 
</P>
<P>
Stinging loss: Shawn Goetzinger and Chad Malesich were major contributors to 
Camarillo's state Division I championship cross-country team in the fall, but 
the two seniors have not gotten started this track season. 
</P>
<P>
Malesich injured a knee while playing basketball at home and has not 
participated in track, and Goetzinger has been hampered by illness, Coach Mike 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Malesich's absence has been particularly damaging. A versatile runner, Malesich 
timed 52.0 seconds for 400 meters and 9:21.1 for 3,000 as a junior. He was 
undefeated at 800 meters in Marmonte League competition with a 1:57.82 best. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing him was really tough on us because he's a big points man," Smith said 
of Malesich, who could be competitive in races from 400 to 3,200 meters. "He 
was good for 10 to 12 points a meet." 
</P>
<P>
The more distance-oriented Goetzinger timed 4:22.18 and 9:31.2 for 1,600 and 
3,200 last year but has had problems keeping healthy this spring. Goetzinger 
missed last fall's Marmonte League cross-country finals because of illness but 
came back as the Scorpions' fourth man in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Cleared for takeoff: Quartz Hill's boys' track team has an imbalance in the 
field events. 
</P>
<P>
Superior depth in the horizontal jumps compensates for the Rebels' lack of 
athletes in the vertical and weight events. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got jumpers coming out my ears," Coach Don Crimin said. "It's a real 
strong group." 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Higa, the defending Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the triple 
jump, leads a group of three who have bettered 43 feet. Higa has bounded 47-5 
this season, and teammates Brian Slack and sophomore Bryan Frazier have leaped 
43-5 and 43-4, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Slack jumped 44-11 3/4 last year, narrowly missing the 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Higa also leads the Rebels in the long jump with a 22-1 1/2 mark. Adam Frazier, 
a 22-plus long jumper in 1989 who has gone 21-0 this season, and Slack (20-10) 
also could score in the divisional championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting Highlanders: Royal's Dave Landaker, a sophomore, is hitting .333 in the 
No. 5 position in the lineup and is a part of the Highlanders' recent 
resurgence at the plate. Royal has 47 hits in its past four games and has won 
five of its past six. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we were trying to hit the ball farther and harder than than we were 
capable of," Coach Dan Maye said. "But we started hitting line drives that were 
putting more runs on the scoreboard than the long fly balls, and we started 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
Royal has hit only one home run all season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've figured out that hard ground balls through the infield score 
more runs," Maye said. 
</P>
<P>
Tested optimism: A 3-7 record usually does not generate much optimism, but 
Agoura Coach Gary Gray is somewhat pleased with that mark. Five of Agoura's 
defeats have been at the hands of teams from the talent-rich Marmonte League, 
the other two against a talented Buena team. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any consolation in any of this, it's the tough preseason schedule," 
said Gray, whose team defeated Santa Paula, 3-2, on Tuesday in its Frontier 
League opener. "But I hope it hasn't buried us. Sometimes you begin to have 
doubts in yourselves and your abilities. But I think we're OK. At least they're 
still coming back to practice." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, which will move to the Marmonte League next season, is holding its own 
against larger schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making those teams earn their runs," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising with Cruz: Channel Islands center fielder Jacob Cruz, a 6-foot, 
160-pound junior, has been attracting professional scouts and intentional walks 
with his .568 batting average (25 for 44). According to Coach Don Cardinal, the 
scouts' interest has spilled over to sophomore pitcher Angel Aragon (3-2) and 
sophomore cleanup hitter Jose Gastelum (.395). 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that this is a great opportunity to show the scouts a thing or 
two," Cardinal said. 
</P>
<P>
No place like home: Because of the renovation of Brookside Park, St. Francis 
did not play a home game until last week when the previously nomadic Knights 
played host to St. John Bosco in a Del Rey League game. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked better to Bosco than it did to us," St. Francis Coach Tom Moran said 
of the field. No wonder -- St. Francis committed eight errors and had three 
runners picked off in the 7-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Shelled: Alemany's ace left-hander, Joey Rosselli, surrendered six hits to 
Loyola on Friday -- three of which were home runs. Rosselli (4-1) allowed only 
four homers last season.

CHATSWORTH CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR A WAY TO BEAT SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Chatsworth High was unable to defeat San Fernando, losing, 9-2, and 
tying the Tigers, 8-8, last week. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando has not lost to the Chancellors in the teams' past six games over 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The streak includes a victory in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals in 
1988 and a two-game sweep last season when Chatsworth was nationally ranked. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you beat a team like Chatsworth, which might just be the program of 
the '80s, you have to feel pretty good about it," San Fernando Coach Steve 
Marden said. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Entering the week, who had more hits than any other player in the 
Northwest Valley Conference? It wasn't San Fernando's John Najar, Kennedy's Ben 
Guzman, Benji Belfield nor Brett Reisner of Taft, nor was it Chatsworth's Mitch 
Root, although all have been hot. 
</P>
<P>
The honor belongs to San Fernando's Richard Sanchez, a 5-foot-5, 140-pound 
third baseman. But pound for pound, Sanchez pounds the ball as well as anyone. 
Sanchez, a senior who answers to "Shorty," entered the week with 19 hits in 38 
at-bats and 18 runs scored, also tops among conference players. It is no fluke: 
Sanchez batted .339 last season. 
</P>
<P>
All of Jeff Gordon's nine home runs, and 17 of Simi Valley's 20, have been hit 
at the Pioneers' cozy field, which is 295 feet down the left-field line and 350 
feet to the power alleys. Teammate Kenny Hood has a 16-game hitting streak that 
dates to last season. He is 18 for 43 (.419) this season. . . . Royal has 47 
hits in its past four games. . . . Westlake has stolen 31 bases in 32 attempts, 
including 22 in a row.

SULLIVAN HANGING HIS HOPES ON BEARS' JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second year in a row, former Cal Lutheran standout Kent Sullivan will 
battle Maury Buford for the Chicago Bears' punting job. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Sullivan hopes the outcome will be different from last year 
when the Bears went with experience (Buford) over youth (Sullivan). 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a really good chance at making it," said Sullivan, who signed 
a two-year make-good contract with the Bears last month. "I've heard through 
various people that they're pretty high on me. . . . They went with Maury last 
year, but he didn't have a very good season, finishing 26th (actually 21st) out 
of 28 punters, so I think I've got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Buford, 30, who also has played for the San Diego Chargers and New York Giants 
during his seven-year NFL career, averaged 39.5 yards for 72 punts last season, 
including nine touchbacks and 21 punts inside the opposing team's 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 25, had a 38.8 average during his career (1985-88) at Cal Lutheran. 
His best seasons, statistically, were in 1985 and '86, when he averaged 40.1 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
On the road again: Without a home field, the Mission baseball team has gone to 
ridiculous lengths, and distances, to play its home games. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the Free Spirit plays home games at Valley College, but it also has 
played "home" games at Pierce, L. A. City and East L. A colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Mission has overcome this adversity to post a 17-9-1 record, 9-4 in the 
Southern California Athletic Conference, and contend for the school's first 
state playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Grounded jumper: Lolita Pile of Cal State Northridge, a three-time NCAA 
Division II All-American in the triple jump, will not compete in her specialty 
in the Fresno Relays on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pile's absence is not because of injury or illness but because of Fresno City 
College's short runway, which is only 35 yards (105 feet) long. 
</P>
<P>
Pile's triple-jump approach is 127 feet. With a landing pit at each end of the 
runway, the only way she could have jumped would have been to shorten her run, 
or keep her approach its normal length and start on the grass infield before 
veering onto the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"She could have (started on the grass)," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said, 
"but we decided against that. She'll still be busy with other events." 
</P>
<P>
Pile will compete in the long jump and run the second leg on the Lady Matadors' 
400-meter relay at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Local help: Some might say the key to winning an NCAA basketball title this 
season was the presence of an All-American such as Jennifer Azzi or Larry 
Johnson, but astute observers will note the presence of Valley-area reserve 
guards on both champions. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Parson, a senior from Kennedy High, is the only Californian on Stanford's 
national championship women's basketball team. She entered the game after Azzi 
fouled out late in the Cardinal's 88-81 win over Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Bice, a sophomore from Simi Valley High, and Stacey Cvijanovich, a 
senior from Santa Clara High, both played in UNLV's 103-73 blowout of Duke. 
Cvijanovich scored five points in 10 minutes and Bice was scoreless in nine. 
</P>
<P>
Double trouble: Percy Knox and Angela Burnham, two former state track and field 
champions at Valley-area high schools, each rank among the Pacific 10 
Conference leaders in three track and field events. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, who won the state long jump title for Antelope Valley in 1987, is ranked 
third in the 200 meters (20.98 seconds) and fourth in the 100 (10.44) and long 
jump (25 feet 6 3/4 inches) for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, who won an unprecedented five state sprint titles at Rio Mesa 
(1986-89), ranks third in the 100 (11.91) and 200 (24.15), and sixth in the 400 
(55.23) for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Knox and Burnham also run legs on their respective 400- and 1,600-meter relay 
teams. Both 400-meter relays teams rank first and both teams in the longer 
relay rank third. 
</P>
<P>
Stated intentions: College of the Canyons has been confirmed as the host of the 
1991 women's state junior college basketball tournament, and Coach Jeff Dunlap 
is putting together a December tournament that will serve as a dry run for the 
state event. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cougars' Classic is scheduled for Dec. 13-15 and will include last 
season's state qualifiers, Southwestern, Antelope Valley and Desert in addition 
to Pierce, in the eight-team field, Dunlap said.

UNDEFEATED MIRA MESA BEST OF THE BEST

<P>
Spring vacation tournaments, such as the annual Lions tournament, normally give 
teams an inkling as to where they stand heading into league play. But with 
Easter falling in the middle of April this year, most teams have already begun 
league play before Saturday's start of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like powerful Mira Mesa in a down City Eastern League, can already figure 
a reasonable magic number for wrapping things up. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the other top-ranked teams should find themselves in a battle with 
as many as four teams. The Metro Conference, where early favorites Sweetwater 
and Castle Park have been upstaged by Hilltop and Montgomery, is a perfect 
example. Those two clubs were ninth and 10th in the Metro last year, but are 
now tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont and Santana in the Grossmont 2-A League have just one loss each and 
seem headed for a collision on April 27 when they meet at Santana. 
</P>
<P>
Helix has slipped since making the section 3-A final the past two years, and 
the Highlanders must now reckon with upstart Monte Vista as well as Granite 
Hills in the Grossmont 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of senior pitcher Ben Pai, Oceanside might become an emotional 
favorite in the Avocado League. But the Pirates (7-2-1) will still have to 
contend with El Camino, San Marcos and Escondido. Carlsbad, the defending 2-A 
champion, is 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the Palomar, perennial favorite Mt. Carmel, the defending 3-A champion, 
should be tested by Orange Glen, Poway and Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS might have figured to have an easy go in the City Western, but that was 
before Monday, when Mission Bay, just 4-6 this year, ripped them, 17-2. La 
Jolla and Kearny might also be factors. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford (9-2) stands to crack the top 10 soon, but should feel some heat from 
San Diego before things are through in the City Central. 
</P>
<P>
Three games into the first ever City Harbor season, things are bunching up and 
there does not appear to be a favorite as yet. 
</P>

The Times' San Diego Section Baseball Top 10:

</P>
<P>
1 MIRA MESA 1990 record: 13-0 League: 
</P>
<P>
City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Prosser 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa, which was 22-5 last year and lost in the 3-A semifinals to eventual 
champion Mt. Carmel, might be on top for a long time considering it has only 
two senior starters -- Beau Champoux (.413 average) and pitcher Jimmy Escamilla 
(26 strikeouts). Of the juniors, versatile Marc Nielsen is hitting .416 and is 
3-0 on the mound. Though Prosser says hitting is the primary reason for the 
fast start, pitching hasn't been shabby. Junior Mike Bovee leads the county at 
6-0. "I'd have to say it's the best team I've had," Prosser said. "They play 
real well together and they get along well. It's a real team effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 GROSSMONT 1990 record: 13-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 2-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jeff Meredith 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont can score runs in bunches. Junior catcher Todd Cady is leading the 
county in runs batted in (27), is tied for the lead in home runs (five) and is 
tied for third in stolen bases (12). Senior third baseman John Tatum has three 
homers and 16 RBIs, senior outfielder Lenny Van Every is hitting .475 with 15 
RBIs and 12 stolen bases, and senior first baseman Jim Earley has two homers 
and 13 RBIs. That production has made life easy for pitchers Danny Lennon (4-0, 
0.69 ERA), Jason Eskridge (3-0) and Mike Spears (26 strikeouts). Meredith is in 
his second season but guided the Foothillers to the 2-A title game last season. 
A return to that game is possible this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 MT. CARMEL 1990 record: 10-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Sam Blalock 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, the Sundevils have won four section titles. In the six 
other years, they were eliminated by the eventual champion. So the road to the 
title goes through Rancho Penasquitos. Although catcher Matt Miller (.275, nine 
RBIs last year) is the only returning field player and Doug Hill (9-0, 2.56 ERA 
last year) is the only returning pitcher, Mt. Carmel will rely heavily on a 
junior varsity team that finished 19-2 in 1989. Blalock said this is his best 
defensive team ever. Mt. Carmel has held opponents to two runs or less in eight 
of 11 games, and only three runs in another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 SANTANA 1990 record: 11-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 2-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Saska 
</P>
<P>
Before last year, Santana had made it to the 3-A title game four out of five 
years, and won it all in '84 and '86. By its standards, Santana was down last 
year finishing 15-10-1, including a first-round playoff loss. In 12 games this 
year, the Sultans are hitting well and will challenge Grossmont for the league 
and possibly the section title. Junior outfielder Gabe Hernandez is hitting 
better than .500 and senior Ferdie Hollis has three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 MONTE VISTA 1990 Record: 10-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 3-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rob Phillips 
</P>
<P>
With a new coach, a new field and renewed enthusiasm, Monte Vista broke a 
16-year playoff drought last year. This year, the Matadors look to continue 
those winning ways. Senior all-purpose player Vern Mullis (.434 average last 
year) is second in the county with a .545 average and has three home runs and 
13 RBIs. Darren Rucker is hitting .474 with 16 RBIs. On the mound, though, is 
where the Matadors excel. Senior Ernie Reyes is 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA, junior 
Robbie Stone is 4-1 with a 1.18 ERA, Mullis is 2-1 with a 1.51 ERA and senior 
Neal Svalstad has a 0.88 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 USDHS 1990 record: 9-3 
</P>
<P>
League: City Western 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Richard Serrano 
</P>
<P>
After finishing third in 1988 and second last year, there's no reason USDHS 
can't take that final step and win its league. The Dons' have the enviable 
balance of heavy hitting, fine pitching and all-around experience. Scattered in 
the lineup are three of the county's top 25 hitters. Juniors Gavin Millay and 
David Sanchez and senior Jeff Desjardins are all batting over .420. Tom Shanner 
and Gary Remiker join Millay for a solid pitching staff. And there are six 
players who were starters last year. Serrano's outlook is optimistic, but 
cautious: "We can play with the best, but we can lose with the best, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 ORANGE GLEN 1990 record: 9-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ken Walker 
</P>
<P>
The strategy for first-year coach Ken Walker is pretty simple: keep other teams 
from scoring. His pitching staff can do it. The Patriots have three solid 
pitchers -- Scott Coleman (1.92 ERA), Jim Roby (2.10) and Damon Vinje (2.04). 
The team allows less than two runs per game. Coleman set a section record 
earlier this year by posting 16 consecutive no-hit innings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 HILLTOP 1990 record: 8-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Metro 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Baumgarten 
</P>
<P>
After dominating the South Bay in the early 1980s, it has been five years since 
Hilltop last won a league title. The Lancers, ninth last year at 8-16, appear 
ready to make a run. "We have a nice pool of talent," said Baumgarten, in his 
19th year. "They are young, but they do think pretty well, and that's so 
important in this game." Juniors Jose Silva (4-2) and Jose Gallegos (2-0) and 
senior Martin Villanueva (2-1) form a solid staff. There are only three senior 
starters, but they are up the middle -- catcher Paul Stojsavljevic, shortstop 
Rich Dare and center fielder David Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9 MONTGOMERY 1990 record: 9-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Metro 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Manuel Hermosillo 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise has been the turnaround made by the Aztecs. Tenth 
last year in the league at 9-15, 4-10, Montgomery has posted big victories 
already over Bonita Vista, Sweetwater and San Diego and is tied for first with 
Hilltop at 3-0 in league. "I'm real surprised," Hermosillo said. "The kids set 
their own standards after finishing last last season." Senior catcher Miguel 
Perez (.481) leads six Aztecs hitting over .340. The others are seniors Luis 
Arroyo (.400) and Mauricio Martinez (.350), juniors Saul Rodriguez (.372) and 
Luis Contreras (.353) and sophomore Jose Laranzana (.342). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 POWAY 1989 record: 6-3-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rudy Casciato 
</P>
<P>
Poway returns three infielders and a catcher and should be among the favorites 
to win league. Matt Schwenke, who has already signed a letter of intent to 
UCLA, Greg Sorrell, and Brock Marsh all batted over .300 last year. Since 
returning from a broken wrist before the season started, Schwenke has played in 
two full games and hit two three-run home runs. Danny Miller is 3-1 and has 41 
strikeouts in 32 innings.

TITAN INVITATIONAL MEET RUNS AGAINST ARCADIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Titan Invitational Track Meet Saturday falls on the same day as the Arcadia 
Invitational, a much more prestigious meet. But according to Poway Coach Dan 
Schaitel, the Arcadia meet won't draw the top talent away from Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we've seen, there doesn't seem to be that problem," Schaitel said. 
"Some teams will be going to both meets. We won't be. I don't want to push it 
too far." 
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 athletes will compete in the meet, which is scheduled to begin at 9 
a.m. with the last race at 3:30 p.m.. Among the top teams competing are Mission 
Viejo and Esperanza and from San Diego, Poway, Mira Mesa and Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Poway senior Kim Dill, who placed fourth in the 100-meter hurdles in last 
year's state meet, is ranked second in the state in that event. Dill also will 
compete in the 300-meter hurdles where she will meet San Pasqual's Erin Blunt, 
who is ranked in the top five in the state in that event. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's Steve Pomiak, who runs the 100-meters in 10.9 was a member of the 400 
and mile relay teams which took second at the Pasadena Invitational a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
At that meet, Poway placed in the top three in every race. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm very pleased with the boys performance," Schaitel said. "They 
are a very strong and well balanced team. There are no weak areas and they are 
continually getting better." 
</P>
<P>
In the Poway girls meet against Mt. Carmel Thursday, it came down to the last 
race, the mile relay. Mt. Carmel won the meet, 88-77. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest pitcher Millie Esquivil had 21 strikeouts in only nine innings last 
Thursday, despite Southwest's 1-0 loss to Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
That puts her in a three-way tie with Suzy Lawrence of Sweetwater and Darbie 
Seegrist of Marian. However, it took both Lawrence and Seegrist 19 innings to 
collect their 21 strikeouts, which they did in a game against each other in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido pitcher Ruth Henry recorded her second no-hitter in the Cougars' 16-0 
victory over Oceanside Friday. The day before Marquessa Penrod threw a 
no-hitter in Escondido's 2-0 victory over Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido is 7-2.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGUITO HIRES FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Dieguito High named Marty Albert its second head football coach in less 
than a month Wednesday. He replaced Dave Rudolph, who resigned on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert compiled a 120-95-4 record in a 17-year career that included 10 years at 
Strongsville, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and Los Alamos, New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, an assistant at Carlsbad, said his decision to leave was a financial 
one based on the decreased benefits package offered by the San Dieguito School 
District on top of a $10,000 cutback in pay. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't coach high school football because you can make a lot of money at 
it, you do it because you see some value in it," said Albert, 46. "I like the 
opportunity of being in school, taking people and being competitive. It's a 
challenge, but it's something I now have an opportunity to do." 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State took advantage of 12 walks to score an 11-1 nonconference 
victory over Cal State Los Angeles. SDSU (24-12) was led by Scott Dennison, who 
had a home run and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego defeated Chapman College, 8-0, in a nonconference 
match. USD (19-4) is ranked 19th, while Chapman (8-6) is third in Div. II. The 
Toreros lost only two sets, and Thomas Simonson lost only one game. Dan 
Mattera, now ranked 47th, and J.R. Edwards, ranked 74th, also won. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International added former SDSU player Andrew Aguilar, 28, as an assistant 
coach. He has assisted at Santa Barbara City College. USIU also announced 
Aurora Van Sickle of Rancho Buena Vista High and Monica Green of Gering, Neb., 
as two new recruits.

years, with time off for good behavior. On Nov. 14, 1986, Boesky paid $100 
million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to plead guilty to 
one criminal count of lying to federal regulators to settle charges of rampant 
insider trading. The penalty was a record at the time, and Boesky's confessions 
stunned Wall Street. Reuters

GROWER EXPANDS IN BIG WAY WITH OREGON ACQUISITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capitalizing on San Diego County's building boom, Springtime Growers' wholesale 
nursery grew into prominence in the 1980s by selling trees and shrubs to 
landscapers of commercial and residential developments. Later, Springtime 
Growers built upon that foundation by stocking retail nurseries, too. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Springtime made its biggest expansion ever, paying $11 million to 
acquire Oregon Garden Products of Hillsboro, Ore., the state's largest 
wholesale grower and a major supplier of retail nurseries in the Midwest and 
the East. Last year, Oregon Garden Products posted revenues in excess of $14 
million.

Oregon Garden Products, with a 1,100-acre farm 20 miles west of Portland, 
allows Springtime to expand its product line and to sell goods to customers in 
colder climate, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll have the Northwest material which they can now ship to the Eastern and 
Midwestern markets," said Harold Young, editor of the Pacific Coast Nurseryman, 
a trade publication circulated in Western and Sun Belt states. "From an 
acquisition standpoint they increase their product base . . . conifers and 
stuff that we don't even know about down here. They're in a position to go 
great guns." 
</P>
<P>
The combined revenues of Springtime Growers and Oregon Garden Products now 
makes parent company Springtime Inc. of San Diego one of the nation's five 
largest wholesale growers, with annual sales in excess of $32 million. There 
are more than 33,000 U.S. wholesale growing nurseries competing for a share of 
the $4.2-billion annual wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1980, Springtime grows more than 600 varieties of trees, shrubs and 
vines on nearly 400 acres of farms in Del Mar, Miramar and Phoenix. Springtime 
has been supplying retail and landscape nurseries in California, Nevada and 
Arizona. Last year, Springtime posted revenues of $18.7 million, up from $18.4 
million in 1988 and $14.2 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Ewing, Springtime's president, the acquisition of Oregon 
Garden Products enables the company to better supply the growing number of 
regional and national chain stores that are buying plant products. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of large retailers -- such as Home Club, K mart, Builders Square, 
Wal-Mart and Sun Belt Nurseries -- that demand substantial quantities and 
varieties of plants has developed a need for multi-product, service-oriented 
producers, according to industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
"These regional or national retailers want to get their business taken care of 
with one call," Ewing said. "But our industry is a fragmented one, with many 
growers specializing in certain types of products. There are many large 
distributors but very few large players on the supplier side of this business. 
We plan to fulfill this need." 
</P>
<P>
Establishing strong positions in both the retail and landscape business also 
helps Springtime weather bad times. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, the Phoenix developer market has been down lately and, as a 
result, we've had a decline in landscape business, but our retail has been real 
strong," Ewing said. "It helps us offset a low time in one area." Landscape 
business accounted for 38% of Springtime's 1989 revenues. Retail contributed 
62% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Springtime now grows on 300 acres in Del Mar, 40 acres in Phoenix and 40 acres 
in Miramar. Over the next five years, Springtime plans to moves its Del Mar 
operations to an expanded Miramar site, where it leases the property from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
According to Springtime spokesman Dennis Bahen, the company is moving its 
operation because of "housing encroachment (in Del Mar) and a chance to reduce 
operational costs. It's cheaper leasing land from the government." 
</P>
<P>
After serving as president of Nurseryland Garden Centers, a successful lawn and 
garden products chain, McKenzie Cook, 52, founded Springtime in October 1980. 
During Cook's five-year tenure at Nurseryland, the chain expanded from four to 
25 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, now Springtime's chief executive officer, left the successful chain 
because he recognized a need for a major wholesale supplier in fast-growing San 
Diego County, Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of major wholesalers up north, but they had their hands 
full supplying Orange County, which as you know had a boom of their own," said 
Ewing, 40. "No one was really addressing the fast-growing market in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
With $3 million money raised from limited partners, McKenzie and Ewing launched 
Springtime with 20 acres in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"We started supplying landscape contractors and rode on their backs until we 
got the retail side going," Ewing said. "We certainly had no idea we would grow 
this big."

JAPANESE TO VEND SAN DIEGO PACKER'S BEEF

A joint venture between Japanese and U. S. meat dealers will offer beef 
imported from the United States in freezer-equipped vending machines, an 
official representing the Japanese company said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to supply imported beef at a cheaper price to consumers by reducing 
the costs of distribution-related personnel required otherwise," said Naoki 
Sakai, spokesman of Jackson Co., a Japanese meat dealer based in Japan's 
western port city of Kobe. 
</P>
<P>
Sakai said this is the first time in Japan that beef will be sold in vending 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Co., which has specialized in U. S. meat since 1978, and Hamilton Meat 
Co., a meat packer based in San Diego, set up the joint venture in Kobe last 
month, Sakai said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new firm's move followed Japan's liberalization of imports of seasoned beef 
into Japan on Sunday, the first day of the country's new fiscal year, he said. 
Under a 1988 bilateral agreement between Japan and the United States, Japan has 
been gradually liberalizing beef imports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the venture, seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be processed in 
the United States before being imported in frozen vacuum packages for sale in 
vending machines in Japan, Sakai said. 
</P>
<P>
Vending machines will be set up at 1,000 locations, mainly near railway 
stations and convenience stores, he said, adding that the number of machines 
will be increased to a yet-unspecified figure in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Sakai said the new joint company plans to sell a pack containing 17.5 ounces of 
beef for sukiyaki at about 1,800 yen, or $11.30, about half the retail price of 
similar but locally produced beef. 
</P>
<P>
"We can sell at that price by introducing vending machines in place of the more 
costly work force," Sakai said. 
</P>
<P>
Each vending machine will be connected to a computer at the venture's head 
office, which will monitor the temperature and manage inventories within each 
freezer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company will install the vending machines starting next week, and is 
expecting 3 billion yen, or $18.8 million, in sales in its first year of 
operation, Sakai said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan imported 128,000 tons of beef from the United States in the first 10 
months leading up to January of fiscal 1989, which accounted for 41% of Japan's 
total beef imports in that period, according to Japanese government figures. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Meat Co. is a subsidiary of Omaha, Neb.-based Beef America, a U. S. 
meat packer.

TACO BELL CITED FOR CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taco Bell fast food restaurant in Mira Mesa has been cited for violations of 
child labor laws as part of a concentrated strike force crackdown last month by 
U.S. Department of Labor investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The citation was part of a nationwide crackdown from March 12 and 14 by the 
Labor Department that turned up 10,987 children said to be illegally employed. 
In California alone, the investigations of 218 employers turned up 880 alleged 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Mira Mesa Taco Bell violation, however, was the only one found in the San 
Diego area, according to the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Taco Bell at 8389 Mira Mesa Boulevard was cited for seven violations of 
regulations which stipulate that 14- and 15-year-old workers may not work more 
than 3 hours a day or later than 7 p.m. on school days. Children of that age 
are also prohibited from working during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in that age category are also barred from working more than 18 hours a 
week or from working more than eight hours a day on weekends when school is in 
session, said Robert Kelley, director of the Department of Labor's San Diego 
district office. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Taco Bell, Bob St. John of Escondido, was fined $1,260 as a 
result of the citations, according to the department's regional spokesman in 
San Francisco. St. John was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole said in a statement that cases of 
illegally employed children are on the rise and that the department has begun 
publicizing the names of violators in an effort to discourage child labor law 
abuses. The names of about 300 employers nationwide were released, including 
the local Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Child labor laws also prohibit children from working certain kinds of jobs 
including manufacturing, meat processing, public messenger work or jobs that 
require the operation of motor vehicles, power machinery or tools.

JACK SMITH: HERE'S TO THE SENSIBLE LADS (AND LASSIES) OF THE PRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Herb Krauch of Gilman Hot Springs confirms, with others, that during 
Prohibition distilled spirits could be obtained by prescription, "for medicinal 
purposes only," but throughout that noble experiment "most newspapermen drank 
bootleg gin." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody would know more about the habits of newspapermen in the Prohibition era 
than Krauch. Herb is 93. He spent 50 years on the Herald-Express, starting in 
1912 as an office boy at $4 a week and rising to editor. 
</P>
<P>
I worked as a reporter under Krauch in the early 1950s and know something about 
the drinking habits of reporters myself. 
</P>
<P>
Herb says reporters drank bootleg gin because it was easier to get than 
prescription booze and a lot cheaper. Since reporters probably made about $25 a 
week in those days, cheap was important. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1930," he recalls, "we had a house of ill fame across from the Herald on 
Trenton Street, where one city editor occasionally spent his lunch time, and a 
bootleg bar at the corner of Trenton and Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted a drink at the office you could go into the photographic 
department and Frank Bentley, head photographer, would sell you a shot of gin 
for 10 cents. In 1928 the city editor was drinking two fifths a day and 
eventually, in delirium tremens, was carried out of the office on a stretcher. 
Those were the days." 
</P>
<P>
One wonders whether the quality of the paper was affected by the city editor's 
going into delirium tremens. We all worked in a sort of constant delirium. 
</P>
<P>
When I worked at the Herald in the early 1950s our city editor was Agness 
Underwood, a tough, sentimental, competent newspaperwoman who had been a holy 
terror on the street as a reporter. As city editor Agness rarely drank, but 
sometimes she would pass out beer to her boys, as a reward for honest labor, 
from a case that had been delivered from the Continental Bar at Pico and 
Georgia Street by George Banker, the one-eyed bartender. 
</P>
<P>
The Continental was the longest bar in town. George was gruff and burly, with 
an intimidating eyeless socket. But he was sweet; he ran the bar like a priest 
ministering to his flock. It was always clogged with muggers, hookers, bag 
ladies, used car salesmen from nearby Figueroa Street, and, of course, 
reporters and photographers. George also kept the permanent stew, food being 
required by law. No one ever knew what went into it. 
</P>
<P>
We were a disreputable lot, but we kept the people informed, at least about the 
lower reaches of society. Stanley Walker had defined news as "wine, women and 
wampum," and we covered it. I have always wanted to print a poem about that 
breed. I do not know its author, but it was copyrighted in 1928 by the McNaught 
Syndicate Inc. With apologies to its author: 
</P>
<P>
 Here's to the gallant reporters, 
</P>
<P>
 Those boys with the pencils and pads, 
</P>
<P>
 Those calm, imperturbable, cool, 
</P>
<P>
 undisturbable, 
</P>
<P>
 Nervy, inquisitive lads. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time that we pick up a paper 
</P>
<P>
 Their marvelous deeds we should bless; 
</P>
<P>
 Those bold, reprehensible, brave, 
</P>
<P>
 indispensable 
</P>
<P>
 Sensible lads of the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lines are heavily sentimental and ironic, but they were probably written 
by one of those bold, reprehensible, brave, indispensable, sensible lads of the 
press himself. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were lassies as well as lads, but not many. The women were 
often called sob sisters and were usually given tear jerkers to write -- 
stories about young mothers who were in jail for sticking their boyfriends with 
an ice pick. But they were good reporters -- tough, aggressive, resourceful, 
subtle and fearless. 
</P>
<P>
Agness Underwood, as a reporter, once dropped a white carnation on the body of 
a waitress who had been stabbed to death in a bar, just to give the story a 
name -- "The White Carnation Murder." Then she told her photographer to take a 
picture of her creation. A policeman interfered. Agness slapped him with her 
purse. As a city editor, Agness expected her reporters to be no less 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
The press has now become the media, and its practitioners wear stylish clothes 
and drink fastidiously. City editors are rarely carried out in delirium 
tremens. Reporters are responsible family men and women and have degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Or so I hear.

</P>
<P>
MAGAZINES: IMPORTANCE OF CIGARETTE ADS TO WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS AND 
PUBLICATIONS IS DETAILED. MAGAZINE WEEK, MEANWHILE, SAYS 165 PERIODICALS WOULD 
DIE WITHOUT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What would happen if a much-discussed ban on print tobacco advertising took 
effect? For one thing, 165 magazines might gasp their last breaths. That's 
according to a recent study by a group called the Leadership Council on 
Advertising, reported in the March 19 Magazine Week. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing, not mentioned by Magazine Week, is that there just might be some 
impact on the estimated 1,600 American teen-age girls who each day smoke a 
first cigarette, or on the reported 400% increase in lung cancer deaths among 
women since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
While male smokers are quitting at a steady rate, the number of women smokers 
has, until very recently, been growing. Experts cite various interrelated 
reasons why women are taking up and refusing to kick an addiction that makes 
their lungs a breeding ground for one of the most aggressive and deadly forms 
of cancer. One reason that can't be overlooked is the campaign the tobacco 
industry wages in the pages of women's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
In a pause from business as usual that's truly refreshing, the April Mirabella 
says to hell with advertisers and stares the issue down. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosperous tobacco industry makes a generous friend and a formidable foe," 
writes Sue Woodman in a piece titled "Target." 
</P>
<P>
"It supports women's sports events like the Virginia Slims tennis tournament; 
women's education and fellowships to the Women's Research and Education 
Institute, and women's arts projects," she says. "Women's organizations and 
magazines, which provide vital channels of information, support and role models 
for women, receive hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from tobacco 
advertising or sponsorship." 
</P>
<P>
The piece cites a British study speculating that teen-age girls read women's 
magazines, and are exposed to the advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Often those messages are received at a time when a young woman's self-image is 
at its shakiest, and when she may be most open to a cigarette ad's nonverbal 
messages," Woodman writes. 
</P>
<P>
The image promoted is that smoking makes women beautiful, successful and 
slender. But as a professor of surgery at UCLA points out: "The reality is that 
smoking leads to disease and death, and dying from lung cancer is a terrible 
way to die." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute called Mirabella's assertion that 
advertisements hook girls on smoking "a transparently false argument." 
</P>
<P>
"It completely ignores the experience of countries around the world which have 
banned advertising of cigarettes altogether and seen no drop in the cigarette 
consumption of men, women or children. . . . None of the countries in Eastern 
Europe have had advertising in over 30 years and they have some of the highest 
cigarette consumption in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a proposed American ban on cigarette ads is fraught with 
constitutional perils. But self-regulation may not be as unlikely as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokeswoman for Mirabella, the magazine tipped off its tobacco 
advertisers that it planned to run Woodman's article. There is not a single 
cigarette ad in the April issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who doubts that a totalitarian undercurrent underlies certain streams of 
environmental thinking has been paying more attention to T-shirt aphorisms than 
"green" literature. Anyone who believes that the environmental movement is "an 
ideology every bit as powerful as Marxism and every bit as dangerous to 
individual freedom and human happiness" has overdosed on Ayn Rand. That 
alarmist quote is the low point of an essay by editor Virginia I. Postrel in 
the April Reason magazine. The piece is at least as politically slanted as any 
eco-screed. But if more environmentalists were as well-read in their own 
theorists and as lucid in their thinking as Postrel, the "green revolution" 
would be in much better shape. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the rapid destruction of natural wildlife habitat around the globe, 
photographer James Balog "created images of animals in exile from that lost 
Eden, adrift in the ether of a planet now alien to them." The resultant 
studio-type portraits of creatures including a chimpanzee, a manatee, a black 
rhino and an Atlantic green turtle are at first unsettling, then mesmerizing. 
In the April National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is not the safe, harmless substance everyone thinks it is," a 
representative of the organization CSIP contends in the April 15 issue of The 
Wine Spectator. "It rots wood and rusts iron. Thousands of people drown every 
year." The same issue also reports that Inglenook has promised to scrub 60 
million gallons of Navelle Burgundy from the Mendocino Coast after a wine 
tanker ruptured. Readers who aren't too tanked to think clearly will quickly 
recognize that this is the biweekly publication's annual April Fool's issue. 
</P>
<P>
NBC president Brandon Tartikoff dismisses David Lynch's new television series 
"Twin Peaks" by saying: "I probably would want to live in a country where 
("Twin Peaks") could work, but I suspect it will be a tough road for them." The 
April 6 Entertainment Weekly dismisses him as a "cynical, anti-art" kind of 
guy. The only mildly condescending review gives "Twin Peaks" an A-plus for 
refusing "to condescend to television." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHREDDER FODDER 
</P>
<P>
Siskel and Hoving? Hoving and Ebert? 
</P>
<P>
In the April Connoisseur, editor-in-chief Thomas Hoving reviews all 289 films 
he has watched on VCR. Give Hoving a thumbs up for his iconoclasm (among the 
films he pans: "Citizen Kane," "Catch 22," "Fellini Satyricon" and "Platoon"). 
Give him a thumbs down for thinking anyone cares.

LEGAL VIEW: HEY MOM: I'M BEING TAUGHT BY A '57 CHEVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students at Culver City High School are learning about the law in an unusual 
educational project sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation and the 
Beverly Hills Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare enough that high school students are offered classes about legal 
principles, but what makes this project even more interesting is the "vehicle" 
being used to teach the law: a 1957 blue Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Louis M. Brown, 80, first had the idea for the course nearly 30 years 
ago, when his children were in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, anybody can teach all of the law that a high school 
youngster can possibly absorb using the automobile as the central theme." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who helped pioneer the preventive law movement and who is the author of 
several legal books, wrote an outline for a textbook based on his idea, but he 
couldn't attract any interest among publishers. So the idea sat in the back of 
his mind until last year, when he found himself next to Kathryn Ballsun, the 
new president of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn., at a luncheon in his honor. He 
mentioned the idea to her, and as he puts it, she "went running with it." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-week, one-day-a-week course, taught by several volunteer attorneys, 
began at Culver City High School in February and will move to Santa Monica High 
School this month. 
</P>
<P>
Ballsun says her goal is for school districts across the country to pick up the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum uses the purchase, repair and operation of a blue '57 Chevy to 
illustrate these legal concepts: basic legal rights (the right to own property, 
to seek redress through the courts); contract law (the purchase of a car is a 
contract); automobile insurance; consumer rights (lemon laws, repairs), and 
criminal law (tickets, arrest). 
</P>
<P>
"The students love it," Ballsun says. "The law becomes something living and 
vital for them, rather than abstract principles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal," she continues, "is to expose high school students in a positive way 
to the concept of laws and how important they are in their daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
The handouts given each student at the beginning of the course demonstrate the 
pervasive impact the law can have on even a high school student. Included are 
an automobile purchase agreement, a manufacturer's warranty, a loan and 
security agreement (this allows the bank to repossess the car if you don't pay 
your car payment), a traffic ticket form, and a criminal complaint (the legal 
document that sets forth the crime with which a defendant is charged). 
</P>
<P>
And, no matter what your age, you'd be doing pretty well if you could 
understand all that.

Japanese cars -- and many European makes -- had a reputation during most of the 
1980s for unparalleled quality. But recently the quality ratings on some of 
those imported and domestically built foreign cars have been taking some hard 
knocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Auto Safety recently put together a list of the most significant 
lemons of the 1980s, with some surprising results. Of course, there were the 
Ford, Chrysler and General Motors cars that you would expect -- cars such as 
the fire-prone Pontiac Fiero and the GM X-cars of early 1980s vintage. 
</P>
<P>
But on the list, along with the worst cars produced by Detroit, were some of 
the Japanese cars with the best reputation, including the Toyota Camry and the 
Honda CRX. The center, a nonprofit group supported by Ralph Nader, said this 
about the Camry: "Toyota touted the car as the most trouble-free, but owners 
found otherwise. Defects in the transmission, brakes, timing belt and cruise 
control put this car to shame." 
</P>
<P>
The Honda CRX "won" in the "most fragile" category because its plastic bumpers 
"were so flimsy that owners forked over $1,000 in repairs after toddler-speed 
5-miles-per-hour impact." 
</P>
<P>
Other imported cars on the lemon list were the Suzuki Samurai, Peugeot 505, 
Sterling 815 (a Honda derivative from England), Renault Alliance, the Maserati 
Bi-Turbo and the Yugo. Import lemons took eight of the 21 positions on the 
list, a showing that is disproportionately large since import sales amount to 
less than a third of U.S. auto sales. In addition, the respected Consumer 
Reports annual auto issue for April shows that both Honda and Toyota are 
beginning to slip in their quality rankings. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean? Simply that buying a Japanese or other foreign car is no 
longer a guarantee of quality, if it ever was. American producers are beginning 
to catch up in quality and the Japanese and Europeans are beginning to slip. It 
was inevitable that this would happen, because the Japanese and European 
reputation for quality had risen to an unsustainable level. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a valid assumption anymore that a Japanese car is better than an 
American car," said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety. 
"If the best auto maker in Japan can produce a car as bad as the Camry, then 
the marketplace is not what it used to be." At some point, U.S. producers may 
catch up with their foreign rivals, even though the marketplace will not 
realize it immediately. At that moment, American cars will be bargains. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it pays to exercise caution, because there are still plenty of 
American-made lemons being sold. The Center for Auto Safety lists the GM-A 
cars, Chevrolet S-10 light truck, Chevrolet Camaro, Cadillac DeVille, Cadillac 
Allante, Chrysler Imperial and Ford Aerostar minivan as among the American 
lemons of the 1980s. 
</P>

Q: I have a 1980 Volkswagen Vanagon with an air-cooled 2,000-cc engine. I had a 
major engine failure last year and suspected that the motor was running hot. So 
I installed a temperature gauge on the engine and found that the head is 
running at a reasonable 120 degrees. But the oil is a ferocious 275 degrees. My 
question is: Would a synthetic oil help? The ads claim that synthetic oil does 
not break down at high temperature. -- M.H.H. 
</P>
<P>
A: The temperature is not abnormally high, especially considering that your 
engine is air-cooled. Oil sump temperatures on most engines run 235 degrees to 
260 degrees. The current top of the line oil, SG, is capable of running at 350 
degrees for 64 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The synthetic oils are also good, but keep in mind that it is the additives 
that tend to break down in high heat, and the synthetics use many of the same 
additives. If you are worried about the viscosity of the oil at the higher 
temperature, you can also run a heavier oil, such as an SAE 40 or SAE 50. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, if you are still worried about the problem, you might want to 
consider an after market oil cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently bought a motor home and would like to buy a small used car to 
tow. We are finding that you can't tow just any car. Is it better to use a tow 
bar, a two-wheel dolly or a four-wheel trailer? -- J.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: The manufacturers of many front-wheel-drive cars warn against towing the 
cars with the front wheels on the ground for more than a few dozen miles. The 
problem is that without the engine running, a transmission may not receive 
proper lubrication and can overheat. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to use a two-wheel dolly rather than a tow bar. The problem is 
that the dolly does use more space when parked and involves more work to hook 
up. If you want to avoid the hassle and stick with a tow bar, the only way you 
can safely buy a car that can be towed on the ground is to check the owner's 
manual before you buy it.

IMPASSIONED POSTERS CHANGED THE FACE OF GERMANY

<TEXT>
<P>
Nov. 9, 1918. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicates power of a bruised and battered Germany. 
Within hours, a new republic is declared. A coalition of socialists forms a 
provisional government and announces a January date for the country's first 
democratic elections. Suddenly, the war-weary nation awakes. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship rules lapse, a paper shortage eases, and posters swathe the urban 
landscape in fiery political rhetoric. The bold color used by German artists 
"transformed the cities into pyrotechnic tapestries," according to historian 
Ida Katherine Rigby. Between the November Revolution and the January elections, 
wrote a contemporary observer, "Berlin's streets rioted in color orgies, the 
houses exchanged their gray faces for an agitated mask." 
</P>
<P>
A selection of these impassioned posters now hangs on the spare white walls of 
the Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery gallery downtown. Tamed somewhat by the new 
surroundings, many of the works nevertheless refuse to be declawed, their 
fierce color and searing imagery stretching resolutely over the vast 
chronological and geographical divide. 
</P>
<P>
An image of a bony, ashen hand poised over a quiet village portends impending 
danger. The poster's caption links the threat to Bolshevism and urges Germans 
to protect their homeland from the forces that assumed power over Soviet Russia 
the year before. Determined to prevent Germany's November Revolution from 
veering toward the anarchism and extremism associated with Soviet Russia's 
October Revolution, the provisional government launched a fervent campaign to 
instill order, to cease agitation in the streets and appeal to workers to 
return to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Posters became instrumental in this campaign, and those commissioned by the 
government's publicity committee took their places on the streets beside those 
issued by political parties and private anti-Bolshevik leagues. The 
Novembergruppe, a band of artists and writers committed to upholding the values 
of the socialist-led revolution, carried out many of the commissions with the 
same Expressionist fury they brought to their paintings and prints. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators plunge through the center of a Heinz Fuchs' poster, their signs 
as harshly pointed as the artist's brusque black lines. "Do You Want Enough to 
Eat?" reads one handwritten placard. "Work Brings Bread," answers another. An 
unbounded Expressionist energy collaborates here with the government's adamant 
call for order. To eyes steeped in generations of Expressionism, from German to 
Abstract to Neo-, the effect is dynamic, charged, immediate. To the German 
worker of 1918-19, however, the simple, slashing lines of such images were like 
strange babblings in a foreign tongue, suspicious and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
More intelligible, perhaps, were posters in the style of O.H.W. Hadank's "Work 
is Deliverance." The bold red block letters confirm the image below, of a 
monumental sower, spreading seeds across the new Germany. While the old nation 
stands in flames and ruins beneath a stormy sky, the new gleams in the light of 
the rising sun, a common symbol of the nascent republic. Radiant and orderly, 
the new world thrives through the labor of its citizens, the workers in 
distant, churning factories, and the strong, stern-faced sower. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Klein's "He Who Doesn't Work Digs the Graves of His Children" offers the 
same moral in more desperate terms. In the center of the image a group of men 
huddles together, idle, hands in pockets, while behind them a factory stands 
unproductive and, in front, a mother and her children starve. The mother, gaunt 
and humble, clutches a bundled baby, while an older child reaches out toward 
the men from her seat on an austere black coffin. Klein's sooty palette, 
accented in blood red and touches of yellow, empowers the image with a severity 
and urgency certain to prod the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Whether drawn in the violent black shards of Expressionism, in an older, more 
staid style of illustrational realism, or a melodramatic mode in between, the 
posters here state their case with bold insistence. The contemporary viewer, 
however, is faced with a challenge similar to that imposed on the German worker 
of 1918-19. While the worker could read the words but not the imagery of the 
more innovative posters, the present audience can grasp the power of the images 
but not the words. The gallery has provided only sporadic translations, and 
without these, the posters shout in a muffled voice, commanding in tone but 
elusive in meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The richness of this material, historically as well as visually, deserves a 
more thoughtful approach than it has earned here. Thematic groupings and more 
precise information about the social and political contexts from which the work 
emerged would help it do what it meant to do -- communicate and not just 
decorate. 
</P>
<P>
Though the show is named "Novembergruppe," it is doubtful that all of the work 
here was made by members of that group. Many of the posters bear the torch 
insignia of the Werbedienst, the government's publicity office, but many do 
not. A campaign poster for the German National People's Party, for instance, a 
faction that remained loyal to the conservative values of the Kaiser's Germany, 
seems an unlikely Novembergruppe commission. 
</P>
<P>
This eclectic selection of posters, culled from three private collections, 
nevertheless reflects the extraordinarily fickle nature of German politics 
between the wars. Even in retrospect, the period refuses a fixed definition. 
Its 17 different governments in 15 years suffered contradictions, clashes and 
dangerous ambiguities -- problems that this show, too, cannot overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Novembergruppe" continues at Photowest Gallery (744 G St., Suite 205) through 
April 30.

Sullivan on 'Murphy Brown': Former "CBS This Morning" co-anchor Kathleen 
Sullivan is in Los Angeles taping the season finale of CBS' "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan plays herself in the episode, which has Frank (Joe Regalbuto) asking 
Murphy (Candice Bergen) to get him a date for Corky's (Faith Ford's) wedding. 
The episode will air during the May ratings sweeps. Sullivan's contract with 
CBS doesn't end until November and, with the sudden firing of Brent Musburger 
last weekend, there are rumors that she just might find another role at the 
network with CBS Sports before spring is out. SHAUNA SNOW

Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum, has accepted an 
invitation to join the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, a prestigious New 
York-based professional organization with about 150 members in the United 
States and Canada. Membership in the association is determined by the quality 
of museums' collections and programs as well as directors' achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais appears to be the only member from Orange County. Kevin E. Consey, 
former Newport Harbor Art Museum director, transferred his membership when he 
was named director of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art last year. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Orange County artists have applied for Artists-in-Residence grants from 
the California Arts Council, nine more than applied last year. A council 
official largely credited Orange County artist Mary-Linn Hughes with the 
increase. Hughes, last year's sole artists-in-residence grant recipient from 
the county, waged a grant awareness campaign of sorts and helped organize a 
recent workshop on how to apply for the grants, which pay artists to work in 
schools and other community agencies. They are awarded in June.

Estefan Leaves Hospital: Singer Gloria Estefan, promising she would soon be 
back performing at 100%, left New York's Orthopedic Institute Hospital for 
Joint Disease on Wednesday, two weeks after a bus crash broke her spine. 
Estefan, 32, faced reporters, cameras and hospital workers from a wheelchair, 
but then ended her news conference by standing, unaided. Doctors have estimated 
her full recovery could take up to six months. SHAUNA SNOW

Chagall Record Set: An unidentified Japanese telephone bidder paid an auction 
record price of $6.09 million for a work by artist Marc Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
The 1949 painting, "The Bride Under the Canopy," was the highest-priced work in 
Tuesday night's sale of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's. The painting 
shows a bride and bridegroom under an awning, with a large vase of leaves and 
flowers and a violinist. Another Chagall, "The Farmers' Bouquet," went for 
$5.02 million, also to a Japanese telephone bidder. SHAUNA SNOW

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: KUROSAWA SERIES CONTINUES; CURTIZ FILMS, 3-D FEST ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
There is an abundance of alternative film offerings this week. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive Kurosawa retrospective continues at the Little Tokyo Cinemas, 
as does the survey of Iranian cinema of the '80s at UCLA, where a 34-film 
Michael Curtiz series commences tonight with his 1921 Austrian silent "The Way 
of Terror." There's even a three-month 3-D festival starting Friday at the 
Vagabond, with the 1953 "House of Wax." Director Andre de Toth and star Vincent 
Price are expected to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LACE will present "Ten to Eleven: Television by Alexander Kluge," a 
90-minute presentation of recent work for TV by the spiritual father of the New 
German Cinema. The program will screen continuously during gallery hours from 
today through May 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to Eleven" finds Kluge at his most playful, freely associating and 
reprocessing images from 20th-Century popular culture to create fresh and often 
amusing meanings. One whimsical segment imagines the kidnaping of the Eiffel 
Tower, its relocation to an Arizona canyon and eventual magical return to 
Paris. Not surprisingly, there are many references to World Wars I and II, and 
Kluge even includes a newsreel on currency reform in the immediate aftermath of 
the Second World War. Throughout these videos, Kluge makes connections between 
popular culture, current events and economics. 
</P>
<P>
One delightful segment deals with vintage advertisements, with Kluge reducing a 
silly Nazi gymnastics rally -- the gymnasts form a swastika a la Busby Berkeley 
as a finale -- to the level of a commercial. Through a bit of judicious 
editing, Kluge turns an actress in an old movie -- she is almost certainly Leni 
Riefenstahl -- into endorsing a product in the midst of a love scene. Best of 
all is Kluge's "100 Years of Tango," which intermixes shots of the Battle of 
the Marne to the cooling towers of a nuclear plant, with homages to the tango's 
greatest stars, Rudolph Valentino and Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, both of 
whom suffered untimely deaths. Information: (213) 624-5650. 
</P>
<P>
Also commencing today is "Amerikanism," a series of films presented at the 
County Museum of Art in association with the Goethe Institute, which explores 
the role of America in Weimar culture after World War I. Opening the 
retrospective in the Bing Theater at 8 p.m. is Fritz Lang's final silent, 
"Woman in the Moon" (1929), a film so prophetically accurate and technically 
dazzling that in 1937 the Gestapo confiscated not only all models of its 
spaceship but also all foreign prints of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lang was honored for the film years later by the Space and Rocket Center 
in Huntsville, Ala., he always gave major credit to his good friend, pioneer 
rocket enthusiast Dr. Willy Ley, who collaborated with Hermann Oberth (later a 
rocket designer for the Nazis) in designing for the film a two-step rocket 
model along with other elaborate paraphernalia of space travel. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a novel by Lang's then-wife and co-scenarist Thea von Harbou, "Woman 
in the Moon," apart from its stunning visuals, is a typically exaggerated 
silent melodrama, a kind of vintage "Star Wars" played straight and involving 
an eternal triangle between two men and a woman. While Lang did not take the 
film's plot seriously, he was always proud of the film, especially for his 
inadvertent invention of the countdown to dramatize visually the spaceship's 
takeoff, a special challenge in the silent cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist and avant-garde composer Christine Baczewska will perform a 
live sound track for the film, using her voice as the primary instrument and 
supplementing it with synthesized tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's 8 p.m. program will be F. W. Murnau's "Sunrise" (1927) and Walter 
Ruttmann's "Berlin: Symphony of a City" (1927). For full schedule, call (213) 
857-6010. 
</P>
<P>
This month's Temp'theque program at the Directors Guild is "The Divine Garbo." 
If you missed "A Woman of Affairs" last January at UCLA, you will have another 
chance Saturday at 7 p.m. Greta Garbo is at her most transcendently beautiful 
and subtle in this 1928 silent version of Michael Arlen's "The Green Hat." It's 
followed at 9:15 by "Love," a 1927 version of "Anna Karenina." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's 7 p.m. double bill includes her first two MGM features, "The Torrent" 
and "The Temptress" (both 1926), followed at 9:45 by one of her finest, "Flesh 
and the Devil" (1927). For full schedule: (213) 466-FILM.

'RED HOT' FEATURES A CELEBRITY SURPRISE

** "Red Hot and Blue." Featuring Lee Atwater, Isaac Hayes, B.B. King, Carla 
Thomas, others. Curb Records. 
</P>
<P>
The most entertaining thing about this ensemble salute to spicy, Memphis-style 
'50s and '60s R &amp; B is the way it lets you surprise your friends. 
</P>
<P>
Play a selection such as "Knock on Wood" or "Bad Boy" for someone without 
identifying the singer, then watch their eyes bulge when you reveal that it's 
the controversial national chairman of the Republican Party . . . Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
Singer-guitarist Atwater comes across surprisingly well at first, especially 
vocally. He's not any better than a singer in an average bar band, but he is 
more convincing than such other celebrity pop figures as, say, the Blues 
Brothers and Bruce Willis. But the novelty effect of his singing and guitar 
licks wears thin, and it's hard to imagine listening to this tribute to a great 
era in American music when the records that inspired this project are still 
readily available.

TURKEY FRANKS WITH FLAVOR OF THE SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of a beef frankfurter use turkey for lower fat content. And instead of 
using the usual bun, update it with a Southwestern flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Wrap the frankfurter in a flour tortilla. Skip the mustard and relish and use 
shredded cheese, green onions and a zesty salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey frankfurters can be wrapped in cheese slices, such as Swiss, Jack or 
Cheddar, place in frankfurter buns and heated in a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
For a turkey frankfurter casserole, layer the bottom of a casserole with beans 
and top with frankfurters and garnish each with slices of cheese. Bake until 
heated through and cheese is bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
For appetizers, cut frankfurters in halves and spear rounded ends on bamboo 
sticks. Dip in French dressing mixed with mustard and bake until heated 
through. 
</P>
<P>
TURKEY FRANKFURTER ROLL-UPS

THE BUTCHER: NEW CAJUN DISHES HEAD YOUR WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I spent a wonderful week in Cajun country Louisiana not long ago eating my way 
into blissful oblivion on gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish and crab. It was the first 
time I had visited Louisiana, outside of New Orleans, since many years ago when 
chef Paul Prudhomme took me to visit "his people" back in the mid 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a few changes in Louisiana cuisine since then. New products 
have been developed and are being developed that are adding new excitement to 
an already exciting traditional Cajun and Creole cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
When I first came to Louisiana in the mid '70s, for example, alligator had just 
been taken off the endangered species list and hunting them was legal (under 
very controlled conditions) during September. Many creative cooks in that part 
of the world began experimenting with alligator meat. 
</P>
<P>
Alligator etouffe, alligator soup and alligator sausage are among the alligator 
dishes that became popular. A demand for alligator developed and a few 
enterprising entrepreneurs began farm-raising gators. This year they will 
harvest more than 75,000 farm-raised alligators. 
</P>
<P>
Alligator has not yet become a standard in the meat markets of America, but 
with the interest in Cajun and Creole food well established in this country, it 
probably won't be long before you run into alligator everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Another new Louisiana treat that will very likely soon be seen on the menus of 
fine restaurants everywhere is soft-shell crawfish, not soft-shell crabs, those 
are old hat. Soft-shell crawfish are something rather recent to Cajun-Creole 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until they started farm-raising crawfish in the mid 1980s that this 
delicacy began appearing on menus in south Louisiana. The crawfish molt four 
times a year and in the process, for a brief period, are left with a new soft 
shell. That new shell begins to harden very soon; but if harvested immediately 
after molting and quickly frozen, the shell remains soft and totally edible 
just like the soft-shell crab. I had them for the first time at Ralph &amp; 
Kacoo's, a restaurant in Baton Rouge. They were fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
Again, it will be a while before these are available in the frozen food case of 
a local super, but considering the interest in Cajun-Creole cooking in America 
and the support that the Louisiana Dept. of Agriculture and Louisiana State 
University give to aquaculture in the state, soft-shell crawfish could soon be 
a leading export. 
</P>
<P>
One of Louisiana's leading exports in recent years has been chef John D. Folse, 
C.E.C. Folse has been instrumental in bringing the cuisine of Louisiana to 
international recognition. Together with Prudhomme, Folse has taken Cajun 
dishes to all parts of the world: Beijing in 1986; Paris in 1987; Moscow in 
1988, and Italy last year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of my recent trip to Baton Rouge was spending an 
afternoon with Folse at his White Oak plantation. He generously prepared a 
variety of Cajun-Creole specialties for me to try: cochan de lait roast 
suckling pig cooked over an open fire, alligator sausage with crawfish butter, 
and a marvelous char-broiled pork tenderloin with Louisiana cane syrup. 
</P>
<P>
Pork tenderloins are available everywhere, packaged two to a vacuum package. 
And Louisiana cane syrup can be found in any well-stocked supermarket or food 
specialty store. 
</P>
<P>
CHAR-BROILED PORK TENDERLOIN WITH CANE SYRUP SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 pork tenderloins 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Port 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup Louisiana cane syrup 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup cracked black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried basil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon 
</P>
<P>
Cane Syrup Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Wipe pork tenderloins dry with paper towel. Place in glass dish and add Port, 
syrup, pepper, salt, thyme, basil and tarragon. Rub marinade well into meat and 
let stand at room temperature 20 to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Grill meat over coals in covered grill 20 to 30 minutes. Don't overcook. 
Internal temperature should be about 150 degrees, meat should be juicy and just 
past pink. Slice thin on bias and serve with Cane Syrup Sauce. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Cane Syrup Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons finely minced onion 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Port 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Louisiana cane syrup 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter over medium high heat in heavy saucepan. Saute onion and garlic 
until tender, about 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Add Port and broth and cook to reduce to approximately 1/2 volume. Add syrup, 
salt, cayenne and black pepper and continue to cook until sauce is slightly 
thickened and all flavors are well incorporated. Makes about 1 cup. 
</P>
<P>
Note: 1 to 2 teaspoons arrowroot dissolved in equal amount of water may be 
stirred in to achieve slightly thicker consistency, if desired.

GLENDALE PROPOSES NEW LIMITS ON VENDING TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobile vending trucks would have to stay away from parks and schools, limit 
their sales hours and face tougher penalties for breaking rules under an 
ordinance recommended Tuesday by Glendale city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council told its staff in February that it wants to impose 
new restrictions on mobile vendors who sell sandwiches, ice cream, produce and 
other items. The council deferred action on the proposed ordinance Tuesday, 
asking the staff to make minor changes and bring it back to the council in two 
to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The revised law, combined with significant fee hikes proposed by the city 
staff, would give Glendale some of the toughest mobile vending rules in Los 
Angeles County, one longtime operator said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gone further and faster with these regulations than any other city in 
which we operate," said Dorothy E. Heyne, co-owner of Ray's Rite Rate Lunch 
Service in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial catering firm, founded in 1943, owns or supplies 50 food trucks 
that operate in Glendale, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Burbank, Beverly Hills and 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale council members said a crackdown is needed because of residents' 
complaints that the vendors disrupt their neighborhoods. And business people 
have complained that the vendors divert customers from stores and restaurants 
that must charge higher prices because of higher operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're totally out of control," Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said some vendors have avoided county health department 
inspections and may not be sanitary. Bremberg referred to some vending vehicles 
as "roach coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed restrictions: 
</P>
<P>
* Mobile vendors could operate only from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* The vehicles could not park within 300 feet of a park or a school. 
</P>
<P>
* Mobile vendors could not sell on private property within a residential zone. 
</P>
<P>
* A mobile vendor who violates Glendale rules twice would face a misdemeanor 
charge; conviction would result in the loss of the vending license. 
</P>
<P>
* The present 10-minute limit on vending at any one place would increase to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Heyne said she was concerned about some of the proposed changes, including the 
ones that could bar her from construction sites before 6 a.m. and from Glendale 
campuses, where her trucks traditionally provide snacks to night school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said the city clerk could grant exemptions in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
But "you could spend a lot of time at the city clerk's office looking for 
exemptions," Heyne said. "Other businesses that are paying the same taxes 
aren't subject to the same red tape." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has issued about 120 mobile vending licenses this year, each costing 
$36. City Manager David H. Ramsay said he will propose increased fees to pay 
the cost of enforcing the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is considering a plan that would boost the annual mobile vending fee 
to $300 per company and $50 per truck, said Steven Adams, an assistant to 
Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
Heyne said Glendale's charge would be significantly higher than those she pays 
in any other city in which she operates. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new rules and fees would punish her business for offenses she said 
were committed by some smaller operators. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is to find the right balance," Councilman Jerold Milner told Heyne 
at Tuesday's meeting. "We don't want to penalize you, but on the other hand, we 
have a proliferation of less-desirable mobile vendors."

COACH WAS A CONTENDER; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: FRANKIE DUARTE IS LIVING ONE OF HIS DREAMS AS NEW TRAINER AT THE 
HUNTINGTON PARK ATHLETIC CLUB, WHERE HE STEERS LATINO YOUTHS INTO THE RING AND 
AWAY FROM DRUGS AND GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frankie Duarte, former world championship contender, gang member, alcoholic and 
drug addict, was in the boxing ring again. His hands were up deflecting punches 
-- dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep those hands up," Duarte told his sparring partner, a youth who ducked 
under a deliberately slow right. 
</P>
<P>
Just seven months after his last title shot, the 35-year-old Duarte is living 
one of his dreams. He is head coach of the Huntington Park Athletic Club, a 
boxing program set up by the city to keep the area's predominantly poor, Latino 
youths off the streets and out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a job here not just to make fighters but to be an example, to pass on 
what I've learned through the good and bad times in life," said Duarte, who was 
known in boxing circles as a relentless brawler with a chin of stone. "I have a 
lot to teach these kids, and it's not just boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, 35, is surprisingly open about the good and bad times. 
</P>
<P>
There was the heroin overdose in 1983, when other addicts tried to revive him 
with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and by putting ice in his pants and burning 
the bottom of his feet with cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte regained consciousness the next morning. The scared addicts did not dare 
to call an ambulance, he said. "I couldn't believe I almost died," Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was his comeback and the magical year of 1987, when the world 
championship was in Duarte's grasp, when he enjoyed the celebrity and glitter 
heaped on boxing's elite. He especially loved it when the crowd chanted 
"Frankie, Frankie, Frankie" as he prepared for battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on heroin, a bum," Duarte said. "Then here I was on TV. It was a high no 
drug could ever match. It was like something out of the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Now Duarte is out of the limelight again. He spends his afternoons and 
Saturdays in an old brick building on Rugby Avenue, home of the Huntington Park 
Athletic Club. Youngsters walk through a graffiti-stained alley to reach the 
entrance. At least some of the 20 to 30 youths who work out on a typical 
afternoon have run with gangs. They are like the Frankie Duarte who partied on 
the streets of Venice years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was one of four children born to a barber and a housewife. He has lived 
most of his life in a modest stucco home in the Mar Vista neighborhood near 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 13 years old I was already getting into sniffing glue," Duarte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte soon graduated to hard drugs as he partied with Latino gangs. When 
Duarte was 15, his desperate father offered to get him into a boxing program if 
he stayed clean. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager had been a boxing fan and decided to give it a whirl. He rode the 
bus almost daily to the Teamsters Boys Club in Los Angeles. He showed promise, 
winning Golden Gloves titles. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte recalled his first trip to the gym: "I remember the trainer saying at 
ringside, 'He's a natural.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Duarte was losing big outside the ring. The drug use continued, and Duarte 
began drinking when he was 17, the year before he turned professional. Duarte 
was a discipline problem. He attended four junior high schools and two high 
schools before dropping out in the 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be one of the guys," Duarte said. "I kept saying when I turn 
professional I'll quit doing it all." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte did not quit, but he was flourishing in the ring anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying I was a future champ, that I couldn't miss," Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1977, he lost a bout that would have put him in line for a championship 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte said he had been drinking and smoking PCP up to two weeks before the 
fight. He was overweight and had to take water pills to reduce. In the fight, 
Duarte took a beating. The referee stopped it in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
"I really went on a low point," Duarte said. "I started using heroin. I started 
hanging out with a lot of hypes." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte had some more wins; he held the California featherweight title in 1978. 
But he was haunted by his past. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how successful I was, when I was outside of boxing I was afraid to 
talk to people; would they think I was stupid?" Duarte said. "I'd rather be 
back in the barrio partying with the homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
The first stage of Duarte's career came to an end after a 1979 loss to Rolando 
Navarette, who later became the World Boxing Council's junior lightweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to pursue my partying life," Duarte said. "I realized I couldn't 
quit. I didn't know how to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte had become a hard-core heroin addict by 1982. He held odd jobs, but 
nothing solid. A turning point came two years later when he was kicked out of 
his parents' house and went to live with an aunt. There he read the Bible. He 
returned to the gym in 1984 and gave up drugs and booze. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have money. I didn't have a car," Duarte said. "It was the only thing 
I knew how to do." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte made a comeback. In July, 1986, he won $50,000 and the North American 
Boxing Federation bantamweight championship in a bout against a Hawaiian 
fighter named Jesus Salud. Duarte was being invited to celebrity parties. There 
were television interviews. On the surface, life was sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The media played up Duarte's tragic history before his 1987 title fight with 
Bernardo Pinango, the World Boxing Assn.'s bantamweight champ. Former alcoholic 
and drug addict makes good -- that was the gist of most of the news reports. 
Duarte knocked down Pinango in the 12th round but ended up losing a bloody, 
controversial 15-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I got robbed," Duarte said. "After that fight I was never the same." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte said he stayed sober for two years as he trained for another title 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Duarte lost a one-sided bout to WBC super-bantamweight champion 
Daniel Zaragoza of Mexico City. The referee stopped the fight in the 10th round 
after Duarte caught more punches than he wishes to remember. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the ring after the fight, Duarte bade his farewell: "I'm 
getting too old for this." He finished his career with a record of 45-8-1. 
</P>
<P>
And after years of being clean, Duarte again turned to alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an addict and alcoholic," Duarte said. "When you go back, you go back 
big." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte considers it a godsend that a friend told him about the coaching job in 
Huntington Park. He was hired last November as an assistant coach and has since 
been promoted to head coach. Duarte said he has stayed clean of alcohol and 
drugs since he started. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
To get the job, Duarte had to agree to random drug and alcohol testing, said 
police Capt. Frank Sullivan, one of the organizers of the boxing program. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's history of drug and alcohol abuse "was a big issue," Sullivan said. 
"We kicked it around a lot." Sullivan said Duarte is an excellent coach and has 
not had a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the gym, the young boxers seem to like the fact that their new coach 
was a contender. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay more attention to what he says," said Angel Magana, 18. "He's a real 
good trainer." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte says he is careful to be a friend and to try to boost the self-esteem of 
his young charges. He has a gentle way of working with the youths, moving their 
bodies this way and that, so they will be in proper position. He will take some 
punches and give a few during sparring. 
</P>
<P>
"No one gets kicked out of this gym," Duarte said. "I don't care if they loaf 
on the heavy bag. That's one day of their life they're off the streets and in a 
safe environment." 
</P>
<P>
And if a youngster is having problems and seeks his advice, Duarte has a 
powerful message.

POLICE, GAYS PATROL VIOLENCE-PRONE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an uncommon sight, reflecting an uncommon partnership: Three police 
officers and about 14 gay men, most clad in leather, together walking the dimly 
lit streets of Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups collaborated Friday night to patrol the community's gay bars, 
which homosexuals complain are common sites for "gay-bashing," violence against 
homosexuals because of their sexual orientation. Police and gay community 
leaders say they hope it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Or a friendship, period. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think it represents progress," said Mark Haskins, an organizer of 
the Silverlake Neighborhood Action Patrol (SNAP), a 1-year-old, struggling 
effort to deploy volunteer patrollers about once a month in hopes of curbing 
gay-bashing. "It's two groups that have a history of adversarial relationships, 
going into a new era of commitment to licking the problem of gay-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's foot patrol marked the first time in Silver Lake that police and 
gay activists have directly joined forces to address attacks on homosexuals. 
Northeast Division police officers accompanied SNAP volunteers on a late-night 
trek through Sunset Junction, a graffiti-scarred area around Sunset, Santa 
Monica and Griffith Park boulevards and Fountain Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Capobianco formed SNAP in February, 1989, after a homosexual employee of 
his Silver Lake clothes store was beaten after leaving a bar. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the patrol was heavily supported and volunteers walked the 
streets every weekend, said Capobianco. But after a few months, support waned. 
And last year, after one patrol was shot at with an air gun that shoots paint 
balls -- usually used with protective clothing in mock war games -- and another 
was harassed by a gang, volunteers became less willing to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many volunteers, including Haskins, say they will not patrol Silver Lake 
unless police accompany the group. 
</P>
<P>
The patrons of Sunset Junction's five bars say they long have been the target 
of assaults, verbal abuse, intimidation or derogatory graffiti. One study shows 
such incidents may be on the rise. The Los Angeles County Commission on Human 
Rights, in a report released in February, recorded 86 hate crimes last year 
against homosexuals. That number was up 41% from 1988, and two-thirds of the 
incidents involved assaults, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Most gay advocates said even that number is conservative, because many 
incidents are never reported to authorities. The Gay and Lesbian Community 
Services Center in Hollywood, which operates a hot line for gay-bashing 
victims, last year received about 170 complaints. Many of those involved 
incidents in Silver Lake, center officials said, but they could not give 
specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
However, "gay-bashing" is an elusive subject, difficult to define or quantify. 
About one-third of the incidents reported to the gay and lesbian center were 
complaints about police who homosexuals considered overzealous in their patrols 
of gay bars for health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
Northeast Division police, on the other hand, do not perceive gay-bashing as a 
major problem. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ben Lee, whose beat includes the Sunset Junction area, said he cannot 
remember the last time he received a gay-bashing complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, police seldom receive complaints about the Silver Lake bars, he said, 
and generally leave them alone. "They pretty much take care of their own and 
kind of police themselves," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reports I get," he said, are complaints from homeowners about 
homosexuals "cruising in cars or walking around in neighborhoods after the bars 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Northeast Division officers are instructed to make a note on their reports any 
time racial or sexual hatred is a motive in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a huge number of those incidents occurring," said Detective Rob 
Watters, who reviews those reports. "I think there was one I was aware of in 
the last six months. There was one in Rampart," the adjoining police division, 
he said. "I don't see it as a huge problem in the Northeast area at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuals are reluctant to report the attacks to police -- often because they 
don't believe their complaints will be taken seriously, said Donna Wade, 
co-chairperson of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Police Advisory Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Police and gay advocates in the past have also disagreed on what constitutes 
gay-bashing. When Mario Martinez, 26, was shot between the eyes on Feb. 28, 
1987, and robbed of his leather jacket after he left a Silver Lake bar, the gay 
community angrily demanded protection from gay-bashing. But police considered 
it a random robbery, not a homosexual-targeted crime. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty in quantifying gay-bashing, even members of the gay 
community agree, is that the assailants are sometimes homosexuals themselves, 
who are picked up at Silver Lake bars or on the "cruise" and who beat their 
partners after going home with them. The county commission's study found that 
more gay-bashing incidents occurred in residences than in public or at places 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the scarcity of solid documentation, the perception of 
vulnerability remains extremely high in the Silver Lake gay community, 
activists said. 
</P>
<P>
Gay-bashing also occurs in West Hollywood, the other gay enclave in Los 
Angeles, gay advocates said. But they said attacks may be more violent around 
Sunset Junction. 
</P>
<P>
The bars' clientele, mainly gay men, attract attention in an area where gang 
activity abounds, Haskins said. And the density of the bars -- all within 
walking distance of one another -- makes the area a prime location for crimes 
aimed at homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the gay community's uneasiness with the police, SNAP's leaders 
decided to appeal to police for help. With assistance from Councilman Michael 
Woo, a meeting was set up last month. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Paul Afdahl and Lee attended. They told the group the Police 
Department supports neighborhood patrols by community groups. Without promising 
to make it a practice, they agreed to accompany the group on a trial patrol. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that meeting, 14 gay male volunteers joined three police 
officers Friday night. Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, whose 13th 
District encompasses Silver Lake, also joined the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
As Woo and Haskins led the group past graffiti-marked walls, down dark streets 
and past an old mattress blocking a cracked sidewalk, Lee and Officer Paul 
Afdahl chatted comfortably with the volunteers, most of whom wore leather 
jackets and jeans and were members of the Avatars, a club for men who like to 
dress in leather. They were accompanied by Officer Glenda Browne. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol passed several bars -- the Detour, Cuffs, the Gauntlet, Red's -- and 
virtually every man interviewed told of being accosted or attacked while 
visiting one of them. Mark Acuna, a Claremont artist, said he had been jumped 
twice by youths while in Silver Lake, motivating him to join the patrol. Friday 
was his third time as a SNAP volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"For years we were good little boys and kept quiet," said Acuna, a burly 
51-year-old who wore a leather jacket and knitted cap. "Well, some 
neighborhoods have decided to take back their streets. We've decided to take 
back ours. 
</P>
<P>
"To get from a bar to your car, you do it with a feeling that anything might 
happen to you," he said. "But I've personally never been afraid. I think to be 
afraid is to submit that they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
During the first tour of the area, the patrol saw none of that. Few people 
walked the sidewalks and passengers in cars offered only quizzical stares. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of the route, the patrol stopped suddenly in front of a dark, 
narrow alley. Two young men drinking in the shadows were startled, then 
embarrassed as the police officers ordered them to dump out their beers. 
</P>
<P>
A quick frisk produced a "fist dagger" -- a thick, T-shaped steel spike with a 
two-inch blade -- on one of them. The sight of it made members of the patrol 
grimace. One youth was arrested for possession of a deadly weapon. The other 
was questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence, however, that the pair were laying in wait to attack gay 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
But the members of the patrol had their suspicions. "If there had been just one 
or two people walking down there, it could have been a very ugly situation," 
said Dana Atkinson, an organizer of the Avatars. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Woo capitalized on the night's only incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw with my own eyes a great example of why this patrol is needed," said 
Woo, as the group finally returned to the coffee shop at which it had met two 
hours earlier. "Who knows? Perhaps we prevented some violent attack from taking 
place because we were on the patrol." 
</P>
<P>
The two officers were more guarded in their assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first coordinated, visible effort between the police and the gay 
community," Lee said. "The first time is very important as image setting. 
Because of our limited manpower, we can't do it every week. But I think it's a 
good first step in establishing a better rapport." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Frank Patchett, commander of the Northeast Division, said the division 
lacks the resources to maintain regular foot patrols with the gay group, but 
would do its best to provide support any time the group schedules a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have enough officers to put a foot beat in that area," Patchett said. 
"I'd like to have that luxury, but we don't." 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to a foot beat, Patchett said, he has worked out an 
arrangement with the Rampart Division, which is responsible for the south side 
of Sunset Boulevard, to deploy a special weekend patrol of the gay bar area in 
unmarked police cars. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has two objectives, to discourage young adults who may be planning 
to harass homosexuals and also to discourage the activities of gay men that 
annoy residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of complaints from residents in the neighborhood of gays driving 
around and committing sex acts," Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side-benefit of this is that the gays will probably go someplace 
else. I hope the neighborhood will quit complaining about the gays and the gays 
will have some sense of safety being able to walk around the streets." 
</P>
<P>
After two hours with the gay volunteers Friday, Woo and the police left. The 
remaining volunteers set out on a second tour of the area, with two of the men 
driving a car alongside the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
This time, three separate groups of hecklers in cars shouted derogatory 
comments and whistled. Without the police and Woo, muttered Charlie, a La 
Crescenta hardware store clerk, the patrol "gets a little more serious." 
</P>
<P>
When the group stopped to talk to Rudy, a security guard who strolled the 
parking lot of a popular bar, the heavyset, bearded Latino warned of the influx 
of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Be forewarned what you're getting into," Rudy said sternly. "If you want to 
control the turf, there'll be blood spilled. Be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't any that night. At about 2 a.m., the group returned to the coffee 
shop. The men slapped each other on the back, hugged and applauded the 
four-hour effort. For many, the event meant overcoming both their fears of the 
street and the police officers whose assistance they had sought. 
</P>
<P>
"It was uncomfortable to a certain extent," said Gerald Caponi, a 28-year-old 
from Orange County. "When I see a police officer around the area I don't know 
what their attitude is. I feel endangered from both ends. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll go through anything to protect our territory," Caponi said.

QUAKE'S EFFECTS HIT POLITICS AS CANDIDATES MAKE IT ISSUE

<P>
Shock waves from the earthquake that jolted this quiet, conservative city in 
1987 are still being felt by the 10 candidates running for council seats in 
next Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates said that the Administration has botched the job of 
rebuilding the city, and is unresponsive to residents. They are competing for 
two seats on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Chandler, 66, who is seeking his third term, is the only incumbent running 
for reelection. Mayor Victor Lopez, on the council 12 years, is retiring. The 
other candidates are Bob Henderson, an insurance broker who was a councilman 
from 1976 to 1984; Helen McKenna Rahder, 38, a teacher and local activist who 
rose to local prominence during a fight to save the Whittier Theater; Fred 
Bergerson, 48, a political science professor at Whittier College; David Todd, 
50, a savings and loan executive; Francois Pellissier, a real estate appraiser 
and member of the Whittier Planning Commission; Thomas Barnes, a private 
investigator; Vicky Kroes, 39, a repairwoman; Donald Hawkins, an electrician, 
and Joseph Marsico, a Whittier resident who is making his sixth attempt at a 
council seat. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where elections generally pass unnoticed, this campaign has been the 
hottest in recent memory because some candidates say its outcome will determine 
whether Whittier will remain the quaint town with Quaker roots, or become just 
another Los Angeles suburb with too many gas stations and strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates have presented their criticism and plans for Whittier during at 
least five different debates, signs proliferate throughout the city, some 
candidates are broadcasting commercials on the local cable television stations, 
and nearly all are taking potshots at the current City Council. Most candidates 
have limited spending to $5,000, though, according to campaign expenditure 
statements, Henderson has spent about $15,000 on mailers, signs and newspaper 
ads and commercials in his bid to be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Though all 10 candidates said they want to preserve Whittier's character, they 
disagree on how it should be done. A lopsided division among the candidates has 
emerged: eight candidates who champion slow-growth, more historic preservation, 
and the preservation of the La Puente Hills, and two candidates who want 
careful development to bring more goods and services into Whittier without 
compromising the small-town atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Todd, who is viewed by some of the slow-growth candidates as a member of the 
Establishment, said that despite differences between the two camps, the goals 
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
"How we achieve those goals is the issue," he said. "Everyone agrees we need to 
have quality, attractive development. Nobody questions that we need to have 
more owner-occupied homes. Everyone wants to figure out a way to allow 
apartment buildings to exist compatibly in neighborhoods with single-family 
homes. But do we continue to change cautiously and carefully or do we go 
through with a meat ax?" Whittier residents, Todd said, want a cautious change. 
</P>
<P>
"This community has met change with progress, but progress on an evolutionary 
basis, not a revolutionary basis," he said. "We don't make sharp left and right 
turns in direction." 
</P>
<P>
But other candidates said residents are disgusted with the city's policies, 
evolutionary or not. They said the policies are outdated, and based on the 
philosophy that the development means business and all business is good. The 
problem, some candidates said, is that not all business is good when it creates 
increased density, traffic and pollution. These candidates said it is time for 
the council to sit down and do some long-range planning for Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a special town, but it cannot be isolated from the outside world," 
said candidate Bergerson. "The earthquake forced the city to face reality. If 
it chooses to ignore it, then this wonderful groove can become a rut." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said if the council continues in the same direction, Whittier's charm 
will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We are losing the ideals that make Whittier unique," he said. "People came 
here because they were reminded of the Midwest. We are now losing that special 
touch. There has been a proliferation of apartments and strip malls, and the 
council has been unable to find a way to decide where its priorities are. " 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, said the camp of eight candidates, is that the council 
refuses to listen to the residents it is supposed to represent. Instead, it 
indulges in its own whims without a word of explanation to residents, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's passage of an ordinance banning assault weapons last year, and 
its more recent refusal to consider buying and renovating the historic Whittier 
Theater are most often pointed to as examples of what candidates said is the 
council's arrogant attitude that it knows better than the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"When a lot of people get together for one cause, and they pack the chambers, 
fill the hallways, down the stairs, and the council ignores what they are 
saying, something has to be done," Kroes said. 
</P>
<P>
Pellissier points to another example. His family has lived in Whittier for 
generations and he wants council meetings broadcast on cable television. The 
council has steadfastly refused to allow the local cable station to tape 
meetings. Pellissier said if the meetings were broadcast, the council would 
realize their activities were being watched and would be more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other candidates support the idea. Councilman Chandler does not. He 
said that if meetings were broadcast council members would be more likely to 
grandstand than do their work. 
</P>
<P>
Marsico, 48, a 30-year resident of Whittier, also complains that the council 
has failed to help residents get around Whittier by building a fixed-route 
trolley system. Marsico said he has tried to get the council to approve such a 
system for 13 years, and only recently has the council agreed to look at his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The largest issues of the campaign, however, have centered on development and 
the problems it could bring. 
</P>
<P>
The most contentious issue centers on what many candidates said is Whittier's 
chief attraction: Puente Hills with its thousands of acres of canyons that 
abound with wildlife. Candidates are constantly asked by residents if they 
favor a planned extension of Hadley Street across the hills to Colima Road. 
Though the plan has been on the books for at least 25 years to alleviate 
commuter traffic on residential roads, it has not become any more popular. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s a plan by the council to develop the area was defeated after 
then-councilman Henderson and a grass-roots organization began a protest. A 
special election was called and the council's proposed ordinance defeated by a 
margin of 70%. Today only two of the candidates wholeheartedly support the 
extension: Chandler and Todd. Both said it is necessary to ease traffic on 
residential roads such as Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Pellissier and Bergerson said the road should be put through only 
after an environmental impact report has been made. Then Pellissier said only 
the route that would cause the least damage to the environment should be 
adopted. The others are dead set against any development of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
The other big development issue is what slow-growth candidates call reckless 
development. All candidates said Whittier residents take great pride in 
Whittier's distinctive characteristics such as the Whittier Village with its 
brick streets, vintage street lighting and small stores with colorful awnings. 
Since the earthquake, the economy of the Uptown area, including the Village, 
has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Shop owners in the area were encouraged by the city to rebuild as soon as 
possible, and many were offered loans at an interest rate of only 4%. Building 
owners consequently overbuilt, and there is about a 30% vacancy rate among 
retail shops today. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growth candidates said that given the high number of empty shops, the 
city should not be encouraging any more retail development. As an example, they 
point to a redevelopment project north of Whittier Boulevard that will result 
in thousands of square feet of commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The Urbatec redevelopment project at Whittier Boulevard and Hadley Street, a 
16-acre project, will bring in a Market Basket grocery store and a Sav-on 
drugstore, among other restaurants and retail outlets. The project, which was 
approved in the mid-80s, will take up a triangle piece of land bordered by 
Whittier Boulevard, Hadley Avenue and a portion of Magnolia. Magnolia would be 
closed to through traffic to build the center. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Chandler and Todd, most candidates have labeled the 
commercial project a classic example of bad development, though they 
acknowledge the area is run down. Pellissier called the project "total 
stupidity" and, like most of the others, criticized the city for paying 
millions of dollars for a 16-acre shopping area that he said will employ half 
as many people as the area now employs. 
</P>
<P>
But Todd and Chandler said that Urbatec cannot be compared to the small retail 
stores, many of which specialize in certain products. Urbatec, on the other 
hand, which will feature a grocery store and large chain drugstore, among other 
retail stores and restaurants, will offer services and products not offered in 
the smaller stores.

PROSECUTOR CLEARS SERLES OF CRIMINAL WRONGDOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city prosecutor Wednesday cleared Planning Commissioner Jim Serles of any 
criminal wrongdoing stemming from allegations that he accepted campaign 
contributions from several businessmen and then voted on their projects in 
violation of state ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This office has concluded its investigation and will not be filing any 
criminal charges," city prosecutor John Vander Lans said. "I don't find a 
criminal violation. I just don't think the charges are sufficient to raise (a 
criminal complaint)." 
</P>
<P>
Vander Lans said he forwarded his findings -- and those of an independent 
investigator appointed to assist the city -- to the Fair Political Practices 
Commission in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson there confirmed that a complaint is under review but said policy 
prohibits discussion of such matters until they are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics allegations were raised in late February by Doug Drummond, a retired 
police commander who is running against Serles for the 3rd District council 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond accused Serles of violating the state Political Reform Act by 
accepting hundreds of dollars in campaign contributions from four developers 
and businessmen, then voting in favor of projects they brought before the 
Planning Commission. A fifth charge accused Serles of misrepresenting the fair 
market value of office space donated for use as his campaign headquarters in 
violation of the state's $1,000 campaign contribution limit. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond sent the allegations to several investigative agencies. The Los 
Angeles County district attorney determined there were no felony crimes and 
forwarded the matter to the city prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Vander Lans reviewed four of the charges and the city appointed retired Los 
Angeles County Police Lt. B.A. Fitzgerald to investigate the office space 
allegation for any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney, who reviews civil matters, disqualified himself in the 
investigation because he had already given Serles advice on the allegations. 
Any allegation of civil wrongdoing would have to be determined by the FPPC, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this proves absolutely that there was no basis to my opponent's false 
allegations, innuendo and mistruths," Serles said. "I have stated from the very 
beginning when Mr. Drummond started with his falsehoods that the truth would 
prevail. " 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to disagree," Drummond said after learning of the prosecutors' 
decision. "I think he is in error. It still has not been investigated, in my 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Serles said two of the allegations were clerical 
errors. He acknowledged voting improperly in two other instances, but said his 
actions were oversights rather than intentional acts of corruption, as Drummond 
had charged.

Tips about your neighborhood graffiti artist could be worth $1,000 under Long 
Beach's graffiti reward program. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council recently doubled the reward for information that leads to the 
arrest and conviction of any person maliciously destroying property by defacing 
it with graffiti. The reward, originally $300 when the program was established 
in 1986, had risen to $500 and then was increased to $1,000 late last month. 
</P>
<P>
People with information about graffiti violations can call the 24-hour graffiti 
reward hot line, 420-3486. Information will be kept confidential. To report 
graffiti that needs to be removed, call 432-8904, Ext. 2215.

LA CRESCENTA AGENCY WILL NOT REDUCE SEWER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite widespread protests from residents, directors of a La Crescenta water 
agency said this week that they will not lower a 138% increase in sewer fees 
imposed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents had signed petitions and have protested at meetings since 
directors of the Crescenta Valley County Water District raised bimonthly sewer 
charges in September for single-family houses from $16.80 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
But after months of study, directors have concluded that the flat per-household 
fee is the only acceptable solution to meeting rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Robert K. Argenio, district general manager, 
said: "Although nobody is happy about the current rate, the pay-as-we-go method 
approved by the board of directors some months ago still appears to be the most 
equitable and cost-effective way to raise the necessary money." 
</P>
<P>
Irate homeowners led by Marjorie Falloure, a 64-year-old disabled resident, 
have called for still another protest at 7:30 tonight at Crescenta Valley High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Falloure has threatened legal action against the water district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had approved the rate increase in July, saying the higher 
fees are necessary to pay the community's estimated $8-million share of about 
$3.4 billion in improvements and additions to the Hyperion sewage treatment 
plant in Playa del Rey, where sewage from La Crescenta is processed. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal authorities mandated changes at Hyperion years ago and gave 
the city of Los Angeles until 1998 to reduce the amount of pollution dumped 
into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The La Crescenta district, like all of the independent agencies and cities that 
use Hyperion, is being charged for a portion of the costs. Argenio has warned 
that the fees may increase still more. 
</P>
<P>
Falloure and her followers had demanded that the district consider bond 
financing, state or federal grants, fees based on water usage, senior citizen 
discounts and low-income discounts to help lower the rates for residents who 
cannot afford the increase. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials this week said all of those alternatives are too costly, 
unavailable, inequitable or unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Argenio said the study of funding options "has led us back to where we 
started."

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED WITH CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale resident has been charged with committing a hate crime for allegedly 
yelling racial slurs and threats at a black man from Inglewood and pounding on 
his car after a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Krist Mardirossian, 31, was charged last week with one misdemeanor count of 
interfering with the civil rights of Kenneth Patterson, 35. If convicted, 
Mardirossian could face a $5,000 fine and up to six months in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was buying food from a sidewalk vendor in the 4000 block of San 
Fernando Road on March 9 when he saw another car back into his parked car, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David Dahle. As Patterson and the driver began to argue, 
Mardirossian and three friends allegedly approached Patterson, shouting racial 
epithets and threats and telling him to "get out of Glendale," Dahle said. 
</P>
<P>
When Patterson got in his car and tried to flee, Mardirossian pounded his fists 
on Patterson's windshield and continued to yell, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
Mardirossian's three companions were not charged because they had no physical 
contact with Patterson, Dahle said. 
</P>
<P>
Racial slurs alone are not considered hate crimes, said Glendale Police Agent 
Christopher Loop. Such crimes must be motivated by bigotry against specific 
groups and must involve racial epithets accompanied by physical assaults or 
threats, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the third hate crime recorded this year by Glendale police. In 
early February, two youths of Armenian descent, both 17, allegedly painted 
swastikas and the words Hitler and KKK on the Glendale Presbyterian Calgary 
Church, a Korean church, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the same youths were arrested in March after they and a friend shouted 
racial epithets and threw an empty beer can at a black woman in a car. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths were charged with interfering with the civil rights of the black 
woman and the Korean church and are awaiting prosecution in Pasadena Juvenile 
Court. Their friend was not charged in the incident, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight hate crimes occurred in Glendale in 1989, six of which were aimed at 
emigrants from Soviet Armenia -- the fastest-growing minority in the city. The 
other two involved black victims, Loop said.

POLITICS: ASSEMBLYMAN DENNIS BROWN SAYS HE FEELS AT PEACE AFTER DECIDING TO 
BECOME A LAY MINISTER INSTEAD OF SEEKING REELECTION. HE ALREADY IS PUTTING 
LAWMAKING ASIDE FOR MORE STUDY OF GOD'S LAWS.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is Thursday morning and Assemblyman Dennis Brown is once again of the 
Legislature but not in it. 
</P>
<P>
His desk is empty while his colleagues, milling around the ornate Assembly 
chamber, wrap up another week of public business by voting on a handful of 
bills before hastily deserting the Capitol for a weekend in their respective 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, the Los Alamitos Republican sits quietly in a Bible class, 
jotting notes about the Holy Spirit as his burly teacher inveighs against the 
growing American indifference to homosexuality, fornication, idolatry, 
covetousness, strife, drunkenness, materialism, pornography, suggestive body 
language and dirty jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded during break that the same sins have been loosely used to describe the 
conduct of the Legislature, Brown smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you know why I want to get out," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Legislature's most extreme conservatives, notorious for his habit of 
voting against almost everything, the six-term lawmaker has begun to turn his 
back on the business of the Capitol to start a new life as a born-again 
Christian and prospective lay minister. 
</P>
<P>
The change, he says, began with a religious experience early last year and 
culminated in his surprise announcement March 5 that God had directed him not 
to run for reelection from a safely Republican district, which includes 
portions of Long Beach and coastal Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also says that his decision to quit politics -- a passion since high 
school -- was influenced by a growing disillusionment with what he calls a 
"rotten" governmental system that falls short of representing the will of the 
people, and encourages the crass exchange of votes for campaign contributions 
and speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the little matter of his narrow escape from felony charges for 
his cameo role in the controversy over the forging of President Reagan's 
signature on 440,000 campaign letters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But now Brown, 41, says he feels at peace. He is intentionally distancing 
himself from the backslapping world of the Capitol, where once he helped direct 
conservative attacks on liberal legislators and government spending for social 
programs. He has quit his position on the powerful Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee and skips floor sessions so he can dedicate more time to religious 
classes at the Capital Christian Center, a large local evangelical church. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the Bible spells it out so perfectly, how the world will despise 
you, how you'll be persecuted, how you will be laughed at," he said. "Since I 
made my announcement three weeks ago . . . , I've noticed a difference in how 
people treat me. I haven't been insulted or anything. People are a little bit 
more uneasy around me, a little standoffish. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my closest friends, I can kind of see that they're not as interested 
in being as close personal friends as they once were." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his political enemies -- such as Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson) -- are as uncharitable as ever, however. They are still fuming over 
Brown's 11-year record as one of the so-called "Cavemen," a group of 
conservatives that prides itself on fighting government from within. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd also questions the timing of Brown's religious redirection. Could it be 
that Brown felt politically vulnerable, especially since the Huntington Beach 
oil spill highlighted his record of voting against environmental legislation? 
Or that conservative voters these days seem to be at odds with Brown's 
anti-abortion position? "If Jesus was responsible for getting him out of the 
way, Jesus was not interested so much in him as He was looking out for the rest 
of us," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
It was near-religious fervor that delivered Brown, a stockbroker and former Los 
Angeles County chairman of Young Americans for Freedom, to the heavy doors of 
the Capitol in 1978. Proposition 13 had captured the angry mood of the 
electorate, and Brown rode that mood to victory in a Democratic district on his 
first try for public office. The district's boundaries later were changed, 
increasing the number of registered Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stroke of luck," Brown said. "If it hadn't been for Prop. 13, I don't 
think there is any doubt that I would not have won that race." 
</P>
<P>
His race was one of seven that threw out incumbent Democrats in favor of 
conservative Republicans. Two other 1978 Assembly victors were Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), a chum of Brown from Young Republican days at USC -- and Ross 
Johnson (R-La Habra). Two years later, John Lewis -- Brown's best friend, 
former college roommate and top aide in Sacramento -- was elected from another 
Assembly district in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The group formed the nucleus of the conservative faction in the Assembly that, 
while not numerous enough to prevail, was powerful enough to block or scale 
down government spending. Brown himself concentrated on changes in the state 
tax code. "There were enough of us coming up here to feel that mandate, and we 
did have an impact during the early tenure," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when his more moderate conservative brethren would relent and vote for 
laws, Brown stood alone, pushing his "no" button on principle. A computer 
analysis of all Assembly votes since December, 1988, shows that Brown has voted 
no 32% of the time, making him the biggest naysayer in the lower chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the things I'm proudest of . . . is I kept my own personal 
integrity in voting on issues in a way that I thought was right." 
</P>
<P>
That a number of colleagues -- Republican and Democrat -- do not operate that 
way is just one of the reasons Brown says he has become disillusioned with the 
legislative system. Too many lawmakers, he believes, are basing their decisions 
on how a vote will anger or please campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a rotten system, the campaign finance system," he said. "There are a lot 
of pressures, and I haven't been immune from them. The financing system of 
campaigns, the expensiveness of campaigns are real negatives on the way the 
Legislature operates. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of legislators up here, there are some people who have 
reputations for being on the take, so to speak, just really letting 
contributions and honorariums influence them to the degree where it really does 
border on the illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Another element of Brown's disillusionment is how the Legislature conducts 
reapportionment, the exercise every decade of redrawing district boundaries 
after the U.S. Census. Legislators are so intent on making sure they have 
"safe" districts by party affiliation, the net effect has been to create an 
Assembly that is way out of step with the general mood of the voters, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all of the political science talk, Brown concedes it was more personal 
reasons that prompted him to leave the Legislature. His legislative schedule of 
four days in Sacramento and three days in Southern California has left him 
little time to cultivate a personal life at a time when most of his other 
friends are getting married. Brown says he is ready to end his bachelorhood, 
long a Sacramento subject of speculation about his life style, to start a 
family of his own. 
</P>
<P>
And within the last two years, Brown has seen his closest colleagues become 
embroiled in legal controversies. Both Nolan and Assemblyman Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) have become targets of the recent FBI undercover operation to 
expose corruption in the Legislature; the legislators have not been indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Brown himself had a close call during Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's 
investigation into the forgery of President Reagan's name on 1986 campaign 
literature sent out on behalf of Republican candidates, one of whom was Roger 
Fiola, a friend of Brown running against Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony before a Sacramento grand jury in February, 1989, indicated the idea 
to use the unauthorized signature was made at a 1986 meeting that included 
Brown, Johnson, Nolan and Lewis -- the quartet of Assembly Republicans 
responsible for developing strategy for campaigns. According to the testimony, 
Brown ordered a political consultant to rewrite one of the campaign hit pieces 
so that it accused Democrat Floyd of caving in "to the powerful underworld drug 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury declined to indict Brown, Nolan or Johnson. However, it returned 
a felony forgery indictment against Lewis on Feb. 6, 1989. After a costly legal 
fight, Lewis convinced an appellate court to overturn the indictment and 
dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said last week that the turmoil over the investigation "impacted me a 
lot, probably subconsciously. The AG (attorney general) was after me awhile, 
and obviously that was distressing, but not nearly as distressing as what John 
had to go through. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, 1989 -- eight days after the indictment was unsealed -- 
Brown said he hit bottom. He went to his Capitol office, but was too depressed 
to work. He suddenly did not want to be near the Legislature or Sacramento, so 
he booked a flight home to Southern California, where he sat and read a couple 
of religious books he had put on his bookshelf, long forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that was an act of God," Brown said. "Those books were waiting 
for me. I read them over the next two or three days, and the following Friday, 
the 17th of February, I was on my knees in prayer, just asking for God's 
guidance and (saying) I wanted to turn my life over to Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"It was at that specific moment I felt an incredible release in my life, that 
God came into my being and allowed me to know Him in a very personal and real 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Brown has been trying to conduct his life according to the 
Christian maxim of being "in the world but not of it." He has shied away from 
going to bars after legislative sessions, one of the primary activities of 
legislators here. 
</P>
<P>
Public records have shown that since his 1989 conversion, Brown has used his 
political campaign funds to donate at least $12,000 to the Lighthouse Christian 
Assembly of Seal Beach, $2,000 to the Assemblies of God, and $1,700 to the 
Capital Christian Center of Sacramento. In addition, he has taken two trips to 
New York on behalf of the Assemblies of God, an evangelical and Pentecostal 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said last week that he has also formed a nonprofit Vietnam Children's 
Home, an organization that will collect money to care for orphans from Vietnam. 
He plans a trip to Thailand and Calcutta, India, in July to inspect Assemblies 
of God activities there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the religious agenda, Brown has found time for a few legislative 
pursuits, like a handful of bills he has introduced to change the tax law. One 
would change the assessment procedures on private railway cars, many of which 
are owned by wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no doubt that Brown, in a twist of the Christian maxim, is 
technically of the Legislature but not very much into it these days. It is 
clear that he is much happier attending Bible classes such as the one on 
Thursday than pushing the "no" button at his desk in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
And does he feel guilty about cutting work to study the word of God? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: NEW RESEARCH SUPPORTS OMEGA-3'S ROLE IN PREVENTION OF 
HEART DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of international researchers, gathered here for the II International 
Conference on the Health Effects of Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Seafood, fell short 
of announcing a formal nutritional standard for the nutrient, but they did call 
for the U. S. National Research Council to reconsider its position and include 
omega-3 in the Recommended Dietary Allowances. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the U. S. government has refused to include omega-3 in its RDAs, 
explaining that further study of the fatty acids' role in metabolic function is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But, citing research done by members of the group, which charts the amount of 
omega-3 required to produce a variety of positive responses in either animal 
models or in patients in a clinical setting, the group described omega-3's 
protective effect against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and psoriasis and determined that it does indeed 
have an essential role in human growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, representatives from the United States and the United 
Kingdom suggested that a minimum of 1% of a day's total calories be derived 
from omega-3 fatty acids -- the type found primarily in fish that inhabit deep, 
cold waters. That percentage could be achieved by eating two to three meals of 
fish per week from sources such as tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring or sardines, 
the scientists said. The American Heart Assn. and the American Dietetic Assn. 
already encourage consumers to eat fish two to three times a week but no health 
organization has recommended a specific amount for omega-3. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical studies have proven that for proper functioning, the body needs to 
derive only about 2% of its total calories from fat -- of all types -- yet 
Americans currently consume about 30% -- most of it from saturated fat, 
according to health experts. Eating more fish would presumably replace some of 
the saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat and simultaneously supply omega-3 to 
the diet. Equal distribution of each type -- 10% saturated, 10% polyunsaturated 
and 10% monounsaturated -- is optimal, all health agencies concur. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (eating fish) is something very healthy to do," said Evelyn Tribole, a 
registered dietitian and media spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn. 
"Canned tuna contains omega-3, and (the nutrient) is available in the 
water-packed variety too. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer a recommendation in terms of an absolute number of grams rather 
than a percentage because it's not as absolute. There are a number of Americans 
who are dieting on any given day so that their total caloric intake is 
variable. But with two to three meals (of fish) a week you know you're at least 
in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Tribole also cautioned against meeting this requirement with supplements 
because they will add additional fat to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I recommend that my patients rotate the use of oils -- canola oil, then 
safflower, then olive. The more variety you have the more likely you are to 
maximize nutrients and minimize toxicity." (It is possible to eat too much of 
one type of fat and cause an imbalance, leading to toxicity, in the body.) 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Crawford of the Institute of Zoology, London, also believes in 
balance and explained that prevention of chronic diseases is one of the most 
logical applications of omega-3. He and many other scientists at the meeting 
agreed that even though the evidence examines intervention, the data should 
encourage consumers to seek balance in the diet and include nutrients from a 
variety of sources -- including those containing omega-3 -- to delay the onset 
of disease. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors explained that although American consumers have made an effort to 
switch from saturated fat to polyunsaturated fat, the United States still has a 
high mortality rate from degenerative disease. But, according to early studies 
of Greenland Eskimos, who also consume large amounts of saturated fat from 
whale blubber and very fatty fish, some of the negative effects of a 
high-saturated fat diet can be reduced by the omega-3s in the fatty fish. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is clear that the seeds of coronary artery disease are already 
being sewn in childhood so we're looking at doing things in terms of initial 
nutrition," Crawford said. "We're not just talking about giving people with 
heart disease or rheumatoid arthritis some fish oils. We're looking at stopping 
these (diseases) from starting in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lands, professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of Illinois, 
agreed. He described a study of 6,000 high-risk middle-aged men that noted a 
40% lower mortality rate among fish-eating Americans, compared to the non-fish 
eating group. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), 
participants were studied over a 10-to-12-year period to investigate a number 
of risk factors for coronary heart disease, including diet, blood pressure and 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
A similar result was observed in a significant study published last year in the 
Lancet, a British medical journal. It reported that of the nearly 2,000 men who 
had previously had a heart attack, those who were advised to eat at least two 
oil-rich fish meals per week had a 29% lower mortality rate over the next two 
years compared to those who were not advised to eat fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever is in the food chain is in the tissues. There's not much 
discrimination (by the body)," Lands said. "Epidemiology tells us that those 
with omega-3 (in their tissues) have a 40% lower mortality rate." Until all the 
evidence is in, consumers can follow the AHA recommendation to include more 
fish meals in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat Fish, Live Better" (Harper &amp; Row: $18.95) by Anne M. Fletcher, a 
registered dietitian, can help consumers further appreciate the benefits of 
fish oils. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recipes and some discussion of fish-oil capsules, the book 
features an easy-to-understand explanation of the role of omega-3 in the diet, 
including how it influences hormone function. Early population studies are 
discussed, and a detailed section on pesticides, pollutants and poisoning 
associated with eating fish is provided. 
</P>
<P>
There is an extensive glossary, which ranges from anchovy to wolfish. In it, 
each species is defined in terms of its pseudonyms, market forms, eating 
quality, methods of preparation and nutritional value.

Right-wing gunners of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia knocked rebel Maj. 
Gen. Michel Aoun's television station off the air in renewed fighting. Aoun's 
command said the antenna at his station in the mountain town of Beit Meri took 
direct hits in the artillery bombardment by Geagea's forces. Meanwhile, 20 
Maronite Catholic bishops met with Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, then issued an

FORD SETTLES SUIT OVER REAR RESTRAINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. is paying $6 million to settle a lawsuit that partially blamed 
the auto giant's failure to offer rear shoulder harness restraints for the 
traffic accident death of a child and crippling injuries to his surviving twin. 
The settlement is the largest paid in a case involving the lack of rear 
shoulder harnesses, San Diego attorney Craig McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
He negotiated the settlement on behalf of the twins' parents, Jim and Patricia 
Miller, who also survived the Nov. 13, 1988, accident. Dozens of similar suits 
filed throughout the nation are pending against Ford and other auto makers. 
Under federal regulations, combination lap and shoulder safety harnesses in the 
rear are mandatory for all passenger cars as of the 1990 model year. In 1992, 
the requirement will be expanded to include minivans. Ford admitted no 
liability in the settlement.

A 28-year-old sailor was convicted of aggravated assault in military court for 
failing to tell a former Navy woman with whom he had sex that he was a carrier 
of the AIDS-causing virus. Petty Officer John Joseph was sentenced to 30 months 
in jail, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge after infecting the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a pretrial agreement, however, Joseph will serve no more than a year 
in jail. In testimony, military doctors discussed whether Joseph could have 
infected the woman when both adults acknowledged that he did not ejaculate. It 
is not yet known whether pre-ejaculate fluid contains the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. The woman claimed that they used a 
condom and that it broke. Joseph said the condom did not break.

WESTLAKE PLAYER'S 4 HOME RUNS TIE SOUTHERN SECTION RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High tied a Southern Section record by hitting four 
home runs in a 15-5 victory over Simi Valley in Marmonte League game at 
Westlake on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal's school-record 10 RBIs matched the third highest output in the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
He is also the third Southern Section player to hit four home runs in a game 
but the second to do it this season. The other is Troy Dunlap of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Lieberthal put Kenny Hood's fastball over the left-field 
fence, more than 330 feet way, for a three-run home run that gave Westlake 
(13-0, 6-0 in league play) a 3-1 lead. Hood (4-1), a senior left-hander who 
went into the game with a 1.55 earned-run average, threw just four pitches and 
failed to retire a batter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Lieberthal hit a solo shot. Then, he singled in the fourth 
inning before hitting a grand slam in the fifth. He finished with a two-run 
home run in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball looked like a melon," said Lieberthal, who raised his batting average 
to .556. "I wanted to hit it even if it was out of the strike zone." JEFF RILEY

Team doctor Robert Albo of Golden State is known as one of the NBA's more vocal 
referee-baiters, and he was pouring it on at a recent game between the Warriors 
and the Seattle SuperSonics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrible call, terrible call!" Albo shouted at referee Joey Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford looked over, saw who it was, and shouted, "You bury your mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Add officials: From NBA Commissioner David Stern: "I read the box scores from 
the bottom up -- attendance, technicals. Oh, God, six technicals. Was that Earl 
Strom again?" 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: When you watched the NFL Today show with Brent Musburger, Jimmy 
(the Greek) Snyder, Phyllis George and Irv Cross, would you have guessed that 
Cross would outlast them all? 
</P>
<P>
Are you ready?: USA Today oddsmaker Danny Sheridan already has picked the final

Still hungry: Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas say they'll

They're unique: After Northern Iowa made it to the NCAA playoffs, Herb Strentz, 
professor of journalism at Drake University, wrote in The Des Moines Register: 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Iowa, the fun of having Northern Iowa in the NCAA prompts the thought 
that, if memory serves, Northern Iowa is the state's only Division I school 
that didn't have a basketball player arrested this year and the state's only 
Division 1 school that hasn't had an athlete arrested in the last couple of 
years for beating up a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Said Cleveland Browns' owner Art Modell, recalling 
that the first TV contract the NFL signed in 1963 was worth $332,000 a year to 
each team: "Our kicking tees cost us that much now." 
</P>
<P>
Daddy knew: Boston Red Sox batting coach Richie Hebner, son of an undertaker, 
reflects on his playing career: "I was on eight teams that made the playoffs 
and we lost seven of them. I led the league in turning in World Series tickets. 
As soon as my father heard we made the playoffs, he knew I'd be home in a week 
digging graves." 
</P>
<P>
A masterpiece: From Richard Justice of the Washington Post: "After making a 
Willie Mays catch against Julio Franco of the Texas Rangers last week, 
Pittsburgh Pirates' outfielder Andy Van Slyke said, 'That's a 
once-in-a-five-year catch. All the elements were there. The only thing it 
lacked was importance.' "

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Dokes was knocked out but not senseless. He had the sense to know his 
career may be over. 
</P>
<P>
The former World Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion was knocked out Wednesday 
night by Donovan (Razor) Ruddock in the fourth round of a scheduled 12-round 
bout and remained unconscious for two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm devastated," Dokes said. "Maybe it's time for me to start thinking about 
doing something else. "If I can't beat Ruddock, I can't beat (Buster) Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
Two other former WBA champions also appeared on the card. James (Bonecrusher) 
Smith, 35, who knocked out Mike Weaver in the first round in April 5, 1986, 
needed 12 rounds to beat the 37-year-old Weaver this time. He did it so 
convincingly that Weaver announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
As referee Arthur Mercante Jr. counted out Dokes, doctors and Dokes' cornermen 
rushed to the stricken fighter. The drama was heightened when a stretcher was 
taken into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes, who, according to a ringside physician, was on the canvas for 4 1/2 
minutes before being helped to his stool. He finally left the ring under his 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was hurt," the 26-year-old Ruddock said, "but I had to do my job. If 
he was hurt, I'm sorry about it. I didn't want him to be hurt permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Dokes, 31, seemed to have an edge after the first three rounds. Then, early in 
the fourth, Ruddock crashed a left uppercut that dropped Dokes into a squatting 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes straightened up and was hit with a right hand and two left hooks that 
sent him to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Ruddock disclosed after the fight that he hurt his right hand three weeks ago 
and had not done any sparring. 
</P>
<P>
Murad Muhammad, Ruddock's promoter and co-promoter of Wednesday night's show, 
said the fighter went to a doctor just two days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told him, 'It's not cracked, it's not broken,' " Muhammad said. 
"Razor asked him, 'Can I fight?' The doctor said, 'Yes, if you can stand the 
pain.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ruddock didn't throw a right hand until early in the third round when he landed 
a left lead flush to Dokes' face. He threw a couple of others before the big 
right hand in the fight-ending combination. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes' gloves were cut off and he was administered oxygen as he lay on the 
canvas. But he began talking to doctors a few minutes after the knockout. 
</P>
<P>
The ending came with explosive suddenness. Until then, the fight had been one 
of tactics. Both men had landed some hard punches but were unable to put any 
effective combinations together until Ruddock's fight-ending flurry. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd of 12,624 at the first all-live boxing card in Madison Square 
Garden in a little more than three years applauded Dokes after he got up. 
</P>
<P>
The knockout at 53 seconds of the fourth round was an important win for the 
26-year-old Ruddock, a native of Jamaica who lives in Toronto. He is ranked 
second by both the WBA and World Boxing Council and fourth by the International 
Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes launched a comeback in 1987 after a layoff of 33 months due to legal 
problems and rehabilitation from cocaine addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Ruddock, who weighed 230 pounds, has a 23-1-1 record with 16 knockouts. Dokes, 
240, of Miami Beach, has a 41-3-2 record with 27 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was his second in 14 fights since the comeback began. Dokes' other 
loss since his comeback began was to top-ranked Evander Holyfield, who is 
expected to challenge champion James (Buster) Douglas in September.

WAIVED BY RAMS, IRVIN SAYS HE WANTS TO PLAY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The rocky relationship between the Rams and cornerback LeRoy Irvin officially 
ended Wednesday when the team waived the 10-year veteran. But Irvin says he 
isn't ready to sever ties with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, left unprotected by the Rams after the 1989 season, said last week that 
if he wasn't satisfied with offers from other NFL teams, he would retire after 
the Plan B free agent signing period, which ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But he apparently changed his mind after a conversation with his wife, Roxanne, 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin was in Phoenix Wednesday and could not be reached, so he issued a 
statement through his wife: 
</P>
<P>
"By no means does this mean the end of LeRoy Irvin. I realize the nature of 
this business is that you can't play forever. But right now, I intend to pursue 
my football career for another one or two years with another club." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, 32, had one year remaining on a three-year, $1.65-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It came as expected," the statement continued. "I've had 10 great seasons with 
the Rams and have enjoyed myself. I have great respect for the team and the 
organization and only hope the best for them. I leave them with a lot of good 
memories and friends." 
</P>
<P>
There were good and bad times. Irvin played in two Pro Bowls and was a mainstay 
in the Rams' secondary for most of the 1980s, starting 104 of 142 games and 
pulling in 34 career interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
A third-round draft choice from the University of Kansas, Irvin played his 
entire career with the Rams and scored five touchdowns. He intercepted four 
passes in 11 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvin was suspended for 30 days for violating the NFL's substance abuse 
policy prior to the 1989 season. He missed the first three games of the regular 
season but returned and started in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, Ram Coach John Robinson suspended him for "conduct 
detrimental to the team." The suspension lasted only one game. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin had spent off-season time working on the edge of boxing, and has said 
that he had an interest in promoting fights. He held a conditional promoter's 
license in California and promoted a recent Tony Tubbs-Orlin Norris fight in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin also applied for a promoters' license in Nevada but was turned down in 
March by the Nevada State Athletic Commissioner.

REPORTER CLAIMS HE WAS THREATENED BY SAMPSON

Sacramento Kings' center Ralph Sampson threatened to beat up a newspaper 
reporter, apparently over a column that called the former All-Star one of 
basketball's "great disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson interrupted an interview Sacramento Bee reporter R.E. Graswich was 
holding with Kings' player personnel director Jerry Reynolds before Tuesday's 
114-105 loss to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ever write something about me without talking to me again, I'll punch 
you in the nose," the Bee quoted Sampson as saying. "I'll be waiting for you 
outside. I'll bust you up. I'm not kidding. I'll get you. I'll bust you up." 
</P>
<P>
The Bee said Graswich has tried several times to speak with Sampson about his 
medical condition, and the 29-year-old center has declined to discuss the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really comment because I don't know what happened," said Rick Benner, 
team president. "If Ralph said those things, we can't have it. He's not going 
to be busting anybody up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reynolds: "It was all talk." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson, in his seventh year in the NBA, has missed 21 games this season and 
suffers from arthritis in his knees. In a column published Tuesday before the 
incident, Graswich wrote: " . . . Sampson is one of the game's great 
disappointments. It's sad to watch him now." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson, Houston's No. 1 pick in the 1983 draft, was traded to Golden State in 
1987 and to the Kings last season.

PRICE WRONG FOR HAWKS AS CAVALIERS TAKE EDGE FOR FINAL PLAYOFF SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cleveland Cavaliers' playoff hopes were on the line Wednesday night at 
Richfield, Ohio, and at halftime they were trailing the Atlanta Hawks by 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Price stopped shooting and started passing and Brad Daugherty took 
charge at both ends of the court to lead the Cavaliers to a 101-95 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th win in their last 14 games pulled the Cavaliers even with the Hawks in 
the bid for the final playoff position in the East. Maybe just as important, it 
gave the Cavaliers a 3-2 edge for the season. If the teams, each 35-38, with 
nine games left, finish in a tie, the Cavaliers will qualify for postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a costly victory. The Cavaliers, hampered by injuries all 
season, lost Larry Nance with a sprained ankle halfway through the last 
quarter. He was taken for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Price was only three for 15 from the field, but he had a career-high 20 
assists. Daugherty was 12 for 17 from the field and led everyone with 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When your shot's not going, they back off," Price said. "I knew I had to get 
the ball to the other guys. Our big men did the job." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers on occasion used a full-court press to harass the Hawks' offense 
in the second half and it worked. The Hawks scored only 37 points in the last 
24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the same intensity in the second half," said Dominique Wilkins 
who scored 33 points for the Hawks. "We beat ourselves. We made stupid 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 125, New Jersey 106 -- The Nets' defense is somewhat more porous than 
the Pistons, but it took the Celtics a while to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 60-58, at halftime before Larry Bird took charge at Boston to 
lead them to an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics scored only 82 points against Detroit Tuesday night, but Bird, who 
had 19 against the Pistons, had 43 points and 15 rebounds Wednesday. He was 16 
for 29 from the field and had six assists. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same old story," said Net Coach Bill Fitch. "It was just too much 
Larry Bird." 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 128, Miami 114 -- Chris Mullin is fully recovered from his lung 
problem and the Warriors, with their ace in form, can handle the expansion 
teams, even on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin, going 10 for 13 from the field, had 30 points and talented rookie guard 
Tim Hardaway had 20 points and 16 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been feeling better this week, " said Mullin, who was out for two weeks 
with severe case of asthmatic bronchitis. He was out long enough to just about 
ruin the Warriors' playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Former Laker Billy Thompson had a career-high 29 points and had 16 rebounds to 
keep the Heat close most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
New York 118, Washington 107 -- Patrick Ewing had 37 points and 17 rebounds at 
Landover, Md., but that wasn't the big story for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
It was the return to shooting form of Kiki Vandeweghe that provided the good 
news for the slump-ridden Knicks. Vandeweghe, rounding into shape just in time 
for the playoffs, was 10 for 12 to help the Knicks end a four-game road losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it was a struggle for the Knicks, who led only 107-105 with 4:37 left, 
before Ewing sank a jumper to start a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 104, San Antonio 98 -- The Mavericks were without ailing center James 
Donaldson again at Dallas and the Spurs, with talented David Robinson leading 
the way, were on a roll, for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the second quarter the Spurs had a 19-point lead. Guards 
Rolando Blackman (28 points) and Derek Harper (27) rallied the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 32 points and 12 rebounds, but the Spurs dropped 3 1/2 games 
behind Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 121, Indiana 116 -- After a one-day enforced vacation, Buck guard 
Alvin Robertson came back fired up at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who drew a one-game suspension for fighting, scored 10 of his 30 
points in overtime as the Bucks' dealt the Pacers their third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
A Mike Sanders jumper with 29 seconds left in regulation enabled the Pacers to 
tie it, 103-103, and send it into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 116, Denver 112 -- This loss to the lowly Hornets at Denver could be 
the blow that costs the Nuggets a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Nuggets had a solid grip on the seventh playoff spot. But 
with a 37-36 record, they must fight off either Houston (35-37) or Seattle 
(36-36). DAN HAFNER

LAWSON APPEARS TO BE UNSHAKEN BY SHAKY START TO 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 season has gotten off to a shaky start for Eddie Lawson, the four-time 
world motorcycle road racing champion. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28, Lawson was standing in the garage of his year-old $1-million home 
in the highlands above Upland when the earth started shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran outside to the driveway and watched the house rock and roll," Lawson 
recalled. "I had the radio on and when I heard an announcer say that the 
epicenter was three miles north of Upland, I said to myself, 'Hey, that's right 
where I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
The quake shattered the Italian marble floor in his home's entryway, knocked 
plaster and pictures off the walls and did about $20,000 worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It shook it up pretty good, but the house didn't fall down, which is 
something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then last Sunday, on a 140-m.p.h. left-handed curve on the Suzuka track in 
Japan, Lawson was racing for second place in the 1990 season opener when the 
rear wheel of his Yamaha was nipped by a Honda ridden by Mike Doohan of 
Australia. The high-speed impact on the fourth lap sent both riders sprawling. 
Neither was seriously injured, but it knocked them both out of the 22-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Doohan was Lawson's house guest last year at this time and is one of the 
California rider's best friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those unfortunate things that happens sometimes in racing," 
Lawson said. "Mike apparently lost his brakes and couldn't stop when we were 
going through the corner. He sure didn't want it to happen, but it did. I was 
setting up Kevin Schwantz to move into second place when suddenly I was down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make it tough to defend my championship, not scoring any points 
at all and having Wayne (Rainey) getting 20 and the other Wayne (Gardner) 
getting 17," Lawson said. "You can't count on the other guys dropping out, and 
it's tough to pick up points one at a time, but I won't quit trying." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, 31, won his fourth world championship last year, riding a Honda, when 
he overcame an early lead by Rainey, a Yamaha team rider from Downey. During 
the off-season, Lawson quit Honda to join Rainey on Kenny Roberts' Marlboro 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey won the Japanese Grand Prix by three seconds, after having led by more 
than 10 seconds. Gardner, the 1987 champion from Australia, finished second on 
a Honda, with Schwantz, a Suzuki rider from Houston, third. 
</P>
<P>
"I slowed down a little after I saw Eddie's bike laying in the grass," Rainey 
said. "I didn't know what happened. I thought maybe he'd slid out on a slick 
spot, so I got a little cautious and made sure I finished. I knew where he went 
down was a heck of a place to crash, and I didn't want any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Rainey, Lawson and the rest of the world road racing circus will 
be at the 2.196-mile Laguna Seca Raceway, near Monterey, for the second round 
of the 16-country championship season. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey won last year's Laguna Seca race with a wire-to-wire performance that 
was marred by a postrace accident involving former U.S. champion Bubba Shobert 
of Carmel Valley and Australian Kevin Magee. 
</P>
<P>
Shobert was riding beside Lawson after the race ended when Magee stopped in the 
middle of the track and was hit by Shobert. The crash sent Shobert to the 
hospital with head injuries from which he is still recovering. Magee had a 
broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather win Laguna Seca again than any other race during the year," Rainey 
said. "All my friends will be there, and it's the only race in America, so it's 
doubly important for me." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who won at Laguna Seca in 1988 and finished third last year, is also 
looking forward to returning there. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the track," he said. "I've always ridden well there, and I'm anxious to 
see how my ankle will hold up Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson's ankle was twisted and bruised in the fall in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lawson nor Rainey sees any problems with the world's No. 1 and No. 2 
riders being teammates. Both, in fact, say they welcome the unusual partnership 
put together by Roberts, a former world champion from Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne and I go back a long way," Lawson said. "We were teammates when we were 
dirt trackers here in the States, and we both rode for Kawasaki in the early 
'80s. We always got along real good. Of course, once the race starts, it's 
every man for himself." 
</P>
<P>
The two test together and race together, but between races they take different 
paths. Once the season reaches Europe next month, Rainey and his wife will 
remain there. Lawson will fly back and forth to Southern California whenever 
the testing schedule permits. 
</P>
<P>
"We really enjoy living and traveling around Europe," Rainey said. "We love to 
browse around and enjoy the food in different countries. It's a great 
opportunity and we're taking advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy Europe except when I'm racing," he said. "My idea of taking some 
time off is to come home and head out to Lake Havasu (where he owns a resort 
home) or enjoy my new place in Upland. I can't wait to get home as often as I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part for Lawson in making the switch from Honda to Yamaha was 
leaving Erv Kamemoto, his former team owner and bike tuner from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"Erv and I had a good rapport and I would like to have kept working with him, 
but things just didn't work out with Honda," Lawson said. "I feel much better 
being back with Yamaha again." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson won the 1984, '86 and '88 world championships riding a Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>

KING SALMON ARE CAUGHT NEAR NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
King salmon, generally targeted by fishermen in northern waters, have shown up 
in fairly impressive numbers recently just outside Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen have been catching the game fish on an incidental basis in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 aboard Newport Landing's Reveille each caught his two-fish limit in just 
a few hours Wednesday, which may indicate a lasting bite similar to one in the 
same area two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual that they are down there in the spring, because the water is 
usually at its coldest at this time," said Dave Parker, a biologist with the 
Department of Fish and Game. "It was unusual two years ago because of the 
magnitude. They were catching them down there for a month, maybe longer." 
</P>
<P>
Skipper Jim Watts said he came across the fish Tuesday -- his passengers 
hooking three and catching one -- after spending most of the day fishing for 
rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to try specifically for salmon on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out looking around, about a quarter-mile off (Newport) Harbor, and we 
saw some birds, then some salmon flashing through some bait," Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
In a few hours his passengers had boated their legal shares of salmon weighing 
between 10 and 18 pounds. PETE THOMAS

John Griffin, who left the college coaching ranks four years ago for Wall 
Street, was named basketball coach at St. Joseph's College, Pa., his alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, 33, a 1978 St. Joseph's graduate, replaces Jim Boyle, who announced in 
December he would step down after nine years as head coach. The Hawks finished 
with a 7-21 record last season, the worst in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin coached Siena to a 21-8 record in 1985-86, then left coaching to become 
an investment broker.

A review panel for The Athletics Congress, U.S. track and field's governing 
body, lifted the two-year suspension of Texas A&amp;M sprinter Andre Cason. 
</P>
<P>
TAC suspended Cason last week for failing to report for a drug test. Four-time 
Olympian steeplechaser Henry Marsh was suspended Tuesday for a similar offense. 
</P>
<P>
Also, TAC suspended UCLA horizontal jumper McArthur Anderson for three months 
because he tested positive for a banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
TAC officials said Anderson tested positive for psuedophedrine, a stimulant 
commonly found in over-the-counter medications, Jan. 19 in Los Angeles.

Track coach Tom Tellez and five athletes filed a $60-million libel lawsuit 
Wednesday against the German magazine Stern, claiming that an article accused 
them of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Superior Court, asks for an unspecified amount of money for 
general damages plus punitive damages of at least $10 million for Tellez and 
each athlete. The athletes are Kirk Baptiste, Cletus Clark, Stanley Floyd and 
Anthony Ketchum -- sprinters who competed under Tellez at the University of 
Houston -- and Kermit Bowers.

WARCRAFT SPECIAL TO DERBY VETERAN

<P>
When it comes to the race track, it helps to have a genuine Renaissance 
wrangler, such as Otto Draper, on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Otto knows race riding. He was a jockey on the Northwest and mid-Atlantic 
circuits for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otto knows training. His barn was up to as many as 20 head during the mid-1980s 
before financial setbacks turned business sour. 
</P>
<P>
Otto even knows painting. After nearly 20 years of brush work and sketches, 
Draper has begun to sell some of his equine oils and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, Otto knows Warcraft, the 3-year-old colt from Charlie 
Whittingham's stable who has been Draper's morning exercise partner since last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft will be among the contenders in the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby on 
Saturday, and a solid performance by the son of Ack Ack could buy him -- and 
Draper -- a ticket to the Kentucky Derby on May 5 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Draper already knows what it takes to win the Derby, either the Santa Anita or 
Kentucky version. While working for Wayne Lukas, Draper was the regular 
exercise rider for Winning Colors in 1988, when she swept both races and became 
a national darling. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas Winning Colors was a tightly-wound bundle of muscle and nerves, 
Warcraft is an easygoing colt who doesn't know enough yet to get all excited. 
</P>
<P>
Draper describes Warcraft as a baby-faced kid with a mouth as soft as expensive 
glove leather. Exercise riders like that quality in a horse, for the softer the 
mouth, the more responsive the animal is to pressure on the reins and bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He impressed me the very first time I worked him," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
That was last Dec. 11 in a five-furlong breeze at Hollywood Park. Warcraft 
worked in company with another promising Whittingham colt, Far Out Star, who 
ran second in his debut last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Luis (Jauregui) was on Far Out Star," Draper recalled. "We were going along 
head and head. I looked over and smiled at him, then loosened the reins just a 
little bit. Warcraft immediately started to pull away." 
</P>
<P>
Draper quickly throttled down, afraid to tap into Warcraft's true ability too 
soon. Still, it was a memorable moment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're riding a horse in the afternoon who feels like he did, you've got 
the confidence that you could win any race at any time," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anita Derby will be Warcraft's sixth race in 76 days, a strenuous 
schedule by most standards and an apparent departure from Whittingham's slow, 
patient style. But more than anything else, Whittingham is known for tailoring 
a schedule to fit a horse, not the other way around. He says Warcraft can stand 
the gaff. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing you've got to remember, this colt never raced at all last year," 
Whittingham said. "You don't want to push the Ack Acks too early or you'll be 
in trouble later on. And this colt had an awful lot of foundation under him 
before he even got to the races." 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft made his debut on Jan. 21 and finished a so-so fourth, going seven 
furlongs that neither delighted nor disappointed his people. He came back on 
Feb. 4 to break his maiden at 1 1/16 miles, then finished far back going a mile 
on a muddy track on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really his only bad race," Draper said. "And I blame it on the fact 
that he's still immature. He really didn't know how to handle getting hit with 
all that mud. 
</P>
<P>
"To look at him right now, he's still got a little baby face and a real soft, 
quiet eye. Give him a peppermint and he doesn't even know how to eat it yet. He 
kind of sucks on them a little, mouths them and then drops them, like he's 
saying, 'What do I do with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, who is owned by Whittingham in partnership with Mary Bradley and 
Nancy Chandler, bounced back from his mud race and won by six lengths on March 
4. In the San Felipe Handicap on March 18, his stakes debut, he finished second 
to upset winner Real Cash, losing by 5 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"He's maturing fast," Draper added. "We've moved him right along, and he's 
handled everything we've thrown his way without getting all stirred up. 
</P>
<P>
"He just putzes along and does his own thing. He doesn't get up on his hind 
feet and rear like Sunday Silence. He's not a run-off like Winning Colors, and 
he doesn't have a 15-race winning streak like Mister Frisky. He's quiet, and 
some may overlook him because of that. But he has a presence about him." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft had his final Santa Anita Derby prep Wednesday morning, going half a 
mile in :47 before the rains came. Chris McCarron, who rides him Saturday, was 
aboard for the workout. With only $30,000 in graded race earnings, Warcraft 
needs a healthy chunk of the purse Saturday to be assured of a starting berth 
in the Kentucky Derby, which is limited to 20 runners. 
</P>
<P>
Leading rider Gary Stevens returns to Santa Anita today after making a special 
appearance at Longacres Racetrack. Stevens, who wore a leg brace because of 
Perthes' disease when he was a child, made a special appearance at a Seattle 
area children's orthopedic hospital, then rode the opening-day card Wednesday 
where he won the $30,000 feature aboard Hilco's Scamper.

PERFECT PITCHING HASN'T SPOILED JENNIFER VAN WIE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP SOFTBALL: MIRALESTE HIGH MOUND ACE HAS A BIG ROLE ON HER TEAM BUT NOT A 
BIG EGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With three perfect games in the last season and a half, it might be easy for 
Miraleste High School softball pitcher Jennifer Van Wie to let success go to 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
But her teammates won't let it happen. The good-natured sarcasm they direct at 
the Marauders' star helps keep Van Wie just another one of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"She's stuck up and conceited," one teammate says while smiling at Van Wie, who 
gives her accuser a playful push. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, and she sings in the shower," another chimes in. 
</P>
<P>
"Make sure to cross out all the curse words," one of the Miraleste players 
advises a reporter interviewing Van Wie. 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie said she doesn't mind the teasing. In fact, she wouldn't have things 
any other way. 
</P>
<P>
In team sports, there probably isn't a more important position than pitcher in 
softball. But Van Wie, who is also the No. 3 hitter in the lineup, likes to 
think of herself only as part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, there's a lot of emphasis on the pitcher or the dominating 
player," said Van Wie, who no-hit Mary Star on Tuesday to raise her season 
record to 10-1. "But it can't be done without the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of press sometimes, but if I didn't have my team behind me, I 
wouldn't be anywhere. And we just have a great team this year." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Miraleste is 10-2 overall and first in the Camino Real League at 6-0. 
Van Wie has accounted for all six league wins and has an earned-run average of 
0.20 in Camino Real play. 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie's success this season hasn't surprised anybody, considering that she 
pitched two perfect games in 1989. She started every league game last year, 
when the Marauders lost only once. 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie, a four-year varsity starter, said the 1989 campaign was a turning 
point in her career. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman and sophomore years, I just came out here. And, I think because I 
was younger, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now," she said. "But in my 
junior year, no matter what, I'd run four laps a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do my running no matter what the team does. If they slack off, it's 
still up to me to discipline myself." 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie has 106 strikeouts in 53 innings and is a master of the riser. 
</P>
<P>
"I throw windmill (style), and my main pitch is the riser," she explained. "If 
the batters get ahold of it, it's usually going to go straight into the ground 
-- if they get on top of it -- or it's going to go right up. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I have my other pitches here and there to try to throw them off: a 
fastball, a change-up, a curve every once in a while, and a drop. But I still 
have to perfect them because I don't want to go out there and hit anybody." 
</P>
<P>
With a mischievous grin, she added: "But, then again, that's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
A hard thrower, Van Wie hasn't had the velocity of her pitches tested since she 
was 13 years old, when she was timed at "about 52 miles per hour," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to exhibit an oversized ego to match her strikeout count, Van Wie 
added: "People have sometimes asked me how fast I throw, but I don't really 
care. Stats and those type of things aren't me." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, after Van Wie pitched a perfect game in this season's league opener 
against St. Mary's Academy on March 15, she said it wasn't particularly a big 
deal to her. 
</P>
<P>
But she admitted that her first perfect game last season was thrilling because 
it put her on a par with her two sisters: Lisa, a former star at Bishop 
Montgomery High School and now a junior at Brigham Young University, and 
Sunshine, 13. 
</P>
<P>
"My older sister had pitched a perfect game, and even my younger sister had 
pitched one, but I had never pitched one at any level," Van Wie said. "I was 
the last one, so it was nice to get it." 
</P>
<P>
But she denied that there is any sibling rivalry. "We're not compared in our 
family as far as what we can do in softball," said Van Wie, who has received an 
academic scholarship to BYU and will join Lisa on the Cougars' pitching staff 
next season. "We're all just doing the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie said having Lisa as a role model has clearly been important to her 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played ever since I was 4 because I started pitching in her footsteps," 
she remembered. "She decided -- after she'd played a year when she was real 
young -- that she wanted to be a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"And my dad thought that would be a good position, so he taught us the same 
basics." 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie said support from her parents, Bernard and Judy, has been crucial to 
her success. And she is quick to point out that the proper word is "support," 
not "pressure." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad that my parents helped me get into sports," said Van Wie. 
"Softball is something I really love to do. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was never any pressure to do it. It was academics and education that 
were always stressed." 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie said her mother is a college student, "but somehow she arranges her 
schedule so that she's at every game. 
</P>
<P>
"She makes sure I eat pasta the night before every game. In some ways, she's 
almost more dedicated than I am. My dad is the same way. In the absence of a 
son, he really enjoys working with us." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Tuesday's home game with Mary Star, Van Wie said to a teammate: "My 
dad sent a note to me in class today wishing me good luck. Isn't that sweet?" 
</P>
<P>
About as sweet as the 16-0 win that followed.

4 FROM MORNINGSIDE, 1 FROM PALOS VERDES WIN AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two players and two coaches from Morningside High School were recipients of 
three of four South Bay awards Sunday at The Times All-Star Basketball Brunch 
at the Anaheim Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie was a repeat selection as girls Player of the Year, Tyrone Paul was 
named boys Player of the Year, and Co-Coaches Carl Franklin and Ron Randle were 
named boys Coaches of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Wendell Yoshida of Palos Verdes was named girls Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The five award winners were honored along with the rest of the 20-player South 
Bay All-Star Team. In all, 12 teams representing different circulation areas 
were honored at the brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, named the nation's top schoolgirl player by Gatorade last week, 
averaged 26.9 points, 15 rebounds and 6.9 blocked shots as a senior to lead 
Morningside to a 32-3 record and its second straight State Division I title. 
The 6-foot-5 center capped her four-year varsity career at the state finals 
March 17 with 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots in a 67-56 win 
over Berkeley despite suffering from chickenpox, strep throat and a fever. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, the Southern Section Division III Co-Player of the Year, averaged 20.5 
points, seven rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots a game to lead 
Morningside to the Ocean League title and a 24-4 mark. The 6-6 senior forward 
possesses a 46-inch vertical leap and had many dunks. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin and Randle guided Morningside to the winningest season of any South 
Bay boys basketball team. The Monarchs were ranked No. 1 in the state among 
Division III schools most of the year and captured their sixth league title in 
the last seven years. They were surprised by Lompoc, 83-80, in the Southern 
Section 3-AA quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida led Palos Verdes' girls team to a successful season despite the 
graduation of 6-5 twins Heidi and Heather Burge, who as freshmen helped the 
University of Virginia reach the NCAA Final Four. Palos Verdes won the Bay 
League title -- extending its league-winning streak to 47 games -- and reached 
the finals of the Southern Section 3-AA and Regional playoffs, losing both 
times to powerful Brea-Olinda. The Sea Kings finished 29-6.

SUN DEVILS' REES HEEDS MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The message was simple and written in large black letters next to Sean Rees' 
name on the lineup card in the Arizona State dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"YOU MUST GO NINE." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock penned the command a few weeks ago to motivate Rees, 
a sophomore left-handed pitcher from Mission Bay High in San Diego, who wasn't 
finishing what he started. 
</P>
<P>
But no one anticipated the impact it would carry. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me the initiative to go out and battle," Rees said. "I get pumped up 
when people get on me." 
</P>
<P>
In his last four starts for the Sun Devils, no one has touched him. 
</P>
<P>
Rees, 5-feet-11, 178 pounds, has pitched a four-hitter, two three-hitters and a 
two-hitter since getting the message. In 36 innings, he has allowed just 12 
hits and eight walks and recorded 55 strikeouts to raise his nation-leading 
total to 120. 
</P>
<P>
Rees' performances have keyed the Sun Devils, 30-9, who have won 14 consecutive 
games and are ranked No. 1 by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just in a good rhythm," said Rees, 8-0 with a 2.18 earned-run average. 
"It's the best feeling ever." 
</P>
<P>
Brock, who has coached Floyd Bannister and Craig Swan, among others, says Rees' 
streak is the most impressive in ASU history. 
</P>
<P>
"Bannister, in his prime, never had four games back to back like that," Brock 
said. "I'm not sure anybody did." 
</P>
<P>
Back on top: With a 12-5 record, No. 4 USC leads No. 3 Stanford, 8-3, in the 
Pacific 10 Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Randy Powers is 7-0 with a 1.99 ERA for the Trojans, who 
travel to Tempe next week for a key series with Arizona State. Powers has four 
complete games and has allowed only four walks in 72 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, 9-8, has won eight of its last 10 games and is in fourth place behind 
Arizona State, 8-5. The Bruins are over .500 in conference play for the first 
time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Junior left-hander Dave Zancanaro has won three consecutive games for the 
Bruins since being moved from the outfield and bullpen to the starting 
rotation. Zancanaro is 7-1 with a 2.47 ERA and three saves. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, 5-13, has lost a record 12 consecutive conference games. The Wildcats, 
who visit UCLA next week, have been swept by Stanford, Arizona State, UCLA and 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
Last-place California, 3-11, figures to continue struggling when it plays host 
to Arizona State this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling blue: The NCAA baseball rule book states: "It is the responsibility of 
the players, coaches and umpires who are participating under the NCAA rules to 
know the rules." 
</P>
<P>
That passage has created a minor stir among college baseball umpires in 
Southern California, several of whom have been wearing black arm bands to 
protest the power wielded by coaches.

Unlike football and basketball officials, who are assigned by the NCAA or 
conference offices, umpires are scheduled by a paid, veteran member of their 
organization based upon preferred lists submitted by coaches. The umpires, who 
make $60 a game, are upset with the outcome of an October meeting, during which 
the coaches decided that passing an NCAA rules test would no longer be a 
criterion for gaining assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the coaches said you don't have to know the rules," said 
Charlie Lupo, who is in his 36th year of umpiring college baseball. "But 
they're the same ones that (complain) about rules interpretations when they're 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Gary Adams, the liaison between the coaches and umpires, said the 
coaches believe experience is as important as passing a test. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that in some cases, when a guy is an excellent umpire in terms of his 
judgment -- that can supersede his lack of knowledge on the rules," Adams said. 
"When it comes to the bread-and-butter call, he'll make the right one." 
</P>
<P>
Lupo isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates 'homers,' " he said. "The umpires are so scared they're going to 
get (taken off the approved list by coaches), they're scared to do their job." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez watch: Alex Fernandez's stock as a major league prospect has not 
dropped a level, even though he has. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, selected by the Milwaukee Brewers as the 24th pick in the 1988 
draft, was 15-2 with a 2.01 ERA last season for the University of Miami and had 
177 strikeouts in 147.2 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The All-American right-hander transferred in January to Miami Dade-South 
Community College to be eligible for the June draft. Fernandez is 7-2 with a 
1.32 ERA and has 89 strikeouts in 75 innings. He also is batting .358 with a 
team-leading seven home runs and 37 runs batted in for the Jaguars, 26-9. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of a jam: Fearing even greater cutbacks by university presidents 
had it taken no action of its own, the American Baseball Coaches Assn. 
submitted to the NCAA last week a proposal that recommends: reducing the 
maximum number of games from 70 to 60; cutting full scholarships from 13 to 12; 
limiting schools to four coaches and adopting a national starting date, 
preventing teams from playing games before the first Friday in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I don't feel that any of the measures are necessary," said Fresno 
State Coach Bob Bennett, who was part of the six-member committee that 
submitted the proposal. "But the cuts from the presidents are coming in all 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
"What we heard from athletic directors around the country was, 'You better come 
up with something that you can live with, or you're going to get something you 
can't.' " 
</P>

BUSS EYES HIS OWN NHL EXPANSION TEAM;

Dr. Jerry Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers and Great Western Forum, said 
Wednesday he is waiting for word on NHL expansion and will not make plans to 
build an arena until he secures a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that obtaining a franchise is the first step, and, 
since the NHL is not expected to decide on expansion until December of later, 
he will lobby the league and wait. 
</P>
<P>
Buss detailed a plan to Wednesday entailing, in order: obtaining a franchise, 
finding a city to support it and getting a large company to back the team and 
community support. He said he will investigate Orange, Riverside and San Diego 
counties as possible locations if the franchise is awarded him. He is looking 
to be granted land on which to build an arena or a good deal on leasing land. 
Failing that, he said he will listen to offers from the proposed builders of 
arenas in Costa Mesa and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this project probably different than other people see it," Buss said. 
"To them, it's go out and get land, get an architect, talk to the city, etc. In 
my estimation, that's putting the cart before the horse. I think you have to 
have a franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Buss has expressed his interest in obtaining an expansion franchise by writing 
letters to key executives in the NHL but has not formally applied for a 
franchise because the NHL is not yet accepting applications. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've told them is that I'm interested in anything in Southern 
California," he said. "What I've thought is Orange County, Riverside and San 
Diego County. If I'm granted a franchise, those are the areas I'll 
investigate." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Helper, NHL spokesman, said the league is tentatively planning to review 
conditions and terms of its expansion application at the Board of Governors' 
meeting the first week of May. League commissioner John Ziegler said at a Board 
of Governors' meeting in February that expansion decisions of "who, what and 
how many" teams won't be on the agenda until the Board of Governors' meeting in 
December, at the earliest.

A BABY STEP FOR ECOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A MALIBU MOTHER, DETERMINED TO STOP USING DISPOSABLES, WINS HER 
CAMPAIGN TO GET A DIAPER SERVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lori Lerner Gray is a born-again environmentalist. She recycles cans, plastic 
and paper. She composts. Her garden is organic. She monitors the house to make 
sure the lights are turned off and has given son Scott, 13, a three-minute egg 
timer so he won't waste water while taking showers. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Gray household in west Malibu is almost a model of the new 
environmental ethic for the '90s -- "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle" -- except for 
baby Rachel, 6 months old, whose 90 disposable diapers a week are adding 
steadily to the Southern California landfill problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's Earth Day coming up and I am lugging out these huge bags of diapers to 
the trash," her mother frets. "It is more convenient, but the guilt is 
never-ending." 
</P>
<P>
That had not been the plan. When Rachel was born last October, Gray called 
Dy-Dee Diaper Service in Pasadena, whose newsletter she had picked up at her 
obstetrician's office in Santa Monica. "It's a great service -- they have cloth 
diapers and they deliver something like 90 clean diapers every week and pick up 
the dirty ones," she said. "Also they're very environmentally oriented. Their 
newsletter has all sorts of reasons why disposable diapers are a threat to the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was a statistic in the newsletter that had sparked her resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that 18 billion disposable diapers are buried in U.S. landfills 
every year. That's the figure that got to me. And they don't degrade. And by 
the way, it turns out that even the biodegradable diapers don't degrade 
either." 
</P>
<P>
Dy-Dee had a convert. But when Gray called, she learned that Dy-Dee Diaper 
Service didn't do Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was too far away, and they didn't have the demand here. And when 
I checked around, I discovered they are the only diaper service available." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was on. After a couple of conversations with the service 
representatives, she called the company president, Brian O'Neal, who proved to 
be "an OK guy," she said, and willing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
First they decided that Rachel's diapers would be picked up in Santa Monica 
where Lori's husband, Larry Gray, is supervising a construction project ("He 
was willing to schlep a bag of dirty diapers to work once a week"). But then 
she had second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hearing a lot lately that we can all make a difference, and I 
decided it was time to take a stand. I thought, let's get the diaper service 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
So she renegotiated and O'Neal agreed to send his diaper trucks to Malibu if 
she could enlist 30 customer families. 
</P>
<P>
Gray knew she was not alone; she thinks of herself as typical of her baby boom 
generation. After a 15-year career as a radio news director, she carved out a 
niche that allows her to work from home by starting Radio Links, a company that 
produces entertainment features for radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 38, and a lot of women my age are having babies," she said. "And we are 
all getting very conscious of the environment. People are changing right before 
your very eyes." 
</P>
<P>
So she posted little signs all over Malibu -- in nursery schools, the Point 
Dume Pharmacy, the Baby Gym, in pediatrician's offices -- with the Dy-Dee 
Diaper Service telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped women in the supermarket who were buying diapers. Basically I relied 
on word of mouth. There are a lot of babies out here." 
</P>
<P>
Gray picked up support as she made her rounds. Anne Coffey of west Malibu was 
No. 11 to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great that somebody is doing this," Coffey said. She had tried to 
get diaper service 15 months earlier when her son, Harry, was born. "It was a 
dead-end street -- they had no interest at all in coming out here. 
</P>
<P>
"I used disposable diapers and felt guilty. We are finally becoming aware that 
if we leave all our garbage around, our kids are going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
By last week Gray had 29 names, and was still in hot pursuit of No. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We do give her credit," said Dy-Dee president O'Neal. "It's really amazing 
when someone calls and wants your service when you are spending hundreds of 
thousands of promotional dollars to get others to see your point of view." 
</P>
<P>
The business, something of a diaper empire, was started in 1938 by O'Neal's 
father, he said, and "the environmental issues have always been a part of our 
advertising, but that hasn't been a factor until lately. Our business has grown 
substantially in the last year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Tim, runs the service in Orange County, which goes as far east as 
Riverside and as far north as Downey. Brian O'Neal's office in Pasadena 
services "everything else including Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, the 
Antelope Valley and Victorville." 
</P>
<P>
Combined, said O'Neal, "we send out 32 delivery trucks every day that run on 
clean-burning fuels. We print 52,000 copies of our 20-page newspaper (the Wet 
Set Gazette) for expectant mothers and we have about 19,000 customers and 18 
customer service representatives. A 90-diaper service costs $11.60 per week. We 
wash about 1.3 million cotton diapers a week." 
</P>
<P>
And beginning Tuesday, some of those diapers will come from Malibu, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought there were enough customers out there to make it worthwhile. 
But if word of mouth only can produce 25 to 30 customers, we know we'll get 
more when we put our trucks and advertising out there.

FOR LATINOS, NEW DAWN IN PSYCHOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
THERAPY: AN UNUSUAL PROGRAM USES ELEMENTS AND SYMBOLS OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE 
CULTURE TO TREAT EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The man stood with his hands dangling at his sides, staring vacuously at the 
woman before him, as the audience watched from folding chairs placed in a 
semicircle. 
</P>
<P>
"I get sick of not seeing you working," the woman said in Spanish. "I want you 
to do something." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "I've changed," the man said. "I've come back because I want to be 
a family again. I'm not the furniture you thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
The action was interrupted by a young man in shorts who jumped up from one of 
the chairs and pretended to do a commercial. Then came the ponderous voice of 
an offstage narrator asking the big questions of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Will Rosendo find a job? Will he get sick again? Will he learn to be a man?" 
</P>
<P>
The stuff of soap operas? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly. 
</P>
<P>
But also the stuff of an unusual therapy program using elements of Latino 
culture -- in this case the Spanish-language soap operas popular in Southern 
California and Mexico -- to treat the problems of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the absence of a camera, the format was pure television. The actors 
were patients with psychological problems, playing roles crafted for them by 
the therapist. 
</P>
<P>
The situations were real, taken from the lives of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
Rosendo, a Guatemalan immigrant, had stopped going to his job as a laborer 
months before, complaining of back pains. Instead of working, he had stayed 
home in a funk, sitting on the couch until his wife threatened to leave him 
unless he got professional help. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the group, a woman from Mexico, had been referred by a 
psychiatrist after her 17-year-old son fatally stabbed her husband, who had 
abused her for years. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are not uniquely Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Ignacio Aguilar, the appropriate treatment just might be. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional psychotherapy is (non-Latino)," said Aguilar, 63, a licensed 
clinical social worker who coordinates the program at Bellwood Health Center, a 
private 67-bed facility in Bellflower. "We have to use cultural ways of dealing 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
The goal: by using elements of the culture familiar to them, to reach 
Spanish-speaking people who cannot relate to traditional psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tall order, of course. Even traditional therapy, based on the belief 
that people can master problems by openly exploring and confronting them, is, 
at best, an iffy proposition. Most therapists concede that mental health is in 
many ways subjective, and that progress is not always steady, obvious or 
measurable. 
</P>
<P>
Adding culture to the equation makes it even more complex. 
</P>
<P>
While traditional psychotherapy encourages self-exploration as a means of 
personal growth, experts say, many Southern California Latinos come from 
backgrounds in which the daily struggle for survival makes therapy seem 
luxuriously self-indulgent. 
</P>
<P>
In such a context, problems are borne stoically rather than solved, and one's 
"fate" is seen as one's master. 
</P>
<P>
But culture introduces a whole new element to the mix, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
By inculcating would-be patients with the forms and symbols of their own 
culture, he maintains, experts can create naturally therapeutic situations. 
</P>
<P>
Soap operas are a case in point. While popular in many cultures, they seem to 
have special significance to Latinos, some of whom relate to the soaps more 
than they do to their own lives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So performing psychodramas patterned after soap operas, he said, creates a 
non-threatening environment in which patients feel free to act out their 
problems, and, thus, to begin to deal with them constructively. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Aguilar said, the program uses Latin American proverbs, folklore, 
poetry, crafts, music and dance to treat patients suffering from depression, 
anxiety, panic and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
It also uses symbols from the Aztec calendar to characterize specific ailments 
and to chart the patients' progress. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, this isn't the only mental health program struggling to accommodate 
the rapidly expanding ethnic diversity of Southern California. Several area 
centers feature programs tailored to the needs of Southeast Asian refugees. And 
a number of centers -- including El Centro in East Los Angeles -- attempt to 
treat Latinos by employing therapists who are bilingual and bicultural. 
</P>
<P>
But Aguilar is seen by many as ahead of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about utilizing these techniques," said Rebecca Bejar, a licensed 
clinical social worker at El Centro, "but Ignacio (Aguilar) has been one of the 
forerunners in actually implementing them." 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Esposito, executive director of the Sacramento-based California 
Society for Clinical Social Work, the largest group of its kind in the state, 
sees Aguilar's work as "marvelous" and "trend-setting" because "it approaches 
people with respect." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Sergio Martinez-Romero, a social psychologist who teaches at Cal 
State Los Angeles and president of the California Hispanic Psychological Assn., 
the Bellwood program goes a step beyond most by not only translating 
traditional therapy into Spanish, but also by using symbols and imagery of the 
culture itself to get patients involved in the therapeutic process. 
</P>
<P>
"It is able to reach people where they are and bring them to a place where they 
can be treated," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, Latinos are not always easy to treat. 
</P>
<P>
While, in general, their symptoms are not unique, mental health professionals 
say, the problems, especially for recent immigrants, are often made worse by 
the experience of trying to fit into an intolerant, alien culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Here the (Latinos) are part of the landscape," said Aguilar, who was born in 
Mexico. "Their culture hasn't been recognized; it's been put down." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, many Southern California Latinos who were born in other 
countries suffer a wide range of problems in adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
Some who experienced traumatic political conditions in their home countries 
react with a natural distrust of the institutions and authority figures they 
encounter in the United States, said psychologist Jorge Cherbosque. Besides 
feeling guilty for leaving loved ones behind, he said, some immigrants who came 
from war-torn countries suffer post-traumatic symptoms, such as flashbacks and 
sleep disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're discovering is that many immigrants from Latin America are 
developing symptoms which many therapists are overlooking," said Cherbosque, 
who teaches cross-cultural psychology at Antioch College's Marina del Rey 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
While the symptoms are understandable, he said, they still can be serious. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants are "coming to a society where they feel they don't belong," 
Cherbosque said. "They don't identify with America and they feel secretly 
guilty for abandoning their homelands." 
</P>
<P>
Bellwood patients, who are often referred to the program by therapists, social 
workers or physicians, voluntarily admit themselves to the facility for stays 
averaging a month, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
But cultural differences sometimes interfere with therapy, he said. For 
instance, Latino culture emphasizes collective values and family 
interdependence, while U.S. culture is geared more toward individualism, he 
said. Thus, Latinos, who often hold fast to traditional male and female roles, 
tend to submerge individual problems rather than disrupt family unity, while 
Anglos find it easier to muster the self-absorption necessary for therapy. 
</P>
<P>
And while most Anglos are entirely comfortable with the idea of psychotherapy, 
Aguilar said, most Latinos see the process as sterile and cold. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hispanic culture, there is no such thing as mental health care -- you're 
either crazy or you're not," Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
In many Latin American countries, and often among Latinos in Southern 
California, he added, those who can't be cured by herbs or spiritual healers 
called curanderos are taken into their families' bosoms and kept apart from 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar began developing his unorthodox approach to therapy during a 17-year 
career at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, where, he said, some of his 
methods initially met with resistance from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more controversial of his ideas, he said, was offering private 
"spiritual" healing sessions to patients for whom such rituals seemed 
meaningful. The practice, while not violating the conditions of his license or 
professional ethical code, did exceed the sympathies and understanding of some 
fellow therapists. 
</P>
<P>
He left the hospital for Bellwood last year, he said, because he believed the 
private facility would offer more latitude in pursuing his cultural techniques. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months since the therapy program -- called Amanacer, or "a new dawn" 
-- began, more than 40 patients, most employed in blue-collar jobs, have been 
treated, Aguilar said. While the cost of treatment, including room and board, 
is about $560 a day, an administrator said, most of the charges are covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the soap-opera psychotherapy, Aguilar said, other therapy methods 
employed are craft sessions, in which patients create colorful Mexican weavings 
while informally discussing problems; Latino music and dance classes to release 
tension and increase self-esteem, and sessions utilizing Spanish poetry, 
folklore and myths containing universal themes that speak to patients of 
situations in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of myths in our culture, and they trigger feelings," Aguilar 
said. "Sometimes the best method of treatment is a metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
One group, the therapist said, uses seasons of the year to connote points on 
the road to mental health and such symbols as turtles, flowers and cactus from 
the Aztec calendar to indicate specific personal qualities -- sluggishness, 
delicacy, abrasiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Although no data yet exists on Amanacer's success at returning people to 
functional lives, Aguilar said the program is working -- an assessment shared 
by many of his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very appreciative," said the woman whose teen-age son was imprisoned for 
her husband's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, she said: "The program has given me value and 
self-worth. If I had found this earlier, I would have been able to stop what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Said Teresa, a depressed patient who came to Bellwood after years of 
unsuccessful treatment by Anglo therapists: "We can understand each other. It's 
a big relief to be able to talk to someone who comes from the same culture." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the soap opera, Rosendo, about to return home to his wife after a month 
of treatment, seemed to be getting a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel stronger," he said. "I didn't want to face the rock that I was. I'm 
ready to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
Off to the left, Aguilar, playing the narrator, interjected a series of solemn 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Would Rosendo, he wondered aloud, be able to solve his problems? Would he be 
able to find a job? Would everything be OK? 
</P>
<P>
Tune in next week.

</P>
<P>
Site manager Richard Senate will lead the tour through the remnants of ancient 
Indian civilizations and Chinese habitats from the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss the cultures that prospered in the area and the reasons why 
they eventually died out," Senate said. 
</P>
<P>
Tour participants will get a special look at the foundations, discovered in the 
early '70s, that once housed Spanish missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular visitors to the museum would not otherwise come in contact with these 
sites," Senate said. 
</P>

PARKING SITE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved the use of a vacant lot next to Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center as a temporary parking lot for patients, visitors and employees. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary-use permit, approved by the council in a 3-1 vote, will allow the 
hospital to use the parking lot at 365 N. San Vicente Blvd. for one year. 
</P>
<P>
If the hospital wants to extend the permit, it will have to seek a renewal from 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said they would like to see the lot used for housing, 
but they agreed to allow it to be used to ease the hospital's parking shortage. 
Mayor Abbe Land opposed the temporary-use permit. Councilman Steve Schulte was 
absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members instructed staff to conduct a traffic study to determine the 
parking lot's effect on area residences.

FUND-RAISER TALK ON GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gangs will be the topic of discussion at an April 18 fund-raiser luncheon for 
Teen Line, a hot line that uses trained volunteer teen-agers to listen to the 
problems of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
"People's Court" Judge Joseph A. Wapner will introduce a veteran gang member 
and a gang interventionist who will present an "explicit firsthand look at 
gangs in our community," according to Teen Line program coordinator Elaine 
Leader. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was chosen because an increasing number of calls to the hot line 
pertain to fears and worries about gangs, Leader said. 
</P>
<P>
The hot line, which has been in operation since 1981, has received more than 
80,000 calls involving a whole range of problems facing teens, including drugs, 
suicide, and physical and sexual abuse, Leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Teen Line is staffed with volunteer teen-agers who are supervised by mental 
health professionals. It is affiliated with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds of the luncheon, which will be held at the Loews Hotel in Santa 
Monica, will go to support the toll-free line, (800) TLC-TEEN.

<P>
CITY HALL PACT REAFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Redevelopment Agency on Monday reaffirmed its authorization of 
a $1.7-million contract with CHCG Architects Inc. to design the new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 approval, with Councilmen Steven Gourley and Jim Boulgarides 
dissenting, was given despite a finding by the architectural consulting firm 
Karsten/Hutman Margolf that CHCG severely underestimated the cost of retaining 
the old City Hall facade to serve as a historical monument. 
</P>
<P>
CHCG estimated saving the facade would cost $150,000, while the consulting firm 
calculated it would take $800,000 to $1.25 million because of the difficulty of 
keeping the unreinforced masonry wall in place during demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The conceptual design called for the facade to be kept in place at the corner 
of Culver Boulevard and Duquesne Avenue as an entry monument to the park-like 
grounds of the new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm, which gave CHCG an overall favorable review, also 
disagreed with the $1.7-million limit on the redevelopment agency's contract 
for the design. Karsten/Hutman Margolf estimated that the agency should limit 
the contract to $1.4 million. Agreeing with the consultant, Gourley and 
Boulgarides voted against approval. 
</P>
<P>
The agency did not make a formal decision on whether the design should include 
the old City Hall facade or a replica, but directed CHCG to explore options to 
exclude it.

AT THE MARKET: SEASONAL PICKS INCLUDE ASPARAGUS, BLOOD ORANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asparagus -- with its long graceful form, delicate flavor and dollop of 
nutrients -- is one food that appeals to foodies and health foodies alike. And 
when you consider how quickly it can be prepared, it may even qualify as a 
fast-food. 
</P>
<P>
Its season lasts for only about four months -- mid-February to June. 
</P>
<P>
Although asparagus is grown in Ventura County, the soil does not lend itself to 
large-scale commercial production, said Lyle Carson, owner of Carson Farm 
Supply in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"Asparagus is usually grown up in the San Joaquin Valley in high peat soil. 
Local homeowners, if they amend the soil, can have reasonable success. It needs 
a loose, high organic soil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who prefer the pencil-thin asparagus grown in Lodi can find it at the 
Central Market in Camarillo, said Manager Robbie Nichols. "Pencil-thin 
asparagus has a lot less weight compared to the regular asparagus that the 
supermarkets get. It is a little more expensive but it's better. It has less 
waste and it is more tender." 
</P>
<P>
Pencil-thin asparagus also cooks much faster, Nichols said. "The regular 
asparagus have woody stems, whereas with the pencil-thin kind you don't have 
that. It cooks in a matter of five minutes, and the regular takes more like 10 
or 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Those not in the mood for vegetables might want to try citrus fruit. Right now, 
blood oranges are available. This orange is a surprise to the eyes and the 
taste buds. Blood oranges are red inside and often are described as tasting 
like oranges crossed with raspberries. "They should last about another month," 
Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
Health-conscious people looking for unusual fare might try tofu enchiladas and 
tofu manicotti, said Kelly Coy, assistant manager of Trader Joe's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Tofu instead of cheese is used because it's lower in cholesterol. No 
preservatives are used, and they're all ready to eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Imported seafood that looks especially good this week are Mississippi 
freshwater catfish, Idaho trout and Norwegian salmon, said Bob Nazarian of 
Gelson's Market in Westlake Village. All are farm-raised and 24 to 48 hours 
fresh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of farm-raised fish is that people don't have to keep it on the 
boat for a few days, it doesn't have to be iced down as often," said Nazarian. 
"The quality is pretty uniform too." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, "things are a little slow because of the bad weather we've had 
lately," said Hipolito Marin, general manager of Brandon King Seafood in 
Oxnard. "The local lobster season is closed and won't open again until October, 
but the Maine lobsters, local prawns and crabs are still available." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

STUDENTS TAKE A COURSE TO NEW DEPTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Miller has spent much of his life exploring an environment unfamiliar to 
most. 
</P>
<P>
"It's new every time that you go out. Over that next ridge could be the hidden 
treasure that you've never found." 
</P>
<P>
He has also spent a good portion of his life teaching others how to survive in 
that other place. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been scuba diving since I was in high school, and for 24 years I've been 
instructing," said Miller, 56. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 13 years he has headed the scuba diving program at Ventura College 
with two other instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the three-week courses at professional dive shops, the Ventura 
College beginner program is one semester. Upon completion, students receive an 
Open Water I certification through the National Assn. of Underwater 
Instructors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a regular three-unit college course. We go for 18 weeks. That's about 100 
hours of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's one of the strong points of our program. We have plenty of time 
to work on any kind of problem a person might come up with. Whereas some of the 
other courses can't spend as much time with individual problems," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The most common of which is overcoming the fear of being underwater, said 
Miller. Then comes grappling with the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura College offers one daytime beginner class that meets twice weekly for 
two hours, and two night beginner courses, meeting weekly for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't waste any time getting them wet. They're in the water the first day 
so we can test their swimming capability. The first four weeks they'll be 
instructed on basic snorkeling techniques. After that, we'll start with scuba 
equipment," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Students must provide their own mask, snorkel and fins. The school supplies the 
scuba tank, regulators and stabilizer jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Students must also pay for three required diving excursions at $40 each and a 
$7 wet suit rental. Wet suits are only used during the ocean outings. Other 
training occurs in the college's 80-degree pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend about half our time during the semester in the classroom studying, 
among other things, the physiology and physics of scuba diving. They've got to 
understand the implications of breathing compressed air." 
</P>
<P>
To drive the point home Miller has coined a "word of the day." It is also 
emblazoned on his license plate. 
</P>
<P>
'XHALE.' 
</P>
<P>
"You must never forget to exhale when surfacing. It's the main safety thing." 
</P>
<P>
About five weeks into the semester the class will have its first ocean 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We take them out to Anacapa Island. The first time out consists of just 
snorkeling methods," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the scuba experience. So what's it like scuba diving in the ocean 
for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
"Frightening!" said Roger Reynhart, who received his diving certification 
through Miller's class. "It's all new. You feel strange. It's more of a 
survival thing at first. 
</P>
<P>
"By the second dive you start to open your eyes. It's a whole different world 
down there. With TV and Jacques Cousteau, people have a sense of what it's like 
without moving from their armchair, but to actually go under and experience it. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
After completing the beginner course, students have the option of continuing 
their scuba skills. 
</P>
<P>
"The next step is the intermediate class. They learn to dive deeper and more 
aggressively," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
An advanced course is also offered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate because diving in this area is excellent," Miller said. "It's 
probably one of the prettiest places in the world to dive." 
</P>
<P>

BEST BETS: FOR THE KIDS; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S 'EGGSTRAVAGANZA' TIME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your kids are fried on amusement parks and you're scrambling for a place to 
take them this weekend, consider the logical alternative: eggs. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, April 7, from noon to 3 p.m., the Conejo Valley Recreation and 
Park District will sponsor its fourth annual "Spring Eggstravaganza," featuring 
games, crafts, a petting zoo, pony rides, magicians, music and massive egg 
hunts that begin every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The event, designed for children ages 12 and under and located at the Conejo 
Valley Play Fields across from the Thousand Oaks Public Library, is free to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had about 6,000 people attend, and there was an admission charge. 
This year, because the event is free, we're expecting about 8,000 people," said 
Kathy Myers, recreation specialist with the Conejo Valley Recreation and Park 
District. "It's getting to be quite a local happening." 
</P>
<P>
Among the scheduled events are sack races, relay races and a parachute tossing 
that children hold onto a parachute and then use it to flip balls into the air. 
"Australian trolleys," in which five children stand on a piece of wood that 
resembles a cross-country ski with ropes and then attempt to walk together, 
help kids learn teamwork, Myers said. All game booths, donated by Rockwell 
International and Century 21 America, are free. 
</P>
<P>
Craft activities will include spin art -- squirting paint onto a rotating piece 
of paper -- and sponge-painting. Children also will have the chance to have 
their faces painted and a pair of bunny ears attached. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cute," Myers said. "We have thousands of kids running around with bunny 
ears on." 
</P>
<P>
Special guests include Chuck E. Cheese, Spiderman, the Domino's Pizza "Noid," 
Officer McGruff of "Take a Bite Out of Crime" fame and a 6-foot bunny. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest draws, however, is likely to be the egg hunts, which will 
involve up to 100 children at a time and begin every five minutes. Children who 
find gold-colored eggs will win one of several prizes totaling $1,000 that have 
been donated by local businesses.

RESIDENTS PROTEST CITY'S AMENDED HOLLYWOODLAND GROWTH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS ARE ANGRY OVER OMISSION OF A REVIEW BOARD TO MAINTAIN 
ARCHITECTURAL STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the hundreds, Hollywoodland homeowners are protesting what they say are 
efforts by city planners to dilute to the point of ineffectiveness their 
proposed specific plan for controlled local development. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 residents who live in the area below the Hollywood sign have sent 
signed copies of a protest letter to Mayor Tom Bradley and other city 
officials, according to the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And more than 100 residents turned out at a public meeting last Thursday to 
oppose the specific plan as amended and proposed by the city for Hollywoodland 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The residents and Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the area, say the 
elimination of safeguards included in a specific plan that the homeowners' 
association drafted and submitted to the city in July, 1989, makes the city's 
proposal too weak. The homeowners' group spent more than $10,000 on its plan in 
hopes of preventing careless development and maintaining the integrity of the 
"Old-World European-style" architecture common throughout Hollywoodland. 
</P>
<P>
"The essentials that we have asked for have been ripped out of the plan," said 
Bruce Mahler, planning and zoning committee chairman for the homeowners' 
association. "We have not been fortunate enough to see who did that or why, but 
we have indicated our deepest concerns and hopes that our version of the plan, 
which we feel will protect us, is restored." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the neighborhood group's plan, eliminated from the city's 
proposal, is a design review board that would review building proposals on the 
about 195 vacant lots and 530 existing homes in Hollywoodland. 
</P>
<P>
Although advisory in nature, the board would aim to ensure that development is 
"compatible in scale and character" with existing architecture, which has 
defined the area since its establishment as one of Los Angeles' first planned 
communities in 1923, according to Mahler and other association officials. 
</P>
<P>
The city plan also eased requirements in the groups' plan for setbacks from the 
street to assure easier firefighting access through the steep and narrow 
hillside streets, and for tougher height and density limits on homes. The city 
plan also eliminated the neighborhood association's proposal to place 
underground all utility lines for new construction, as well as a height 
limitation on walls and fences. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's hearing at Cheremoya Avenue School, nearly every homeowner who 
spoke was in favor of having planners include the tougher neighborhood plan 
provisions in their final draft to be sent to the city Planning Commission 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler told the crowd that the city's proposal is "so diluted, through massive 
deletions and revisions, so drastically watered down, that it has been 
essentially modified into ineffectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
City planners disagree. "I think we're trying to achieve the same goals as they 
are," said Daniel Scott, a city Planning Department hearing examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who is developing the specific plan, attended last week's meeting and 
said he is considering the changes supported by residents. He said the plan 
still has several hurdles to clear, including approval by Planning Commission 
and the City Council, and could be changed significantly before it is 
officially adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Scott did say, however, that city planners oppose the design review board as an 
"inappropriate mechanism" for regulating development. Instead, city planners 
are considering having the area designated as a "historic preservation overlay 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
If the area warrants such protection, approval of development would require 
approval of the city Planning and Cultural Heritage commissions, with the City 
Council hearing appeals, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the area deserves such protection due to uniqueness and 
uniformity of architecture has been called into question, because recent 
development may have altered the area too much, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Crane, a Hollywoodland association member, favors the group's plan and says 
opposition has been limited to developers, who he said favor the less-stringent 
city plan and oppose the design review board. 
</P>
<P>
But, Kurt Meyer, an architect who lives and works in Hollywoodland, is one 
association member who opposes the design review board as an unwarranted 
governmental intrusion in an area that should be left unregulated. He said he 
supports stringent development standards on issues relating to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
As in many city areas, high land values and dwindling room to develop has 
prompted a sharp increase in construction proposals in Hollywoodland. Many 
homes are perched on stilts overhanging steep ravines, and residents say much 
of the new development is being done on lots that are too steep or unstable. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywoodland development currently is governed by an association-backed 
interim control ordinance approved in June, 1988, which imposed restrictions on 
such things as height, setback and roof configuration. The association, hoping 
to speed the process of adopting a more stringent and permanent specific plan, 
set about developing its own proposal to protect the area. 
</P>
<P>
By last year, association members began complaining that developers were 
rushing to get their projects in before adoption of a specific plan and that 
they sometimes abused the interim ordinance while the overburdened city 
planning staff did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in November, the neighborhood association was shocked to find that city 
planners had left their proposal sitting idle on a desk instead of moving it 
through the approval process. Last December, city Planning Director Kenneth 
Topping sent them a letter apologizing "for the miscommunications and delays, 
which have characterized our department's response in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Action on the specific plan came only after Woo and Council President John 
Ferraro, who also represents the area, began meeting with city planners. 
Ferraro has not taken a position yet on the city proposal, said his planning 
deputy, Renee Weitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Woosaid he favors the tougher plan drafted by the association, although he is 
undecided on whether a design review board is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's meeting, Woo committed himself to supporting a stronger specific 
plan. He said this week that he wants stronger language limiting the density 
and height of homes on the steep slopes, limits on the height of fences and 
setbacks, and requiring utility lines to be placed underground.

ART DECO CLASHES WITH THE ORIENT AT HEALTH FOOD-ORIENTED HIBACHI

<P>
I imagine that, back in 1939, officers of the Ventura County Mutual Fire 
Insurance Co., going about their staid business, would have been shocked if 
they could have looked into the future and seen people happily eating meals of 
exotic origin right inside their room-sized vault. 
</P>
<P>
I was surprised to find Hibachi restaurant in this location. Having eaten many 
times at Hibachi in Santa Barbara, I expected the newer Ventura version to be a 
similar vine-covered oasis where you order tropical cuisine at the counter and 
eat on a lush, breezy patio. 
</P>
<P>
Instead the restaurant is in a historic Art Deco building with stately green 
awnings. It looks more like an old-fashioned supper club than a Hawaiian 
restaurant. Another surprise: Although the outside is classic '30s 
architecture, the inside is all Japanese wood, shoji screens and vivid Gauguin 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the look of the restaurant, the food is priced to fit most family 
budgets. It suggests good health-food fare with an Asian spin. The menu has a 
little Chinese, a lot of Japanese, some Korean and some American influences. In 
fact, Hibachi is pretty typical of the kind of food you can find in a Hawaiian 
fast-food restaurant -- except that it isn't as greasy and doesn't use as much 
pork. 
</P>
<P>
Among the starters, bite-sized clams with fresh green onions had a nice, spicy 
kick to them. We tried a variety of dim sum, including mui pan -- barbecued 
pork engulfed in a fist-sized sweet bun. It was like a muffin run amok. 
</P>
<P>
I like my comfort foods less blatant, so I had the sui mai: bite-sized shrimp, 
chicken or pork wrapped in dough and steamed. They are dipped in a light, tangy 
soy-based sauce, which creates a perfect combination of sweet and salt, meat 
and dough. 
</P>
<P>
My son loved the gyoza, which had a vegetable filling with a slight taste of 
cabbage. He ordered them for his appetizer and reordered them for his dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The egg roll had a fine, crispy crust and a startlingly mushy filling. I was 
just trying to decide what to make of it, when my friend told me that no 
genuine food critic could possibly like it; he, however, liked it very much. 
</P>
<P>
Hibachi gets pretty creative with its soups. Miso soup had tofu, finely grated 
carrots and sliced red and green onions. There was a nice, light broccoli soup 
and a delicious seafood chowder, filled with chunks of potato and fish; it had 
a slight, wonderful buttery flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The simpler the dinner here, the better I liked it. Chicken, fish or steak was 
offered marinated in teriyaki and broiled. The chicken was the best -- moist 
and crisp. I tried the mahi-mahi and remembered once I tasted it that I'm 
always disappointed by mahi-mahi. I think I get suckered because I like the 
sound of the name. 
</P>
<P>
For bigger appetites -- and I mean big -- the stir fry and curry dishes were 
filled with fresh vegetables and generous amounts of fish or meat. The chewy, 
slightly sweet brown rice was much better than the white, and worth the extra 
25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The workers at the old fire insurance company might be surprised to find 
Hibachi here -- but I expect that they'd also be pleased. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
PRIORITIES: SHE IS 35, A SINGLE PARENT OF 7-YEAR-OLD TWINS, AND TYPICAL OF A 
LARGE NUMBER OF VENTURA COUNTY ADULTS WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE CLASSROOM.

"There aren't enough people out there that support us, and anyone who tells us 
to keep going is appreciated," Pattie McPhun said. 
</P>
<P>
McPhun, 35, a single parent of 7-year-old twins, is representative of a large 
number of adults in Ventura County who have returned to college seeking a 
degree. She studies at the Ventura satellite center of Cal State Northridge, 
where the average age of students is 34. Women are 78% of the students. Eight 
of 10 from that group are working. Many are single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
McPhun's composure and determination are as striking as her height: 6 feet, 1 
inch in heels. If people struggle to pronounce her name, she says in a soft, 
measured voice, "just remember the 'fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
McPhun began working in the technology division at Ventura Community College 
five years ago; for the past year she has been the athletics secretary. Her 
longtime desire to be a teacher, coupled with a need to earn a living, 
motivated her to return to college for a bachelor's degree in liberal arts 
studies in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, McPhun received a two-year associate's degree from Ventura Community 
College, where she took as many transferable courses as possible. She is now 
taking math and health science as part of her second semester of work at the 
CSUN Ventura center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, McPhun planned to finish college in 3 1/2 years by carrying a full 
course load of three night classes in addition to her secretarial job during 
the day. She cannot, however, easily schedule all the classes necessary for her 
major and has decided to finish the degree over five years. To achieve her 
goal, she must take two courses per semester and a third course twice weekly in 
the summers. 
</P>
<P>
"My children let me know they don't like that I'm gone. I have to remind them 
of our goal for me to make a better living. When I have my teaching credential, 
I'll be off summers and afternoons." 
</P>
<P>
McPhun considers herself luckier than many adult learners because her 
employer's release-time policy enables her to attend a weekly class from 4 to 7 
p.m. without losing salary. She also has two grants totaling $500 a year, 
"which covers registration fees and almost pays for books and baby-sitting." 
</P>
<P>
Divorced in 1985, McPhun has earned her own living for the past five years. She 
said her former husband did not support her academic pursuits and she receives 
no help now beyond child support. Besides the strain of balancing school, work 
and family, McPhun has to juggle expenses. She spends $300 per semester for 
tuition and fees, $75 for books and $250 for evening child care while she 
attends classes. 
</P>
<P>
After she earns her degree, McPhun will need to complete a year and a half of 
course work and student teaching to obtain her credential. 
</P>
<P>
"The liberal arts studies degree program is the academic basis of the K-8 
teacher's credential," said Joyce Kennedy, director of the CSUN Ventura center. 
"It is very popular with an enrollment of 130-150 students, 66 of whom are now 
serving as student teachers in elementary classrooms throughout the community." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said that to complete this last phase, most people have to give up 
their jobs or find alternate forms of employment suited to their daytime 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"They often make enormous sacrifices to attain their degrees," she said.

BRUIN PUTS TEAM AT TOP OF HIS PRIORITIES; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: BACK PROBLEMS SIDELINED MIKE SEALY FOR A YEAR, AND HIS STARTING 
POSITION WENT TO A TEAMMATE. BUT HE SAYS THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS ALL THAT REALLY 
MATTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman Mike Sealy, the former Santa Monica High School volleyball setter, is 
fighting to regain his starting position on the defending national champion 
UCLA team. But he says that helping the Bruins win another NCAA title is more 
important than starting. 
</P>
<P>
Sealy has been in a battle with another freshman, Albert Hanneman, to regain 
his place in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sealy, who was named the Ocean League's most valuable player one year, was 
twice selected to All-CIF Southern Section teams. That kind of prominence 
naturally drew the attention of UCLA Coach Al Scates, long revered as the 
nation's best college volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Scates recruited him, and he has been starting as a freshman for most of this 
season. Recently, however, he gave way to Hanneman of North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Back problems caused by weak muscles forced Sealy to forgo playing volleyball 
his senior year in high school, and he thinks that the long layoff may have had 
something to do with being relegated to a reserve's role. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told me that late in the year your legs start feeling really 
rubbery," he said, adding that they were right. "I'm sure it has something to 
do with being out of shape from not playing last year." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 6 1/2-inch, 180-pound Sealy is still seeing plenty of action. He 
said that Hanneman has been starting the first two games of a match and that he 
has been replacing Hanneman beginning with the third game. In college 
volleyball, the team that first wins three games is declared the winner of a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Sealy is not distressed that he has lost his starting job. In fact, he said, 
the competition between him and Hanneman may be better for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It pushes us both and makes us both better players. The only thing that really 
matters is if we win or not." 
</P>
<P>
It has seldom been "or not" for Scates and his Bruins, who have won 13 NCAA 
championships since 1970. This year top-ranked UCLA (18-2 overall as the week 
began) is considered a good bet to repeat as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons the Bruins win so often is that Scates recruits the nation's 
best players, who intensely compete against each other for starting positions. 
</P>
<P>
Even UCLA All-American middle blocker Trevor Schirman, a senior who has won 
many honors, does not consider himself exempt from such competition. Earlier, 
he said he has to fight to keep his job on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"You can play miraculous matches," Schirman said, "but at the end of the season 
you could be out of there because some guy is playing better than you and has 
worked harder." 
</P>
<P>
Scates said that practices lately have been "so competitive you can't tell who 
the starters are going to be for the next match." He added that he used 11 
different starting combinations during five recent matches. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sealy and the 6-3 Hanneman have been neck-and-neck in practice lately, 
and "both keep getting better. From a motivational standpoint, that's 
tremendous, because it's also happening at other positions." 
</P>
<P>
Each brings different attributes to the setter position, Scates said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanneman was a swing hitter in high school, so he is a good offensive threat. 
He is also quick to the ball and a good, aggressive leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Sealy, at 6-6, is a better blocker, is technically very sound and makes the 
right choices on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Sealy may have "great technical skills," he said, "but he came into the program 
without being able to exercise or jump for six months. He couldn't spike or 
block because he was physically so far behind the rest of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
Scates said that as Sealy's quickness and strength began to wane, he began 
replacing him with Hanneman during the latter stages of matches and then gave 
the starting job to Hanneman. He said he has had to be careful to ask Sealy to 
perform the "right amount of exercise, because an overload could hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
"When he stops growing and as he gets stronger, he's going to increase his 
quickness. And his blocking and hitting are going to get better. He's going to 
be a great talent." 
</P>
<P>
Sealy said that he has been trying to get in better shape by spending more time 
in the weight training room, doing leg presses and squats to strengthen his 
legs. He said a week off from volleyball for winter quarter final examinations 
at the end of March was a welcome respite for him. 
</P>
<P>
He expects to be ready for the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
playoffs, which start April 25 at Cal State Northridge. UCLA has already earned 
a spot in the playoffs, a prelude to the NCAA championships, by virtue of 
having clinched first place in the WIVA's DeGroot Division. 
</P>
<P>
Sealy also expects the Bruins to be ready to defend their NCAA championship 
against a flock of tough challengers. The strongest teams in the WIVA playoffs 
besides UCLA probably will include USC, Stanford, Cal State Long Beach and 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do it," Sealy said. "A lot of other teams have peaked early and 
have played as well as they can. We haven't peaked yet; we're still rising 
toward our best performance."

CRUCIAL GYMNASTICS MEET AWAITS UCLA WOMEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA women's gymnastics team (17-3) is the top seed in the NCAA West 
Regional at 7 p.m. Saturday at the John Wooden Center on campus. Teams in the 
field besides the Bruins, ranked sixth nationally, are No. 7 Oregon State, No. 
10 Cal State Fullerton, No. 16 Washington, No. 23 Boise State, No. 26 
California and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will be vying to qualify for the NCAA championships on April 20-21 at 
Corvallis, Ore. Individuals who will compete for spots in the nationals in the 
all-around competition include Dina Amorosa, Jennifer Bloom and Erin McCann of 
Stanford, Yuri Hinson of UC Davis, Gail Schulz and Tammy Sutton of Seattle 
Pacific and Teri Frankie of the University of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is led by senior All-American Jill Andrews, a winner of two individual 
NCAA championships who has won eight of 10 all-around titles in meets this 
year, and freshman Carol Ulrich, a member of the 1988 U.S. national team who 
has emerged as the Bruins' second-best performer in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have won two of the last three NCAA West regionals. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team (18-2 at the start of the week) will 
host the Diet Pepsi Collegiate tournament this weekend at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's opening matches, UCLA will meet No. 10 UC Santa Barbara (9-11) at 
5:30 p.m., and No. 2 USC (17-2) will face No. 4 Stanford (9-5) at 7:30. On 
Saturday there will be a consolation match at 5 p.m., and the championship 
match will start at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, USC and Stanford have each been ranked No. 1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Pepperdine men's volleyball team (9-11 overall and 4-9 in the Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn.) will end the regular season by playing host 
to Brigham Young (5-16, 1-9) at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and to Stanford (9-5, 9-4) 
at 6:30 p.m. Monday at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>

STOCK PRICES IN TOKYO DROP SHARPLY IN MORNING SESSION

<P>
Erratic price movements resumed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this morning, with 
the Nikkei index plunging by more than 400 points in the first few minutes of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices have eroded steadily since the beginning of the year and 
registered their second-worst fall ever on Monday. Stocks fluctuated wildly 
Tuesday and Wednesday, although they showed signs of stabilizing above a 
"support level" of 28,000 points on the Nikkei 225-share average as investors 
shored up confidence. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nikkei quickly fell through the 28,000 level again today, dropping by 
449.06 points to 27,993.88 as of 9:16 a.m. After one hour of trading, the index 
had recovered somewhat but was still down 370.48 points to 28,072.46. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall in the index was caused by rumors from various sources that some 
minor securities firms had gone bankrupt," Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro 
Inoue told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with 
massive losses by speculators who were unable or unwilling to pay for their buy 
orders because of this year's market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Before Japanese stocks went into their descending roller coaster ride, the 
Nikkei had soared to a lofty peak of 38,915.87 on Dec. 29, when the average 
price/earnings ratio stood at 62.4. The index was gutted by 28% by the end of 
trading Monday, when the Nikkei closed at 28,442.94 and the average P/E ratio 
on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down to 45.1. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts differ on whether the current stock decline represents a crisis-style 
meltdown of the Tokyo market or a healthly correction to more sustainable 
levels after speculation and excess cash drove prices out of line with 
fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
Most traders and analysts agree, however, that the atmosphere in Kabuto-cho -- 
Japan's Wall Street -- is now one of resignation, not panic. 
</P>
<P>
Various factors have contributed to the bearish mood, most notably a sense that 
Japanese financial authorities are ineffectual in their attempts to manage the 
dollar-yen exchange rate. The greenback has strengthened relentlessly against 
the yen in recent weeks, despite yen-buying market intervention by the Bank of 
Japan and pleas for international coordination in monetary policy by Finance 
Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which traded momentarily above the 160-yen level on Monday, opened 
in Tokyo today at 158.32, down 0.58 yen from Wednesday's close, and 
strengthened to 158.15 after one hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Also fueling pessimism in stocks is an amorphous anxiety over trade friction 
with the United States. Negotiators were holding 11th-hour consultations in 
Washington in the Structural Impedements Initiative talks as financial markets 
opened in Tokyo today.

BRYANT ACCUSED OF RACIAL NAME-CALLING; 
</P>
<P>
POMONA: LATINO OFFICIALS PROTEST THE COUNCILMAN'S REFERENCES TO A FELLOW 
COUNCILMAN AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. BRYANT DENIES RACISM.

<P>
Latino city officials and residents are up in arms over Councilman C.L. (Clay) 
Bryant's use of racially offensive terms in referring to a fellow councilman 
and the city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Accused by Councilman Tomas Ursua of calling Urusa a "Chicano gang member" and 
City Administrator Julio Fuentes a "beaner," Bryant admitted using the terms 
but said he has no apologies to make. 
</P>
<P>
The use of the word "beaner," he said, "may be offensive, but it's not racist." 
He said he called Ursua a gang member because Ursua is allied with a political 
"gang" that is trying to recall Bryant from office. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua called a press conference before Monday night's City Council meeting to 
assail Bryant for "anti-Hispanic" remarks. About 100 demonstrators marched in a 
circle outside the council chambers, some carrying signs in English or Spanish 
with such statements as: "Clay Bryant is a Closet Racist" and "Down with Racism 
in Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting, Ursua read a two-page statement asserting that Bryant 
had denounced him at a closed-door council session last week as a "no-good 
Chicano gang member." The meeting was an executive session that ended with a 
call for a grand jury investigation of alleged irregularities in the city 
licensing department. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said Bryant has a history of making racist comments. Bryant denied only 
that he called Ursua no-good. "Ursua proclaimed at a council meeting that he is 
a Chicano and if that recall bunch is not a gang, tell me what it is," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said two city employees heard Bryant call Fuentes a "beaner." Bryant did 
not respond to that assertion at the council meeting, but later acknowledged 
use of the term, although he could not remember when it was used or with whom. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said he was "shocked" that Bryant would use that word. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never called me that to my face," Fuentes said. "I take it as an 
offensive remark. I really think it's derogatory. Not even in jest has a good 
friend of mine ever referred to me as a beaner." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said the allusion to Latinos as beaners, or bean-eaters, is as 
offensive as labeling a black person as someone who likes watermelon and 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua, who recently broke with Bryant after being his ally on the council for 
months, said Bryant has patronized and played minority groups against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he regarded the accusations by Ursua and the demonstration at City 
Hall as part of a plan by his longtime opponent, Mayor Donna Smith, Ursua and 
others to stir up attention for the recall election June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she had nothing to do with the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Racism is so far from his thoughts, Bryant said, that he wouldn't even know how 
to make a racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said: "Every day I have people of all extraction and persuasions in my 
office. . . . The subject of racism has never arisen in my office or out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Waunidi Changamire, president of the Pomona Valley chapter of the NAACP, 
defended Bryant, saying that he has always been available to assist people in 
their problems with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who would have helped the black churches, the black businesses 
and some of the other people that have had problems in the city if it were not 
for Mr. Bryant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said he had planned to ask the council to censure Bryant, but changed his 
mind, feeling that he had made his point. Councilwoman Nell Soto, who, like 
Ursua, is Latino, said she has always opposed censure motions because they 
divide the community.

WATER CONSERVATION URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday adopted a resolution asking residents to cut down 
on water usage by 10% to help offset a prolonged statewide drought. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure is only voluntary, at a time when some Southland water 
officials are urging counties and cities to adopt mandatory water conservation 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution lists ways to conserve, including not hosing down sidewalks and 
driveways, installing low-flow devices in toilets, adjusting sprinklers to 
avoid runoff, avoiding watering during the hot part of the day or during peak 
hours, shutting off fountains and repairing leaky faucets.

YOUTH PROGRAMS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson's youth program proposals, outlined in his State of the 
City speech last week, were approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors for 
implementation by the city's boards and commissions and for inclusion in next 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson proposed expanding the Police Department youth adviser program, 
improving after-school programs, hiring a youth program coordinator, putting 
the city's seniors to work as volunteers in youth programs and starting a 
college-assistance trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Donald McIntyre, mindful of a $5-million budget gap that must be 
bridged, advised that he would prefer a volunteer youth program coordinator to 
save the city money. Overall, McIntyre estimated Thomson's suggestions could 
cost the city $50,000 to $100,000 next year.

RESTAURANT FACES DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of a proposed McDonald's restaurant at the northwest corner of 
Altadena Drive and Lake Avenue will come under closer scrutiny as a result of 
an urgency ordinance extended Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the provisions of the ordinance, which will be in place for the next 10 
1/2 months, the restaurant developer must secure a conditional-use permit 
before beginning construction. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement means that a public hearing must be held before restaurant 
plans are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who organized against the restaurant said it would bring increased 
traffic and create safety problems. They asked the Board of Supervisors to halt 
the restaurant construction. But because the restaurant plans comply with the 
site's commercial zoning and both the County General Plan and the Altadena 
Community Plan, the supervisors could only ask for a more detailed review under 
a 45-day urgency ordinance imposed Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Although representatives of the McDonald's corporation argued that the 
extension of the ordinance for another 10 1/2 months would be unfair, the 
supervisors voted 4 to 1 to extend it. Supervisor Pete Schabarum sided with 
McDonald's and voted no.

ELECTIONS / BALDWIN PARK; 
</P>
<P>
RACE IS A DOGFIGHT AS ANIMAL SHELTER BECOMES KEY ISSUE 
</P>

BALDWIN PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much to the dismay of most of the nine candidates running for city office, the 
main topic in this year's race has been cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Pet Protection, a Los Angeles-based group, has seized the 
opportunity provided by the election to campaign for an end to the county 
animal shelter's practice of selling unclaimed pets for medical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, which is based in Baldwin Park and serves nine San Gabriel Valley 
communities, last year sold 247 unclaimed dogs and cats to laboratories out of 
the 30,000-plus animals that passed through its doors. 
</P>
<P>
"In a democracy, people determine what is important to them, and animals are 
important to the people of Baldwin Park," said Robyne Harrington, president of 
the pet group, which last December failed in its attempt to have the council 
ban the sale of the city's animals from the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Her group has won the support of two candidates and is actively endorsing them 
through mailers, phone calls and door-to-door campaigning. The issue also 
dominated a recent candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the other candidates have expressed concern that the issue, 
championed by an outside group, is obscuring more important matters: the city's 
financial woes, the status of redevelopment projects and two ballot measures 
aimed at converting the mayor's office from an elected seat to a rotating 
position among council members. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are knocking on doors saying that I hate animals and want them 
killed," said Mayor Pro Tem Bette Lowes, one of three candidates for mayor. 
"That's absolutely not true. But I have more respect for the voters than to get 
involved in this fear-and-smear campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Lowes, 57, was elected to a four-year council term in 1988 and took over as 
acting mayor when Leo King resigned last November. If she loses her bid for 
mayor, she still will serve out the remaining two years of her council term. 
</P>
<P>
A Baldwin Park resident for 37 years, Lowes takes credit for having helped 
select recently named Police Chief Carmine Lanza and City Manager Don Penman to 
head the ranks of what had been a demoralized city staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am part of the team that changed the oil on the smoking city car," said 
Lowes, who serves as president of the city's Adult Education Advisory Committee 
and vice president of the county's Mid-Valley Mental Health Board. 
</P>
<P>
Her challengers, Frank Mamone and Albert E. Sanders, both contend that Lowes 
has been part of the problem -- including a budget crunch that last year forced 
the city to lay off its entire code enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
Mamone, who declines to give his age, is a retired supervisor of weapons 
manufacturing plants for the Defense Department and owns and manages a mobile 
home park. This is his third bid for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is broke, and the taxpayers want to hear what is going to be done 
about stopping the squandering," said Mamone, one of the candidates endorsed by 
the pet-protection group. "I will tell people in this city what and where the 
truth is." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, 41, is an ex-Marine Corps veteran and a former machinist for an 
aluminum awning company. He describes himself as a house husband, helping to 
raise two children, ages 11 and 13. He made two previous council bids. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in power do nothing for nobody but themselves," said Sanders, who 
belongs to no clubs or organizations because of what he sees as the potential 
for a conflict of interest. "Only a small, select group in this town makes the 
decisions. I would open it up." 
</P>
<P>
Six other candidates, including two incumbents, are vying for two council 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bobbie Izell, 64, a retired cement layer and home builder who has 
served 11 years on the council, is the other candidate endorsed by the pet 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Julia McNeill, 65, a retired cardiovascular technician, was 
elected to the council in 1987, filling the seat vacated by her late husband, 
Robert McNeill, who died in December, 1986, after eight years on the council.

Everybody running for City Council agrees on one thing: The tax measure on the 
April 10 ballot should be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The special property tax measure, which would fund acquisition of hillside land 
for conservation, was placed on the ballot by the City Council in response to a 
report by a citizens panel last year. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it is opposed both by a councilman who voted to place it on the ballot 
and by the co-chairman of the committee that suggested it as one of three 
funding options for hillside preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Mouw, one of eight candidates competing for three seats on the City 
Council, describes it as a dead issue. Mouw was co-chairman of the Mayor's 
Hillside Conservancy Advisory Committee, which recommended the measure as one 
way to protect the foothills. Mouw said he now believes that a privately funded 
conservancy is a better option. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Bob Kuhn, who voted to place the measure on the ballot, said he 
believes the voters should decide. But Kuhn, who is seeking his second 
four-year term on the council, said he thinks a better way to protect the 
hillsides is to restrict housing density. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would assess 20 cents per $100 of a parcel's value annually, 
beginning in fiscal year 1990-91. The annual assessment on an average homeowner 
with property valued at $250,000 would be $500. Qualified low-income property 
owners would receive a rebate under the measure, which requires approval by a 
two-thirds majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The city estimates it would collect about $10 million over the three years the 
tax would be in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Pride, a slow-growth group, is taking no position on the measure. The 
residents group, using the slogan "Save the Foothills," last year overturned a 
city ordinance that would have allowed taller homes in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are united against the tax measure but all promise that they 
would carefully review future hillside development proposals. And there are 
other issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, 46, who served on the city Planning Commission for four years before 
joining the council, favors limiting council members to two terms. A Glendora 
resident for 28 years, he owns an insurance agency and is on the board of the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Lois M. Shade, 46, has been on the council for eight years and is 
seeking a third term. Shade, a 26-year resident, voted against placing the tax 
measure on the ballot. She is campaigning for a commuter rail station in 
Glendora if a line is built from Los Angeles to San Bernardino. She serves on 
the county Commission on Local Governmental Services and the Glendora Child 
Care Task Force at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Leonard Martyns is not seeking reelection after eight years on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Architect John T. Cashion Jr., 58, a 28-year Glendora resident, served on the 
city's Planning Commission for 14 years. He stresses environmental protection, 
expansion of services for youth and seniors, and annual adjustment of the 
city's fees for services. He served on the city's Downtown Parking Committee 
and Preservation Ordinance Committee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Harper, 39, teaches English as a second language in the Pomona Valley 
Unified School District. Harper, a 27-year resident, favors more programs for 
youth and seniors. He holds a bachelor's degree in English from Southern 
Methodist University and a master's in education from the Claremont Graduate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Doran D. Hearn, 38, a superintendent for a roofing company, has not been 
involved in civic affairs for the five years he has lived in the city. Because 
of that, he said, he is a candidate "with no preconceived prejudices, . . . no 
obligations to any special interest groups or factions." 
</P>
<P>
He earned a bachelor's degree in wildlife/fisheries resource management from 
the University of Idaho, then worked five years as a forester. He served a 
two-year term on the City Council of St. Maries Ida., population 2,794. 
</P>
<P>
Molly MacLeod 38, an attorney and a city planning commissioner, has lived in 
Glendora for 10 years. She is chairwoman of the Glendora Chamber of Commerce 
legislative committee and helped incorporate the Glendora Crimestoppers, a 
citizens crime prevention group. She said one of her priorities is "keeping 
Glendora safe." 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod, who holds bachelor's and master's degrees in speech communications, 
has a law degree from Western State University in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Mouw, 47, a former director of Glendora Pride, is campaigning as a 
pro-heritage, pro-environment candidate. A mail carrier and a 10-year Glendora 
resident, Mouw is director of the Glendora Historical Society and in 1987 led a 
citizens campaign to fight development of one of the city's last orange groves. 
He also chairs the Glendora Human Services Subcommittee. He holds bachelor's 
and master's degrees in history, served in the Marines and was a Peace Corps 
volunteer in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics consultant Tony Miller, 47, is a 28-year resident and serves on the 
General Plan committee. The former owner of Finkbiners Market is a member of 
the Downtown Redevelopment Assn. and is vice president of the Chamber of 
Commerce. He wants to work toward reducing the number of vacant stores in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Pride is supporting Cashion, Mouw and Shade in the election. 
Glendora's Future, a property rights group formed in response to Glendora 
Pride, has made no endorsements.

<P>
Balancing the inevitability of development with preservation of a small-town 
atmosphere is the overriding issue in this City Council race, with most of the 
candidates pushing to slow development. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates are running for two City Council seats Tuesday. Mayor Terry 
Dipple is unopposed, and Councilwoman Maria Tortorelli is not running for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Sandy McHenry, 41, is running for a second four-year term on the 
council. A lifelong resident of San Dimas, he promises to continue improving 
parks, preserving open space and increasing law enforcement with an emphasis on 
community relations and preventive programs. 
</P>
<P>
He serves on the city Development Plan Review Board and Senior Citizens Housing 
Committee, and was planning commissioner for four years. He owned a nursery 
until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Damrill, 50, who last year formed Save Our Rural Environment to scale 
down a proposed development, is running on a slow-growth platform. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unique small-town lifestyle is threatened by the continued overdevelopment 
of our hills and residential areas," said Damrill, who also led a call for a 
new city ordinance that restricts tree cutting. A commercial insurance broker 
and a 10-year resident, Damrill said she would like to develop more services 
for seniors and more volunteer programs. 
</P>
<P>
John Ebiner, 37, a hospital computer analyst, grew up in West Covina and has 
lived in San Dimas since 1985. He holds a bachelor's degree in history from Cal 
Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Ebiner, who serves on the General Plan Advisory Committee, said he favors slow 
growth and doesn't want to allow duplexes in the 20-block, predominantly 
single-family residential town core, "to keep that small-town atmosphere." He 
also supports additional housing for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission Chairman Gary Harshman, 47, says attracting retail 
businesses for more revenue and maintaining a solid budget are his goals. The 
El Monte Airport manager has come under fire from other candidates for his 
county links and support from developers. 
</P>
<P>
At least $2,500 of the $3,000 contributed to his campaign came from developers 
or investors in development, but he described development as a moot issue 
because "San Dimas is almost built out." The 15-year resident has served on the 
Planning Commission since 1987 and is on the General Plan Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Jones, 39, who has served on the city's Senior Citizens Commission since 
October, is making his second bid for a council seat in two years. He is branch 
manager of a manufacturing firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said the council needs to protect mobile home parks "to give (park) 
residents peace of mind." He also advocates a face lift for the Canyon shopping 
center, calling it a "disgrace" that is forcing residents to shop out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Artist and gallery owner Abraham Vanwyk, 57, says he is running as "a man of 
the people" and believes development is crucial for the city. "If our town 
doesn't grow, it will be dead on its feet," he said. "The others want to keep 
the hills green with coyotes running around. I say people own those hills. If 
you want green space, buy property for a park." 
</P>
<P>
A former minister in the County Jail, retirement homes and hospitals, he is in 
the Coast Guard Auxiliary and teaches boat handling and safety at Bonelli 
Regional County Park. 
</P>
<P>
Mary B. Young, 38, said she moved to San Dimas seven years ago because she 
liked the small-town feeling and wants to maintain that atmosphere. The 
homemaker she said she also wants to preserve the city's remaining natural 
areas and increase youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
She has volunteered in anti-drug education efforts in the schools and in the 
Pomona Valley Council of Churches shelter program.

PROP. S WOULD REPLACE SLOW-GROWTH INITIATIVE

<P>
Proposition S, which would replace a 1982 slow-growth initiative, would help 
avert legal challenges and control the pace of residential construction in the 
city, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the new measure would modify and extend Proposition K, 
which voters adopted eight years ago to limit the number of residential units 
built each year in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition K, which was challenged in court by developers, expires in 1992 but 
would be repealed in January, 1991, if Proposition S is passed. The new measure 
would be in effect for 10 years, from Jan. 1, 1991, to Dec. 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Gilman, president of the Residents Assn. of Monterey Park, which pushed for 
the 1982 initiative, said Proposition S is needed to keep the slow-growth 
measure from being challenged again in court. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot lists no opposing argument. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the development firm Monterey Views sued the city, contending that 
Proposition K violated a state law requiring cities to expedite construction of 
affordable housing. The firm also charged that Proposition K -- which 
restricted new construction to 100 units a year -- was inconsistent with the 
city's General Plan, which had allowed construction of 500 new units a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paul Turner ruled in favor of the 
city, saying the developers should have appealed to the city before they went 
to court. The developers have appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jabin of Monterey Views said Proposition S would not affect his property 
because of its zoning. But Jabin said he opposes such measures in general 
because they do not address what he considers the real problem: commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Monterey Views' legal challenge, Gilman helped revise Proposition K 
in an attempt to protect it against future lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition S would be tied to the city's General Plan, under which a total of 
1,300 residential units may be constructed. Under Proposition K, the new units 
could be built at a rate of 100 units a year. Under Proposition S, the annual 
limits would change to an increasing percentage formula that would in effect 
limit construction to about 90 units a year, Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the city room to breathe," Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Low- and moderate-income housing would be exempt from a building allotment 
system until the city meets its obligation to provide a fair share of 
affordable housing, as determined by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot are six candidates seeking three council seats. Mayor Pat 
Reichenberger and Councilman Barry Hatch are seeking reelection. Other 
candidates are Fred Balderrama , David Barron, Sam Kiang and Marie Purvis.

FAMILY LIFE: THERE'S NOTHING SMALL ABOUT RACIAL SLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roy, my regular golfing partner, and I are a lot alike in many ways, even if he 
can't putt. 
</P>
<P>
Other than clothing (a sweat suit on him looks like a tux, while a tux on me 
looks like a sweat suit), we share many interests -- politics, food, travel, 
books. 
</P>
<P>
But things happen to Roy that simply could never happen to me. 
</P>
<P>
Take his recent experience at a Mission Viejo carwash. 
</P>
<P>
As he was walking to the cashier, another customer drove up, got out of his car 
and handed Roy the keys. "I don't need any gas," he said. "Just a wash and a 
hot wax." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if that happened to me, I would (a) think it was a practical joke and 
laugh or (b) think it insulting, in which case I would take the car to a real 
employee and order a $75 hand wax and a $100 full detailing of the interior. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm not Roy, who returned the keys and said, "Sorry, I don't work here." 
</P>
<P>
I'm also not black and experienced at handling such notions based on my color. 
</P>
<P>
Roy is both. 
</P>
<P>
Note that I did not say that Roy is "used to" being judged by his color (or 
misjudged, to be more precise). You don't get used to it, he says, but you do 
expect it in an area such as Orange County, where just 2% of the population is 
black. "And you wonder, 'Will it really ever end?' " 
</P>
<P>
I was raised to think that the answer would be in the affirmative -- once we 
did away with all the overt forms of racism that existed in our society. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, decades after we've knocked down the legal barriers, I'm left to 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
I hear from my black friends the slights they receive almost daily, and I hear 
from my Latino friends who tell of similar experiences (one, whose family has 
been in California since before the turn of century, is constantly being 
stopped at the Border Patrol checkpoint just south of San Clemente). 
</P>
<P>
Here's some further testimony, written by Jessie Fauset: 
</P>
<P>
"I am a colored woman, neither white nor black, neither pretty nor ugly, 
neither specially graceful nor deformed. I am fairly well educated, of fair 
manners and deportment. 
</P>
<P>
"In brief, the average American done over in brown. 
</P>
<P>
"In the morning, I go to work (by public transportation), which is crowded. 
Presently, someone gets up. The man standing in front of the vacant place looks 
around for a woman to give it to. I am the nearest one, but 'Oh,' says his 
glance, 'you're colored,' and he plunks himself down in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
"At noon I go to lunch. I always go to the same place because I'm not sure of 
my reception in other places. How long am I to wait (without being served) 
before I'm sure of a slight? I eat, but I go out still not knowing whether the 
delay was intentional or not. I can't tell, and the uncertainty beclouds my 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing that irks us most is the teasing uncertainty of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the man at the box office give us the seat behind the post on purpose? Is 
the shop girl impudent or just nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"Had the position really been filled just before we applied for it? 
</P>
<P>
"What actuates the teacher who tells Alice -- oh, so kindly -- that the college 
preparatory course is really very difficult? 
</P>
<P>
"Other things cut deeper, undermine the very roots of our belief in mankind. In 
school we sing 'America' and learn the Declaration of Independence. Chivalry, 
kindness, consideration are the ideas held up before us -- 
</P>
<P>
 "Honor and faith and good intent, 
</P>
<P>
 "But it wasn't at all what the lady meant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- the lady in this case being the white world. (The real message) is that the 
good things of life, the true, the beautiful, the just, these are not meant for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
"I am constantly amazed as I grow older at the network of misunderstanding -- 
to speak mildly -- and at the misrepresentation of things as they really are 
which is so persistently cast around us. 
</P>
<P>
"And so the puzzling, tangling, nerve-racking consciousness of color envelops 
and swathes us. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us, it smothers." 
</P>
<P>
What's most fascinating about the above is that while it could have been 
written by my friend Roy this morning. It actually appeared in a publication 
called the World Tomorrow in March of 1922. 
</P>
<P>
I don't pretend to know the answer or even, for that matter, that there is one. 
It may be, as a doctor friend says -- only half in jest -- that racism is 
genetic, that we are born with a need to discriminate against others. 
</P>
<P>
But it certainly wouldn't hurt if we all were just a little more understanding 
and conscious of our actions when dealing with people of other races. 
</P>
<P>
Roy wouldn't ask you to do that for him, but I will. Being a little more 
comfortable with his life in Orange County might improve his putting, and that 
would please me much.

Under normal circumstances, cells in the area of the brain that deal with 
feelings of pleasure fire electrical impulses at about three times a second. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that to one of life's most thrilling moments, such as sky diving, when 
those impulses are being fired at up to 40 times a second. 
</P>
<P>
But even that barely approaches the effects of cocaine, which can cause brain 
cells to fire impulses from 40 to 200 times a second, until the cells sending 
out those signals have used up all their reserves of neurotransmitters, leaving 
the recipient cells crying out desperately for more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very difficult to 'just say no' when the brain is saying, 'More! 
More! More!' " says Dr. Jeffrey Fortuna, director of Drug Education Consultants 
in Orange and staff consultant for the Chemical Recovery Services unit at 
Healthcare Medical Center in Tustin. "There is no drug that depletes the brain 
of chemicals faster than cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't save everyone, but there are a lot of kids we can reach with 
education that is scientifically accurate, not moralistic," he told a group of 
more than 400 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals last week at 
a daylong conference on cocaine dependency sponsored by Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine abuse is a serious problem in Orange County, Fortuna said, although not 
so much the kind that shows up so often on television. Instead of crack, the 
cheap, readily available form of the drug that has caused so much havoc in the 
inner cities and generated intense media interest, Orange County cocaine users 
are more likely to use freebase, the most potent form of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
In freebasing, cocaine is heated in a pipe and reduced to its purest form, 
instead of being combined with other chemicals as it is in crack (cocaine 
bicarbonate) and cocaine powder (cocaine hydrochloride). "It's 100% pure, and 
then it's absorbed through the lungs, so it takes effect in a matter of about 
eight seconds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Injected cocaine starts working in about 13 seconds, according to Dr. David E. 
Smith, founder and director of the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in San Francisco, 
who also spoke at the conference. "Snorted cocaine takes about three minutes, 
and when it's ingested (swallowed), it takes about 25 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"And it's everywhere, absolutely everywhere in Orange County," Fortuna said. 
"No community is immune. "The only thing that fluctuates is the price. In Santa 
Ana, it's about one-fifth the price in Corona del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
The more than 900 addicts that Fortuna has dealt with range in age from 14 to 
45, but he calls 18- to 35-year-olds "the real high-risk group in terms of 
hard-core use." 
</P>
<P>
Fortuna said cocaine "is indeed the most addictive substance on the planet, if 
you exclude sugar." 
</P>
<P>
Most of what is known about cocaine dependency and other addictions is so 
recent that health-care professionals are racing to keep up with new 
developments by reading scientific literature and attending continuing 
education conferences such as this one. "There has been more learned about 
brain chemistry and addiction in the last 25 years than in the entire history 
of society," said Smith, who founded the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic during the 
legendary "Summer of Love" in 1967 and has been treating drug addicts ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
The most common reason that people use cocaine, Fortuna said, is "to produce a 
competitive edge. They want to be brighter, faster, quicker and wittier than 
anyone around them. It's sort of a defensive reason, 'so that people do not see 
me as I really am.' " 
</P>
<P>
The second reason on the list: to elevate mood. Only 5% to 8% of the adult 
population in general suffers from clinical depression, Fortuna said, compared 
with 58% to 64% of those who take drugs. And cocaine will work for a while 
until the brain's chemical reserves are depleted. "Then the individual will 
become even more impressed. The most severe depressions I've ever seen in my 
life are in cocaine addicts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Appetite suppression is the third most common reason, Fortuna said, and some 
people take cocaine to increase pleasure. "These are the true hedonists," 
Fortuna said. But perhaps, surprisingly, "these people are very rare. Most 
hedonists are also addicted to other drugs," he said. The fifth reason: To 
shelve anger and fear, Fortuna said. 
</P>
<P>
After cocaine has used up the brain's supply of neurotransmitters, abstinence 
and good nutrition are "the only two factors that will bring them back," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that life should be a pursuit of goose bumps," he said. "And 
there are plenty of goose bumps to be had without the assistance of chemicals."

SCIENTISTS URGE LOGGING CURBS TO PROTECT RARE OWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Logging on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest is driving a rare owl species 
to extinction and should be significantly restricted, government scientists 
told Congress Wednesday in a recommendation that loggers say could have a 
devastating impact on the region's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists' report, which suggests banning logging on 30% to 40% of 
available publicly owned timberlands, was requested by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, which is to decide by June 23 whether to formally classify 
the northern spotted owl as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
That designation would restrict logging on millions of acres of some of the 
world's most productive softwood forests, setting the stage for a political 
fight between environmentalists and loggers over the potential loss of 
thousands -- maybe even tens of thousands -- of jobs in rural Oregon, 
Washington and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Tuttle of the Wilderness Society said setting aside the preserves called 
for in the report -- areas ranging from less than 100 acres in Northern 
California to 600,000 acres on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington -- would 
slash by 25% the total harvest available in the U.S. forest lands in the three 
states. The owl thrives best in old-growth forests, the type most valued by 
loggers. 
</P>
<P>
"For a forest-based economy, it (the conclusion of the scientists' report) is 
the worst thing that I can imagine," said Kevin Eckery of the Timber Assn. of 
California. "For Oregon, it's the equivalent of Boeing closing in Seattle. I 
can't even imagine something equivalent in California. It's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials cautioned in the report that a great deal more study will be 
needed to determine the proposal's true economic impact. "The issue is more 
complex than spotted owls and timber supply -- it always has been," concluded a 
summary of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the process of formally listing a species as 
"threatened" is based only on science and that economic considerations are 
factored into decisions about how extensively an animal should actually be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
Both environmentalists and loggers say the recommendation is likely to greatly 
influence the Fish and Wildlife Service when it decides how to protect the owl. 
"Make no mistake about it, this is a very influential document," said Rep. Les 
AuCoin (D-Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
The report itself drew a mixed reaction from environmentalists. Rick Johnson of 
the Sierra Club in Seattle said he was "particularly happy" with it, but 
National Audubon Society policy analyst James Pissot in Washington was 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"They are continuing to allow short-term, high-risk (timber practices in 
unprotected lands) in exchange for long-term expectations (of a spotted-owl 
revival) on a wing and a prayer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers and lawyers agreed that the spotted owl will prove as controversial a 
test of the 1973 Endangered Species Act as the snail darter, the 
three-inch-long fish that delayed construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee 
for two years in the late 1970s. After much debate, that dam was exempted from 
the law and the fish was successfully transplanted to another location. 
</P>
<P>
The northern spotted owl does not lend itself to as facile a solution. Each 
breeding pair of owls require a large amount of old-growth timber in which to 
forage for prey, and the several hundred pairs known to exist already inhabit 
most of the remaining virgin forests from California to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
John Kunzman of the Oregon Lands Commission, a grass-roots group of loggers and 
mill hands opposed to broad protection for the spotted owl, said Wednesday that 
his group plans to rally enough pressure on Congress to "throw that law on the 
table and dissect it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson of the Sierra Club said that fears of a backlash against the law are 
real, but he said he doubts that Congress will make any significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Endangered Species Act is still one of the more popular major pieces of 
environmental legislation," he said. "It enjoys wide support with people, and 
Congress knows that." 
</P>
<P>
The report made public Wednesday was co-authored by scientists from the Fish 
and Wildlife Service as well as the three major federal public lands agencies 
-- the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The committee of scientists concluded that the medium-sized, mottled-brown owl 
subspecies is "imperiled over significant portions of its range because of 
continuing losses of habitat from logging and natural disturbances," such as 
fire. It said that "current management strategies are inadequate to ensure (the 
owl's) viability." 
</P>
<P>
Central to the committee's recommendations is the abandonment of relatively 
small existing preservation zones called "spotted owl habitat areas" in favor 
of much larger "habitat conservation areas" encompassing thousands of acres 
each. 
</P>
<P>
These new, larger preserves would be fewer in number, but have room for at 
least 20 breeding pairs of owls. The report said the maximum distance between 
the habitat conservation areas should be 12 miles, allowing easy migration. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, existing owl preserves are smaller, scattered parcels usually 
designed to accommodate one to three pairs of the birds. Environmentalists 
argue that the small preserves are vulnerable to being wiped out by fire or 
wind, and the distances between them discourage the interbreeding needed for a 
healthy owl population. 
</P>
<P>
"The large blocks of forest are a significant improvement over the smaller 
(habitat areas)," said Pissot of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good to see the scientific committee -- this time without political 
interference -- come to a rational, science-based conclusion," said Johnson of 
the Sierra Club, referring to a controversy that developed in 1988 when Reagan 
Administration appointees in the Fish and Wildlife agency blocked an effort by 
scientists to protect the owl. 
</P>
<P>
"It is basically a doubling of the (size of) preserved lands in Oregon and 
Washington," complained Chris West of the Northwest Forest Resource Council, an 
industry lobbying group in Portland, Ore. "When we laid it out on a map, we saw 
communities lose their entire forest base; entire ranger districts were put 
off-limits." 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon is being turned into a giant wildlife sanctuary for the spotted owl," 
said Kunzman, who owns a logging-equipment supply house in Sweet Home, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Under the committee's proposal, Oregon would have 48 of the larger habitat 
areas and Washington state would have 43. California, with lusher forests 
better able to support owls, would have 99 such areas, but each would be 
markedly smaller in size. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists also suggested allotting at least 80 acres of suitable land 
around the nests of all known owl pairs in public forests devoted to logging. 
These birds would be relied on to re-establish owl populations in those areas 
between harvest cycles. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to that provision was included to allow the Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management to honor sales already contracted out under a 
short-term compromise agreement hammered out last year by Oregon lawmakers. 
That pact sought to defuse the crisis atmosphere that was closing some mills 
and forcing up the cost of uncut trees because of fears of future log 
shortages.

STRUGGLING TO PROTECT 'THE ICE'; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM AND EVEN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARE THREATENING ANTARCTICA'S PRISTINE 
BEAUTY. BUT THE PUSH IS ON TO PRESERVE THIS LAST UNTAINTED LABORATORY.

ANVERS ISLAND, Antarctica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The upturned hull of a sunken Argentine tourist ship has nearly slipped from 
sight, barely breaking the surface now like one of the playful whales that swim 
these frigid but plentiful waters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the somber memories of the wreck last year, and the oil it spilled within 
sight of a premier U.S. research station, endure as forceful symbols of the 
hazards posed by the growing human presence in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 315 tourists and crew of the Bahia Paraiso survived and the spill 
was minor by most standards, the accident gave new impetus to a movement to 
respect this continent not only as a place of forbidding beauty but also as a 
fragile reservoir ensuring the Earth's health. 
</P>
<P>
That has meant, in part, cleaning up the unsightly mess that developed in 
recent decades from Antarctic exploration itself. But more broadly, it has 
encouraged a changing mentality toward tourism, research methods and 
exploitation. The broken hulk also has reminded the world of the need to 
preserve Antarctica as a uniquely shared and still-untainted laboratory for 
understanding the planet's seas and skies. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 nations that make up the Antarctic Treaty organization are working with 
renewed energy on tougher rules to govern activities in the region. And some 
countries are rebelling against an already strict 1988 agreement to govern oil 
drilling and mineral mining, arguing instead for an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, is 
removing the junk heaps that scar its three permanent bases and is hauling 
shiploads of rubble back north. Even before the Bahia Paraiso sank, an 
additional $8.3 million was budgeted for environmental and safety projects this 
year. Cleaner sewer systems are being installed, environmental impact programs 
are under review and emergency plans for oil spills are being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Antarctica was approached in an expeditionary way," said Gary 
Staffo, recently named as the National Science Foundation's polar safety and 
environmental officer. "It was seen as a one-time shot: 'We'll go do the 
mission and get the people back and leave the trash behind.' Certainly that is 
no longer acceptable -- and that is progress. There are greater expectations 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Bahia Paraiso means Paradise Bay in Spanish, and that would have been an apt 
name for the place where the ship foundered on rocks on Jan. 28, 1989, spilling 
about 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Elephant seals nuzzle noisily on a rocky island beach, adelie and chinstrap 
penguins totter about, tiny limpets browse in the tidal basins and swarms of 
shrimp-like krill bloom in springtime, hearty meals for the whales. 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, blue-white glacial ice cliffs rise hundreds of feet out of the 
sea. The silence gives way to explosions as vast slabs break away and slide 
into the water -- the "calving" of icebergs from the ice shelf that covers 98% 
of the continent and is up to three miles thick near the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Antarctica is a place for science. In recent years, the research has 
taken on urgency as knowledge emerges of the environmental damage caused by 
industrial-era pollution and its potential impact on the whole planet. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects take advantage of the still-unspoiled seas and skies, with 
constant winter nights and crystal summer days, to pursue cutting-edge studies 
of phenomena such as cosmic rays and radiation belts. 
</P>
<P>
And some scientists are finding a world startlingly abloom in what seems at 
first such a bleak and lifeless place, fresh proof of the continent's crucial 
role in the world's ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers David Karl of the University of Hawaii and Mark Huntley of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, for example, are charting a 
phenomenal mass of life in the Gerlache Strait along the Antarctic Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
From the pitching deck of the primary U.S. research ship the Polar Duke, Karl 
sends an electronic pulse into the water, setting off a small explosion. That 
frees a titanium frame holding a ring of 13 plastic bottles, and the device 
floats up hundreds of feet to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
All hands scan the choppy waters until Robert H. Rutford, president of the 
University of Texas at Dallas and a veteran polar hand, spies the yellow buoys 
astern. The ship's winch painstakingly recovers the experiment. Karl helps pull 
aboard the frame and its harvest: five months' worth of organic sediment, much 
of it excrement from luxuriant swarms of krill shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
The "catch" is neatly divided into 11-day samples captured by the 
computer-driven ring of revolving bottles attached to the bottom of a plastic 
funnel. Some are near empty, but a couple, recording the height of the "bloom," 
are nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year project, costing $600,000 this year, recorded a rise in the 
strait's biomass this summer "to a higher level than ever found before in any 
ocean," said Karl, who has visited Antarctica seven times since 1976. "In the 
winter, this water is essentially a biological desert. But in the spring, we 
are finding that it blooms into a biological garden." 
</P>
<P>
The study also will help analyze aspects of the "greenhouse effect" of global 
warming, thought to be caused by a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere. As the plant biomass of the Gerlache Strait grows and absorbs 
carbon dioxide, that may allow the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere and, in effect, serve as "a self-regulating mechanism that helps 
keep us from totally ruining the environment," Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntley, a partner in the program known as RACER (Research on Antarctic Coastal 
Ecosystem Rates), said the project has shown the strait to be 10 times richer 
than the nutrient-filled fishing grounds off Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica, known simply as "The Ice" by old hands, contains 70% of the world's 
fresh water, and the cold currents welling from its shores are apparently an 
engine for the world's seas. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got here is a biological pump," Huntley said. "The Gerlache is 
seething with life. And if you've got a rich resource like this that depends on 
a small locale, then you'd better be careful with it. It could be an incredibly 
important nursing ground." 
</P>
<P>
In a climate with winter temperatures as low as 128.6 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit and where psychological tests are required for those who plan to 
"winter over," Ph.D. degrees don't suffice; scientists need ingenuity, 
teamwork, stamina and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
When he sent the frame back to the bottom for another eight-month sampling, 
Karl resorted to an unlikely anchor: an old boiler taken from the junk heap at 
Palmer Station. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica is so harsh an environment that it defies the ambitions of any 
single nation, and nowhere in the world has international cooperation been so 
extensive. The RACER program's 23 scientists come from seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
"With colleagues from India to Germany, you get a whole different conceptual 
perspective," Huntley said. "One has the sense of constantly being fertilized. 
. . . A lot of the geopolitical nonsense falls away, and the human aspects 
prevail. The common denominator is scientific research." 
</P>
<P>
That fits the treaty's declaration: "It is in the interest of all mankind that 
Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes 
and shall not become the scene or object of international discord." 
</P>
<P>
The mean annual temperature in the interior of the continent is 70 degrees 
below zero Fahrenheit. But along the Antarctic Peninsula jutting up toward the 
tip of South America, the summer temperatures rise above freezing. That gives 
rise to names like the "Banana Belt" and the "Antarctic Riviera" in a region of 
majestic fiords and, between the outsized glaciers, much of the 2% of open 
ground not covered by ice on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula is just two days by sea across the fearsome Drake Passage or a 
two-hour flight aboard a C-130 Hercules to the Chilean airstrip at Teniente 
Marsh Base on King George Island, making it accessible to scientists and a 
steadily growing number of tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
The island is home to eight permanent research bases and also to the only hotel 
in Antarctica, run by the Chilean military. Calling it Spartan is generous; the 
hotel looks and feels like an elongated shipping container raised off the 
barren ground beside the gravel landing strip, with a few cubicles off the 
narrow hallway for people boarding ships in the bay for tours or transiting to 
bases farther south. 
</P>
<P>
The Bahia Paraiso was among several ships that call at Palmer Station, on 
Anvers Island halfway down the peninsula. About 2,500 tourists made the trip 
this season, up from 822 in 1983. A couple of tour ships plan to visit McMurdo 
Station next year, the largest U.S. base, located on the opposite side of the 
continent on the much colder Ross Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country skiers, an airborne tour group and a cross-continent dog sled 
expedition have also called at the third U.S. base, Amundsen-Scott at the South 
Pole, during the last two summers. 
</P>
<P>
Groups like the Environmental Defense Fund cite the Bahia Paraiso sinking in 
demanding far stricter rules for tourism, including a ban on helicopter flights 
and boat landings within 1,500 meters (about one mile) of wildlife sites and an 
outright ban of any ship waste disposal in the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, openly 
discourages tourism and last year enacted regulations to control tourist 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Carol A. Roberts, deputy director of the National Science Foundation's division 
of polar programs, cited three concerns: the impact of tourists on scientific 
work, especially during disruptive visits to the stations; the tourists' impact 
on the environment, underscored by the Argentine shipwreck, and the cost of 
search and rescue. Palmer Station sacrificed most of its research season last 
year to care for the Bahia Paraiso survivors and coordinate the cleanup and 
analysis of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Nascent adventure tourism on the dangerous mainland, she said, threatens to 
cause even greater problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who handles logistics for Antarctica, noted that the budget for 
getting to and working in the region is greater than the science budget itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last place on Earth; it's almost like going to the moon in a 
logistical sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards were apparent on a recent trip by scientists setting out on a range 
of expeditions, accompanied by NSF staffers evaluating environment and safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The C-130 flight from Chile descended through clouds toward the airstrip in 
35-knot crosswinds, just below the landing limit of 37 knots. The New York Air 
National Guard pilot fought to keep the wallowing, yawing plane on course and 
slammed it down on the airstrip. Parked, the plane shuddered in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
A choppy, wet ride aboard rubber Zodiac rafts with outboard motors brought the 
group to the Polar Duke, the workhorse U.S. Antarctic research ship. The 
219-foot, ice-strengthened vessel serves as both transport to Palmer Station 
and platform for some of the complex oceanographic studies that form the heart 
of the NSF's $151-million annual Antarctic research program. 
</P>
<P>
The new Norwegian captain, Tor-Arne Jakobsen, brought the ship into Palmer two 
days later on a stormy night in a punishing 45-knot wind, down from the 
66-knot, hurricane-force winds the previous day at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the approximately 4,000 people who work each year in Antarctica, 
Jakobsen had long sought the chance to be there. His father was captain of an 
expedition there in 1950, and Jakobsen himself had sailed seven times to the 
Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The charts Jakobsen used clearly showed the rocks struck by the Bahia Paraiso. 
The Argentine charts apparently did not. Treaty countries are working now to 
bring all charts used in the area up to date. 
</P>
<P>
Staffo, the environmental officer who previously worked for NASA, cited a 
number of other new safety measures. The NSF is testing devices to be carried 
on expeditions that could be tracked by satellite, instantly pinpointing a 
group's location. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. focus is on the environment, especially waste disposal. 
Macerators, which grind up sewage, were installed at Palmer and McMurdo 
stations this year; the "gray water" is still pumped into the bays. Palmer, a 
small station with just 40 residents in the summer, no longer burns its waste 
but rather "retrogrades" it, jargon for shipping it back north. McMurdo, a much 
larger center of more than 1,000 in summer, still burns waste every other 
Sunday morning, a sore point for Greenpeace and other activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jorgensen, Palmer's contract manager, said 10 containers of refuse had 
been shipped back this year, and a chartered ship had hauled away tons of junk 
from the abandoned Old Palmer Station, across Arthur Harbor. Several years' 
worth of old low-grade radioactive and dangerous waste was also sent back. 
</P>
<P>
A priority, Staffo said, is to get suppliers to remove all plastics and excess 
packing material before the goods are shipped. "It's much easier to deal with 
it in the States than once it gets out on the ice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. program suffered its own fuel spill this season when 10,000 to 12,000 
gallons of oil spilled from old rubber fuel bladders at the airfield near 
McMurdo, Staffo said. Since then, those bladders have been replaced with steel 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Palmer last year could do little more than watch as the Bahia 
Paraiso oil slick spread into nearby tidal coves and beyond. It took six days 
for emergency crews to arrive with oil booms and other gear. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60,000 gallons of fuel is still aboard the overturned vessel, but 
NSF projects the cost at $60 million to remove the wreck. So it will remain in 
its grave on a reef off DeLaca Island. American scientist Ted DeLaca was 
working at Palmer at the time and watched the ship founder on the island named 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, a scientist from Texas A&amp;M University, was 
returning to Palmer for a year-later analysis of the spill's impact. An 
emergency team analysis conducted after the spill, whose results are to be 
published in the May edition of Environmental Science and Technology magazine, 
basically found that the bay made a quick recovery after the initial kill-off 
of thousands of limpets and other invertebrates and about 300 birds. 
</P>
<P>
The pounding of the surf and winds apparently helped cleanse the area within a 
few weeks, Kennicutt said, but he now wants to see whether oil sediment that 
penetrated the shoreline has caused longer-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group found a very low population of microbes, "proof of how 
pristine the area is, since microbes thrive with pollution." He will study 
whether the microbes, which degrade hydrocarbons, have increased as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"The spill showed up the potential problem of tourism as the number of people 
in the area increases. It's unfortunate, but it gave us a laboratory framework 
to test the magnitude of a spill in such an area," he said. "But for other 
scientists who have been assessing the natural processes, to have this man-made 
event introduced throws all the years of data into doubt."

SOVIETS PLAN TO 'CLEANSE' PARTY OF RADICALS 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party, faced with growing divisions in its ranks, is 
preparing to oust those radical reformers who promote "social democracy" rather 
than the party's platform, informed political sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Intended as a major "cleansing" of the party, the move will attempt to preempt 
the plans of some radicals to break away when the party holds a pivotal 
congress in July by expelling them and re-establishing political discipline 
among remaining party members. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is expected to begin within a few days, according to the sources, 
following the publication of a "letter to Communists" from the top party 
leadership outlining the need to tighten party discipline and to adhere to a 
basic ideology. 
</P>
<P>
The letter will also stress, the sources said, that the drive must be conducted 
within party rules and on the basis of the new platform, that it must be 
focused on individuals rather than on groups and that, above all, it must not 
degenerate into a full-scale purge, a word at which all here shudder. 
</P>
<P>
"No one plans to oust people by platforms or groups," one party source 
commented. "Each party member will be invited to define his position and make a 
decision as regards party membership. Each individual party member will have to 
determine what his position will be." 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to eliminate the voices of those reformers demanding far more 
radical changes, the campaign seems certain to make the 18.8-million-member 
party much more homogenous, forcing out those on the extreme left and perhaps 
those on the extreme right. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely targets for the campaign, the sources said, are the more than 
60,000 members of the party's Democratic Platform, a newly formed faction that 
believes that "Communist ideology has exhausted itself" and that is pressing 
for more radical reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which has 162 local clubs in 102 Soviet cities, has been debating 
whether, when and how to break with the Communist Party and establish itself as 
a social democratic party. The new party would be oriented toward evolutionary 
changes to establish socialism, retaining a market-based economy but with 
protection for the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
Arkady M. Murashov, a leader of the opposition Inter-Regional Group of Deputies 
in the Soviet Parliament, said organizers of a proposed social democratic party 
have planned a founding conference for May and that the Communist Party is "in 
a race on who acts first." 
</P>
<P>
While some Communist Party members have already resigned to join the social 
democrats, Murashov predicted that there would be mass resignations once the 
new party is founded. "We expect at least half of the members to follow our 
example," he said. "In any case, we are talking about millions joining the new 
party -- instantly and on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign would probably leave untouched the Soviet Union's most popular 
opposition politician, populist Boris N. Yeltsin, who remains a member of the 
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. Despite his open and sharp 
criticism of many party policies and of the its leadership, Yeltsin has stopped 
well short of forming a faction within the party, let alone a new party, 
relying instead on his immense personal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The anticipated campaign appears to have resulted from a fundamental 
understanding, reached within the past week, between progressives and 
conservatives in the party's ruling Politburo, and this may ultimately prove 
more important than the campaign itself. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives seem to have accepted in this agreement the far-reaching reforms 
sought by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to transform the Soviet economy on the 
basis of market forces. Progressives, for their part, have agreed on the need 
to recognize the party's "merits" and not blame it for all the country's ills; 
they also seem to accept the necessity of greater party discipline, even at the 
cost of ousting some past allies. 
</P>
<P>
This understanding, if confirmed, would resolve some of the deepest divisions 
within the Soviet leadership over the course of perestroika, as Gorbachev's 
program of political, economic and social reforms is known. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is now pushing a package of more than 20 measures to overhaul the 
Soviet economy, with some of the first to be adopted about May 1 and others to 
come into effect over the summer and autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent conservatives, who have long insisted on the need to keep the Soviet 
economy within the framework of central planning and based on state ownership, 
are already talking with equanimity about the transition to "market conditions" 
while retaining elements of the old system. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the government and party bureaucracy remains in the hands of 
conservative apparatchiki, as do many state-owned enterprises, and their 
support of the reforms, or at least their acquiescence in them, will be 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Progressives, who hold positions closer to the center, have begun to far more 
freely criticize their one-time allies, the radicals, accusing them of losing 
sight of the urgent need for a better economic performance if perestroika is to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign appears to follow closely the call last month of Yegor K. 
Ligachev, a senior Politburo member regarded as the party's leading 
conservative, who demanded that the policy-making Central Committee begin such 
a "cleansing" and rid itself of radicals who distort its policies and undermine 
its discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Although a liberal party source denied that Ligachev and his supporters within 
the Central Committee had forced others in the leadership to accept the 
campaign, he does appear the winner in what must have been a major showdown 
within the party's top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is certain to hit such well-known radicals as historian Yuri N. 
Afanasyev, a leader of the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, according to 
political sources here. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are not Communists, and the process of evaluating each member 
will make clear who is who and where everyone stands," one influential 
conservative party source said. "This will be a cleansing of our ranks -- not a 
purge, definitely not -- and we will emerge smaller but stronger as a party." 
</P>
<P>
But the drive could also reach some prominent members of the new political 
Establishment, including economist Stanislav S. Shatalin, a key adviser to 
Gorbachev, who declared himself to be a social democrat during last month's 
meeting of the Central Committee.

BILL TO RESTORE ANTI-BIAS LAWS MAY FACE VETO 
</P>

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Wednesday that he would oppose this year's 
major piece of civil rights legislation, even as President Bush praised Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and pledged "to live up to the highest ideals of the 
civil rights movement." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said he will recommend vetoing a bill that would overturn five 
Supreme Court decisions limiting protections against job discrimination. The 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee handily approved the bill as 
Thornburgh's letter was released. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill, which would make it far easier for civil rights plaintiffs 
to win job discrimination lawsuits, has been the civil rights movement's 
highest legislative priority for a year. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
Thornburgh said: "The Administration opposes as inconsistent with equal 
opportunity any legislation that would encourage quota systems or otherwise 
divide our society along racial lines." Supporters of the bill deny that it 
would encourage quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Bush sidestepped the issue in his speech to the Joint Center for Political and 
Economic Studies. He pledged to "fight against poverty and for opportunity" and 
to "use this office -- this bully pulpit -- to condemn, in the strongest terms, 
racism, bigotry and hate." 
</P>
<P>
In raising the veto possibility, Thornburgh noted that the Administration has 
proposed legislation to overturn two of the five rulings. He said it "is 
determined to help root out racial bias and bigotry and to guarantee equal 
opportunities for all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
It is the other three rulings on which the Administration and the Senate bill 
are at odds. The three, which were decided on 5-4 votes at the end of the 
1988-89 Supreme Court term, held that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In cases of alleged employment discrimination, employers no longer have to 
demonstrate that apparently discriminatory hiring and promotion practices are 
essential to corporate success. Last year's court decision in Ward's Cove 
Packing Co. vs. Antonio shifted the burden of proof to employees who charge 
that they were victims of discrimination. The Kennedy bill would shift the 
burden of proof back to employers. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that, without establishing a link between specific employment 
practices and a resulting discriminatory impact, "employers could be found 
liable for the numerous innocent factors that can cause statistical imbalance 
in the composition of a work force." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Managers may include race or sex as a reason for denying an employee a 
promotion if they also give other, legitimate reasons for their decision, 
according to the court's ruling in Price-Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. The Kennedy 
bill says that the employer is guilty of illegal discrimination if race or sex 
was one reason for denying a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that this would penalize employers in cases in which race or 
sex was "a motivating factor" in employment decisions, regardless of whether 
the same decisions would have been made anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing recovery based on an employer's state of mind is contrary not only to 
the spirit of Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) but to the spirit of 
our legal system as well," he said in his letter to Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White employees, according to the ruling in Martin vs. Wilks, may now 
challenge court-approved affirmative action plans years after they are adopted. 
This decision threatened to unravel hundreds of city and county plans to hire 
and promote more minority members. The Kennedy bill would bar new lawsuits if 
the white employees knew about affirmative action plans but waited years to 
contest them. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that the court's ruling "may lead to fairer, more carefully 
considered and unassailable remedies for discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
The bill's supporters deny that it would compel employers to use quotas for 
women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The President, in his remarks Wednesday, noted that "prejudice and racial 
tensions still exist in America." Bush predicted that "the day will come -- and 
it is not far off -- when the legacy of Lincoln will finally be fulfilled at 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- when a black man or woman will sit in the Oval 
Office." 
</P>
<P>
"When that day comes, the most remarkable thing about it will be how naturally 
it occurs. He or she will be another President, another traveler in the 
continuum of freedom, representing all the people of America." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's words did not mollify civil rights leaders, who expressed outrage at 
Thornburgh's veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 
an umbrella group of more than 180 organizations, accused the Administration of 
deciding "to bow to the right wing of the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
After noting that the threatened bill has 40 co-sponsors in the Senate and 164 
in the House, Neas predicted that it would be passed with at least 70% support 
-- more than enough to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate committee approved the measure on an 11-5 vote.

STUDENTS GET A LESSON IN HOW COLD WAR CAN HEAT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was billed as a speech on perestroika. Instead, it became an illuminating 
lesson on the legacy of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to give their students a global perspective, administrators at Sierra 
Nevada College on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe invited a Soviet diplomat to 
the campus to discuss the political and economic changes convulsing the Soviet 
Union. Gennady Zolotov, the deputy consul general in San Francisco, graciously 
agreed, and a date for the lakeside mini-summit was set. 
</P>
<P>
Then politics got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the globe, an American diplomat in Leningrad was denied 
permission to travel into Lithuania the day before last Friday's scheduled 
speech at the tiny college. So the State Department, in a tit-for-tat policy 
dating to the 1950s, promptly called Zolotov in San Francisco and told him to 
unpack. He was informed that the special permission he needs to journey more 
than 25 miles beyond the consulate had been revoked. His trip to the mountains 
was off. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't retaliation," State Department public affairs representative Chuck 
Steiner said. "It was just an in-kind response. They denied our request, so we 
denied theirs. It's been a long-held rule between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs officer Kim Lamberty added, "We didn't zap this guy on purpose. 
. . . It just so happened (Zolotov) was the next (Soviet diplomat) scheduled to 
travel" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
College officials, expecting a crowd of several hundred students and community 
leaders at their event, protested heartily. But it was no use. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems pretty petty and immature to me," college dean Mark Hurtubise said, 
recalling his fruitless pleadings with Washington. "Why couldn't we have been a 
role model rather than resorting to the same type of activity we criticize in 
other countries?" 
</P>
<P>
The episode has become something of a cause celebre in Incline Village, the 
small, woodsy town two miles from the California state line where Sierra Nevada 
College is located. Last year, the 500-student liberal arts school hosted the 
consul general from San Francisco, Sergei Aivazian, and his appearance was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the turmoil in the Soviet Union sparked by Lithuania's declaration 
of independence from Moscow on March 11, Hurtubise said: "We figured it was a 
great time to bring another Soviet official to our campus." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Zolotov's speech, a weekend of events -- including tete-a-tetes 
with local politicians and hiking in the surrounding mountains -- were planned 
for the diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"Gennady was going to bring his wife, Valentina, and they were going to stay at 
our house," Hurtubise said. "Everyone was looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
Zolotov did not return telephone calls from The Times. But reaction to the news 
in Incline Village has been "disappointment and disbelief," college spokeswoman 
Roz Parry said. Callers from the community "basically agreed the whole thing 
was childish," while students were puzzled by what looked to them like State 
Department paranoia over an innocent social visit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The students thought it was quite ironic, since the topic of the speech was 
perestroika and glasnost, that their own government would deny them the 
opportunity to hear new ideas," Parry said. "We had hoped they would 
reconsider, as a gesture of openness, but they said a policy is a policy." 
</P>
<P>
Hurtubise is an optimist, however, and is hopeful the speech can be 
rescheduled. Perhaps by next semester, he reasons, chilly international 
relations -- like the frosting of snow on the peaks surrounding Lake Tahoe's 
sparkling waters -- will have thawed.

8 FLEE IN 3RD ESCAPE FROM JAIL IN 4 MONTHS 
</P>

<P>
Seven inmates, including two murder suspects, were being sought on Wednesday 
after the third escape in four months from the South Bay Detention Facility 
here, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said eight prisoners cut through bars 
on a jail window and climbed to freedom Tuesday night before a security guard 
hired to watch the outside of the jail could alert deputies inside. 
</P>
<P>
The break was a replay of a March 7 escape in which 13 inmates used hacksaw 
blades to cut their way out in the largest jailbreak in San Diego County 
history. 
</P>
<P>
One of the inmates who escaped Tuesday night was captured about 20 minutes 
later, but the other seven eluded a dragnet. Authorities speculated they may 
have headed for the Mexican border seven miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the inmates apparently had a hacksaw or some other tool 
smuggled inside and used it to cut through the bars. 
</P>
<P>
"The inmates then forced out the plastic window and lowered themselves 35 feet 
to the ground on bedsheets tied together," said Sheriff's Sgt. Bev Creighton. 
"It's not been determined what tools were used to cut through the bars and how 
they were brought into the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista police captured Johnny Smith, who had been awaiting transfer to 
state prison to serve a drug sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego men charged with murder, Manuel Salmaron, 29, and Yidefonso 
Barahona, 19, were among those still at large. 
</P>
<P>
The others were identified as: Fernando Martinez, 24, San Diego, held on 
charges of drunk driving and a previous escape attempt; Jorge Renteria, 28, San 
Diego, held on a variety of charges including assaulting a police officer; 
Roberto Loza, 31, no known address, charged with 14 counts of robbery; Arturo 
Robles, 29, held for a prior escape, and Salvador Gutierrez, 25, burglary. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates were being held in a "hard felony tank" in the crowded jail. 
</P>
<P>
The jail sits below street level in downtown Chula Vista. Its location allowed 
someone outside to lower hacksaw blades on a string to the window where the 
inmates who escaped in March were able to snag them. 
</P>
<P>
Four inmates from the March 7 escape remained at large Wednesday, as did two of 
seven inmates who fled Dec. 5 by breaking a window and squeezing through a 
narrow opening after greasing themselves with hand lotion. 
</P>
<P>
The county hired private security guards to watch the outside of the jail after 
the March escape, and new steel bars were installed on outside windows to 
prevent inmates from having tools lowered to them.

BILL REQUIRING REPORTING OF 'HATE CRIMES' OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress gave final approval Wednesday to legislation that for the first time 
would require the Justice Department to report the rising number of "hate 
crimes" against racial or religious minorities, homosexuals and other victims 
of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted, 402 to 18, for a Senate-passed bill that calls for the 
compilation of federal statistics on criminal acts -- including murder, 
assault, robbery and burglary -- that stem from bias based on race, religion, 
sexual orientation or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, including Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), said they 
objected to the legislation because it would put homosexuality on a par with 
race, religion and ethnicity as areas traditionally covered by civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who supported the measure, is expected to sign it into law and 
assure the publication of "hate crimes" as part of the annual Uniform Crime 
Reports for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The measure specifies, however, that the identity of crime victims must not be 
disclosed and restricts the use of the data for research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the bill said it would provide the basis for Congress to act later 
on legislation to curb outbreaks of anti-Semitism, gay-bashing and racially 
motivated attacks that are now not tabulated separately by police or 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't take the most effective action against hate crimes until we know more 
about them," said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), author of the Senate bill. "Now 
we'll begin to learn the level of poison in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.), chief House sponsor of the legislation, 
added in a statement that "reliable nationwide figures on these atrocities will 
isolate hate crimes and make their prosecution easier to achieve." The bill 
would provide the public and law enforcement agencies with the first reliable 
national information on hate-based crime as a separate category of offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Under current practice, crimes rooted in prejudice are lumped together with 
other murders, assaults, arson or incidents of vandalism.

<P>
"Hate crimes run the gamut from vandalism to package bombings," Simon noted, 
referring to bombs sent through the mail recently that killed a federal judge 
and a civil rights attorney in the South. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was backed by a broad cross-section of religious, labor and civil 
rights groups as well as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. In the 
Senate, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) pushed through an amendment that remained in 
the final version of the bill that would bar the use of funds to promote or 
encourage homosexuality.

PERES SAYS HE HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT TO FORM A NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT; 
</P>

<P>
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who has promised to take Israel into peace 
talks with Palestinians, said Wednesday that he has acquired enough 
parliamentary support to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the lawmaker or lawmakers who may have changed party loyalty 
and come to Peres' support was not made public. Since the Likud-Labor coalition 
government collapsed March 15, Peres has been trying to persuade Likud Party 
members to defect. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, speculating on the identity of one possible defector, said he would 
be given a police escort into the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, Peres sent a letter to President Chaim Herzog informing 
him that he will name a Cabinet and submit it for approval as soon as the 
Knesset can be convened. When that might be was not clear; many members have 
gone abroad on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the honor to inform you that I have succeeded in forming a government," 
Peres told Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Peres told reporters: "We have to accomplish a new government as soon as 
possible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is unthinkable that a democratic country would remain without a proper 
government, a legal government, a full government, for weeks and weeks when we 
are facing important waves of immigration, when we have security problems, 
economic problems and most of the ministries are without ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"I say we have a majority. I will say no more than that. Negotiations are not 
complete, and I hope there is a chance to broaden further support for the 
government I shall build." 
</P>
<P>
Peres said he hopes the Knesset will meet Sunday. He declined to name the 
members of his Cabinet but said his government will "move forward the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Likud leaders were reportedly shocked. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted 
by government television as saying that "we did everything to keep the 
government intact." 
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis erupted with the coalition's collapse, Shamir has headed a 
rump government in a caretaker role. When Labor pulled out, what had been a 
national unity government was left with only about half its Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Peres was given approval to form a new government, but he had not been able to 
line up the support of more than 60 of the Knesset's 120 members -- one short 
of a majority. Labor, a center-left party, has 39 seats of its own. Likud has 
40, and the rest are scattered across the political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
No one has said who it might have been that put Peres over the top, but 
attention focused on two breakaway members of Likud, Yitzhak Modai and Avraham 
Sharir. 
</P>
<P>
Likud, in a move that touched off a storm of public criticism, said it had $2.5 
million in pledges to keep defectors in the fold. According to government 
television, the money was to be donated by an unidentified Jewish-American 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The money was meant to ensure that Shamir would keep promises of Cabinet posts 
and high party posts for the two Likud members, according to news reports. In 
the event that he failed to keep his word, the money was to go to a new party 
headed by Modai and Sharir. 
</P>
<P>
Sharir is said to be keen on joining Peres. According to acquaintances, he 
holds a grudge against Shamir for denying him a Cabinet post in the last 
government and views his future in Likud as bleak. Sharir, who was minister of 
tourism in a previous coalition, refused to answer reporters' questions 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members said Peres is bluffing and has no majority. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe him," said Moshe Katzav, a Likud member and minister of 
transportation. "I don't trust him. He has no more than 60." 
</P>
<P>
Katzav said Modai was meeting with Shamir even as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Peres' announcement raised a number of questions besides the identity of his 
supporters. For one thing, leftist parties that had been expected to support 
him were apparently having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in his pocket," said Dedi Zucker, a member of the leftist Citizens 
Rights Movement. 
</P>
<P>
According to an unconfirmed report, Peres' announcement was a cover for an 
attempt to form a minority government. It was said that he would persuade a 
member of an unaligned religious party to sit out the Knesset vote, a maneuver 
that would give Peres a 60-59 plurality. 
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Rabin, the former defense minister and No. 2 in Labor, was 
uncharacteristically silent. Rabin, who resisted Peres' move to break up the 
coalition government, refused to talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
For Peres, heading a new government would constitute a dramatic recovery from 
the edge of obscurity. After failing to lead Labor to victory in the last 
elections, he joined the Shamir government as minister of finance. At the time, 
many analysts forecast his eventual ouster from party leadership and the end of 
a long career. 
</P>
<P>
But Peres, who was prime minister from 1984 to 1986, continued to take an 
active diplomatic role. He spearheaded Labor's insistence that Israel begin 
peace talks under a plan brokered by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III. When Shamir balked, Peres engineered a no-confidence vote in the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
During his term in the Finance Ministry, Peres courted religious parties with 
generous funding, and it paid off in one important instance: The ultra-Orthodox 
Agudat Israel party backed Peres in his quest for a majority, giving him an 
important edge. 
</P>
<P>
The horse-trading process is distasteful to many Israelis. A movement is afoot 
to reform the electoral system to reduce the role of minor parties. A small 
group of hunger strikers have camped out near the Knesset building, trying to 
persuade thousands of citizens to sign a petition asking for change.

BIGGEST E. GERMAN POLITICAL GROUPS AGREE ON COALITION;

<TEXT>
<P>
Ending days of uncertainty and indecision, the two largest two political 
groupings in East Germany's fledgling democracy agreed in principle Wednesday 
to join in a broad coalition that would take the country into reunification 
with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, between the Alliance for Germany and the Social Democrats, came 
on the eve of the opening session of East Germany's first freely elected 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
As talks on the shape of the coalition continued, it appeared likely that 
Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democratic leader, would be formally elected 
as prime minister. The Christian Democrats lead the Alliance for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This action would put Christian Democrats at the helm in both Germanys and 
likely smooth the way toward unity. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
campaigned vigorously for the Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on a coalition and the probable election of De Maiziere as prime 
minister, coupled with today's opening of the Parliament, are expected to ease 
a growing sense of public dismay that in many ways has made the first days of 
East German democracy more traumatic than the preceding decades of 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
An electorate that on March 18 voted with high expectations for swift 
unification with its rich western neighbor has looked on helplessly as scandal, 
controversy and confusion have cropped up one after another. Many people have 
worried that the darkening mood might poison the atmosphere while reunification 
is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Disputed West German claims to East German property, the uncertain future of 
millions of jobs in East Germany's uncompetitive industries, the continued 
destructive presence of the once-powerful East German security police -- all 
have spread uncertainty through the country while elected politicians have 
seemed unsure about how to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
Only after days of doubt did the Social Democrats finally agree Tuesday to 
enter into talks with the Christian Democrats on forming a broad-based 
coalition. If the talks progress swiftly, political analysts believe, De 
Maiziere may complete his Cabinet by the end of next week, when officials of 
both Germanys are scheduled to take a long Easter weekend holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of the conservative, three-party Alliance for Germany, which 
also includes the Social Union and Democratic Awakening, would give the new 
government the support of more than three-fourths of the 400 members of 
Parliament. This majority is regarded as vital for approving the constitutional 
changes required for reunification and for ensuring broad political support for 
those changes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the larger parties, only the Communists, who now call themselves Democratic 
Socialists, are not involved in the coalition talks. 
</P>
<P>
The East German people, already unsettled by two weeks of political drift, were 
angered and upset late last week by reports that the West German Bundesbank had 
recommended a currency union that would call for exchanging East German marks 
for West German marks at a rate of 2 for 1. East Germans had expected an 
exchange rate of 1 for 1. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the East Germans have been forced to stand by while West Germans 
debated a question that will affect their wage levels and personal savings has 
added to the overall sense of frustration and resentment. Trade union leaders 
and political groups have called for nationwide protests today against the 
Bundesbank plan. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the reaction has led Chancellor Kohl to make it emphatically 
clear that the Bundesbank report is only a recommendation. On Wednesday, Hans 
Klein, a spokesman for the Kohl government, took pains to point out that no 
decision will be made until after the new East German government is consulted. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Eppelmann, the leader of East Germany's small Social Union party, 
expressed concern about the deteriorating situation. He cautioned Tuesday that 
reunification must take place in such a way that "Germans in both parts of 
Germany can look each other in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, East Germans were hit by another shock -- the abrupt resignation of 
the second party leader in four weeks on charges of being involved with the old 
Communist security police, the so-called Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Ibrahim Boehme, leader of the Social Democrats, raised further 
questions about the credibility of all the newly elected members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"Who will be the next to resign?" an editorial asked in Tuesday's issue of the 
Berliner Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schnur, leader of the small Democratic Awakening, was forced to resign 
a few days before the election after admitting that he had been a Stasi 
informer. 
</P>
<P>
The West German magazine Stern says in the issue that will appear today that 
Schnur worked for the Stasi as recently as late last year, even after his 
election as the leader of Democratic Awakening, then an opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
For both Boehme and Schnur, as for the country, it was more than just a 
resignation. Schnur is believed to have suffered a nervous breakdown, and party 
colleagues said that Boehme was hospitalized briefly last Friday after spending 
eight hours reviewing his files at Stasi headquarters in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party sources denied a report in the leading West German 
daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, that Boehme had attempted suicide. 
Diplomats in East Berlin also dismissed the report as false. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Schnur, Boehme admitted no guilt. He apparently resigned because he was 
unable to clear himself completely of allegations that he had been a Stasi 
informer. The accusation, made by an anonymous former Stasi agent, appeared 
last week in the West German weekly Der Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
Boehme's review of his file at Stasi headquarters turned up no incriminating 
evidence, but it found references to an additional file, which is missing. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that one of the country's most popular elected leaders has been 
brought down by anonymous, unproved accusations is one more reminder of the 
lingering destructive power of the security police in the emerging democracy. 
</P>
<P>
That Boehme's personal and professional standing could be effectively destroyed 
by such accusations has added to the general sense of disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Communists have been completely free of Stasi-related 
accusations.

BONN OFFICIAL AGREES U.S. MUST PLAY ROLE IN EUROPE

<TEXT>
<P>
West Germany's foreign minister Wednesday endorsed a Bush Administration 
proposal to assure continued U.S. influence in a post-Cold War Europe, even 
though America's military power may be overshadowed by the economic might of 
the 12-nation European Community. 
</P>
<P>
After meetings with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called for a new transatlantic 
partnership between Washington and Europe after the Common Market completes its 
scheduled political and economic integration next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We should try to get a declaration defining the common objectives, the common 
tasks and challenges of the European Community and the United States," Genscher 
told reporters at the White House. Later, he told a press conference that 
U.S.-EC cooperation would strengthen the worldwide influence of the democracies 
on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last December, Baker said the United States is determined to 
continue to play a role in European affairs even if changing circumstances 
diminish the importance of U.S. military power. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should evolve from a 
primarily military alliance to a political grouping. And he called for regular 
cooperation between the United States and the European Community. Genscher 
supported both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher also said that the foreign ministers of West and East Germany, the 
United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union will probably meet before 
the end of the month to discuss German reunification. This meeting, dubbed the 
two-plus-four talks, brings together the two German states and the four Allied 
victors of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany and the United States want a unified Germany to be a member of 
NATO, while the Soviet Union has said that the country should be independent of 
any military bloc. But at his press conference, Genscher expressed optimism 
that Moscow would eventually agree to German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"A neutral Germany would increase instability," he said. "It would introduce a 
degree of unpredictability in Germany and in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "opinion in the Soviet Union has not been finalized," while 
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have expressed support for German membership 
in NATO, something that "will affect the opinion of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher added that the Soviet Union "is no longer an aggressive country." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "do not consider the 
country of the other to be a threat. We think this is a realistic assessment." 
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Genscher said, the plan to modernize and upgrade 
NATO's short-range nuclear arsenal is dead. The plan was once the subject of 
heated controversy between West Germany, which opposed it, and the United 
States and most other NATO members, who favored it. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the modernization proposal, Genscher said: "That is an issue 
of the past. We should only discuss matters of the future."

DEEP SCARS LEFT BY SENEGAL'S CONFLICT WITH NEIGHBORING MAURITANIA; 
</P>
<P>
WEST AFRICA: NEW SHOPKEEPERS TAKE OVER IN DAKAR. BUT THE IMPACT IS DEVASTATING 
ALONG THE FRONTIER RIVER.

DAKAR, Senegal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soap, sugar, milk -- any staple a family might need -- is ranged on the shelves 
around Ngaido Ba in the cramped shop he runs on a corner of one of Dakar's 
oldest quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Ba took over the shop just a few months ago after its previous occupants, a 
Mauritanian family, fled during a wave of attacks last April on thousands of 
their countrymen living in the Senegalese capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything here," Ba remarked to a recent visitor, "just like before, 
when the Mauritanians were here." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles away, in the tiny village of Ngaoule on the Senegal River, 
the undeclared war between Mauritania and Senegal looks a little different. 
</P>
<P>
One evening in January, a stray rifle shot from the Mauritanian side of the 
river punctured the pirogue from which villager Mamadou Mberry Sarr was fishing 
and killed him. When the village chief remonstrated with the local army 
commander, he was asked, "Why did you let the man go out?" 
</P>
<P>
There was no choice, the chief replied. With the farmland and pasture they were 
accustomed to using on the Mauritanian side now out of bounds, the need to coax 
a living out of the river is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
In the cities, where Mauritanian shopkeepers once controlled as much as 80% of 
the retail market for consumer goods, the worst fears of the Senegalese about 
the economic impact of the loss of their shopkeepers have proved unfounded. The 
stores vacated by fleeing Mauritanians were quickly rented to Syrians, Lebanese 
and Senegalese, like Ba. 
</P>
<P>
The Mauritanians had operated an unusual credit system for their customers, who 
would deposit their monthly salary not in a bank but with a shopkeeper, then 
buy down the balance with daily purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The new shopkeepers have yet to build up the level of trust that would enable 
them to do business in this way, but there have been few other dislocations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very afraid of shortages," one Dakar professional said. "I sent a lot 
of supplies to my mother, just in case. But nothing happened. According to 
official accounts, there are more shops now than before." 
</P>
<P>
But the conflict has had a devastating impact along the 500-mile stretch of the 
Senegal River that separates the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Mass deportations and the border closure struck directly at people who lived in 
one country and pastured their herds in the other. They lost thousands of head 
of cattle, and farmers were cut off from their fields. All now live in fear of 
the occasional outbreak of military gunfire from bank to bank. 
</P>
<P>
Several villages have been leveled by what the Senegalese say are unprovoked 
artillery assaults from the Mauritanian side. Every month brings reports of 
civilians, including children, killed by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone tells us that Senegal doesn't want war," a village chief told a local 
magazine. "But all that's happening -- isn't that war?" 
</P>
<P>
The year-old conflict underscores the costly fragility of border relationships 
throughout Africa. Senegal may be one of the continent's most peaceful lands, 
but with the rupture of relations with Mauritania, it is at odds with three of 
its four neighbors: A 12-year-old conflict with Guinea-Bissau over fishing 
rights has erupted again in recriminations, and a 1982 agreement on political 
and economic confederation with Gambia, the snake-shaped river country that 
bisects Senegal, has been dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the fishing industries of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau are 
stalemated, and Senegal has all but closed the commercially busy border with 
Gambia, provoking power outages, food shortages and unemployment in Gambia and 
costing Senegalese truck drivers and shippers millions of dollars in lost 
consignments. 
</P>
<P>
Relations with the fourth neighbor, Mali, have also been strained by the 
Mauritanian conflict. Senegal recently complained about Malian workers flooding 
into Mauritania to take over the jobs given up by expelled Senegalese. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the rupture with Mauritania is viewed as the most serious -- and not 
only here. The violent dispute between the two largely Muslim countries 
threatens to mar one of the Islamic world's major showcases: the summit meeting 
next January in Dakar of the 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that the summit meeting takes place in a country of 
black Africa. The meeting is designed to underscore the strength of Islam in 
this region. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs here that more than just political ties have been damaged. 
Many people lament the severing of cultural and historic bonds. Islam reached 
Senegal through Mauritania, and many of the country's earliest religious 
leaders were either Mauritanian or educated in Mauritania. Among Africans in 
both countries, ethnic distinctions were blurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We were closer to Mauritania than to any other country," Babacar Toure, owner 
of the weekly Senegalese magazine Sud-Hebdo, said in a recent interview. "We 
mixed with them -- who is a Senegalese without Mauritanian blood? I saw it as 
my second homeland. In this newsroom, people cried." 
</P>
<P>
In the region of the fleuve, as the river is known, there was so little 
political distinction between villagers that ferry and boat passage was 
unrestricted. When the two countries jointly built a dam across the river at 
Diama, near its Atlantic outlet, the pathway over the dam had no immigration or 
customs authorities at either end. 
</P>
<P>
In part, this freedom was a product of economic necessity. There were herdsmen 
and farmers on both sides who could not reach their land from their homes 
without crossing the border. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the incident that provoked last year's violence was a product of 
that liberty and cooperative spirit. Senegal, Mauritania and Mali have long had 
a tripartite program to develop both riverbanks, the only land in the arid 
regions of all three with any potential for agricultural development. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years the program has improved irrigation in the area, turning 
desert-like tracts into highly productive rice paddies. In Mauritania, this 
intensified a racial tension that had never been far below the surface. The 
country is run politically and controlled economically by its white Berber 
elite, who look down on their black African countrymen. An attempt by Berbers 
to displace blacks occupying the southern region eventually provoked a violent 
confrontation between a handful of Senegalese and Mauritanians over an island 
in the middle of the river. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute should have been localized and minor, many say in both capitals. 
But when word reached major Senegalese cities, it galvanized into mobs the 
idlers and unemployed who have gravitated to places like Dakar. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, the Mauritanians were taking things out on Senegalese laborers 
in their country. There, however, the violence fed on racial tension. Black 
Africans carrying legitimate Mauritanian papers were accused of acquiring them 
fraudulently and deported -- if they were not attacked and butchered first. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, tens of thousands of both countries' citizens were forcibly 
repatriated to homelands that many had not seen in decades. Many now have new 
jobs, and they say that not even a political settlement will restore their old 
life.

King Baudouin, a devout Roman Catholic, stepped down temporarily Wednesday 
rather than sign into law a bill ending Belgium's 123-year ban on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
After relieving the king as head of state, the government enacted the abortion 
bill and asked Parliament to restore him as monarch at a special session today. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual move, made at the 59-year-old king's request, let the government 
enact legislation to allow abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and 
relieved the king of his constitutional duty to sign into law a bill he 
strongly opposes. Parliament adopted the bill last week. 
</P>
<P>
The king's powers are largely ceremonial. He has no real legislative powers, 
but under the constitution, he signs all the bills into law. In practice, the 
king also plays an active role behind the scenes. He has repeatedly acted to 
defuse disputes between Dutch- and French-speaking political parties, which 
often are locked in linguistic disputes.

FDA PLANS TO BOLSTER ASPIRIN LABEL WARNING; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: WOMEN WILL BE URGED AGAINST USE DURING THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 
PREGNANCY. THE INTENT IS TO AVOID HARM TO THE FETUS OR DELIVERY COMPLICATIONS.

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration soon will require labels on all 
over-the-counter aspirin products warning pregnant women not to take such drugs 
in the final trimester without a physician's specific order, according to 
acting FDA Commissioner James S. Benson. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory agency hopes to impose the warning, designed to avoid harming a 
fetus or delivery complications, "in the next several months," Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
His surprise announcement came in a March 29 letter to California health 
officials in Sacramento, where a copy was made available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, aspirin products carry only a general warning used on all orally 
taken, over-the-counter drugs. That warning, required since 1982, advises 
pregnant women not to ingest such medications without a physician's approval. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed language of the impending warning is: 
</P>
<P>
"It is especially important not to use aspirin during the last 3 months of 
pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by your doctor because it may 
cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery." 
</P>
<P>
The wording is identical to that now required for several other classes of 
over-the-counter painkillers, known as ibuprofen products. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a concern, though not a hell of a lot of data," about aspirin's 
possible harmful effects during the final trimester, one FDA official said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the FDA has been considering a warning requirement for 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's letter to Thomas E. Warriner, undersecretary of the California Health 
and Welfare Agency, came just as state officials in Sacramento were preparing 
to require precisely such a warning for over-the-counter aspirin products. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's panel of scientific advisers is expected to take such 
action on Friday, under the authority of Proposition 65, the anti-toxics law 
approved by California voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to Benson, aspirin manufacturers would be given a year to begin 
labeling their products with the new warning. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin industry leaders, who were en route to California for Friday's 
Proposition 65 meeting, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin has been studied extensively for its intended and unintended health 
effects. But the results have been mixed and often contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, a study published in the authoritative New England Journal of 
Medicine reported last August that low doses of aspirin in late pregnancy can 
prevent a potentially fatal form of high blood pressure among pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The study's authors noted that their tests involved the ingestion of only 60 to 
100 milligrams -- far less than the usual adult dose. 
</P>
<P>
Another recent study found that regular doses of aspirin can cut in half a 
person's risk of stroke from an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Still another concluded that an aspirin every other day can cut the risk of 
heart attack in half for men over age 50 and confer even greater benefits to 
those at the highest risk of heart attacks because of smoking, high cholesterol 
levels or diabetes. 
</P>

GUIDELINES AWAITED ON INSURANCE PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: FOUR MONTHS OF HEARINGS ARE DRAWING TO AN END. UNCERTAINTY OVER 
RATES HAS LEFT CONSUMER GROUPS AND COMPANIES TRADING ACRIMONIOUS CHARGES.

<TEXT>
<P>
More than four months of state Insurance Department hearings into what 
constitutes a "fair rate of return" for insurance companies are coming to a 
close here this week in an atmosphere of recrimination and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the hearings are expected to come, by the end of the month, a set of 
profit guidelines to be recommended by Administrative Hearing Judge William 
Fernandez to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. Once reviewed and perhaps 
changed by Gillespie, these will be issued as standards for state approval of 
future auto, homeowners and various other insurance rates in the state. 
</P>
<P>
These standards also would be used for determining what, if any, rate rollbacks 
and premium rebates Gillespie may finally order pursuant to provisions of 
Proposition 103. The rollbacks have been delayed for 17 months already while 
the standards were debated and litigated. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Gillespie and the Insurance Department staff have been suggesting 
at the hearings that a fair rate of annual return for the companies should 
range, depending on circumstances, from 11.2% to 15%. The companies, by 
contrast, have been arguing for a 16% to 21% annual rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
There are a host of subsidiary issues, such as which company expenses, like 
political contributions, might be disallowed in making the calculations, and 
whether the profits should be in each line of insurance, or averaged out among 
all lines each company sells. 
</P>
<P>
The recriminations have come mainly from representatives of consumer 
organizations who charge that the hearings have been unbalanced in favor of the 
industry. They noted that many of their requests for data on company finances 
and sales practices were rejected by the hearing judge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the uncertainty has come from insurers over what conclusions 
Gillespie may reach, and what the consequences of her decisions might be. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that if Gillespie sets profit guidelines far below what 
the companies think they should be, the companies will sue to prevent her 
standards from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the result of these hearings -- which have cost the companies, and 
indirectly their California ratepayers, millions of dollars -- may be a new 
round of the litigation that has so far stymied all efforts to implement 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
There also are questions of whether the elected insurance commissioner, who 
will take office in January, may want to set his own standards, and whether the 
work done at the hearings and the conclusions reached by Gillespie will be 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they felt the hearings will prove to have been useful, various 
parties were cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Keller, an attorney for Travelers and other companies, said, "I would hope 
we're getting near the end" in setting standards for the state's new system of 
approving rates. But on the rollbacks, he said, "individual companies that are 
ordered to refund millions of dollars probably will go to court." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Gnaizda of Public Advocates Inc., representing a coalition of minority 
and low-income groups, asserted that the hearings will prove to be a waste of 
time, unless Gillespie disregards Judge Fernandez's recommendations and strikes 
out on her own to develop a more pro-consumer tack than the hearings took. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer groups directly represented -- Latino Issues Forum, Voter Revolt 
and the Consumers Union in particular -- are in a sour mood because the 
compensation from insurers for consumer attorney expenses that they had been 
promised by Gillespie at the start of the hearings has not been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the big companies have refused to pay it, and the issue of financing a 
consumer presence at the hearing is being litigated. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, one consumer representative after another rose to support motions 
charging that Fernandez had been biased against them and the minority and 
low-income groups and asking that evidence and arguments from companies that 
had refused to compensate the consumer attorneys for their efforts be ignored 
in the conclusions that are reached. Particular anger was expressed that the 
judge had refused to admit evidence on "redlining" against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
After the consumer attorneys had spoken, and insurer attorneys had rebutted 
them, Fernandez angrily left the bench without his coat, rolled up his shirt 
sleeves and, striding to the desks occupied by the consumer representatives, 
castigated them. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he is descended from several minority groups himself, the 
judge said he could not tolerate such unfair accusations. He said he 
sympathizes with the plight of minority members who are charged a great deal 
for insurance or unable to buy it. But he said that as a judge he will follow 
the law when he makes his recommendations.

ESCAPED KILLER, GUARD CAPTURED IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An escape from the California Institution for Women in Frontera has ended in El 
Paso, Tex., with the capture of Jeanette Lynn Hughes, a convicted Huntington 
Beach murderer, and the guard who allegedly helped her flee from the 
maximum-security prison 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who was serving a sentence of 25 years to life for the 1984 murder of 
her husband in their Huntington Beach home, and prison guard Cyndi Marie 
Coglietti were captured Tuesday night by federal agents and local police at the 
El Paso International Airport. They were not armed. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes and Coglietti had reservations for a flight to Denver after having 
stopped for several days in Las Vegas and Phoenix, federal agents said. Prison 
officials said they believe that Hughes, 36, and Coglietti, 26, were planning 
to meet a passenger at the El Paso airport to receive some cash. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes and Coglietti, a five-year corrections officer who was assigned to keep 
special watch on the inmate as a high risk to escape, were being held at an El 
Paso jail Wednesday. Extradition proceedings to California were pending. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they had received a tip that Hughes had relatives in the El 
Paso area and that she and Coglietti might be there. They also credited Hughes' 
family with helping in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials said the capture put an end to the speculation that Coglietti 
had been kidnaped, a theory that they had previously refused to rule out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pretty thing to see one of your fellow (staff members) fall victim 
to a manipulative inmate," said Ross Dykes, the associate warden at the 
2,500-inmate Frontera prison. "The information we have is kind of damning." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes had tried to saw through her cell bars and made other elaborate escape 
plans before being caught in 1987, prison officials said. As a result, she was 
put in a high-security unit that required personal escorts to and from 
virtually all activities. Coglietti was one of the corrections officers 
assigned to Hughes' unit. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officers in those situations are trained to develop "a close 
relationship with the inmates, keep an eye on them and what they're up to" and 
try to gain access to inmate informants, Dykes said. But in the case of Hughes, 
he added, Coglietti apparently "crossed the line."

Guards at Graterford State Prison have sued the state, claiming they are 
endangered by overcrowding in the nation's fifth largest prison. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Commonwealth Court, asks the court to order the 
state to reduce the prison's population to "safer, more manageable levels." 
</P>
<P>
It also asks for improvements in the prison's sewage, water and electrical 
facilities.

The lawsuit is believed to be the nation's first by prison guards seeking to 
relieve prison crowding, said Michael Fox, of Council 13 of the American

The maximum-security prison northwest of Philadelphia has a capacity of 2,734 
inmates. It held 4,212 inmates on Tuesday, including 510 serving life sentences

A PASTOR'S $20-MILLION LAST HURRAH; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSFORMATION: THE PUSH IS ON TO INCREASE MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OF THE LARGEST 
PROTESTANT CHURCHES IN LOS ANGELES, AS IT RELOCATES TO CHATSWORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jess Moody slumped in his chair, his usually upbeat demeanor 
momentarily dragged down by the strain that goes with trying to set new roots 
for a congregation that, until last year, had stayed put for nearly four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Membership is dramatically down and it's no small task to establish a new 
identity for his congregation -- even for one that once was among the largest 
Protestant churches in Los Angeles -- now that it has changed its name from 
First Baptist Church of Van Nuys to Shepherd of the Hills, he allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, construction of a planned new church complex in Chatsworth is nearly 
a year behind schedule and the man he thought might one day succeed him as 
pastor has stepped aside, a victim of burnout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a precarious time in the church's history," Moody said, a certain 
weariness evident in his voice. "You know, this is probably my last hurrah. I'm 
64 years old and I'm trying to make it happen one more time." 
</P>
<P>
Moody, however, is not one to dwell on the negative. Without missing a beat, 
the Texas-born pastor with a penchant for building large churches sat upright, 
and in a voice turned strong, launched into a discourse on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," he said, pointing to a large aerial photograph of the west San 
Fernando Valley that graces a lobby wall outside his church office. "A million 
people live west of the 405. That's two Fort Worths! 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me we've got the best site for a new church in all of Los Angeles, 
maybe even in America." 
</P>
<P>
Moving a long established congregation is hard enough. Long-time members tend 
to be upset by the move and many can be counted on to drop out, noted C. Peter 
Wagner, a church growth specialist at Pasadena's Fuller Theological Seminary. 
At Shepherd of the Hills, membership has dropped by almost 3,000 while Moody 
tried to move the congregation over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Moody's move doubly difficult is the emphasis on reaching the 
"unchurched" that Shepherd of the Hills has claimed as its mission. Rather than 
trying to lure new members from existing West Valley churches or limiting 
himself to keeping his old congregation intact, the people Moody said he wants 
are the ones who profess to have no interest in going to church. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for people who don't have a Bible in their homes or any time for 
it," Moody said with characteristic flair. "But it ain't my style to go around 
with halitosis breath grabbing people. If we create interest, people will 
come." 
</P>
<P>
The site Moody has bet his congregation's future on is a 14-acre plot boasting 
a third of a mile of Simi Valley Freeway frontage between Corbin and Winnetka 
avenues adjacent to the massive Porter Ranch development. Grading is under way 
and Moody hopes that the first phase of the $20-million relocation project will 
be completed by late fall. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, though, Shepherd of the Hills' home is 17,500 square feet 
of space in two Chatsworth industrial buildings across the street from each 
other and about three miles from the freeway site. Since January, Sunday 
services have been conducted at nearby Chatsworth High School or at the Mason 
Park Recreation Center. An outdoor service is, however, planned for the new 
site on Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
When Moody describes the plans for the new church complex, the one-time college 
radio sports announcer sounds almost as if he is describing a country club. The 
first building to be constructed will be a $6-million, 65,000-square-foot 
structure that will contain a 1,900-seat auditorium and several classrooms and 
offices, plus a full-scale health club open to non-church members as well, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for later construction of a half-mile jogging trail complete 
with a par exercise course, a 400-seat theater for cultural events and 
lectures, and a 3,100-seat sanctuary in a building with a wrap-around wooden 
deck, adjacent man-made lake and indoor and outdoor baptisterys. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to have a "universalist appeal," not a single cross, 
Christianity's principal symbol, is planned for any of the building exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
And everything, Moody insisted, will have "a Connecticut farmhouse-feel to it," 
even down to the proverbial white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to avoid traditional symbols that may turn some people off," he 
said. "What we will have will say to people that we're relaxed about life. 
Today, we have too many churches that are against everything, including 
breathing. The people on the outside hate them." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting "church outsiders" has long been Moody's focus. After earning a 
doctorate in theology, he served as pastor of a Southern Baptist church in 
Owensboro, Ky., then moved on to another in West Palm Beach, Fla. It was there 
that he first made his mark. 
</P>
<P>
Under his direction, the church grew to 6,000 members. He founded Palm Beach 
Atlantic College, created a 25-station church television network and became a 
nationally known church figure. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the network fell more than $300,000 into debt, a debt 
that was assumed by First Baptist Church of Van Nuys after Moody arrived in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
First Baptist, which began congregational life in a railroad car in 1914, was, 
in its heyday, the preeminent Valley religious institution. Over the years, it 
spawned a host of other local churches. 
</P>
<P>
The church relocated to 14800 Sherman Way in the early 1950s, and under the 
leadership of the Rev. Harold L. Fickett Jr., became a 12,000-member 
mega-church. Fickett resigned in 1975 to assume the presidency of a Christian 
college back East. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the beginning, Moody was in and out of hot water with some members 
of his congregation over his attempts to reorganize church administrative 
procedures and his desire to affiliate the then-independent church with the 
Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 dissidents broke away and organized Chatsworth's Faith Evangelical 
Church, which Fickett later returned to the Valley to pastor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. David W. Miller, Faith Evangelical's current pastor, noted a "certain 
irony" in Shepherd of the Hills also relocating in Chatsworth, but he said he 
welcomes the move. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a half-million unchurched people within 30 minutes of here. There's 
plenty of room for a whole lot of churches," said Miller, whose church now 
attracts about 2,000 worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Moody has gotten his share of negative publicity. In 1985, he 
admitted losing $40,000 in an investment scheme perpetrated by a former church 
member. Hundreds of other investors, including many from First Baptist and 
Faith Evangelical, also were victimized. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, while trying to secure a new church site, Moody publicly 
stated that it was "God's will" that his congregation move to the "promised 
land" of the West Valley to keep that area "from Satan's grip." 
</P>
<P>
Moody later said his use of "church language" had been misunderstood. 
Nonetheless, his remarks gave Monteria Estates homeowners an additional edge in 
their eventually successful fight to keep First Baptist from relocating on 12.5 
acres adjacent to the exclusive Chatsworth neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A decade of struggle to relocate First Baptist appeared at an end when the 
freeway frontage site was acquired and First Foursquare Church of Van Nuys 
agreed to purchase First Baptist's 10-acre Sherman Way property for $11 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But then First Foursquare scuttled the agreement and an attempt to sell the 
land to a commercial developer also fell through. First Foursquare eventually 
re-entered the picture, but it cost First Baptist $1 million more to vacate the 
property than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, delays resulting from having to meet a host of city 
requirements snowballed at the new church site, postponing the planned move-in 
date from late 1989 to late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
All of this took its toll on the Rev. Jim Rives, Moody's right-hand man and the 
church's business manager. At 48, Rives has quit the ministry to enter real 
estate sales and political fund-raising, although he remains a paid consultant 
to Moody and a member of the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of thought Jim would some day take my place," Moody said. "But he's 
changed his tune." 
</P>
<P>
Rives said, "my job was to take the heat on everything involved with the move 
so Jess could remain the pastor. But it started to affect my attitude. I burned 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The move has also taken its toll on membership. Rives said "several hundred" 
congregants have left the church, which Moody admitted is down to "7,500 names 
on the membership roll," a great percentage of whom never attend services. 
</P>
<P>
With membership off, so is church income. "It's a little down, but we're not 
breaking our hearts over it. . . . We have plenty of money. It's just in the 
members' pockets," Moody said. "We have 1,750 people who are regular givers to 
the church. Perhaps 800 tithe 10% of their income," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Jauregui, a 20-year church member who chairs Shepherd of the Hill's board 
of trustees, also insisted that church finances and membership remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord has given us a good, solid base. Plus, new people are starting to 
show up at services. For a church in transition, that's very good," said the 
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Corp. executive. 
</P>
<P>
However, Herb Hollinger, editor of the California Southern Baptist, the 
denomination's state newspaper, noted that "Jess seems real weary. He's had to 
fight a lot of battles and he's getting tired. They may not have been ready for 
the magnitude of this adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hollinger expressed confidence that Moody's latest gamble will pay off. 
Wagner, the church growth expert, added that demographically speaking at least, 
Moody's plans for Shepherd of the Hills make good sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Churches, like everything else, are in the marketing business as well," Wagner 
said. "As American culture changes, the churches that fare best are the ones 
that change with the culture." 
</P>
<P>
Moody, Wagner said, is merely following a course pioneered by the Rev. Robert 
Schuller, pastor of Garden Grove's highly successful Crystal Cathedral, whose 
appeal to suburban baby boomers has garnered him a 10,000-member congregation 
and an international reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the baby boomers, young parents in their mid-20s to 40s who respond best 
to this style of ministry. Affluent, suburban areas like the West Valley are 
full of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner also noted it was common for "old-timers" to leave in such circumstances 
for more traditional churches. "That's OK. That's just how churches evolve," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd of the Hills remains affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, 
the nation's largest Protestant denomination, but one that has been racked with 
bitter in-fighting in recent years between fundamentalists and moderates. Both 
factions generally consider the Bible to be the inerrant word of God; however 
the moderates, with whom Moody has been aligned, tend to be more accepting of 
limited dissent and are socially more liberal. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no hint of this denominational affiliation in the congregation's 
new name. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wyatt, the Fresno-based spokesman for the California Southern Baptist 
Convention, noted that "a number" of newer Southern Baptist congregations 
around the state have opted not to include the denomination's name in their 
congregational name "for strategic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Doing so, he added, "eliminates one more reason for someone to avoid the 
congregation. A lot of people don't want to affiliate with a particular 
congregation." 
</P>
<P>
"In California, the name 'Baptist' is a negative. It conjures up images of 
Jerry Falwell," Wagner added. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moody insisted that the Valley's changing demographics and church 
scene left him no alternative but to move to Chatsworth. More than half of 
First Baptist's existing congregation -- most of them white and middle class or 
upper middle class -- had already moved to the West Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the central Valley he was forced to compete for members with both 
Van Nuys First Foursquare and Sun Valley's Grace Community Church, two 
fast-growing but decidedly more conservative congregations. 
</P>
<P>
"Just give us a few years," Moody insisted, smiling. "You'll see. We're going 
to be the church of the 21st Century in the West Valley." 
</P>

NEWSPAPER COLLECTOR GETS HISTORY FIRSTHAND

<P>
George Washington is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly front-page news? 
</P>
<P>
To John Eplett, it is. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett read all about it on the front page of the Dec. 25 edition of the 
Columbian (Mass.) Centinel. But the news cost him more than a quarter. Eplett 
paid $300 for the paper, which was printed in 1799. 
</P>
<P>
To some, Washington's death is just old news. But to Eplett, who collects old 
newspapers, it's history. 
</P>
<P>
"The legacy of the father of his country," Eplett reads aloud from the paper, 
which is bordered by a black line in memory of the President. "Washington is no 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Eplett has read the article dozens of times, but he's still incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe they were already calling him the father of our country -- 
less than two weeks after he died?" 
</P>
<P>
Eplett, who lives in Van Nuys, owns more than 500 historical papers, mostly 
from the 18th and 19th centuries. His collection chronicles the murder trial of 
Jesse James, Custer's last stand, the capture of Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis and the sinking of the Titanic. It also provides insight into 
the everyday concerns of early Americans, including bad breath and hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't miss a thing," says Eplett, 54, who uses a magnifying glass to read 
the early papers, which are printed in very small type. "I read every single 
word, including the advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper collectors are as rare as many of the papers themselves. There are 
only a few hundred serious collectors in the country and only a handful in Los 
Angeles. "People don't like the bulk," says Richard Robinson, a collector from 
West Los Angeles, whose several thousand newspapers are stored in acid-free 
plastic envelopes in several locations. "It's not like stamps or coins, where 
you can have an entire collection in a few drawers." 
</P>
<P>
But collectors say it's a lot more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Eplett sold his entire gold and silver coin collection worth about 
$60,000 to buy newspapers. "I thought coins were interesting," he says, "but 
they don't hold a candle to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett admits that at first he was just trying to make money selling the 
papers. "But then I realized I was dealing with American history," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, he's looking for organizations interested in displaying his 
collection, so others can share in the thrill of reading history firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is considering showing the 
collection at its museum in Whittier, according to Sheriff's Sgt. Linda 
Edmunds. Eplett is lucky he turned out to be a history buff because, as far as 
making money, he might have sunk like the Titanic. There's just not a great 
demand for old newspapers, and most are worth only a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The rarest ones, however, command a few thousand, and newspaper collectors can 
compete as fiercely as rival reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of viciousness that goes on," says Charles Nemzer, a collector 
from Beverly Hills, whose newspapers span 1717 to 1865. "People would cut their 
arms off to get some papers." 
</P>
<P>
The most sought-after papers are those about President Lincoln's death. "It's 
still just like he died yesterday," says Nemzer, who owns one printed the night 
before Lincoln was shot, announcing that the President would be attending 
Ford's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett buys his papers from dealers, university archives, private collectors 
and newspaper libraries. He says he has spent about $60,000 and estimates that 
his collection is worth more than $400,000 retail. But other collectors say 
that's an exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
The value of a newspaper, collectors say, depends on its condition, the 
importance of the event reported, the rarity of the paper and how soon after an 
event the article appeared. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Eplett says, the ultimate newspaper reporting the death of John 
F. Kennedy would be one published in Dallas on the same day. Similarly, 
although the Dec. 25 paper lamenting Washington's death is valuable, Eplett 
could get more for one published closer to Washington's death, which occurred 
Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett's most valuable paper is one published before the event -- the Chicago 
Daily Tribune's embarrassing blunder of Nov. 3, 1948, when a banner headline 
proclaimed, "Dewey Defeats Truman." 
</P>
<P>
The paper, free of brown spots and tears, is worth more than $3,000, Eplett 
says. But Nemzer and Robinson say it's worth only $400. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Eplett's early papers are in top-notch condition because, until the 
Civil War, newspapers were made of rags and linen instead of wood pulp. "They 
don't get brittle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett says he gets as big a thrill reading the advertisements as he does the 
articles -- particularly the ads for cure-all medicines, which dominated papers 
of the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"How many suffer torture day after day, making life a burden and robbing 
existence of all pleasure owing to the secret suffering of piles?" says an ad 
for Simmon's Liver Regulator in the 1876 Denison (Tex.) Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
The medicine, according to the ads, was intended to cure ailments such as bad 
breath, constipation and headaches. "Do not neglect so sure a remedy for these 
repulsive disorders," the ad warns. 
</P>
<P>
Eplett also owns a newspaper with an ad for Dr. John Greenwood, the dentist who 
made Washington's false teeth, and another with an ad for Lincoln's law office. 
</P>
<P>
Although references to famous people excite Eplett, he says he learns more 
about American culture and mores from incidents involving ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
An 1876 Denison paper, for instance, reports: "Mrs. Russell Outraged by a Negro 
Fiend." 
</P>
<P>
"Verily, it never rains but it pours," the article begins. "This morning, while 
at home attending her household duties, Mrs. Russell was attacked and ravished 
by a Negro. Would-be rescuers were too late, however. This fiendish villain had 
accomplished his hellish design." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers with articles about ordinary people aren't worth much, but, Eplett 
said, to him the firsthand accounts are a priceless look at the culture and 
attitudes of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things," he says, "that you just don't read about in books or see in 
the movies."

Portrait of a Full Life 
</P>
<P>
You think you're busy. At 84, Sam Tash of Northridge still has more to do than 
he has time for. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got lots of painting to do," he said with a shake of his head. Tash 
paints life-size portraits from snapshots for family, friends and friends of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"When I paint a portrait, it looks just like the people," he said. His fee? "I 
ask them to make a $25 donation to the Wilkinson Senior Center." 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge facility, operated by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks 
Department, is a past recipient of Tash's artistic generosity. Three years ago, 
he donated a 4-by-8-foot painting to the center, which shows senior citizens 
engaged in some of its many activities, such as bingo, ballroom dancing, 
billiards, painting, crocheting and card-playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire that mural every day and I've been coming here for four years," said 
Satch Fleming, 83, of Northridge. "It's a real work of art." 
</P>
<P>
So how many paintings does Tash, a former orchestra leader, finish in a month? 
"It depends on how ambitious I feel," he said with a laugh. And on how much 
time he's spent playing his violin instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Controversy 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups in Encino and Tarzana are dealing with a very 
Beverly-Hills-ish problem: tear-downs. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers buy a piece of property, take down a one-story ranch-style home and 
put up a two-story house that they take to either side of the lot lines," said 
Joel Palmer, president of the board of directors for Tarzana Property Owners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a loss of privacy for the neighbors because now they have a huge 
house looking down into their yard. These new houses are simply too big for the 
lots and they're changing the character of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith, past president of Encino Property Owners Assn., pointed out 
another problem plaguing neighborhoods. "There are a number of one- and 
two-acre lots in this area, and they're being bought up and then subdivided 
into as many as four to six lots," Smith said. As Palmer elaborated, "It 
creates a density problem." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit group Homeowners of Encino regularly receives notices from the 
city's planning department regarding lot splits. "We used to get one every six 
weeks, and now we get two a week," said Gerald A. Silver, the group's 
president. "The neighborhood is getting chopped up into postage-stamp sized 
lots." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of the situation have pitted neighbor against neighbor. "It's 
creating a near-warlike environment between homeowners," Smith said. Some 
homeowners are adamantly against any changes in lot sizes, and others want to 
cash in on the gold mine their property has become. 
</P>
<P>
Smith keeps the issue in perspective. "It's not really poor versus rich when 
you're talking about $700,000 houses being torn down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Message of Hope 
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of people with multiple sclerosis -- MS -- are doing relatively 
well 20 years after the onset of the disease," said Audrey Goldman, of the 
Multiple Sclerosis Society's Southern California chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an adult-onset disease, but it's not terminal. It affects the central 
nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal cord, so that 
basically it's a conduction problem: The brain's messages get interrupted. In 
severe cases, though, the messages just can't get through anymore." 
</P>
<P>
About 25 people in the San Fernando Valley with severe cases of MS will soon 
participate in a three-month study directed by Robert Winslow, professor of 
leisure studies and recreation at Cal State Northridge. The goal is to develop 
individual recreation programs that are based on their abilities and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for most people with severe MS, according to Winslow, is that they 
led very active lives before the onset of the disease and they have an 
overabundance of free time. "They can't do the things they used to and 
consequently they feel very isolated because they're homebound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who is also involved with the study, said, "They're bored and don't 
feel as productive. We want to help them develop a menu of activities so they 
can actually make selections during the day. We want to expand their choices." 
</P>
<P>
The study is being conducted with a $15,125 grant from the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society. More than 1,200 Valley residents are registered with the 
Southern California chapter. "And we figure there's one person who doesn't 
contact us for every one who does," Goldman added. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
21816 Lanark St., Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
Size: 19 acres 
</P>
<P>
Facilities: Lighted tennis courts, baseball diamonds, swimming pool, indoor 
gymnasium, picnic facilities, play area. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 
Sunday

Information: (818) 883-1503 
</P>
<P>
Before Ray Notaro came along, Lanark Recreation Center was just another city 
park. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, Notaro and Frankie Goodman started the Lanark Boxing Club and 
began organizing classes enabling area youngsters to learn how to box. Today, 
more than 300 children, some as young as 8, have participated in the boxing 
program. Safety gear is provided by the park and a nominal registration fee 
pays for a mouthpiece and hand wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
Lanark also is the only city park with a fencing program. Instructor Edwin 
Hurst offers night classes three times a week to the public. Both programs have 
helped bring more young people to the park, said park director John Perez Jr. 
"Lanark is a place of diversity where a child can get involved in the typical 
baseball, tennis or swimming," Perez said. And the atypical too. KAREN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 SUED OVER ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO WOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed suit Wednesday against three top 
executives of a real estate company, charging them with making $3,500 in 
illegal contributions to Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo's reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who returned the donations following an audit by his 1989 campaign staff, 
was not named in the Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses the three corporate officers of Sherman Oaks-based Lycon 
Properties Inc. of making seven illegal $500 donations in the names of their 
children. It seeks civil penalties and an injunction banning any future illegal 
contributions by the executives or their employees. 
</P>
<P>
The three defendants are Dale Francescon, the company's chief executive 
officer; his brother, Robert Francescon, Lycon's chief financial officer, and 
William Lyons Jr., the company's secretary. They could not be reached for 
comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARINA, REDONDO BEACH SETTLE PIER DAMAGE 
SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of four lawsuits that hit Redondo Beach in the wake of the 
spectacular 1988 winter storms was settled this week without any admission of 
negligence by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach Marina had charged in its multimillion-dollar suit that 
inadequacies in the harbor design and maintenance had contributed to storm 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither side admitted fault, the city did agree to lower rent for 
sport fishing and other recreational enterprises, and to pay part of the cost 
of repairs to the area where the popular Blue Moon Saloon once stood. In 
return, the marina will continue to operate two expensive boat hoists and pay 
higher rent for restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides praised the settlement, but boaters criticized it because it will 
eliminate, for safety reasons, moorings on the outer harbor where boaters have 
anchored cheaply in the past.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL CANCELS FINAL NUCLEAR TEST AT ITS 
LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement Wednesday, Rockwell International called off plans 
to carry out a final nuclear experiment at the hot lab of its Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, a victory for anti-nuclear activists. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said it has contracted for the work to be done instead at the 
University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended a long-running battle with anti-nuclear and homeowner 
activists opposed to Rockwell's request to renew a nuclear materials license so 
the experiment, known as the TRUMP-S, could be done before the lab is 
decommissioned. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative Law Judge Peter B. Bloch said Rockwell asked Wednesday to 
withdraw its license application, and that he promptly dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell no longer is authorized by NRC to handle nuclear materials in the hot 
lab, except as part of decontamination and decommissioning work, Bloch said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TIMING ON HIRING OF CITY ADMINISTRATOR 
UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to hire a new San Gabriel city administrator on the eve of Tuesday's 
City Council election has created a political flap. Two candidates, including 
one incumbent, feel the matter should be left over for the new council. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Tapp said he hopes the selection will be made by Monday, the day 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Sabino M. Cici, one of the three candidates vying for two 
council seats, walked out of a Tuesday meeting where the three finalists for 
the position were being discussed, and accused the council of "attempting to 
ramrod the selection." Candidate Dominic S. Polimeni said that he, too, is 
concerned about the timing of selecting a replacement for Robert Clute, who 
announced his retirement in January. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Ted R. Anderson, the third candidate, said the three-month 
process has not been rushed.

ROCK HUDSON EX-LOVER FILES LIBEL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock Hudson's former lover filed a $23-million libel suit Wednesday, claiming 
that he is falsely portrayed in a new book on the late actor as "a criminal, a 
thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an extortionist, a 
forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist and a squatter." 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Marc Christian, who last 
year won $5.5 million from Hudson's estate for emotional distress he suffered 
because Hudson failed to disclose he was suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Christian is suing the publishers of "Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine," by Tom 
Clark and Dick Kleiner, a 288-page biography that hit the bookstores last week. 
Clark was a longtime companion of Hudson who was written out of the actor's 
will. Kleiner is a writer who lives in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy can write what he wants," Christian said Wednesday, referring to 
Clark, "but calling me those things is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Kleiner could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Clarke, a publicist for Pharos Books in New York, said the publisher 
would have no comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The book speaks for itself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The $18.95 book is "selling very well for a biography," she added. The book 
jacket calls it "an intimate portrait of Rock Hudson . . . and the friendship 
he shared with Tom Clark. It reveals stories that no one else knows." 
</P>
<P>
Christian, 36, said a friend gave him galley proofs of the book before it was 
published and that he tried unsuccessfully to get the publishers to delete 
certain passages that he claims refer to him in a bad light. 
</P>
<P>
Famed palimony attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who represents Christian, said the 
book alleges that Christian once firebombed an apartment that belonged to a 
friend of Hudson, forged love letters from Hudson that were used in his damage 
suit against the estate and knew that Hudson had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Christian said the book claims Hudson was "not 
homosexual" and may have contracted AIDS through blood transfusions during 
bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, however, denied that Hudson had 
been infected by AIDS because of surgery in 1982. She said that when Hudson 
died, the hospital tested the two blood donors and neither had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson said that Clark had once been named a beneficiary of Hudson's estate 
but that his name was stricken from the will. 
</P>
<P>
"Clark left Rock's life after a falling out before I moved in, and didn't see 
him again until shortly before he died," Christian said. "He knew nothing about 
my relationship with Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Christian, a musicologist, was initially awarded $21 million last April by a 
jury which determined that he suffered extreme emotional distress because 
Hudson hid the fact that he had AIDS. A judge later ruled that the jurors 
allowed their "passion" against Rock Hudson's "outrageous and reprehensible" 
conduct to color their thinking, and reduced the amount to $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Christian testified in sometimes lurid detail how he unwittingly continued to 
have high-risk sex with the star for eight months after Hudson was diagnosed as 
having AIDS. The two men had met at a political fund-raising party in 1983 and 
lived together in Beverly Hills before Hudson's death in 1985 at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-week trial, Christian testified that he learned from a 
television broadcast that the the actor was dying of complications of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Christian testified that he himself showed no signs of having contracted AIDS, 
but that medical tests show that he has the antibodies for herpes, which Hudson 
also had contracted. He claimed he did not have herpes before his relationship 
with Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Christian had placed blame for the concealment on the actor's secretary, Mark 
Miller, whom he described as a close friend of Clark and who was one of the 
defendants in last year's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the estate attempted to portray Christian during the trial as a 
money-grabbing opportunist who used his relationship with Hudson to further his 
ambition for an acting career. 
</P>
<P>
"He was exposed to AIDS, it wasn't greed," Mitchelson said. "And, as far as 
this lawsuit goes, they libeled him badly. He doesn't want people taking shots 
at him and so he is standing up and being counted." 
</P>
<P>
Since the trial, Christian has received a $500,000 insurance settlement from 
one of the defendants, but said he lives in a modest Los Angeles apartment, 
working on public radio documentaries. He said he has performed volunteer work 
with AIDS patients at a San Fernando Valley hospice and has joined the activist 
gay group ACT UP. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel the disease is overwhelming us and we have to do what we can 
because the government doesn't care, doesn't pay attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has no romantic relationships at present, and does not plan to have 
any until after his court battles are over. "There's just too much work and 
worry right now," he said.

LESSONS OF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTHS WHO HAVE SEEN BATTLE SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES IN A SERIES OF TALKS

Jose Chavarria's introduction to war came early. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 11 I (was forced to) join the army," he said. "They dragged me from 
my home. I was playing in the back yard with a couple of my friends and. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Jose stood gripping the microphone, unable to continue the story of how he was 
kidnaped, taken to the jungles of El Salvador and taught "how to hate people." 
</P>
<P>
The audience, a group of students at University High School in West Los 
Angeles, sat in silence as the 17-year-old stared at the ground, seemingly 
searching for words to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting nearby, lending their support, was a group of young people who have 
experienced similar pains. Paula Nahhal, 15, spent six months in a bomb shelter 
in Lebanon last year, hiding from the bombing and shelling. Donovan McCoy, 17, 
a former member of a New York "posse," had to fight his way out of urban gang 
life. And Sherry Sami, an 18-year-old Iranian, fled turmoil in her country 
after relatives were killed. 
</P>
<P>
These are the Children of War. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three weeks members of the New York-based group have spoken at 
area schools and to community groups on their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
A Cambodian refugee who came to this country after his parents had been killed 
by the Khmer Rouge started the Children of War in 1984 to help other young 
victims of war living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While the youth speak of war, they bring a message of peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to tell you that people are dying, that people are suffering," 
Nahhal said. "It's time to stand together and make peace." 
</P>
<P>
She said she has never "known the good things" Lebanon has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go outside, we don't know if we will come back," she said. "When we go 
to sleep, we don't know if we'll wake up." 
</P>
<P>
She recalled how her best friend was killed during an attack at school. "The 
shattered window went through (her) body and she died," Nahhal said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who died "were playing in the courtyard when the bombing started." 
</P>
<P>
"Damn," one student in the audience muttered softly. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the chilling accounts was emotional and educational for many students 
attending the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Marscina Kilgore, 16, sat listening intently with a furrowed brow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't watch the news, and I seldom read the paper," she said afterward. "I 
didn't know (war) involved people our age." 
</P>
<P>
Others felt almost ashamed of their own lifestyles after listening to the 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really spoiled sitting here," said Jennifer Naman, 17. "They're 
standing there saying they don't have any freedom, no family to speak of. I 
felt so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rosen, the group's adviser, said the presentations are often cathartic 
for the young speakers -- part of their healing. The youths -- some of whom 
plan to return to their native countries -- spent a week listening to each 
other's stories before beginning their speaking appearances. 
</P>
<P>
While they have learned to lend each other support during the emotion-filled 
presentations, stepping in front of a microphone has not always been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to (speak) because I have seen my family die in front of my 
eyes," said Chavarria, from El Salvador. "I don't want to remember." 
</P>
<P>
One woman from South Africa appeared on the program but asked to remain 
anonymous for fear of reprisals against her family. 
</P>
<P>
Living under apartheid is as devastating as any war, she said. "It teaches you 
hatred," she said. "It makes you very bitter. It's not easy to trust the next 
person. It has also made me be brave . . . not to fear anything." 
</P>
<P>
Response to the group's appearances has been generally favorable. But Jerry 
Shapiro, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League regional office, said 
speeches by an Israeli teen-ager and a Palestinian youth painted an unfair and 
simplistic picture of a complex situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received scores of complaints because the program was found to be 
skewed, biased and manipulative," Shapiro said, adding that the presentations 
seem "to be very carefully scripted." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lora Sandroni, a Children of War volunteer, said the "individual kids 
bring their personal opinions and experiences to the group. They are not in any 
way primed. They share what's in their hearts."

CENSUS SHORTCOMINGS STIR RISING TIDE OF COMPLAINTS 
</P>

Confronted with a rising chorus of complaints about flaws in the 1990 census, 
officials of the U.S. Census Bureau said Wednesday that about 1.9 million 
American households may not have received census forms. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio), chairman of a House subcommittee on 
the census, bureau officials said that many forms were addressed to the homes 
of people who actually receive their mail at post office boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said, however, that these and other mistakes could be corrected, 
and they sought to cast the early flaws in a positive light. They said the 
bureau had anticipated missing as many as 3.8 million homes in a mass-mailing 
of forms that began in late March. 
</P>
<P>
"The number we used for planning purposes was 3% to 4% of households, so you 
can see we are doing better than projected," said Paulette Lichtman-Panzer, a 
census spokeswoman. "We knew up front we would have problems and we have 
budgeted the resources to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, census officials estimate that more than 6,000 questionnaires 
-- less than 1% of the 900,000 that went out -- were not delivered to residents 
because of a variety of glitches, such as envelopes that were improperly 
stuffed with the form or changes in address since the last survey. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, echoing concerns of a growing contingent 
of city officials across the country, said Wednesday that more than 44,000 city 
households or 110,000 Los Angeles residents may not have received census forms. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the census in Los Angeles as "a hit-and-miss approach," Hahn said 
that houses, apartment buildings and, in some cases, entire blocks failed to 
receive questionnaires. Hahn said that the households missed by the census were 
scattered across the city. 
</P>
<P>
As with other metropolitan areas, a complete count of residents is important 
for Los Angeles and Orange counties because much of the financial aid they 
receive is based on population. In addition, the number of elected officials 
representing the region in Sacramento and Washington is directly related to 
population. Traditionally, most of the people missed in the decennial census 
are urban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the vast majority of household census forms -- intended for about 95 
million households -- were mailed by the week of March 23. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Bancroft, a spokesman for the Census Bureau who also worked on the 1980 
census, said the delivery problem was worse this time around. He attributed it, 
in part, to a keener awareness of the census and a desire by more people to be 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem is greater this time, but the awareness is much greater. 
We're actually pleased by all the demand," Bancroft said. "It shows a lot of 
interest in the 1990 census." 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials blame the missed deliveries on a variety of problems. 
For instance, they said that the addresses of some newly built homes and 
apartment buildings were not known by the Census Bureau, and that a number of 
addresses were not matched with the right ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
Census offices this week began redelivering forms, some by mail, others by 
hand, and will continue to do so through the end of next week. Between April 26 
and June 1, said Lichtman-Panzer, census takers will attempt to visit every 
household that did not return a census form. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montes, a Census Bureau district director in Orange County, said his staff 
on Wednesday was counting the forms that the U.S. Postal Service said could not 
be delivered, and was preparing to send employees out to deliver the 
questionnaires in person starting today. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be mail detectives," Montes said. "Since the post office has 
deemed these to be undeliverables, we're going to make actual visits. We should 
be done with the backlog by the middle of next week." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials in Orange County recommend that residents who have not 
received a form call (800) 999-1990 to notify the bureau of the oversight. 
Although new forms will not be sent out, a census enumerator will be scheduled 
for a visit to complete the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with the 1990 census began cropping up last week when Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley and city officials elsewhere asserted that the Census 
Bureau's March 20 canvassing of the nation's homeless was seriously flawed. 
Bradley asked census officials to conduct a partial recount. City officials 
said Thursday that they have not yet received a response from the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
By late last week, the Census Bureau had received more than 760,000 calls from 
people, complaining that they had not received their forms or asking for 
foreign language assistance, Bancroft said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, civil rights groups, including the Urban League in Los Angeles, 
have expressed concern that people who note their race as African-American, 
instead of filling in the circle marked "black or Negro," will not be counted 
as part of the nation's black population. 
</P>
<P>
The census has chronically undercounted black people, missing them at a rate 
almost four times as great as the rest of the population. After the 1980 count, 
the Census Bureau estimated that it had missed about 1.4% of the nation's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Nampeo McKenney, the Census Bureau division chief in charge of ethnic studies, 
said Wednesday that the bureau may have to devote additional resources to 
ensure that all people who identify themselves as African-American are 
classified as black, but she said the work will be finished by a Dec. 31 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We will get it done," McKenney said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, distributing questionnaires has posed the biggest problem, according to 
officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago and other 
large cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been encountering wholesale lapses, including three 20-story 
buildings, that didn't get any questionnaires," said Hulbert James, census 
coordinator for the New York mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian Sanchez, an official of the Census Bureau's Philadelphia office, said 
that "a couple hundred thousand" forms with faulty addresses could not be 
delivered to parts of Philadelphia, Maryland and New Jersey. Sanchez said that 
the Census Bureau experienced similar difficulties in Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ortiz, a census specialist with the mayor's office in Houston, said this 
week that his office had been receiving about 100 calls a day from people who 
had not received their census forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had complete apartment complexes that didn't get their forms," Ortiz 
said.

where he appeared along with his rival for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"That has created some confusion," Van de Kamp said. "So let me state once 
again, for the record, that I have always supported Medi-Cal funding for 
abortion; that I am opposed to the parental consent law, and that I strongly 
support increased funding for desperately needed family planning services. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our characteristics, like gender, are dealt to us by nature," he said. 
"Others, like our records, we build and we earn." 
</P>
<P>
In the abortion politics of the California governor's race -- where all three 
candidates support abortion rights -- the contest has been over the degrees of 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she would support an initiative to guarantee abortion rights if 
they are threatened by the state government. She said, however, that "for the 
moment, abortion is safe in California." 
</P>
<P>
"But we need to elect leaders who are unequivocally pro-choice. And I just 
happen to know one woman for governor who fits that bill," she added. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for governor 
who also supports abortion rights, spoke at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Van de Kamp called on state health officials to allow testing of 
the pill RU 486, which has been found to induce abortions within five weeks of 
conception. If the drug is proven safe, Van de Kamp said, he believes it should 
be marketed. 
</P>
<P>
The drug's manufacturer, however, is a French company, Roussel Uclaf, which has 
not applied for a license to test its product in California. And, Van de Kamp 
acknowledged, there's no guarantee the firm will supply the drug for testing. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates called Van de Kamp's proposal "smart politics" and 
good news for American women. Feinstein suggested the attorney general was 
"trying to one-up me with the female vote." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein leads Van de Kamp among women voters by more than a 2-to-1 margin, 
according to a recent Los Angeles Times Poll.

Ford Motor Co. is paying $6 million to settle a lawsuit that partially blamed 
the auto giant's failure to offer rear shoulder harness restraints for the 
traffic accident death of a child and crippling injuries to his surviving twin. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is the largest paid in a case involving the lack of rear 
shoulder harnesses, San Diego attorney Craig McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
He negotiated the settlement on behalf of the twins' parents, Jim and Patricia 
Miller, who also survived the Nov. 13, 1988, accident. Dozens of similar suits 
filed throughout the nation are pending against Ford and other auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal regulations, combination lap and shoulder safety harnesses in the 
rear are mandatory for all passenger cars as of the 1990 model year. In 1992, 
the requirement will be expanded to include mini vans. Ford admitted no 
liability in the settlement.

</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LOS ALAMITOS' BID FOR A $13-MILLION ISSUE WINS BY A MORE THAN 2-1 
MARGIN AND SURPRISES MANY IN AN ERA OF ANTI-TAXATION SENTIMENT.

<P>
Running a skillful campaign, a grass-roots organization overcame opposition to 
tax increases and persuaded local voters to approve a $13-million bond measure 
for schools, Los Alamitos Unified School District officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even more surprising, Measure K in Tuesday's election was approved by a 7-3 
margin in a school district where only 25% of the residents have school-age 
children, state education officials said. The measure, which needed a 
two-thirds majority to pass, received 70.9% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Murrey, the school district's director of business and support services, 
said that Measure K's supporters were able to get across the message to voters 
that the schools would have to be rejuvenated "much like your home needs 
repairs after 30 years." The average age of the district's seven schools is 29 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"They were willing to tax themselves," Murrey said. "They would like to see 
their schools in the same condition they were 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Schools targeted for repairs are Hopkinson, McGaugh and Rossmoor elementaries 
and McAuliffe Middle School and Los Alamitos and Laurel Continuation high 
schools. The schools range in age from 25 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Alamitos school board decided to put Measure K on the ballot, it 
voted to use a state provision that allows school officials to exempt certain 
areas within their districts from voting on bond issues or having their taxes 
raised. In this case, residents from Leisure World of Seal Beach were excluded 
from the district election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, school district officials decided to provide exemptions for those 
property owners age 65 and older from paying the new tax. Those residents, 
however, have to file for exemptions each year. 
</P>
<P>
"That helped us," said Donna Artukovic, a school board member and campaign 
coordinator for Measure K. "We had many senior citizens on a fixed income." 
</P>
<P>
Applying such provisions to school bond measures, however, hasn't guaranteed 
success. Of the 21 similar school bond elections in the state since 1983, 
voters approved only four, said David Walrath, a legislative advocate for the 
Coalition for Adequate School Housing, based in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Walrath added that most of those elections were for bonds to build new schools 
or expand older schools. In May, 1989, voters in the fast-growing Capistrano 
Unified School District defeated a ballot measure to raise property taxes for 
new school construction. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, school bond measures have failed in general in Orange County in the 
past 10 years. Of the seven school bond measures held since 1980, only three 
have passed, according to the Orange County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Measure K will raise taxes on property within the school district by an average 
of $4.50 a month for the next 25 years, the amount of time needed to retire the 
bond debt. The money will be used to repair and rehabilitate all six schools in 
the district, which spans Los Alamitos, Seal Beach and a small part of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
District officials attributed the success of the initiative to a strong 
grass-roots campaign and to a report that identified specific improvements 
needed at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The repairs will involve electrical systems, leaking roofs, asbestos removal, 
heating and air-conditioning systems, plumbing and general rehabilitation. The 
school repairs are scheduled to be made over the next 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Money to cover the cost of renovating schools has been a growing problem for 
schools in the state. Many districts have had to look to new solutions, such as 
bond elections, to find the financing, rather than taking money from a general 
fund at the expense of instruction costs, Walrath said. He estimated the cost 
of deferred maintenance for schools statewide at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is this: Only 20% of the households have children in 
schools, and only 50% go to the polls," said Gary Jerome, an education 
consultant to state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). "That makes it very 
difficult to get a two-thirds majority." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for defeat, education experts said, can vary. But Jerome said much 
depends on how organized a campaign is and how well they convey to voters the 
need for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The best campaigns are the ones that really enlist parents," Jerome said. "By 
and large, school districts run lousy campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Artukovic said that in the Los Alamitos district, members of her committee 
conducted a survey before the election that helped tell the board what voters 
were willing to accept. The costs of repairing the schools were targeted at $26 
million, but the school board trimmed that to $13 million after getting the 
results of the survey, Artukovic said. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that there was no organized opposition to the initiative.

CITY LICKS CHOPS OVER ALISO VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the recently formed city of Laguna Niguel are considering the 
annexation of Aliso Viejo, a 6,600-acre planned community owned by the Mission 
Viejo Co., according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
This plan was mentioned in a March 22 letter sent to the Local Agency Formation 
Commission as part of Laguna Niguel's application for initial approval to annex 
two small parcels of land north of the city. The request was denied on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mayor Patricia C. Bates said that as a combined city of Laguna 
Niguel and Aliso Viejo, both communities would be able to deal more effectively 
with regional issues and save money by avoiding duplication of city services 
and administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on preliminary studies that have been done on including the Aliso Viejo 
Planned Community in the city of Laguna Niguel, there are various factors which 
indicate this would be to the mutual benefit of the citizens of Laguna Niguel 
and the citizens of Aliso Viejo," Bates wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bates added that the two adjacent communities are already linked because they 
share schools, recreation facilities and open space. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Mission Viejo Co. and the Aliso Viejo Community Assn. were 
quick to criticize the idea of annexation, saying that Aliso Viejo should be 
allowed to develop into a separate city. The 11-year-old community of Aliso 
Viejo now has about 4,000 residents but is expected to grow to about 50,000 
residents by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to take pieces of it and give it to adjoining cities," Mission 
Viejo spokesman Richard Watson said of Aliso Viejo. "We want to allow it to 
mature." 
</P>
<P>
Don Swift, director of the Aliso Viejo Community Assn., said in a March 15 
letter to Bates that the annexation would "seriously hinder the natural 
evolution of Aliso Viejo from a planned community to cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't support it," Swift added Wednesday. "We (the two communities) are 
just too different." 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO denied Laguna Niguel's request to include the two parcels in the city's 
"sphere of influence," a step that precedes the formal request for annexation. 
One of the parcels is within the boundaries of the proposed city of Laguna 
Hills, and the other is in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members denied the "sphere of influence" request pending a decision 
about whether the Laguna Hills cityhood issue will be placed on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills cityhood application still must gain the approval of LAFCO and 
the County Board of Supervisors to make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said city officials would wait until after the election before pursuing 
either a second try to take control of the two small parcels or opening a 
dialogue with Aliso Viejo officials on creating a single city out of the two 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not presume to intrude on their desire for self-determination," Bates 
said, adding that the city has taken no official stand on the Aliso Viejo 
annexation proposal. JAMES M. GOMEZ

FOSTER PARENTS WARN AGAINST ACCUSATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of local foster parents voiced concern Wednesday that accusations of 
abusive behavior by staff at the Orangewood Children's Home will discourage 
volunteers and worsen what is already a severe shortage of foster families. 
</P>
<P>
"We need foster homes badly," said Cherri Olson, a Fountain Valley foster 
mother and member of the County Foster Care Advisory Board. "Many lay people 
who are interested in becoming foster parents and believe they will have to 
deal with an agency that won't respond to their concerns will decide not to 
have anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood, the county's shelter for abused, neglected and abandoned children, 
is being investigated by the County Juvenile Justice Commission and the grand 
jury over allegations that children have been physically, mentally and verbally 
mistreated there. 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood officials say the allegations are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the children who are taken into protective custody spend some time at 
Orangewood before being placed with foster families. Olson said that the foster 
parents she has spoken to dismiss allegations of mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 600 licensed foster parents in the county but more than 2,600 
children in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel any negative publicity that affects the dependency system often has a 
deleterious effect on recruitment," said Barbara Labitzke, foster home 
development coordinator for the county and executive director of the Southern 
Area Fostercare Effort, which coordinates foster care in an eight-county 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Several foster parents rallied to the defense of Orangewood in a letter to 
local media. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that (Orangewood) ranks with the very best programs and facilities 
nationwide," stated the letter signed by 17 foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
The foster parents also questioned the motives and conduct of Dorothy Moore, 
the Newport Beach woman who first leveled charges of mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations came after Moore, a legal secretary who became a foster 
parent in January, befriended two homeless children and had them placed in 
Orangewood when their parents allegedly abandoned them. Moore said the children 
told her that they and other children were harshly treated. 
</P>
<P>
Two former counselors at Orangewood -- one of whom was fired after 
disagreements over how to handle the children -- later came forward to support 
Moore's charges. 
</P>
<P>
Foster parent Olson, who learned of the allegations as a member of the Foster 
Care Advisory Board, said that social service officials "leaned over backwards" 
to verify Moore's complaints, but found no wrongdoing. She said that Moore's 
persistence has not only damaged Orangewood's reputation but also some foster 
parents' trust in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, responding to the foster parents Wednesday, however, said her concerns 
have nothing to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
"My complaint is with the administrators at Orangewood and how children are 
treated there," she said. "I think there are many good people out there who 
will still want to come forward and care for children, that's what it's all 
about." CARLA RIVERA

The City Council has extended a ban on new dance halls, nightclubs and topless 
bars, and has scheduled a public hearing that could lead to an extension of a 
separate freeze on adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The council this week voted unanimously to extend the dance hall ban for up to 
10 months and 15 days to give the city more time to prepare an ordinance 
regulating such activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are noise problems and there has been violence connected with some of 
these operations," said City Atty. Stuart Scudder. "(City) staff needs more 
time to study relevant court decisions and make the necessary revisions to the 
ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also voted unanimously to schedule a public hearing on April 
16 to consider extending a moratorium on new or expanded adult businesses such 
as adult bookstores, billiard parlors and X-rated video arcades. The moratorium 
applies to new and expanded adult businesses along Garden Grove Boulevard 
between Beach Boulevard and Magnolia Street. JAMES TORTOLANO

HIGH COST MAY CURB NEW STREET NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers sometimes like to change the names of county streets to match their 
personal vision: When Costa Mesa-based EPAC Development bought a section of 
Aliso Viejo, for instance, it quickly came up with names that matched the 
performing arts theme of its 186-home community "Applause." 
</P>
<P>
One street was named Intermission, another simply Drama. The county approved 
the names, and area maps were altered accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The county likes to comply with such requests. Trouble is, street-name changes 
cost a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orange County taxpayers spent more than $62,000 putting up new signs, 
relabeling maps and permits, and shifting addresses last year. Developers 
repaid a portion of it, but the taxpayers still got stuck with a bill for 
$38,064, more than it costs to put a new sheriff's deputy on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
It's an irritating way for the county to lose money, officials say, and the 
Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to stem the tide by raising 
fees for the service. A street-name change that once cost a developer $476 will 
now cost $1,255. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm cheap," Board Chairman Don R. Roth explained after the meeting. "We're not 
trying to make any money on this, but we do need to stay even, and these 
programs have to pay for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The board is particularly sensitive to programs that are not paying for 
themselves, Roth added, because budget season is approaching and the county 
will face a significant deficit unless new sources of revenue can be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an area where there's a cost to the taxpayers, and they shouldn't have 
to be paying it," Roth said. "We're always looking to deal with those." 
</P>
<P>
For the quirky and eclectic batch of Orange County street names -- Oakie Dokie 
Lane and Hunky Dory Lane come together near Trabuco Canyon, for instance -- the 
new fees just make it more unlikely that anyone will tamper with history. 
</P>
<P>
And in Applause, the new names, along with the theater theme, are there to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had this theme from the very beginning, and we're very excited about 
it," EPAC marketing director Sandra Dunkin said. "We just opened our models -- 
there's a Swan Lake and an Elton John and a Chorus Line." JIM NEWTON

CELEBRATION TO MARK COLUMBUS VOYAGE

<P>
About 80 civic and community leaders gathered at the Harbor Club on Wednesday 
to begin planning for the 500th anniversary celebration of Christopher 
Columbus' discovery of America. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized and hosted by the Orange County Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Commission, focused on recruiting businesses to participate in 
the events planned for Orange County during the yearlong commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed celebrations are a boat parade in Newport Harbor, a special 
opera night presenting at least one of the operas written about Columbus' 
voyage, and a Mexican rodeo featuring trick riders from all over Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Collins, a member of the U.S. Quincentenary Commission, noted that 
California has been especially enthusiastic about organizing for the upcoming 
celebration. So far, he said, commissions have been established in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, and, tentatively, in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County commission was formed about a year ago to help organize 
events for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
One goal, according to commission co-chairman Frank De Santis, is that Newport 
Beach be chosen as one of the ports visited by replicas of the Nina, the Pinta 
and the Santa Maria, which will be duplicating Columbus' voyage across the 
Atlantic.LAURA MICHAELIS

FOOD SELLER FIGHTS CITY OVER LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For beachside concessionaire Tom Lewis, this is typically a quiet time of year. 
His six food stands won't open until this weekend, and the peak season is still 
almost two months away. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, these have been the toughest of months for Lewis. Just three 
weeks ago, he finally succeeded in collecting about $4,500 from the company 
whose tanker was responsible for the Huntington Beach oil spill. British 
Petroleum Co. damaged his leased parking lot during the cleanup effort, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And a week ago, Lewis was notified that in six months the city plans to 
terminate his lease on the 330-space parking lot, saying it needs the area to 
store equipment during its upcoming pier reconstruction project. He is 
challenging whether the city has legal right to take over the lot, a move that 
he says would force him out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Without the income he gets from parking lot revenues -- about $3 for every $4 
ticket sold -- he cannot afford to continue selling hot dogs, chips and sodas, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they take the parking lot, they might as well take it all," Lewis said. "I 
never would have gotten into this in the first place if it weren't for the 
parking lot, because it's such a moneymaker." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say a clause in the 20-year lease allows them to cancel it. But 
Lewis disputes that, saying "I've never signed anything with the city of 
Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
He and his partners signed the original lease agreement in 1980 with the state, 
which owns the parking lot. The state leased the property to the city, which 
subleases it to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis says only the state has the power to cancel his lease; city officials say 
they now have that authority. 
</P>
<P>
But City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, prompted by a letter from Lewis' 
attorney, persuaded the City Council on Monday to delay its decision on the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"This will give us a chance to review Mr. Lewis' claim," he said. "I certainly 
want to be fair, and see to it that he gets anything he's due in relation to 
his leaseholder rights." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he believes Uberuaga is genuinely concerned about his plea. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got into this thing, I never thought the state would deed that lot over 
to the city, or I never would have done this, because I don't think they're 
trustworthy," Lewis said. "If they want to buy it from me for a fair price, 
that's fine. I'm not opposed to selling it. But I'm not going to let them take 
it from me." JOHN PENNER

MCCOLL DUMP PLAN IS REJECTED BY EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it will hold to its 
decision to rid the abandoned McColl dump of tons of toxic waste by burning it, 
despite a renewed call by a coalition of oil companies to entomb the hazardous 
compounds at the eight-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
"Thermal destruction of the McColl waste is not a negotiable issue," EPA 
spokesman Terry Wilson said. "Congress has mandated we find a permanent 
solution for hazardous dumps like McColl, and leaving waste in the ground is 
not a permanent solution." 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies -- identified by federal officials as the parties most likely 
to have been responsible for the wastes -- submitted a plan earlier this week 
to leave the refinery waste and oil-drilling muds in the ground and cap the 
site with a synthetic and clay cover. It is similar to a cleanup approach 
proposed three years ago by the oil companies, which organized under the name 
McColl Site Group. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest proposal, the oil companies offered to pay for maintenance and 
security at the site and a long-term ground water monitoring program to 
determine if any toxic waste has reached underground water supplies about 250 
feet below the dump. The plan also calls for stabilizing the earthen dump to 
help prevent it from rupturing during a major earthquake, said Bill Duchie, a 
spokesman for the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the risk posed by the site is very low," Duchie said. "But as long 
as the community and (EPA) feel something should be done, we believe this plan 
is the most comprehensive in terms of safety." 
</P>
<P>
But EPA's Wilson said capping the World War II-era refinery wastes at the site, 
located a stone's throw from neighborhoods of expensive, single-family foothill 
homes, is unacceptable. Wilson said the agency will continue testing various 
methods to excavate and destroy the toxic materials through incineration. A 
final decision on how to clean up the 150,000 tons of waste is not expected 
until March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the agency in February asked the McColl Site Group to submit a plan 
for monitoring the ground water for possible contamination after EPA officials 
discovered trace amounts of petroleum-based compounds in some test wells. (So 
far, no drinking water supplies have been affected.) 
</P>
<P>
As part of the group's response, Wilson said the companies resubmitted their 
original cleanup plan to contain the waste at the site, an option that would 
cost an estimated $20 million to $25 million and take three to five years to 
put in place. 
</P>
<P>
On-site incineration, federal officials say, would cost about $117 million and 
take four to seven years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the five oil companies -- Shell Oil Co., Phillips Petroleum, 
Texaco,, Arco and Unocal -- say they will challenge any attempts to make them 
pay for on-site incineration. Federal officials acknowledged at a recent public 
hearing that the expected court fight over the cleanup costs could delay the 
actual start of cleanup up to 15 years. STEVEN R. CHURM

RECKNOR RATTLES, ROLLS ON THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Recknor is the Rat and the vagabond of UC Irvine's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
He has come to be known as Rat, short for Rattler, because of the unending 
ribbing he gives his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll rip just about anything and not let up," says Bill Ashen, the team's 
coach. "You can't come back at him. If you do, he'll put you in the bag . . . 
Everybody kind of knows when he starts to just sit and take it." 
</P>
<P>
Recknor is the vagabond because of where he has been ("Better to ask where he 
hasn't been," Ashen says.) 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's volleyball team is the final stop of a five-year, four-school, 
three-sport athletic career for Recknor. His ability as a blocker and server is 
helping the Anteaters to a season that some people are calling a breakthrough 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Recknor, a 6-foot-6 senior, left Palos Verdes High School in 1985 as a 
quarterback good enough to take a recruiting trip to Washington, where he 
surveyed the weight room and thought better of continuing that sport. He went 
to USC as a recruited walk-on pitcher, but quit baseball after undergoing 
shoulder surgery on his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
He then went to L.A. Harbor College, where he practiced with the basketball 
team for a year but did not play. The next year, he hooked up with Mt. San 
Antonio College, eager to play basketball, but he became disenchanted when the 
team didn't play the running style he had expected. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to beach volleyball. The players who at first snubbed him later 
embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy who always tried to keep me off the court asked me to play on his team 
in a six-man tournament," Recknor said. "To me, that was the ultimate 
hypocrisy, telling a kid to go away and then asking him to play on his team." 
</P>
<P>
While playing on the beach, he met Brian Kehe, a former Irvine player who urged 
him to meet Ashen. Recknor joined the Anteaters in the middle of last season, 
and he has been keeping the Anteaters' van rides lively ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke the starting lineup in about two weeks," Ashen said. "He pretty much 
surprised me and everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
This season, his final year of eligibility, Recknor is rated as the Anteaters' 
top blocker. At one point, he was ranked ninth in the nation in blocking, but a 
temporary move to outside blocker reduced his opportunities for a time. 
</P>
<P>
Recknor leads the team in aces, with 20. As a pitcher, he made his mark with a 
fastball, but in volleyball, he serves a floater, specializing in placement. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, meanwhile, are specializing in improvement. They had a 7-25 
record last season, and won only one match in the Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
With Recknor, junior Steve Florentine (the former Anteater basketball player), 
junior David Pettker, sophomore James Felton, senior Mike Minier and junior 
James Davis, Irvine has the core of a team that is 8-11 and has upset of Cal 
State Long Beach and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"You start doing well, and it just gets easier to do well," Recknor said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashen, 35, gets only perfunctory argument when he says he was the best player 
on the floor when he came to Irvine in 1986 to coach the school's club team. 
</P>
<P>
With victories over Long Beach and Northridge, both ranked in the top 10, 
Irvine might have earned the right to expect respect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a breakthrough year," said Bob Newcomb, WIVA commissioner and also an 
Irvine professor who coached the team in the early 1970s before the sport was 
discontinued at the school for a time. "It's not going to be a breakthrough 
year; it already is." 
</P>
<P>
To Ashen, Irvine used to be "kind of like little brother tagging around." 
</P>
<P>
But the Anteaters now consider themselves a threat -- and are considered so by 
others. "We used to think we were successful if we didn't get shut out in any 
games and the other team didn't take the starters out," Ashen said. 
</P>
<P>
David Hollaway, a 6-2 guard formerly on the San Jose State basketball team, has 
made an oral commitment to attend Irvine, said his father, Chuck Hollaway. 
David Hollaway was a freshman on the 1988 Spartan team that staged a walkout 
against coach Bill Berry, who eventually was fired. Hollaway played at West 
L.A. College last season, and also considered Nebraska and New Mexico. The 
spring signing period begins April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Kronemann, Irvine's No. 1 singles player and the 17th-ranked tennis 
player in the country, missed a match against UCLA last week because of a 
hamstring injury. There was concern that the injury might be a stress fracture, 
but a bone scan Wednesday proved negative. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ford, former Houston athletic director, is one of six finalists for the 
athletic director's job, according to sources. Other finalists include: Tom 
Beckett, Stanford associate AD, Dennis Farrell, Associate Big West Conference 
commissioner, Dan Guerrero, Cal State Dominguez Hills athletic director, and 
Darryl Rogers, former Detroit Lions coach. . . . The tentative 1990-91 schedule 
for the men's basketball team includes road games at Maryland, San Diego State 
and Stanford and games against Cal State Northridge and California in the Bren 
Center, as well as three tournaments. Other teams in the Great Alaska Shootout 
Nov. 23-26: UCLA, Virginia, South Carolina, Nevada Reno, Texas Tech, Marquette 
and Alaska Anchorage. Other teams in Irvine's Disneyland Freedom Bowl Classic: 
Loyola Marymount, Bradley and Idaho State. Teams for a tournament at the 
University of Tennessee Chattanooga are not finalized. . . . The baseball team 
opened its Big West Conference season with a shutout of Cal State Fullerton, 
but lost the final two games of the series. The schedule doesn't get easier. 
This weekend, Irvine plays three games at Fresno State, ranked 23rd by 
Collegiate Baseball. "We've got our work cut out for us," Coach Mike Gerakos 
said. "They've got some outstanding pitching up there, and it's always a 
challenge to go up to that ballpark. . . . Their strength is their pitching, 
but hitting has been one of our strengths." . . . The sailing team finished 
second to the U.S. Naval Academy last weekend in the Boston Dinghy Cup, held on 
the Charles River, site of the national championships in June. The 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology was third in the competition, which 
included 15 of the top 20 teams in the country. Irvine's James Malm and Scott 
Munch won the Division A title. Irvine won the national sailing championship in 
1988 and finished third last year.

SLOW-STARTING LAGUNA BEACH RUNS DOWN WOODBRIDGE

LAGUNA BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As usual, the Laguna Beach boys' volleyball team spun its wheels early in 
Wednesday night's match against Woodbridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Artists weren't blown away. 
</P>
<P>
Dain Blanton had 28 kills to lead the Artists, ranked fourth in Orange County, 
past No. 3 Woodbridge, 12-15, 15-5, 15-9, 15-10, in a Pacific Coast League game 
at the Laguna Beach gym. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only running on about three cylinders," said Blanton, a 6-foot-5 outside 
hitter. "We still have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (7-3) avenged a four-game loss to Woodbridge and moved into a 
first-place tie in the league standings with the Warriors at 5-1. Woodbridge is 
8-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists trailed early in each game against Woodbridge. Laguna Beach Coach 
Lance Stewart said it was a typical start for the Artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tendency to be a little slow out the gate," he said. "We can't keep 
doing that or teams will start slamming the door in your face." 
</P>
<P>
That happened to the Artists early in the season. With four starters out 
because of the basketball season, the volleyball team started 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton, Josh Borella, Brady Butcher and John Trevino were busy playing in the 
state basketball tournament and didn't arrive until the second week of 
volleyball season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only running on about one cylinder earlier in the year," Stewart said. 
"Now I'd say we're running on two." 
</P>
<P>
Blanton and Borella both had their games in high gear. Borella, a 6-1 junior, 
started for the first time this season and finished with 21 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to wait until Josh was ready from basketball," Stewart said. "He was 
definitely an influence out there. Now we have four good attackers." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge Coach Steve Stratos said his team didn't play well. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Beach wanted it more than we did," he said. "That was very obvious. 
They outplayed us in every aspect of the game. And I thought Blanton showed a 
lot of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Blanton had 10 kills, including six aces, in the second game as Laguna Beach 
erased a 3-0 deficit. Borella added seven kills and four aces. 
</P>
<P>
"Dain kept the pressure on them," Stewart said. "He played smart." 
</P>
<P>
Blanton and Borella continued to pound Woodbridge in the third and fourth 
games, as Laguna Beach rallied from deficits of 2-1 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth game, the Artists capitalized on six Woodbridge errors in a 9-1 
run. Woodbridge trailed, 10-5, but used two Laguna Beach errors and a kill by 
Scott Seymour to pull within 10-8. Seymour led Woodbridge with 18 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach ended the match when two Woodbridge hitting errors and an ace 
serve by Sean Baldwin keyed a 5-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he was pleased with the victory.

CARL'S JR. LIGHTENS UP ON MENU BY SERVING LOWER-CALORIE ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Chris Woodyard, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In health-conscious Orange County, a low-calorie menu would seem like a 
sure-fire winner. 
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on the movement, Carl's Jr. Restaurants launched its "lite menu" 
this week by promoting items already on its menu as healthy alternatives to the 
traditional burger, fries and milkshake. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, fast food almost always meant fattening food. Now, El Pollo 
Loco places little hearts on its menu board to designate items that meet 
American Heart Assn. standards, and even giant McDonald's now offers salads. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is taking the next step by advertising its barbecue chicken 
sandwich, charbroiled chicken salad, garden salads and plain baked potato as a 
"lite menu." 
</P>
<P>
While other restaurants have tried to portray their food as healthy, Carl's 
could gain a measure of credibility by putting its calories where its mouth is. 
</P>
<P>
But will anyone really eat a naked baked potato? 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Parks, a Carl's Jr. spokeswoman, said the plain potato is a 
tantalizing alternative for people on special diets. And a customer can always 
have a pat of margarine or some veggies thrown on it, although such indulgences 
will boost the calorie count past the posted 350 minimum. 
</P>
<P>
And don't expect to find a calorie count listed next to the bacon cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
The larger issue is whether Carl's can cash in on the health boom with its 
latest promotion. Carl's already knows that some customers "are not willing to 
go for a drastically healthy product," says Parks. 
</P>
<P>
But she says the company, which was the first fast-food restaurant chain to 
introduce salad bars, believes there are plenty of customers who steer clear of 
hamburgers and prefer the convenience of healthy fast food. She said she hopes 
the new campaign will lure them in. The "lite menu" will be featured in 
television ads and glossy coupon inserts. 
</P>
<P>
One UC Irvine professor suggests that people who want to lose weight ought to 
forget the calories and simply try to eat less of what they like most. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Carl's lite menu, Dr. Grant Gwinup, a professor of endocrinology, 
said customers probably won't be happy if their appetites are not satisfied. If 
people like Carl's Jr. hamburgers, he says, they should keep eating them -- but 
in moderation.

ENGINEERS UNION FINED IN OWL ROCK INCIDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: JUDGE IMPOSES A SUSPENDED $10,000 LEVY AFTER RULING THAT THE LOCAL WAS 
IN CIVIL CONTEMPT FOR VIOLATING A COURT ORDER 10 TIMES. SIX OTHER CHARGES WERE 
DISMISSED.

<P>
A Superior Court judge in Los Angeles has handed Arcadia-based Owl Rock 
Products a minor victory in its six-month quarrel with its union over wages. 
</P>
<P>
The court found Local 12 of the Pasadena-based International Union of Operating 
Engineers in civil contempt of a court order issued in September and imposed a 
"suspended" $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 10 violations of the court order were committed in Owl Rock's rock 
and cement plants in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt J. Lewin suspended the fine -- $1,000 for each incident cited -- but 
it will be payable if the union violates the court order in the future. 
Violations included placing spikes and other sharp objects in the company's 
driveway to flatten vehicle tires and causing other damage to company property. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin, who issued his ruling March 28, dismissed six similar allegations of 
violations in other locations where Owl Rock operates. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Rock, which is 50% owned by Ontario-based Mitsubishi Cement Corp., is one 
of Southern California's major suppliers of construction materials. The company 
began experiencing incidents of vandalism after its labor contract with the 
union expired in August last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 26,000-member union represents workers at 20 Owl Rock plants in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"By fining them, the judge would stop the union from engaging in this type of 
illegal activity," said Owl Rock's sales and operations vice president, Mike 
Broome , on Wednesday. "We will pursue any violation of the injunction in the 
future even if we have to seek jail time for the individuals involved." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 violations cited, eight involved putting spikes to flatten vehicle 
tires, one on property damage and another for verbal threats, said Lynn Graack, 
Owl Rock's vice president for administration. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Segall, an attorney for the union, said none of the 16 incidents that 
Owl Rock cited in court involved the company's customers.

BAXTER INTL. TO LAY OFF 6,400, CLOSE 21 PLANTS;

Baxter International Inc., one of the world's largest makers of hospital 
supplies, announced plans Wednesday to lay off about 6,400 workers and close or 
sell 21 plants in an effort to trim costs and narrow its scope. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 10% work force reduction and consolidation of manufacturing 
facilities, Baxter indicated that it will sell several businesses, raise prices 
on many products and channel more money into research and development. 
</P>
<P>
"These decisions are in the best long-term interests of all of our 
constituencies," said a statement by Baxter Chairman Vernon R. Loucks Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"Baxter must keep evolving to help its customers meet their objective of 
providing high-quality health care while controlling costs," Loucks said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter has extensive operations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs are expected to have "very modest impact" on Baxter's Orange County 
operations, which employ about 3,000 workers. Two of Baxter's key businesses, 
the Edwards division, which makes heart valves and other cardiovascular 
products, and the Bentley division, which makes oxygenators used in open heart 
surgery, are based in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter spokesman Les Jacobson reported that Michael Estes, corporate vice 
president of Baxter and head of its medical specialties devices business, said 
earlier this week that one of the objectives of the restructuring would be to 
strengthen the Edwards and Bentley divisions. Jacobson said Estes stressed that 
Baxter had no intention of divesting these operations. 
</P>
<P>
Other smaller Baxter units in the county, Jacobson said, include the Fenwal 
automated systems division in Santa Ana that makes blood separating equipment, 
the Paramax systems division in Irvine that makes diagnostic equipment, a 
regional distribution center in Garden Grove and a hospital supply division 
office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter also has several facilities in the San Fernando Valley. The Hyland 
division, which makes plasma products, has three facilities -- in Glendale, on 
the Glendale/Los Angeles border and in Duarte -- that together employ about 
1,000. A division in Valencia employs 400 and makes various medical products 
for hospitals. Jacobson declined comment on those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, based in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, said the cost of the 
restructuring would result in a first-quarter loss of $375 million to $400 
million, or $1.50 to $1.60 per share. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the changes would generate annual pretax savings of up to $275 
million by 1993 and help Baxter achieve annual growth of 15% to 18% in 
operating income over the next several years.

O.C. POP BEAT: NPG, BILL WARD MAKE POINTS WITH VIDEO VENTURES; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: TWO LOCAL ROCK ACTS MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY IN A BID FOR MTV EXPOSURE. 
A LIVE RELEASE FROM A NOW-DEFUNCT EDITION OF THE JAMES HARMAN BAND GOES BEYOND 
MERE NOSTALGIA. 
</P>

<P>
With just-released debut videos, two Orange County rock acts, National People's 
Gang and Bill Ward, leap into the relatively new world of musical marketing via 
MTV. Both emerge with their integrity intact in clips that make a point instead 
of merely mongering a salable image. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local bluesman James Harman's new album of old live tracks reminds 
us that video images are no substitute for the old-fashioned impact of a great 
band forging a succession of unscripted, personality-filled moments in a sweaty 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings range from * (poor) to ***** (a classic). 
</P>
<P>

National People's Gang 
</P>
<P>
"Gettin' Close to God" video 
</P>
<P>
(Dr. Dream) 
</P>
<P>
All rock video is advertising, and NPG could hardly have done a more appealing 
job of selling itself than it has with "Gettin' Close to God." The scenario 
moves between kinetic concert footage, shot at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, and the offstage doings of a weird, wired evangelist, played by 
singer Chad Jasmine. The concert sequences establish each band member as an 
interesting performing personality as NPG cranks out the edgy, funk-flavored 
track that leads off its recent album, "Orange." But Jasmine is beyond 
interesting. Not only does he wear the most outlandish rock headgear since 
Peter Gabriel's days with Genesis, but he wears it with a Gabriel-like 
charisma, grabbing the viewer with a theatrical performance full of alluring 
ambiguities. 
</P>
<P>
It's the ambiguity that makes the video more than a sales tool for the band. 
Jasmine's portrayal of the preacher holds a degree of mockery, which is the 
expected, by now trite rock 'n' roll take on evangelism. But there is also 
magic and mystery in the characterization. Jasmine, painted like one of the 
decadent priests of "Jesus Christ Superstar," makes his character too vibrant 
to dismiss. There's a power in extremist religion, as well as a madness, the 
video suggests. In its most telling moment, we see a bare-chested, joyfully 
shamanistic Jasmine on stage at the Coach House, hacking a watermelon into 
slices and sharing the fruit with his audience -- a Eucharistic ritual that is 
a regular part of NPG's concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Without betraying the song's ambiguity, the video focuses its meaning with the 
suggestion that a charismatic figure in the pulpit and a star on a rock stage 
both conduct rituals and gather flocks drawn by hunger for a god of some sort. 
That suggestion raises some interesting questions: If we dismiss the preacher 
as a sham, then shouldn't we be suspicious of the rocker as well? Lord knows 
that some rock heroes are as brittlely dogmatic as some religious 
fundamentalists. To its credit, National People's Gang would rather explore 
mysteries and ambiguities than proclaim simplistic answers to what ails our 
spirits.

Bill Ward 
</P>
<P>
"Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)" video 
</P>
<P>
(Chameleon) 
</P>
<P>
When his debut album, "Ward One: Along the Way," was released early this year, 
the former Black Sabbath drummer vowed that if any video of his included 
pouting, scantily clad models or any of his old band's demonic imagery, "you 
can come over to my house and smack me over the head with a big shovel." Well, 
Ward's close-cropped noggin is safe. The "Bombers" video eschews the poses, 
cliches and come-ons that make most headbanger video such an embarrassment. 
Instead of fantasies, "Bombers" offers horrific newsreel realities, ranging 
from an elephant hunt to enough wartime cannonade and bombardment footage to 
induce shellshock. 
</P>
<P>
These grim scenes -- and occasional contrasting glimpses of beauty and family 
love -- play out behind the ghostly, superimposed image of the song's 
well-known guest singer and ace video ham, Ward's old mate Ozzy Osbourne. 
</P>
<P>
The video starts with a boy and girl walking carefree through an idyllic park, 
then being confronted suddenly by a blank white screen. It soon becomes a video 
monitor for them, depicting a graphic lesson about the nature of peace and 
violence and the individual's responsibility to choose the humane path. In a 
hopeful final vision, the idyllic scene is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's no arguing with content like that, the "Bombers" clip 
underlines the way in which video so often narrows and diminishes a song. 
Ward's album is a highly personal concept piece about his alcoholic decline and 
fall and his struggle for recovery and renewal. In that context, "Bombers" is 
about the damage that an out-of-control individual can wreak on himself and 
those he loves. While the video's escalation to questions of global insanity is 
valid enough, I'd rather think of Ward's own story when hearing this excellent, 
hard-chugging song -- as I do when I listen to the record. 
</P>
<P>
"Bombers" posed an unusually tough assignment for the video makers. They had to 
introduce Ward as the creative force and persona behind the song -- despite the 
fact that Osbourne sings it and appears as its marquee attraction. They 
squandered an opportunity to establish Ward as a personality right at the 
start. In the opening sequence, an anonymous mad professor appears on the 
mysterious screen and beckons the strolling kids to watch. Why not have Ward up 
there doing the beckoning, and perhaps speaking some suitably Delphic 
introductory lines? Instead, just as in his Black Sabbath days, the Seal Beach 
resident comes off as Bill the Drummer, playing backup to Ozzy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, the sheer strength of the song (the best thing Osbourne 
has had to sing in years) and the video's commitment to serious content make it 
exceptional in the metal field. According to a Chameleon Records spokeswoman, 
"Bombers" is scheduled to debut this weekend during the first third of MTV's 
"Headbangers Ball" program, which runs from midnight Saturday to 3 a.m. Sunday.

James Harman Band 
</P>
<P>
"Strictly Live . . . in '85! Vol. 1." 
</P>
<P>
(Rivera/Ice Pick) 
</P>
<P>
The best live albums make you feel as if you were there -- and wish that you 
truly had been. 
</P>
<P>
Harman's notes on the back cover of "Strictly Live" are right on target in 
pointing toward the ambient charm of being there that comes through on the 
album, which was recorded over two nights in March, 1985, at the Belly Up in 
Solana Beach. "It's all here, everything a live recording needs. . . . 
Feedback, stuff falling down, people talking and yelling, (guitarist Hollywood) 
Fats' noisy volume control, three guys playing harmonica in the front row, 
bartenders ringing bells and my favorite . . . some would-be percussionist 
clanking glasses or ashtrays together -- out of time -- all the way through the 
slow blues." 
</P>
<P>
Also present and accounted for is an astonishingly strong blues band -- Harman 
singing and playing the harmonica, Michael (Hollywood Fats) Mann and David 
(Kid) Ramos on guitars, Willie J. Campbell on bass and Stephen T. Hodges on 
drums. In a way, the belated appearance of "Strictly Live" makes it a nostalgic 
look back at a band that no longer exists -- Fats died in 1986 after joining 
the Blasters; Campbell and Ramos left in 1988, leaving Harman and Hodges to 
carry on in a revamped lineup that hasn't made a record yet. But the 
performances on "Strictly Live" are far too enlivening to let any nostalgic 
pining for Harman's old band linger too long. 
</P>
<P>
The album follows the shape of an actual concert by this supremely versatile 
lineup: ambling amiably at the outset, dipping into some slow, deep, dark-night 
blues, then picking up rocking intensity. Throughout there is a sense of 
musicians playing off each other and their surroundings, doing something that 
was special to that night, that moment. Three songs out of the seven are 
devoted to the theme of barroom lust -- Harman's way of connecting with the 
crowd's own desires and fantasies of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
A flawlessly folksy and vibrant showman, Harman infuses personality into every 
vocal sally, every cagey and confident harmonica interjection. His singing 
breathes a smile of pleasure and a lighthearted hankering into such fun, sexy 
tunes as "By-Yourself Dance" and "Legs (Let the Little Girl Dance)." He shifts 
to sorrow on the dirgelike "Blues Walked In," his harp shifting between clean, 
piercing cries and thick, distorted sobs. 
</P>
<P>
On the nine-minute "You're Gone," the Harman Band does what only the great 
blues performers can: It seizes on the simplest of lyrical sentiments, and 
turns it into complex psychodrama as cathartic as good theater. There is a 
moment at the song's climax that is sheer, time-stopping perfection. The mighty 
Fats is finishing a devastating, swarming, rhythmically exploratory solo by 
laying on a meaty, chordal riff. Ramos jumps in with sizzling alarm, 
paralleling and vaulting above Fats' line as the rhythm section drives the song 
to a crescendo. And then Harman ascends to the peak of this mountain of sound 
and cuts loose with a harmonica cry that is like an arc of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, a good band simply would ride home on the wave of intensity it 
had created. But Harman and company do something that's beyond merely good. 
Instead of going for the crowd-pleasing rave-up that lies before them for the 
taking (and which they do indeed deliver later, on the chugging train-rhythm 
song "Goatman Holler"), they pull back. 
</P>
<P>
That swarming Fats solo, and the lightning bolt epiphany that followed, stood 
for something: the current of rising, unhinging emotion coursing through a man 
whose lover has gone. An Othello or a King Lear would rage on into insanity, 
but this is the blues, and the blues is not about tragic fate. The blues is 
about finding a way to cope. 
</P>
<P>
So the band reins itself in, and Harman's voice steels itself, just as a 
sorrowing soul must steady itself and try to regain control. Then, at the end, 
with rage spent, but control too hard to maintain, the song breaks down in 
tears signaled by Harman's falsetto vocal cries and Fats' moist, barking guitar 
punctuation. The progression has gone from abject, stricken sorrow at the 
start, to dangerous anger at the climax, to a potentially cleansing grief at 
the end, with each stage eloquently stated and fully felt. A band can't do any 
better than that.

CRITIC AT LARGE: CONTRADICTIONS OF CASTING -- A PUZZLEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: SUPERSTARS OFFER ONE SET OF PROBLEMS, UNKNOWNS ANOTHER.

Up to its last reel, "Stanley and Iris" was a very promising film. It centered 
on an important issue (adult illiteracy); it carried an authentic sense of 
blue-collar urban America; it featured two of the biggest stars in the 
business, Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro. It sank with hardly a ripple. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the charismatic presence of Paul Newman in a fine performance, "Blaze" 
flickered out disappointingly. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the issue "Mountains of the Moon," an impressively scaled 
historical epic with two exciting but unknown actors in the two major roles, 
has not found the audiences you would have thought it deserved and might get. 
</P>
<P>
As the late king of Siam might have observed, it's a puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
What the evidence says, and it is part of the risk in a high-risk business, is 
that stars cannot save a picture audiences don't want to see. But casting 
unknowns means that a movie had better have a very strong and appealing script. 
</P>
<P>
The plus of casting stars is their bankability. The money people are willing to 
lend money on the strength of the stars' visibility and track records. The real 
risk is that the stars carry with them all the baggage of their previous 
performances and, perhaps more important, of all their publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The charge against Jane Fonda, having nothing to do with her present or past 
politics, was simply that she is by now too well known as a super-successful 
careerist to be persuasive as an oppressed assembly line worker in a bakery. 
And De Niro, although he has been at home in blue-collar country much of his 
career, was also thought to be too successful to pass muster as a well-spoken 
cafeteria drudge who is also illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
(There is evidence that some adult illiterates develop considerable speaking 
skills to help hide their illiteracy, but it's a footnote point.) 
</P>
<P>
It's the miracle of star acting that audiences willingly suspend their 
disbeliefs to accept Dustin Hoffman as an autistic savant, for example, or 
Meryl Streep as an Australian housewife or Tom Cruise as a rage-filled 
paraplegic. But when that suspension of disbelief doesn't happen -- and it may 
well have nothing do with the acting as acting -- there is hell to pay in the 
accounting department. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that the customers didn't give two hoots about Gov. Earl Long 
and the fetching stripper who came into his life, and it didn't make any 
difference who enacted him. It may be, to some degree, that Paul Newman has 
been Northern urban so often that red galluses and a corn-pone accent only 
reveal the actor acting. 
</P>
<P>
That, finally, is the real challenge, to conceal all the artifices of which the 
movies are built. When a movie works, the acting as acting is invisible; music, 
photography and all the rest become, as it were, merely inevitable, and the 
surrender to the dream is total. When it doesn't work, you're watching a movie 
and you know it. 
</P>
<P>
In certain instances, like John Waters' current "Cry-Baby," knowing it's an 
outrageous camp on the movies is the whole idea, and the frenetic joke is its 
own pleasure. But when you're meant to be there, in Waterbury or Louisiana, and 
you aren't, quite, it's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
There is an irony in speculating that "Mountains of the Moon" might have been a 
more substantial box-office success with star actors in its two key roles. 
Patrick Bergin and Iain Glen were splendid as the explorers Richard Burton and 
John Speke, and they almost certainly have conspicuous careers ahead of them. 
(There is a further irony in that their admirers will then want to look back 
and see "Mountains of the Moon" again.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spectacular African scenery, the robust drama, the high emotions 
and the evident passion director Bob Rafelson brought to the project, its 
historical basis is not widely known and without the "holler" of star names, an 
exceptional film has had hard going. 
</P>
<P>
It's a further complication, but true to say, that the presence of Tom Cruise 
and his pre-existing image as one of the sexiest young stars around was an 
immeasurable help to "Born on the Fourth of July." His performance, one of the 
best of any year, was an almost total departure from his image, although the 
glimpses of the handsome young Cruise as the pre-Vietnam Ron Kovic heightened 
the tragedy of the later Kovic in his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
The relentless intensity of the film made it a grueling experience; it would 
I'm sure have been an even harder sell without the lure of Cruise as being not 
just young and appealing but self-effacingly brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Day-Lewis had had the beginnings of a fine career before "My Left Foot," 
with memorable roles in "Room With a View," "My Beautiful Laundrette" and a 
superb leading part in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." But in "My Left 
Foot" he was unrecognizable, as unknown as a known actor has been since John 
Hurt was the Elephant Man. The fiery and uncompromised nature of his portrayal 
of Christy Brown generated the word of mouth that made it a star-creating role 
and led to that thunderous, spontaneous standing ovation at the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
What seems finally true is that there are virtually no stars the customers will 
go to see in anything these days. Eddie Murphy perhaps. Which actress? Who 
else? Stars will generally enhance the success of a successful script (Kevin 
Costner in "Field of Dreams"). Relative unknowns can enhance the charm of a 
successful script (the players in "sex, lies, and videotape" and "Mystic 
Pizza") and may become stars in the process. 
</P>
<P>
But if there are puzzlements about casting, and there surely are, the iron law, 
unrusted since it was announced early in the 17th Century, is still that the 
play's the thing.

SUPPORT FOR $178 MILLION TO NEA CALLED 'OVERWHELMING'; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: THE CHAIRMAN OF A HOUSE PANEL EXPECTS THE PROGRAM TO SURVIVE A NEW ROUND 
OF ATTACKS. 
</P>

<P>
The chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with the $178-million funding of 
the embattled National Endowment for the Arts said Wednesday he believes that 
"overwhelming" support will ensure continuation of the program despite a new 
volley of attacks from congressional colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), after hearing a dozen congressional witnesses 
testify before his Education and Labor subcommittee on postsecondary education, 
told reporters he feared that the NEA was in jeopardy last year because of 
public furor over its sponsorship of assertedly pornographic and blasphemous 
art works. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are now finding, both inside and outside Congress, overwhelming support 
for reauthorization," he said. "The only question is whether there should be 
restrictions on the money." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he opposes any censorship powers for the endowment, but the 
majority of witnesses called for a ban on tax dollars for projects that are 
obscene or attack religion. Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Mel Hancock 
(R-Mo.) demanded outright abolition of the NEA, and others asked for 
restrictions to bar support of exhibits such as the Robert Mapplethorpe 
photographs that sparked public outcry last year. But Reps. Rosemary Oakar 
(D-Ohio), Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), a 
silversmith who claimed to be one of the few artists in the House, warned 
against congressional attempts to impose censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Oakar deplored "all this negative stuff which I think is somewhat sick" aimed 
at about 20 of 302,000 grants. She praised President Bush for increasing the 
requested amount this year and for his opposition to censorship language. 
</P>
<P>
"We have stayed out of it, and we ought to keep staying out of it," she said of 
proposals for congressional restrictions on the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the subcomittee accused opponents of unfairly branding endowment 
backers as supporters of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done that, but I can't say that those who do are illogical," 
Rohrabacher replied in an exchange with Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.), the only 
Republican member of the subcommittee supporting unrestricted NEA funds. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he hoped this would be the final hearing on reauthorization of 
the NEA's budget and that he would have a bill ready to go to the House floor 
by "late spring." Earlier, representatives of artists' groups announced the 
formation of the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, decrying controls 
on the government arts program. At a breakfast news conference, they said they 
would work to defeat Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), leader of 
Senate efforts to block funds for allegedly obscene or blasphemous works of 
art. "Mr. Rohrabacher next year will be going back to his surfboard," predicted 
Jeffrey Chester, Los Angeles representative of the National Alliance of Media 
Art Centers. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte R. Murphy of Washington, executive director of the National Assn. of 
Artists' Organizations, said Helms and other conservatives "have made this a 
campaign issue and we'll be prepared to respond. We have support in every 
congressional district."

THE LEE ATWATER ALBUM: A POLITICIAN SINGS THE BLUES; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: GOP CHAIRMAN AND AMATEUR GUITARIST GETS POWERFUL BACKING FROM 
R&amp;B GIANTS B.B. KING, ISAAC HAYES, SAM MOORE AND OTHERS ON HIS 13-SONG 
PACKAGE.

<P>
President Bush doesn't play on the new album featuring Lee Atwater, his former 
campaign manager and the current Republican Party chairman who is also a noted 
blues fan and amateur guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a King on "Red Hot &amp; Blue," which is due in record stores on 
Tuesday: B.B. King, that is. And the album features a host of other R&amp;B 
royalty, including Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas, Chuck Jackson and Sam Moore, all 
collaborating with Atwater in a (pardon the expression) democratic presentation 
of affectionately rendered blues and soul standards. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who is in a New York hospital for treatment of a brain tumor, shares 
lead guitar duties with King and is lead or co-vocalist on seven of the album's 
13 songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had a chance to do their thing," said Hayes, co-producer of six of 
the songs, by phone from his home in Atlanta. Hayes, best known for his music 
from the movie "Shaft" and as the writer and producer of the Sam &amp; Dave 
classics "Soul Man" and "Hold On I'm Comin'," met Atwater while visiting a 
friend who worked at the inaugural headquarters in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the first to say, 'Hey man, I'm no accomplished musician. You guys are 
the pros. You tell me what to do,' " Hayes said of the album project. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater is best known for his passionate playing of hardball politics. He's 
credited with the aggressive campaign strategy (including the notorious Willie 
Horton ads) that boosted George Bush to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But in the new album's liner notes, Atwater writes, "I have three loves in my 
life. My family is first, then comes music and politics. . . . I don't think 
anything is more helpful to the body politic or to the people in general than 
music, especially this kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Columbia, S.C., native grew up frequenting blues clubs in the 
South, and by the time he was a teen he was playing in bands that sometimes 
backed such visiting stars as Percy Sledge and Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
This passion came to national attention when he put together a pre-inaugural 
youth concert last year in which he jammed with top blues and R&amp;B stars. 
The new album, released by former California Lt. Gov. Mike Curb's Curb Records, 
was an outgrowth of that concert. Atwater's portion of the album royalties have 
been earmarked for three nonprofit groups, including D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education). 
</P>
<P>
Not all responses to Atwater's blues ventures have been positive, in light of 
Republican policies seen by some as antithetical to minority interests. 
</P>
<P>
New York rock critic Dave Marsh, in the current issue of his Rock &amp; Roll 
Confidential newsletter, writes, "Even if (Atwater was a great performer), the 
presence of the Republican Party chairman on the recording scene would be 
toxic." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes laughed at the notion. "First of all, music should be for all people," he 
said. "It should be free. No one should put a tag on music and say who's to 
like what. If it suits your fancy, you embrace it, and that's what that little 
boy from South Carolina did. I don't see it having anything to do with party 
affiliation."

HEALTH: A SELF-STYLED CONSUMER HEALTH ADVOCATE LASHES OUT AT THE FAT CONTENT OF 
MCDONALD'S PRODUCTS. BUT THE FAST-FOOD COMPANY SAYS THE ADS ARE RECKLESS AND 
MISLEADING.

Nobody likes being called fat, including McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
The world's largest fast-food chain on Wednesday denounced full-page newspaper 
advertisements that stated "McDonald's, Your Hamburgers Have Too Much Fat!" and 
urged the company and other restaurants to reduce the fat in their hamburger 
meat by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"It is reckless, it is misleading and we think it is intended more to scare 
people than to inform them," said McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner. 
</P>
<P>
The ads were paid for by Phil Sokolof, a wealthy Omaha, Neb., manufacturing 
executive and self-styled consumer health advocate. His previous ads have 
attacked the use of palm and coconut oils in cookies and other prepared foods. 
</P>
<P>
After the publication of those ads last year and in 1988, numerous food makers 
-- including Keebler and Pepperidge Farms -- agreed to cut back or eliminate 
tropical oils, which are high in saturated fat. Saturated fat consumption can 
increase cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease, many health officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's ads, which ran in newspapers that included the Wall Street 
Journal and USA Today, Sokolof's National Heart Savers Assn. took aim at 
saturated fats in beef and dairy products. Topped by a large headline that read 
"The Poisoning of America," the ad urged readers to "Eat smaller portions of 
leaner meats and lower fat dairy products." 
</P>
<P>
The ad also said McDonald's Big Mac and a bag of french fries contain 25 grams 
of saturated fats, and one ounce of Kraft American cheese contains 5.5 grams. 
Most health guidelines recommend individuals limit daily saturated fat 
consumption to 22 grams. 
</P>
<P>
But McDonald's disputed Sokolof's claims, saying that it already uses lean beef 
and that its Big Mac and fries contain anywhere from 15 to 19 grams of 
saturated fat. The chain noted that the fat content of its hamburger meat 
ranges from 17% to 19% -- not the 21.5% Sokolof claims in his ad. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's also announced that its U.S. outlets are in the process of 
introducing low-fat milk shakes and frozen yogurt. Additionally, the chain is 
testing a less fatty, 100% vegetable shortening to fry potatoes, which are 
currently immersed in a combination of vegetable and animal fats. 
</P>
<P>
"This continues this whole idea of the nutritional evolution of the menu," said 
Rubner. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's was not the only one upset at Sokolof's ads. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the ad is presented it tends to ignore the total diet," said Lisa Coe, 
spokeswoman for the United Dairy Industry Assn. Coe noted that consumers can 
balance their consumption of high fat foods with less fatty alternatives to 
keep their total fat intake within recommended guidelines. "It's all a 
trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers, including The Times, refused to run the ad. Times spokeswoman 
Laura Morgan said the paper rejected the ad because it was believed to be 
unfair, and The Times feared the legal liability of running an ad that made 
accusations against a particular company. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolof -- who suffered a heart attack 24 years ago that he blamed on high 
cholesterol levels -- and his high-profile campaign were supported by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
"His attempt to alert people to the dangers of saturated fat is a good one," 
said Jayne Hurley, the center's nutritionist. "Americans are eating way too 
much saturated fat." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Sokolof's ads aimed at palm and coconut oils garnered more 
attention and had more impact than years of studies and lobbying by her own 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly shows how effective one person with a lot of money can be," said 
Hurley.

RYAN CONFIRMED AS NATION'S TOP THRIFT REGULATOR; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: THE SENATE VOTE IS SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>

<P>
The Senate handed President Bush an important victory Wednesday by confirming 
T. Timothy Ryan Jr. as the nation's top savings and loan regulator, despite his 
lack of financial experience and admissions of past drug use. 
</P>
<P>
After a determined lobbying campaign by the Bush Administration, the Senate 
voted 62 to 37 to grant Ryan a five-year term as director of the Office of 
Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the agency, Ryan will preside over the government's efforts to 
salvage the scandalized thrift industry and to determine which S&amp;Ls are so 
badly crippled that they warrant seizure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want the S&amp;L crisis to be met head on, let's give Tim Ryan a 
chance," said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.). Seventeen Democrats, 
most of them from the South, joined the Senate's 45 Republicans to give Ryan a 
comfortable margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration was particularly anxious to get Ryan confirmed to guarantee 
that the OTS will have unquestioned power to regulate the trillion-dollar 
thrift industry, which is undergoing a traumatic shrinkage and restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital the Senate act now," said Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah). "The critical 
enforcement authority of the OTS is being thwarted in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a district court judge blocked the impending government takeover of 
an Illinois S&amp;L on the grounds that former OTS Director M. Danny Wall was 
never confirmed by the Senate. An appeals court stayed his order and will take 
up the case next Wednesday, when the Senate will be in recess. 
</P>
<P>
Garn argued that confirming Ryan as the nation's chief thrift regulator would 
remove the cloud of legal uncertainty over the OTS and bolster the agency's 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Clear-cut enforcement power is vital because it "enables the OTS to place 
thrifts operating with inadequate capital under government conservatorship or 
receivership," said Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic opponents argued that Ryan, a pension lawyer and former Labor 
Department official, lacked the financial expertise to help clean up the 
aftermath of the biggest financial scandal in American history. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thrift institutions have collapsed in recent years, destroyed by a 
combination of excessively risky investments, weakening real estate markets 
and, in some cases, insider fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The government insures customer deposits up to $100,000, so taxpayers 
ultimately will bear the burden of shutting down insolvent thrifts at a cost 
that could reach $285 billion over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.) noted that billions of dollars were stolen by crooked 
S&amp;L managers who reaped "big yachts, fields full of racehorses, huge 
diamonds." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting financial mess requires an OTS chief with more expertise than 
Ryan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone to address the scandal was brought to us -- they send us a man, and 
the defense of this man was, 'we couldn't find anybody (else),' " said Dixon. 
"My God, we couldn't find anybody." 
</P>
<P>
For the massive S&amp;L repair job, "you want somebody of towering capacity," 
said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). "At a minimum, you want somebody who 
has a well-established reputation as an expert in finance. This is a big, big 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's supporters said that specific expertise was not necessary and that his 
determination and managerial abilities would be sufficient for the task. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this man possess leadership?" Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) asked 
rhetorically. "That is what is needed to move into the eye of the storm 
surrounding the savings industry." Expert knowledge is no assurance of success, 
argued Dole. "I don't think you have to be a thrift insider, a so-called thrift 
expert, to take on the job of overseeing the savings and loan industry," he 
said. "Let's face it, it's the insiders who got us where we are today, drowning 
in a cesspool of unbridled greed and fiscal irresponsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's admissions that he used marijuana and tried cocaine once or twice in the 
1970s were brushed aside by his defenders and did not become a serious issue in 
the debate over his qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) referred to a survey showing that 65 million 
Americans had tried marijuana and 21 million had used cocaine. It is "an 
unpleasant fact of life" that millions have experimented with these illegal 
drugs, Specter said. However, he said, "this is not a disqualifier" for persons 
seeking important jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Dole voiced anger over public leaks last week of the information about Ryan's 
drug usage. The disclosure was contained in FBI reports available only to 
members of the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be using FBI files just to smear someone," Dole said. "What he 
may have done 17 years ago, it's (now) public and it ended 17 years ago."

INNOVATION: NEWSPAPERS MUST REACH OUT, TOUCH READER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headlines may be snappy, the stories all crisp and comprehensive and each 
photo compelling to the eye, but the sad truth is that the type of newspaper 
you are now reading probably is obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that video has superseded print as this culture's medium of choice 
(although it has), or that newspapers are inherently incapable of capturing and 
holding people's attention. It's that most newspapers -- as currently written, 
designed and published -- are giving people less and less of what they really 
need. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are misnamed; the idea that newspapers are about the news is simply 
wrong. If you look at the history of newspapers, what you will discover is that 
their role was less as a vehicle for news than as a medium to create 
communities of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Consider your own reasons for reading this paper: Is it just to get the latest 
information? Or is it to feel connected to a part of a larger community? 
Remember, one of the most successful ad campaigns in history was not "Reach Out 
and Inform Someone" -- it was "Reach Out and Touch Someone." People want to 
feel connected; news is just one way to continually energize those connections. 
</P>
<P>
So the real issue here is less "packaging the news" than creating these 
communities. That's why tomorrow's newspapers have to be fundamentally 
different from today's. Editors and publishers need to explore ways to build 
newer and tighter relationships with their readers and advertisers. Instead of 
relying on editorial rhinoplasties and promotional gimcracks, successful 
newspapers will use emerging technologies to redefine their roles as the vital 
community medium. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that most newspaper editors are prisoners of print; they think 
purely in terms of texts -- stories, quotes, photos, charts and columns (like 
this one). Their notion of high technology is the newsroom word-processing 
system. Publishers are little better -- innovation to them is high-speed insert 
machines and ink that won't smear onto readers' fingers. Everything revolves 
around delivering news and advertising in a nice paper package. 
</P>
<P>
That's shortsighted. Newspapers have to stop treating their readers as readers 
and start treating them as people. People want to do more than just read; they 
want to act. They want to connect with people and ideas on a variety of levels. 
</P>
<P>
What newspapers should become -- and must become -- are gateways to these new 
connections. Increasingly, newspapers are going to shift from being editorial 
and design driven -- new coverage, columnists and formats -- to technology 
driven, with telecommunications, audio/video and computational media used to 
redefine the role of the printed page. The intelligent deployment of technology 
is the key to transforming an audience of passive readers into an active 
community of shared interests. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is no reason why each newspaper section can't have its own 
answering machine to take reader comments and suggestions. Transcribe these 
verbal "letters to the editor" and weave them into the section. Print a 
custom-tailored questionnaire in the business section on taxes or in the sports 
section on the all-star team and encourage people to fax in their responses. 
</P>
<P>
These "fax polls" offer a way to build new links with the reader, and 
technology can turn the reader into a participant. USA Today has done something 
like this with 900-number telephone polls with some success -- but it's handled 
more like a vox populi gimmick than an integral part of the paper's editorial 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
But integrating text and telecommunications makes sense. Newsday in Long 
Island, N.Y., has enjoyed significant revenue from its 976 sports and weather 
phone lines. Why not put a 900 number at the end of a story on, say mutual fund 
investment options? For a small fee, the reader can call the number to get more 
information from the journalist who did the story. The way you do it is have 
the journalist tape a five-minute interview on the story and then "index" the 
interview so that people can use their touch-tone phone to access the bit of 
information they want. 
</P>
<P>
Blending print with this sort of audiotex service strikes me as an obvious way 
to get people to view the newspaper as a community information resource. There 
are all kinds of news and service-oriented stories that lend themselves to such 
audio augmentation. Most journalists I know would love to be able to write 
stories that get people interested enough to pick up a phone and call. 
</P>
<P>
There are enough personal computers out there that urban and suburban papers 
should give serious thought to putting up advertiser-sponsored computer 
bulletin boards. This isn't anything like the humongously expensive/disastrous 
videotex ventures of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
These bulletin boards offer low-cost communications and access to a very 
desirable demographic. Think of it as an on-line newsletter for special 
interest groups. The bulletin board can point out relevant stories in the 
newspaper, and the newspaper points people with more specialized interests 
toward the bulletin boards. Putting past movie reviews or restaurant reviews 
on-line might be a genuine service. 
</P>
<P>
One also shouldn't ignore the role technology could play in creating a new 
level of responsiveness in advertising. There's nothing stopping a newspaper 
from serving as a clearinghouse for more information on its advertisers. For 
example, why shouldn't a newspaper offer to fax a restaurant menu of one of its 
advertisers to a reader requesting it? My gosh, some weekly newspapers already 
offer telephone mailboxes for their personals ads. Why shouldn't daily 
newspapers offer such services for its classified ad clientele? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are a bunch of newspapers, ranging from this one to the Hartford 
Courant, now exploring how best to transmit fax versions of themselves. And 
yes, Times Mirror, the parent of this newspaper, lost millions trying to turn 
the pig's ear of videotex into a silk purse of publishing profitability -- but 
those approaches to technology are nothing more than an extension of the print 
mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
They treat technology as a medium for dispensing data instead of as a tool to 
craft communities. The idea here is to get more than people's eyes involved in 
the newspaper. The goal is to use the newspaper as both a platform and a 
springboard to other media. Ideally, these media enhance the value of the 
newspaper and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
This technology-driven vision of the future of newspapers doesn't in any way 
jeopardize the next generation of Ben Hechts and Mike Roykos any more than the 
rise of television has killed the novel. There will always be a place for 
people who can write stories with style or present ideas with elan. But editors 
and publishers need to understand that their newspapers have to coexist and 
co-evolve within a new ecology of multiple media. It's not enough to publish 
all the news that's fit to print. You have to use all the tools you can to 
build and serve a community of people who want to do more than just read what 
you've written . . . and then turn the page.

BONWIT TELLER SELLS ITS NAME TO TRUMP GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANCE IGNON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the existing Bonwit Teller specialty retail chain will be closed, 
including the flagship store in Manhattan, under an agreement announced in 
bankruptcy court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A group of investors, including Donald J. Trump and a shopping mall developer, 
that won rights to the Bonwit Teller name paid $22 million for five of Bonwit 
Teller's 16 stores, including the outlet in Manhattan's Trump Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was approved by the federal bankruptcy court overseeing the Chapter 11 
filing by L. J. Hooker Corp., Bonwit Teller's owner and a subsidiary of 
Australia's Hooker Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford (Sandy) Sigoloff, who became a corporate savior when he engineered the 
stunning recovery of Wickes Cos. in the early 1980s, was unable to repeat the 
magic with the beleaguered chain. 
</P>
<P>
Sigoloff had been charged with resurrecting the 83-year-old Bonwit Teller in 
August. But after racking up at least $21 million in debt last year, Bonwit was 
auctioned this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump consortium includes Pyramid Cos., Alfred Taubman and Phil Palevsky. 
Stores in Boston and Buffalo, N.Y., will continue to operate under the Bonwit 
name. Trump plans to open another store at the Manhattan site. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker will continue operating Bonwit stores in the malls it owns in Cincinnati 
and in Columbia, S.C. Stores in Palm Beach, Fla.; Oakbrook, Ill.; Troy, Mich., 
and Chicago went to other buyers, who will operate the stores under different 
names. The total sale was worth $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Five other stores will be closed. In all, only four stores will remain open 
under the Bonwit name. 
</P>
<P>
Sigoloff, 59, said he regrets not having been able to rescue the chain. "Would 
I like to have saved it? You bet," he said. "But we came to the party too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
With the chain on the verge of financial collapse when he took over and 
subsequent delays in merchandise deliveries, Sigoloff had little chance, 
several industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Sigoloff earned the reputation as a turnaround specialist when he brought Santa 
Monica-based Wickes out of Chapter 11 reorganization in 1985, paying creditors 
between 90 and 100 cents on a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Although a success with Bonwit would have only enhanced that reputation, 
several industry analysts still lauded Sigoloff for keeping Bonwit alive long 
enough to attract a host of bidders for at least some of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done great," said Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, a 
monthly trade publication. "As far as salvaging the retail empire, I don't 
think there was any expectation of that." 
</P>
<P>
L. J. Hooker Corp. bought Bonwit in 1987. It also snapped up four other 
retailers, and has sold all of them except for a small Texas chain, including 
the venerable B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores. 
</P>
<P>
After overextending itself financially in its rush to build shopping malls and 
fill them with its retailers, Hooker filed for protection from its creditors on 
Aug. 9, 1989. Sigoloff was named chief executive of the company that same day 
and charged with salvaging what he could for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were initial hopes that Bonwit might make a comeback, Sigoloff 
said it was clear by October that the chain, which had been losing money for 
several years, would have to be sold.

Bank of New England to Cut 5,600 Jobs: Bank of New England said 5,000 job cuts, 
representing a third of its employees, will take place by year-end and are part 
of a strategic plan to stabilize the ailing bank. About 1,700 employees will be 
told over the next couple of days that they are no longer needed, and the 
remaining jobs will be cut through attrition, consolidations or through 
continued planned asset sales, the bank said.

Immune Response Corp. Plans Offering: The San Diego biotechnology company 
co-founded by Jonas Salk, which is trying to develop an AIDS vaccine, has filed 
for permission to hold an 2.2-million-share initial public stock offering to 
raise as much as $19.8 million. Now in advanced clinical trials at several 
medical centers, the firm's vaccine aims at stimulating patients' immune 
response systems to prevent the disease from progressing to full-blown AIDS. 
The company had planned to go public last fall, but the offering was called off 
after the stock market soured.

Decision Due on Bloomingdale's: Federated Stores, the parent of the Campeau 
Corp.'s U.S. retailing operations, said it will decide within 30 days whether 
to call off all efforts to sell its Bloomingdale's department store chain. The 
New York-based retailer was put up for sale last fall as part of a plan by 
Campeau to overhaul its department store divisions, but the move was put on a 
back burner in January when the department stores filed for bankruptcy court 
protection. Federated Stores said the Bloomingdale's chain is the only unit it 
currently is considering selling.

TWA OWNER IS SAID PONDERING EASTERN BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: CARL C. ICAHN IS REPORTEDLY TALKING WITH CREDITORS OF THE BANKRUPT 
COMPANY, BUT AN OFFER HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE.

As the unsecured creditors for Eastern Airlines step up pressure to sell the 
carrier, Trans World Airlines owner Carl C. Icahn has resurfaced as a possible 
buyer, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn and his associates held informal discussions recently with 
representatives of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., financial advisers to the 
committee of Eastern's unsecured creditors, said the sources, who spoke on 
condition they not be identified. The talks have been preliminary, and the 
notion of an Icahn bid for Eastern has not yet "ripened," one of them said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined comment on the matter. Icahn's office 
said he was unavailable for comment, and aides at Goldman Sachs did not 
immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs reportedly told the committee recently that TWA is not interested 
in bidding for Eastern, but a source close to the airline company said there is 
some interest. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors' committee, exasperated by Eastern's mounting losses, voted 
Tuesday to reject the airline's latest reorganization proposal and to seek the 
appointment of a special trustee to sell Eastern. The creditors have been 
soliciting possible buyers behind the scenes in recent weeks, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, a corporate investor who took TWA private in October, 1988, appears to 
have emerged as the predominant potential buyer, the sources said. They 
suggested he might bid for Eastern in concert with other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's interest in Miami-based Eastern goes back at least to September, 1988, 
when members of Eastern's machinists union met with him about a possible bid. 
After Eastern's filing for bankruptcy protection on March 9, 1989, and the 
subsequent collapse of an attempted buyout led by ex-baseball Commissioner 
Peter V. Ueberroth, Icahn was the unions' favorite to buy the strike-plagued 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants struck Eastern on March 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn was TWA's white knight in 1986, buying the airline in a $440-million deal 
to thwart an attempted takeover by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent 
Texas Air Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have noted a potential compatibility between Eastern, which 
operates mainly between the Northeast, Florida and Atlanta, and TWA, which is 
strongest in transatlantic operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Icahn backed off from Eastern last May. TWA said it needed more time to 
discuss with its unions the feasibility of integrating the TWA and Eastern work 
forces and was not prepared to submit a formal bid at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, battered by the strike, continues to report losses and is having 
difficulty attracting passengers. The rebuilt airline has sold more than $800 
million in assets with the approval of a U.S. bankruptcy court and would now be 
valued at far less than the $464 million offered by the Ueberroth group. 
</P>
<P>
TWA has problems of its own. It recently reported a net loss of $298.5 million 
in 1989.

EXECUTIVES ARE RELUCTANT TO RELOCATE TO SOUTHLAND

As major corporations pay more to relocate executives, they are finding 
executives less willing to move to Southern California, a new survey said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of the human resources directors surveyed at more than 
100 Southern California corporations in Russell Reynolds Associates' annual 
executive recruiting study said it is "somewhat" or "very" difficult to 
relocate executives here. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 71% said it was somewhat or very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
John S. Peterson, an executive recruiter for Russell Reynolds, said the area is 
full of business opportunities, but housing is just too expensive. So 
corporations find themselves spending more to bring and house executives here. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 45% of local corporations spend $40,001 or more to 
relocate executives -- those earning $75,000 or more annually -- to Southern 
California. That is up from 34% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
When executives come here, they often have to settle for smaller homes because 
of the high prices, Peterson said, adding that he has a client in Pittsburgh 
who lives on an acre of land but realizes that "won't be an option" when he 
comes out here. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two percent of the respondents said housing costs are a major deterrent 
in relocating here. Additional factors that make executives think twice before 
moving here are earthquakes, commute time, traffic, smog, drugs, gangs and 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago, people would have moved to Southern California in a New 
York-minute," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, to make relocating sweeter, companies are offering sign-on bonuses 
and interest-free home loans and guaranteeing job security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the survey found that 55% of executives from here are 
reluctant to relocate to other parts of the country.

TOKYO STOCKS PLUNGE 3.8% AT CLOSE OF EARLY TRADING 
</P>

<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed its slide this morning, with the Nikkei index 
plunging by nearly 1,100 points in the morning session to close at its lowest 
level this year. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices have eroded steadily since January and registered their 
second-worst daily fall -- of 6.6% -- on Monday. Stocks fluctuated wildly 
Tuesday and Wednesday, although they were showing some signs of stabilizing 
above the "support level" of 28,000 points on the 225-share Nikkei average as 
investors shored up confidence. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nikkei quickly fell through the 28,000-point level again today, 
dropping by more than 400 points in the first 15 minutes of trading and falling 
a total of 1,088.94 points, or 3.8%, by the end of the morning to 27,354.00. It 
was not clear whether stock prices would go into another free fall, but 
volatility was certain to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the pessimism were rumors that one or more small Japanese 
brokerage house was on the verge of bankruptcy because speculative investors 
were failing to meet margin calls. Share prices of securities companies in 
general have taken an unusual beating in the recent market downturn, along with 
banks and other financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
Speculator groups, which borrow heavily for their stock investments and post 
shares as collateral against further loans for further investments, have been 
under extreme pressure to meet margin calls, analysts say. Often they must sell 
stocks to do so, driving down prices and feeding a "vicious circle" in the 
psychology of the market. 
</P>
<P>
When margin calls cannot be met, the brokers must absorb the losses. 
</P>
<P>
"The brokers have been getting killed," said Alan Woodhull, a senior analyst in 
Tokyo for Merrill Lynch. "That's not all -- some of the banks and utilities are 
down to one-third of their peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Kazuhiro Miyake, an analyst for Nikko Securities Co.'s Nikko Research Center, 
said rumors about a brokerage collapsing fueled the selling this morning but 
were most likely premature. 
</P>
<P>
Miyake noted that Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's "Big Four" brokerages 
along with Nikko, Nomura and Daiwa, had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy 
after the first oil shock in the early 1970s, but the Ministry of Finance 
stepped in to rescue it with loans. Smaller securities houses were subject to 
buyouts and mergers in past market downturns, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult time for the brokerage sector," Miyake said. "The speculators 
are suffering a lot of losses, and the smaller brokerages are the hardest hit."

Before Japanese stocks went into their descending roller coaster ride, the 
Nikkei had soared to a lofty peak of 38,915.87 on Dec. 29, when the average 
price/earnings ratio stood at 62.4. The index was gutted by more than 28% by 
this morning, and the average P/E ratio on the first section of the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange was down to about 45. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts differ on whether the current stock decline represents a crisis-style 
meltdown of the Tokyo market or a healthly correction to more sustainable 
levels, after speculation and excess cash inflated prices out of line with 
corporate earnings and other fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
Nikko's Miyake, for one, said the current 28% market decline ranks only as the 
fifth worse in postwar trading in Tokyo. By comparison, the Nikkei suffered a 
cumulative loss of 37% from its peak following the first oil shock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's Woodhull characterized the present price plunge is a 
"reordering of priorities" after a long period in which the market was clearly 
overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
"The hype has been taken off the market, and a lot of stocks are simply getting 
a haircut," Woodhull said. "Nothing has changed, except we have some 
macroeconomic shifts going on" such as in interest rates and foreign exchange 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Most traders and analysts agree that the atmosphere in Kabuto-cho -- Japan's 
Wall Street -- is now one of resignation, not panic. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which traded momentarily above the 160-yen level on Monday, was 
trading in mid-morning in Tokyo today at 158.18.

CONTEL TO REORGANIZE, TRIM ITS WORK FORCE BY 600 JOBS

Contel of California, the state's third-largest local phone company, said 
Wednesday that it will close a regional billing center in Bakersfield but beef 
up its headquarters in Victorville to cover operations in eight Western states. 
</P>
<P>
The moves are part of a national reorganization and consolidation announced in 
Atlanta by the company's corporate parent, Contel Corp. Among other things, the 
changes will trim the national work force by 4%, or about 600 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
How many California jobs will be affected has yet to be determined, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Contel said the change will combine telephone operations from the present three 
regions and 12 divisions into six multi-state operating groups reporting 
directly to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Contel provides local phone service in 30 states. In California, where it 
serves communities in the fast-growing high desert and the mountain resorts of 
Big Bear and Mammoth Lakes, Contel employs 1,800 to serve about 300,000 
customers. Under the reorganization, Victorville will become headquarters for 
local telephone operations in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, 
Idaho, Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Al Sabsavitz, spokesman for the California unit, said the reorganization, which 
will eliminate one layer of management, is an effort to make the company more 
responsive to customers and to the growing competition in telecommunications. 
The reduction in jobs also reflects improved telephone technology that requires 
less maintenance and operating personnel. 
</P>
<P>
It is the firm's first organizational overhaul in 18 years, Sabsavitz said.

A TOPSY-TURVY FIRST QUARTER FOR MUTUAL FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: A SURVEY FINDS THAT MANY OF LAST YEAR'S HOT FUNDS HAVE COOLED. AND 
SOME COLD ONES HAVE HEATED UP.

Investors who stuck it out with some of the worst performing mutual funds over 
the past few years got their reward during the first quarter of 1990 as fund 
performance made a U-turn, turning once-sorry performers into stars, and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
Those who invested in technology stocks, which had been languishing for more 
than two years, did particularly well, with six of the top 10 mutual funds 
heavily invested in some sort of technology group. But investors who had been 
riding high with Japanese stocks got pummeled, according to Lipper Analytical 
Services' quarterly survey of mutual fund performance released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All the funds that were still playing last year's game got hit very heavily," 
said Don Phillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values in Chicago. "And those that 
were out of favor last year had a pretty good quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Region Funds, battered by record declines in the Japanese stock market, 
lost 13.18% of its value during the three-month period -- by far the worst 
performance of any group, according to Lipper. Other hard-hit groups included 
gold-oriented funds, utilities, financial services and international funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was also a poor quarter for mutual funds overall, with only two 
industry groups -- science and technology, and European region funds -- posting 
positive performances. Science and technology was up 2.68%, while European 
region funds rose a scant 0.83%, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
On a brighter note, the average mutual fund outperformed the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index. The S&amp;P 500 was down 3.01%, while the average 
mutual fund fell only 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess, for some people, the lesson this quarter was (values) don't have to 
go up," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. 
</P>
<P>
Despite severe market drops in 1987 and 1989, stock performance has been 
phenomenally strong throughout the 1980s, Lipper said. And that has given 
investors the erroneous impression that investing in stock-oriented mutual 
funds is almost a sure road to riches. 
</P>
<P>
But if the first quarter is any guide, the past decade's performance is not 
likely to be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything does well in 1990, we would think it would be those funds that 
invest in companies with strong earnings power," Lipper said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the top-performing mutual fund managers are not overly optimistic about 
the market's chances for the year. The economy is still not terribly strong, 
they note, and that signals lower corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Would I be surprised if computers were up 30% for the year and (Fidelity 
Select Computers) was a top-performing fund? No. But would I be surprised if 
they were up 60%? Absolutely," said Larry Bowman, portfolio manager for 
Fidelity Investments' computer and technology funds, which ranked as the 
nation's fourth- and eighth-best performers for the quarter, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Fund experts said last quarter also illustrates why investors should never 
chase the best-performing funds. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, for example, acknowledges that the funds he manages have posted "yucky" 
performances over the past two years. During 1988, Fidelity's computer fund 
lost 5.05% of its value. In 1989, the return was a mere 6.8% -- well below the 
nearly 32% return of the S&amp;P 500 index. This quarter, the fund was up 
15.82%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Strategic Investments was the top-performing fund last quarter with 
a 32.33% return, and it is now in the worst-performing group, with a loss of 
21.10%. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter's other top-performing funds included Strategic Gold and Minerals, 
ranked first with a 19.15% return; Equity Strategies was second, with a 17.96% 
return, and Financial Strategic Portfolio: Technology was fifth, with a 10.56% 
return. 
</P>
<P>
The worst performers: Nikko Japan Tilt Fund, which posted a 29.9% decline; SLH 
Investments: Pacific, down 21.43%; Strategic Investments, down 21.10%; DFA 
Group: Japan Small Company, down 19.91%, and Keystone International, down 
17.52%.

ARCHITECTURE: N.Y. ARTIST HELPS WED UCSD LAB TO SETTING

<P>
For the most part, new buildings at UC San Diego have disregarded their 
settings. Until a few years ago, this was a campus of low-key wooden structures 
set among the eucalyptuses. 
</P>
<P>
Into their midst in recent years dropped such intergalactic interlopers as the 
Price Center and the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific 
Studies -- contemporary buildings that would work better in a more commercial 
or industrial setting. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the new Molecular Biology Research Facility Unit II, designed by 
architects Moore Ruble Yudell in collaboration with San Diego landscape 
architect Andy Spurlock and New York artist Jackie Ferrara, is one of the best 
buildings on campus. It proves that a contemporary structure housing 
cutting-edge research can cut a subtle profile. The building was funded by the 
Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Houston, which has a history of backing 
well-designed research facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its fine design, the building marks the first time the Stuart 
Collection, which oversees public art on campus, has been involved so early in 
the design process. Mary Beebe, the collection's director, suggested that 
artist Ferrara join the design team. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara first met architect Charles Moore at Max Protetch Gallery in New York 
in the early '80s, when Moore's drawings were in one room, while Ferrara's art 
was in another. 
</P>
<P>
Moore and Ferrara had a meeting to test their compatibility, and, despite 
cultural differences, they hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other new campus buildings, which fail to address the campus master plan 
and its key circulation routes, the new research facility was intended to be 
relatively secluded. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want a lot of foot traffic, but they did want some sense of 
connection to the campus," said architect John Ruble, who, with partner Moore, 
played a key role in the design. "It's a building where a few initiated people 
work long hours. Any laboratory building is a controlled environment. The air 
is conditioned and filtered, and the work can involve toxic stuff. They didn't 
want uncontrolled access." 
</P>
<P>
Unit II, situated on a prominent site near the southern entrance on Gilman 
Drive, was artfully grafted to 3-year-old Unit I, a stark concrete-block 
structure designed by San Diego architect Leonard Veitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Why does this new building succeed where its peers on campus fail? 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because its designers knew where to add flourishes and where to play 
their hand close to the vest. 
</P>
<P>
The facade facing Gilman Drive, made of steel, glass and concrete, is neither 
overtly busy, like the Price Center, nor awkwardly composed, like the massive 
new concrete Engineering Building Unit I designed by San Diego architects BSHA. 
</P>
<P>
Materials in muted grays and greens, combined with the subtle mound of earth 
between the building and Gilman, help the structure recede behind a screen of 
eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
The real drama is saved for the other facade. Here, terraces detailed by 
Ferrara from Spurlock's original landscape plan flank main entry steps that 
lead to a dramatic courtyard detailed by Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the building consists of two wings of laboratories on three 
levels, joined by the architects' entry plaza and Ferrara's terraces. 
</P>
<P>
Screened by low walls of concrete block, the terraces are intended for the 
scientists who work in the building, not for the campus community at large. 
</P>
<P>
Consisting of angular slate paths set in gravel, punctuated by lines of 
Australian willows, the terraces make a striking, somber statement, though even 
Ferrara is not sure what emotions she hoped to convey. 
</P>
<P>
"I met some of the scientists, and came away with a notion about a stone 
garden," Ferrara said. "I consistently try to do work that is non-referential, 
so that it will tend to have timeless connotations, like Stonehenge or the 
pyramids." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara modeled the shapes of her two terraces on the footprints of the wings 
they parallel. 
</P>
<P>
Moore designed the curved entry steps between the terraces. Ferrara had 
proposed angular steps, but the curved forms are better. They serve as a sort 
of animated hinge between the terraces. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the entry to Unit I, directly connected to sidewalks, offers the 
easiest pedestrian access to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ferrara didn't see the architects' design before she did her work, 
there is a surprising continuity of mood between the terraces and the 
courtyard: primitive and monumental. 
</P>
<P>
Inlaid granite gives richness to weighty concrete-block walls around the entry 
court. Smooth plaster is sculpted into a variety of classically influenced 
forms, such as large pilasters on the main entry tower and courtyard columns 
topped with angular Pharaoh's heads. 
</P>
<P>
Curved and straight concrete benches in the courtyard form a yin-yang sort of 
ensemble in front of a fountain beneath an arch. A shading trellis of thick 
wood beams rests atop massive plaster columns. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the architects gave the labs a sense of openness reminiscent of Louis 
Kahn's Salk Institute, barely a mile away. Natural light comes from large banks 
of conventional and clerestory windows. 
</P>
<P>
The building, now partly occupied, opens officially in June. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ferrara, clearly a perfectionist, isn't done. For one thing, she 
doesn't like the "elephant trunk" shapes of the stair railings near her 
terraces. These will be altered or replaced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the school is trying to find money for 15 teak benches designed by 
Ferrara for the terraces, Beebe said. These would make the expanses of gravel 
and slate more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara's successful collaboration with Moore Rubell Yudell and The Spurlock 
Office proves that involving an artist early in the design process can produce 
art more subtle and innovative than the plop-art afterthoughts bolted to so 
many concrete pads outside other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: San Diego architect Lee Platt died Saturday after brain surgery. 
Platt, 40, had won several awards for his work. Most recently, he completed 
designs for a recreation center in Rancho Penasquitos and the Maritime Museum 
in Old Town. Platt's late father, Robert, was also a local architect. Platt is 
survived by a daughter Emily, 2, and wife, Chica, an architect who will take 
over as president of Platt Architects. Services will be held at 10 a.m. today 
at Glen Abbey Memorial Park. Donations can be made to Mercy Hospital and the 
Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's column on the new Uptown District project in Hillcrest should have 
credited Lorimer-Case Architects for all residential and commercial design on 
the portion of the development east of Vermont Street.

SOCIETY: A GALA PARTY IS STAGED ABOARD STAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Maritime Museum, the only museum in town that candidly admits to 
being partly filled with bilge, rolled red carpets down its two gangplanks 
March 24 to welcome about 260 supporters to its second annual, almost-seagoing 
gala. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the city's more dedicated salts, including Gordon and Jeanne Frost 
and Art and Dulcie DeFever, were among the first to board the venerable Star of 
India for the floating cocktail reception. 
</P>
<P>
The calmer types in the crowd arrived on the Embarcadero in black tie, but 
quite a few others bowed to the belated "Mardi Gras Magic" theme and turned out 
in costumes that, in the true New Orleans style, owed their inspirations mostly 
to nonsense and whimsy. A woman in a comically conical, Guinevere-style 
headdress, Groucho Marx glasses and a green nose rather exemplified the jovial 
silliness that was at the core of this event. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Kay Black, who greeted guests at the head of the gangplank, followed 
her own sartorial advice and donned, among other things, a metallic fright wig 
that made some vague reference to Cleopatra and probably would have sent that 
lady in search of an asp. 
</P>
<P>
"You might think this is 'Mardi Gras Magic,' but it's really 'Katherine's 
Madness,' " Black said, referring to herself and giggling as she watched the 
costumed guests parade around the Star's main deck. Clowns handed out balloons 
twisted into silly shapes, and the crowd, inclined to silliness, carried them 
like trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The scene varied rather notably from the Star's seafaring days in the 19th 
Century, when seasick English and Irish immigrants bound for Australia hung 
over the same high gunwales at which museum guests gathered for wine and 
witticisms. The central deck also supported an iced buffet of raw oysters and 
clams that would, ironically, have been an impossibility on a sea voyage. Those 
who wished to escape the cold winds that scoured the deck could retreat to a 
similar display in the hold. 
</P>
<P>
The briny blasts that swept the ship encouraged lingerers to scurry over to the 
main event aboard the ferryboat Berkeley, which designer Dick Ford had hung 
with towering, umbrella-like cascades of twinkling lights that made the old 
ferry look like a Mardi Gras float in a New Orleans parade. A second effect was 
to make the boat, silhouetted against the onyx waters, appear to have been 
strung around with diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 strings of lights were draped both outside the boat and in its two 
decks, and Ford said that hanging required, if not an advanced degree in 
engineering, at least a degree of ingenuity. "We had to hang all these lights, 
but we couldn't blow up the boat," said Ford, who explained that the Berkeley's 
historical designation precludes the use of nails, tape or any sort of 
fastener. Thus the lights had to be draped over existing supports; one idea 
that was considered but discarded called for the strategic placement of hula 
hoops. 
</P>
<P>
The event benefitted the preservation of both ships and lured supporters with 
such blandishments as a casino deck, pasta and dessert buffets and dancing to 
the Bill Green Orchestra, which eschewed chanteys in favor of its usual Big 
Band sound. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Pierce co-chaired the gala and assisted in greeting a roster of guests 
that included Alison and George Gildred, Ruth and Gordon Lacy, Barbara Iredale, 
Barbara and Bob Sharp, Marilyn and Russ Downer, Jan and Mike Madigan, Virginia 
and Brick Landon, Laurie and Dick Blackington, Dolly and Jim Poet, Billy and 
Mac McKnight, Dottie and Hal Georgens, Paul Black, Vi and Dan McKinney, Esther 
Burnham with Jack Lasher, Ann and Carl Bowman, Linda and Joe Basquez, Patty and 
Rick Ghio, Martha and Bill Ehringer, Isabelle and John Murphy, and Jane and 
Norm Neely. 
</P>
<P>
A tradition inaugurated by Mikhail Baryshnikov and continued by Rudolf Nureyev 
and Japan's famed Kodo drummers was sustained March 23 by the tap dancing 
Nicholas Brothers, Fayard and Harold, who attended the "Gotta Sing Gotta Dance" 
gala that closed the season for the San Diego Foundation for Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicholas Brothers strolled into the U.S. Grant Ballroom to sustained 
applause well past 11 p.m., following their appearance in the opening night of 
the "Gotta Sing Gotta Dance" program presented by the foundation at the Civic 
Theatre. The late hour also was traditional for foundation galas, and guests 
were just settling down to their clear oxtail broth, many unwilling to break 
the pastry crust that topped it until the other star of the show, Cab Calloway, 
had made his appearance. But that was not to be; the 83-year-old entertainer, 
having expended much energy in telling the Civic Theatre audience the story of 
Minnie the Moocher, evidently chose to retire to his suite instead. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of more than 300 was notably shy on low-down hoochie coochers, 
although it was heavy on dancers, most of whom found the music of Fro Brigham 
and his Preservation Band sufficiently inspiring. Performing Arts Foundation 
founder Danah Fayman has always made a point of inviting casts to 
post-performance suppers and galas, a nicety that adds a certain texture and 
occasional glamour to these dressy affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the affair was too dressy; the nightclub theme of the performance put 
guests in a mood for the Cotton Club theme of the gala. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to mix it up and have everybody let their hair down," said Fayman. "I 
never knew for sure beforehand if I'd hear all these people sing 'Hi-De-Ho,' 
but I hoped!" 
</P>
<P>
A signpost in the foyer pointed to the corner of 125th Street and Broadway, the 
heart of Harlem in the 1930s and the neighborhood of the Cotton Club. Gala 
chairmen Lois Zien and Laura Abrams carried out that theme by dressing the 
tables with arrangements of blood-red roses, pale feathers and strings of fake 
pearls; organizing a floor show of sequinned gangsterettes, and serving a 
researched and avowedly authentic Cotton Club menu that included seafood 
quenelles in lobster sauce, roasted veal with yams dauphine and swans fashioned 
from chocolate and rice pudding. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily underwritten gala earned about $75,000 for the foundation; one of 
the benefactors was the Jewels of Charity group, which with Pacific Bell 
provided funding for 1,000 county school children to attend the "Gotta Sing 
Gotta Dance" performances. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included John and Sally Thornton, Patrick and Rose Patek, the 
Terry Churchills, Marcella Rabwin, the James Baldwins, the William Herricks, 
Bill and Elizabeth Zongker, John Barbey, Arthur and Eleanor Herzman, Scott 
Lynch, the Karl Kreutzers, the Fred Bucks, the Robert McLeods, Walter and Mary 
Smyk, Sig and Elena Mickelson, Kenneth and Dixie Unruh, Larry and Junko 
Cushman, Polly Puterbaugh and Rosemary KimBal.

Parliament returned King Baudouin to the throne today, two days after he agreed 
to be suspended to avoid signing a bill legalizing abortion. But some unhappy 
lawmakers urged changes in the law to reduce royal privileges. 
</P>
<P>
There were no votes against putting the king back on the throne, but 93 of the 
338 deputies present abstained. 
</P>
<P>
King Baudouin, a devout Roman Catholic, refused to sign the abortion bill after 
it was passed by Parliament last Friday. As the constitutional head of state, 
he must sign all bills to make them law. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Baudouin agreed to a temporary suspension. He was removed from the 
throne Wednesday, after which the government enacted the law itself. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said his center-left government will seek 
changes in the constitution to prevent future refusals by the king, on moral 
grounds, to endorse legislation. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
But it is expected that the government wants the royal powers, already largely 
ceremonial, reduced further. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the king cannot cast aside his constitutional role only because he 
morally opposes legislation. They said he can only lose his constitutional 
powers if he is physically or mentally unable to rule.

Cuba warned that it will sell its sugar and nickel on the international market 
if the Soviet Union and other traditional East European trading partners stop 
buying them. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are difficulties, we will go out into the world market and sell sugar 
and nickel," Juan Escalona, president of Cuba's National Assembly, told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Cuba's sugar and nickel exports have traditionally gone to East 
European and other socialist countries. 
</P>
<P>
Escalona predicted that Cuba's economic relations with its traditional trading 
partners in Eastern Europe will not continue at the same overall level as 
before because of the political and economic reforms sweeping those countries.

The U.S. Air Force will remove its first nuclear Cruise missiles from West

All Cruise missiles in Western Europe are to be scrapped by May next year under 
a 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to cut intermediate-range nuclear forces.

The spokesman said the first 16 of 96 missiles in West Germany, all based at 
Wueschheim Air Station south of Coblenz, will be removed next Wednesday and

A member of the Soviet Parliament said today that about $320 billion will be 
needed over the next 10 years to cope with the consequences of the disaster 
April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Shtsherbak, vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Commission on 
Environment and Nuclear Energy, told reporters an international fund should be 
set up to assist the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He said the thyroid glands of more than 1.5 million people, including 160,000 
children, were exposed to "important levels of radiation" after the Chernobyl 
disaster. In the Ukraine, the incidence of thyroid cancer was expected to 
increase as much as tenfold, Shtsherbak said. There are also considerably more 
cases of leukemia and immunity deficiencies. "We call that Chernobyl AIDS," he 
added. "We believe this is only the beginning."

A soldier who held an empty commercial jet for three days, threatening to blow 
it up unless he was flown to the United States, jumped out of the plane early 
today and escaped, a radio station reported. 
</P>
<P>
Privately owned Radio Haiti-Inter said Pvt. Gerald Pierre, 20, fled the 
American Airlines Airbus A300 about 1:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials gave no immediate explanation of how the soldier got away, 
there was speculation that the army allowed him to escape as a way to resolve 
peacefully the three-day siege, which had closed the international airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre was trying to desert after being reprimanded by an officer for alleged 
insubordination, radio reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre had allowed passengers and crew members to leave the New York-bound 
Flight 658 on Monday shortly after commandeering the jet. On Tuesday, he 
threatened to blow up the plane unless he was flown to the United States, Radio 
Haiti-Inter said. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and police were guarding the airport but had not surrounded the 
10-foot-high perimeter fence, and Pierre could have fled over an unguarded 
portion of it. 
</P>
<P>
Officials reopened the airport today. It was closed Wednesday after Pierre 
fired a machine gun in the direction of a Haiti Trans-Air flight shortly after 
it landed on a flight from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said American Airlines will send investigators to examine the 
jet before it leaves the airport.

A bomb set by suspected Sikh militants today ripped through a bus in Haryana 
state, killing at least 12 people and injuring 42 others just minutes after the 
lower house of Parliament voted to extend federal rule of Punjab, police said.

<P>
Police said the bomb exploded as passengers were getting off the bus in the 
main bus terminal in the Haryana town of Panipat, 30 miles north of New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
The 4:30 p.m. blast killed at least 12 people on the bus and injured 42 others, 
police said. Eighteen of the wounded were reported hospitalized in serious 
condition.

NON-COMMUNIST EAST GERMAN PREMIER;

<TEXT>
<P>
East German deputies got their first taste of parliamentary democracy today as 
they designated the country's first non-communist prime minister and asked him 
to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
They also voted in a Christian-Democratic Union Party member as Speaker at the 
inaugural session of the country's first freely elected assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the opening ceremony, deputies elected Dr. Sabine Bergmann-Pohl 
as president of the Parliament. The East Berlin physician is a member of the 
conservative Christian-Democratic Union, which with 163 seats is the largest 
party in the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The first ballot this morning did not give any of the candidates an absolute 
majority. Bergmann-Pohl received 214 votes in the second ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Volkskammer then designated Christian-Democratic Union leader Lothar de 
Maiziere, 50, as the country's prime minister and asked him to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, whose party won the March 18 election, said he is prepared to 
accept the challenge. Talks are under way and a deal with the runner-up Social 
Democrats and other smaller parties is close to being concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure contrasts sharply with the activities of the previous Parliament, 
which had been little more than a rubber-stamp institution during the four 
decades of Stalinist rule that ended with the ouster of the hard-line 
communists last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 400 deputies, including leading members of the Party of Democratic 
Socialism -- the renamed communists -- attended an ecumenical church service 
before the ceremonial opening of the Volkskammer, the East German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Among the delegates at the service in the downtown Gethsemane church were 
outgoing Communist Prime Minister Hans Modrow and Gregor Gysi, the leader of 
the PDS, which has 66 parliamentary seats. 
</P>
<P>
The March 18 electoral victory by the three-party, conservative Alliance for 
Germany was widely seen as an endorsement of West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's blueprint for unification. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies said they expect the life of the new-style democratic 
Parliament to be short and that the role of a still-to-be-formed, broad-based 
government will be largely restricted to passing legislation needed for 
reunification.

National Heritage Inc. of Dallas has agreed to merge with Life Care Centers of 
America Inc. of Cleveland, Tenn., to form a new company through a stock 
transaction in which Life Care will have a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed an announcement Feb. 5 that the two large long-term 
health care management companies were discussing a merger. 
</P>
<P>
The new company will carry Life Care's name and be headed by Life Care Chairman 
Forrest Preston. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the combined assets of National Heritage and LCCA, the new 
company will include selected assets and operations of certain affiliates of 
the two firms and certain health-care assets of Southmark Corp., headquartered 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark, once a $9-billion real estate-based financial company, is currently 
in Chapter 11 proceedings. It and its subsidiary, Pacific Standard Life 
Insurance Co. of Davis, Calif., together own about 62% of National Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Standard is in conservatorship after California insurance regulators 
ordered Pacific in December to stop selling insurance because of capital 
deficiency estimated at about $54 million.

WATERFORD CRAFTSMEN STRIKE OVER BONUS

Ireland's world-renowned Waterford crystal workers today staged the first 
all-out strike in their history amid fears that the company's craftsmen could 
lose their glass-cutting jobs to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All 2,300 workers at Waterford's three plants went on strike over management 
cost-cutting plans at the debt-ridden firm, hit hard by a slump in its crucial 
American and British markets. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, who say they are scapegoats for chronic mismanagement, put down 
their tools when the company stopped bonus payments for 500 glass cutters. 
</P>
<P>
Waterford chief executive Paddy Galvin warned that the lifeblood is being 
drained out of the company after three consecutive loss-making years. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of the company is in the balance. We are not in a viable situation. 
Seventy percent of our costs are labor costs. The cost of our product has gone 
too high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waterford parliamentarian Austin Deasy said there is a real danger now that the 
company will consider moving production to East Germany or Czechoslovakia, 
which have work forces skilled in glass-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors in my view are not too concerned where the glass is manufactured as 
long as they get a dividend from their investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin said it would grieve him to move the company out of Ireland but he told 
reporters: "If we can't produce our products at a price we can sell to the 
marketplace, we might be forced into this situation." 
</P>
<P>
A union spokesman angrily condemned the suggestion, saying: "This is an empty 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
Last month a group of investors led by Tony O'Reilly, the Irish-born chairman 
of U.S. food giant H. J. Heinz, and New York investment bank Morgan Stanley 
&amp; Co. took a 29.9% stake in the Waterford Wedgwood crystal and china group. 
</P>
<P>
Waterford took control of the British china maker Wedgwood in a 1986 takeover 
that united two of the most prestigious "table-top" names in the world of 
luxury goods.

Major American tobacco companies are manipulating trade laws and pressuring 
U.S. trade agencies in developing countries to ensure that markets for their 
products remain open, a top U.S. health official said today.

"They play our free trade laws and export policies like a Stradivarius violin, 
pressuring our trade promotion agencies to keep open -- even force open in some 
cases -- other nations' markets for their products," said James Mason,

</P>

"I've been appalled over the cynical marketing techniques of the tobacco

Singer Peggy Lee won a summary judgment against Walt Disney Productions in a

videocassette version of "Lady and The Tramp." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Huss granted a request for the judgment 
establishing Disney's liability in the case, Daily Variety reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, Lee's attorney, said the court will schedule a trial to determine 
damages. Lee is seeking $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lee provided voices and co-wrote songs for the 1955 animated classic. Disney 
has sold about 3.2 million cassettes of the movie at a wholesale value of 
between $45 million and $50 million, Daily Variety said. Theatrical rentals 
have totaled about $40.25 million, it said.

MANDELA TV STORY TO STAR SIDNEY POITIER?: It's a story that would ring up Big 
Numbers on TV. And, we hear, that's just what Harry Belafonte and ABC-TV also 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
According to our Hollywood spies, network moguls are supposed to be "seriously 
discussing" a miniseries on the life of Nelson A. Mandela that would be 
produced by Belafonte. Bill Cosby's wife, Camille, who is also a producer, 
likewise has been mentioned as one of the brains behind the project. 
</P>
<P>
According to a top source, the film would star Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier as 
the South African hero, with other roles reportedly being offered to Jane Fonda 
and Marlon Brando. Harry Belafonte also would make an appearance in the movie 
as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. 
</P>
<P>
While the entire project is cloaked in secrecy, with the Poitier and Cosby 
offices refusing to return repeated phone calls, a spokesperson for ABC-TV did 
confirm Wednesday that "a Mandela miniseries property is presently in the 
development stage." 
</P>
<P>
"But for competitive reasons that's all we're going to say on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
Poitier is currently doing a two-part series for ABC-TV on the life of Supreme 
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
SYD MAKES A PITCH: This time last year, Syd Thrift was gearing up to open the 
baseball season as Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's main man. Well, you know 
how things are with George. It didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
So now Thrift is Down South managing his company and making plans to launch his 
book, "The Game According to Syd." But don't get the idea this will be a knock 
on George. 
</P>
<P>
"This was written to have a positive impact on baseball. It's for the fan and 
to improve what he sees at the game," Syd said. Still, Syd does have a 
paragraph or two on The Boss. 
</P>
<P>
As for the lockout's affect on this season, Thrift sees few problems. "We'll 
have quality baseball because most of the players stay in condition all year," 
he said. "If you have a young team, the entire spring training season is a 
necessity. But the set teams will get off the blocks all right." 
</P>
<P>
And the Yankees? "They're a much better team than last year. They've improved 
the pitching significantly." 
</P>
<P>
HARMONY?: Show biz folk will be paying close attention to the interaction 
between Dorothy Loudon and Martin Charnin when Dot takes in Marty's cabaret 
show at Rainbow &amp; Stars tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say they haven't been on the warmest of terms since "Annie 2" crashed 
in Washington. Warm? Try frigid. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a misunderstanding," is the way an acquaintance of the two put it 
Wednesday. "Maybe this signals a thaw." 
</P>
<P>
Loudon, of course, won a Tony for portraying Miss Hannigan in Charnin's 
original production. But even though the show's being reworked at Goodspeed in 
Connecticut, Dot's not a part of it.

Auhor E. L. Doctorow is winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for best American 
fiction published in 1989 for his eighth novel, "Billy Bathgate," the Folger 
Shakespeare Library announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Doctorow, 59, a professor at New York University, will receive a $7,500 cash 
prize at an awards ceremony May 12 at the library, which administers the 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Four finalists will receive $2,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Doctorow's award-winning novel is about a young man from the Bronx who becomes 
the protege of the infamous 1930s gangster, Dutch Schultz. Doctorow previously 
had won the National Book Critics Circle Award for "Billy Bathgate" and 
"Ragtime" and the National Book Award for "World's Fair." 
</P>
<P>
The PEN/Faulkner Award was founded by American writers 10 years ago to pay 
tribute to novelist William Faulkner, who used his Nobel Prize money to 
encourage other writers. The award is associated with the American branch of 
PEN, the international writers' organization whose name is an acronym for 
poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists.

Former First Lady Betty Ford and several other Republicans announced today that 
they have formed a new political action committee to support GOP candidates who 
oppose President Bush's anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, calling itself Pro-Choice America, said it has "only one purpose 
-- to support courageous pro-choice Republicans who face anti-choice 
opponents." 
</P>
<P>
Jayne Hart, a spokeswoman for the group, said the PAC will concentrate only on 
races in which a Republican who favor abortion rights is opposed by another 
Republican or a Democrat who is opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
While the PAC plans to contribute to both state and federal races, Hart said it 
will probably stay out of contests in which both candidates hold the same 
abortion position, or where the Democrat favors abortion rights and the 
Republican opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ford, other founding members of the PAC included: Rep. Connie 
Morella (R-Md.), former Republican Chair Mary Louise Smith and former Rep. 
Millicent Fenwick (R-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
Also among the founders was Rep. Claudine Schneider (R-R.I.), who is 
challenging Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). Both Schneider and Pell favor 
abortion rights. In addition, there were several Republican men among the 
founders, including Rep. Bill Green (R-N.Y.).

The Seattle SuperSonics reached a tentative agreement with the city to build a 
new home that would keep the team here, city officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for Sonics owner Barry Ackerley to build an 18,000- to 
19,000-seat arena with adjacent parking just south of the Kingdome near the 
city center. 
</P>
<P>
The complex would cost between $90 million and $100 million, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ackerley would own the building and his son, Bill, would manage it. The city 
would give Ackerley about $1.1 million a year in admissions tax receipts for 
the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics were considering leaving Seattle because of problems with the 
28-year-old Coliseum, their present home. The roof leaks, faulty electrical 
circuits cause the scoreboard to get out of whack during games, and the 
plumbing is bad, said Sonics spokesman Jim Rupp. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that had expressed the most interest in acquiring the Sonics were 
Anaheim; Memphis, Tenn.; St. Petersburg, Fla., and Toronto, Rupp said.

The Atlanta Braves have released first baseman Darrell Evans, possibly ending 
the veteran infielder's career. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 42, was told of his release Wednesday in a 10-minute meeting with 
Manager Russ Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
The team opted to keep utility infielder Alexis Infante, who was acquired Nov. 
20 from the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials invited Evans to remain in camp until Saturday, when the Braves 
return to Atlanta for Tuesday's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a veteran of 21 years, said the prospects of continuing his career with 
another team seem dim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened to a lot of my friends and it's not easy," he said. "I guess 
when it slaps you in the face you don't know how to feel. I don't know what to 
expect because I've never been in this situation before." 
</P>
<P>
During his career, Evans had 8,973 at-bats, four seasons with 30 home runs or 
more, and a world championship with the Detroit Tigers in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Evans signed with the Braves as a minor league free agent in December, 1988. He 
batted .207 last season, with 39 RBIs and 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran first baseman Bill Buckner, trying to make the Red Sox as a non-roster 
player, had a double and three singles Wednesday, raising his spring average to 
.391, in Boston's 8-0 exhibition victory over the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Perez made his spring debut for the New York Yankees and went three 
innings -- 42 pitches -- in a 10-5 loss to Atlanta. Perez walked two, struck 
out two and allowed one hit -- a three-run homer by Jeff Treadway.

1,200 RAIDER OAKLAND FANS ORDER TICKETS

<P>
More than 1,200 fans looking forward to the Raiders' proposed return to Oakland 
put money down Wednesday night for season ticket reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The orders were placed at a ticket drive kickoff rally at the Oakland Coliseum, 
where the NFL team played before leaving for Los Angeles in 1982. There were 
9,402 seats reserved, in person and by mail, by the end of the night. 
</P>
<P>
George Buehler, one of the former Oakland Raiders players attending the rally, 
told the crowd, "It's been years since I've played, but I tell you, I'm ready 
to go again, with this kind of support." 
</P>
<P>
The ticket reservations accepted included 42 deposits on 16-seat luxury boxes 
that will go for $45,000 per season. Starting today, the BASS ticket agency is 
taking phone reservations for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
If things go according to plan, the Raiders will return to Oakland in 1992, 
after their lease at the Los Angeles Coliseum expires. 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents to the $428-million deal offered the team say it will put 
taxpayers at too much of a financial risk. Petitions are being circulated in an 
attempt to put the issue on the ballot and let voters decide whether the deal 
should be made. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about the referendum -- you guys are voting right now!" former 
Raiders defensive tackle Art Thoms told the rally crowd, which numbered about 
2,500. 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature at Sacramento, Los Angeles Assemblyman Mike Roos made it 
clear he'll challenge Oakland's plan to sell tax-exempt bonds to finance part 
of the Raiders deal. Roos, chairman of the Assembly bonded indebtedness 
committee, announced that he will will hold a special hearing April 12 in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland City Councilman Wilson P. Riles Jr., who voted against the Raiders 
deal, predicted Wednesday that the $428-million deal will be killed by 
referendum. He proposed renegotiating the contract to eliminate all ticket sale 
guarantees and a $54.9-million franchise fee.

GYMNASTICS: VERA CASLAVSKA WON OLYMPIC MEDALS IN 1964 AND '68, THEN DISAPPEARED

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Soviet tanks rumbled into Wenceslas Square on Aug. 21, 1968, Vera 
Caslavska was at a camp in Moravia, single-mindedly training to defend the 
Olympic gold medal she had won for Czechoslovakia four years earlier in Tokyo 
as the best all-around gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, she went into hiding. Friends warned that her freedom 
was in jeopardy because a few months earlier, in the giddy Prague spring, she 
had signed the Manifesto of 2,000 Words. 
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted by the country's intelligentsia, appealed to 
Czechoslovakians to unite against Soviet repression and establish a 
more-perfect form of Socialism: "Communism with a human face." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets preferred tanks. Signers of the manifesto were considered 
counterrevolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
Caslavska, then 26, fled to the small town of Sumberk in the Jesiniky 
Mountains, where she took refuge in a friend's cottage, accompanied only by the 
caretaker and a cook. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally isolated for three weeks, but I continued to train," she said. 
"While the Soviet gymnasts were already in Mexico City, adjusting to the 
altitude and the climate, I was hanging from trees, practicing my floor 
exercise in the meadow in front of the cottage and building callouses on my 
hands by shoveling coal. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I went to Mexico and won the gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
Caslavska said she had not told her story before to journalists, but she is 
free to speak now because of November's "velvet" revolution, which brought 
democracy to Czechoslovakia. With each passing week, more Soviet troops leave. 
Again, it is spring in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
As an adviser to Vaclav Havel, the poet, playwright and 
philosopher-turned-president, Caslavska was attending a cocktail party held by 
the government early this week. Because of her overflowing appointment book, 
she said that was the only time she could visit with two American reporters who 
requested interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The party was held in Rudolf's Gallery, an elegant hall with gold chandeliers 
and gold carpet in the 12th Century Prague Castle, the home of Bohemian kings 
and now the seat of government. It is the Prague of Mozart, not Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
This is a heady time in Czechoslovakia but also a time of confusion. In his 
weekly radio address last Sunday, Havel said that the time for euphoria has 
passed and it is time for hard work so that the new order may prevail. 
</P>
<P>
But what is the new order? Miners marched in the streets of Prague this week. 
They are not in favor of the former Communist regime, but they sought 
assurances that they will continue to receive guaranteed employment and 
inexpensive health care. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lesser of Czechoslovakia's problems is sports, but, even in that 
realm, there are uncertainties. The sports federation was dissolved last week. 
When reorganized later this month, it is expected to be less financially 
dependent on the government. 
</P>
<P>
Caslavska is 47 and has faint lines around the corners of her eyes. But she 
looks fit enough to compete. She certainly is energetic enough. Olympic 
Committee officials have asked her to help lead sports in the country toward a 
new direction by becoming their president. 
</P>
<P>
But she is an extremely intelligent woman and has other options. She may go to 
Japan as the ambassador, although Havel would like her to remain in the Prague 
Castle as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think I should do?" she asked the reporters who were interviewing 
her. 
</P>
<P>
She is not that accustomed to options. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1968, she was coaxed to come out of the mountains and return 
to the Olympic team by a government eager to show the world that it was 
independent of Soviet rule. It could hardly do that by persecuting its best 
athlete for her anti-Soviet stance. 
</P>
<P>
She was eager to show the world that she was still its premier woman gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for her, that was four years before American television 
discovered gymnastics. Caslavska did not become as famous as Olga Korbut in 
Munich, Nadia Comaneci in Montreal and Mary Lou Retton in Los Angeles, but she 
was no less brilliant for her time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 in Tokyo, as a virtually unknown 22-year-old Prague secretary, she won 
three gold medals -- including one in the all-around competition -- and two 
silvers. In Mexico City, she won four gold medals -- repeating her all-around 
championship -- and two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
She won over the Mexico City crowd by performing her floor exercise to the 
"Mexican Hat Dance." Because she shared the gold medal in that event with a 
Soviet, Larissa Petrik, they also shared the top level of the victory podium. 
During the Soviet national anthem, Caslavska bowed her head and turned away 
from the flag as it was raised. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, she and Czech 1,500-meter runner Josef Odlozil were married in a 
civil ceremony at the house of the Czechoslovakian ambassador. Then, as 10,000 
Mexicans followed, they went to a Roman Catholic Church for a religious 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
She and Odlozil could have defected but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a very strong feeling that I should stay here because I could reinforce 
the self-esteem of the Czech people," she said. "On the other hand, it was good 
that someone like (movie producer) Milos Forman left for abroad and showed the 
world what Czechs could do." 
</P>
<P>
When Caslavska returned to Prague, she retired from competition, had a daughter 
and took some time off before deciding in 1970 that she wanted to coach. 
</P>
<P>
Each Jan. 3 for five years, she went to the office of Antonin Himmel, chairman 
of the Czechoslovakian Sports Federation, and asked for a coaching position. 
Each time she was rejected without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Himmel did not have to give her a reason. She knew that it was because she 
would not sign a document repudiating her signature on the Manifesto of 2,000 
Words. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to say that the Russian invasion was a way of friendly help," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3, 1975, Caslavska chose a new approach. Dressing for success, it would 
be called in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I dressed myself in an aerobics suit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sexy," her interpreter said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not sexy," corrected Caslavska, who speaks fluent Spanish and understands 
a little English. "High to the neck, but very tight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a feel for this. I am a quite conservative person. Sometimes I 
enjoy this kind of joke, but it was very hard for me to dress like this. I 
really had to look for courage. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Himmel measured me with his eyes, and said, 'Vera, what do you have on? 
Are you crazy?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, but I was supposed to apply for work on Jan. 3. I'm here, and I 
am dressed for work. I won't leave until you give me a team and a gymnasium 
hall to work.' 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't make such a decision alone, so he called his advisers -- about 20 
men -- into the room, all of them staring at me. It was decided I would be 
given a team." 
</P>
<P>
Caslavska was not allowed to coach gymnasts on the national team directly, but 
she was allowed to give advice to those who did coach them. Her role, however, 
remained largely unknown until two years ago in Czechoslovakia because 
reporters were forbidden to write or talk about her. 
</P>
<P>
The government's position toward her began to soften in 1979, when Mexico's 
President Portillo invited her to spend time in his country as a sports 
adviser. Under the circumstances, Czechoslovakia could hardly refuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say I was traded for oil, but . . . " she said. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to Prague as a coach without portfolio in 1984, when International 
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch made his first visit to 
Czechoslovakia. Aware that she and another highly decorated Olympian, distance 
runner Emil Zatopek, were not in favor with the government because of their 
support for the Manifesto of 2,000 Words, he asked to meet with them. 
</P>
<P>
"He was told that Emil was ill, and that I had family problems," Caslavska 
said. "But he came back the next year and said he wanted to give the Olympic 
Order to me and Emil. The government agreed. It was the first time I was able 
to stand up in my country since 1968." 
</P>
<P>
She was the official choreographer for Czechoslovakia's women's gymnastics team 
at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
She still has her gold medals. Her silver medals she gave to the leaders of the 
Prague Spring.

Sarah Vaughan, whose remarkable range and smoky contralto voice earned her the 
nickname "The Divine One," has died of lung cancer, it was announced Wednesday. 
She was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan, who had checked out of Cedars Sinai Hospital a few hours earlier, 
died at 9:20 p.m. Tuesday at her home in Hidden Hills, according to her 
attorney and manager, Harold Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said he and Miss Vaughan's 87-year-old mother, Ada, and her adopted 
daughter, actress Paris Deborah Vaughan, were at her side when she died. Levy 
said they were watching a television movie in which the daughter appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Sassy" for her onstage manner, Miss Vaughan was associated with 
recordings of such perennial jazz and pop favorites as "Body and Soul," "It's 
Magic," "Misty," "I Cover the Waterfront," "Lover Man," "Here's That Rainy Day" 
and "Send in the Clowns." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her seven-month fight with cancer, Miss Vaughan had hoped to begin 
working on a new recording this week. Levy said complications forced her to go 
to the hospital Saturday, but that she decided Tuesday she would be more 
comfortable in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sept. 3, after Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed Sarah Vaughan Day in Los 
Angeles, she sang with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, 
capping her long career and delighting 11,878 fans with the soaring lyric voice 
that made her so popular for nearly five decades. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Miss Vaughan, a longtime smoker, was diagnosed with lung 
cancer and carcinoma of the joints in one hand. 
</P>
<P>
"She just kept becoming greater and greater as the years went on," Times jazz 
critic Leonard Feather, a longtime friend of Miss Vaughan, said Wednesday. "In 
the last few years she was just astonishing. She was the idol and envy of 
virtually all singers." 
</P>
<P>
Feather appraised her professional versatility in his "Encyclopedia of Jazz 
Singers" by saying that she was "capable of incomparable jazz performances yet 
qualified to be an opera singer." 
</P>
<P>
That opinion was echoed Wednesday by Times music critic Martin Bernheimer, who 
reviews performances of classical music including opera: 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah Vaughan had a voice of extraordinary sweetness, flexibility and purity, 
and she used it with uncanny insinuation throughout a wide range. She could 
have taught many an opera diva lessons in breath control, in legato phrasing 
and in expressive communication. She was a great singer. Period." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that Sassy is gone," said Miss Vaughan's longtime friend, comedian Bill 
Cosby, "there is no one to measure great singers by." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan, who recorded popular and standard songs as well as jazz classics, 
had scoffed at attempts by fans and music critics to categorize her as a jazz 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sing," she said. "I sing whatever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Born March 27, 1924, in Newark, N.J., to a carpenter and a laundress, she 
received her musical training in the church choir with her mother, first as a 
singer and later as organist. 
</P>
<P>
She claimed she never envisioned getting into show business, even when, on a 
friend's dare, she signed up for amateur night at New York's storied Apollo 
Theater in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"I just quit in the third year of high school and started singing at amateur 
hours," she once told an interviewer. "The night I won at the Apollo I was only 
doing it for the $10." 
</P>
<P>
But Billy Eckstine heard her that night and recommended her to band leader Earl 
(Fatha) Hines, who hired her. Her career as a concert and recording star was 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
Feather, who was present at the Apollo when Miss Vaughan first opened there 
with Hines' band April 23, 1943, wrote of her in his jazz encyclopedia: 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah Vaughan's voice, completely different from that of Billie Holiday, Ella 
Fitzgerald or any of the other great jazz stylists before her, brought to jazz 
an unprecedented combination of attractive characteristics: a rich, beautifully 
controlled tone and vibrato; an ear for the chord structure of songs, enabling 
her to change or inflect the melody as an instrumentalist might; a coy, 
sometimes archly naive quality alternating with a sense of great 
sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald herself once called Miss Vaughan "the greatest singing talent in the 
world today." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan's remarkable range with the husky voice, made huskier over the 
years by her smoking, was so extraordinary that it often prompted exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
"They say four octaves but it's not true," she said modestly in a 1986 
interview. "Two octaves and a fifth maybe. Maybe a little more." 
</P>
<P>
Her voice was considered more instrumental than vocal and was often likened to 
a horn, a comparison she found logical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I ever modeled myself after a singer," she said. "I've more or 
less copied the styles of horn-tooters right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan did admit to some influence by singer Marian Anderson. The prize 
for one of the amateur contests she won as a teen-ager was a choice between 
roller skates or a ticket to a Marian Anderson concert. She chose the concert 
and said she "fell in love with the sound of her voice." 
</P>
<P>
After her debut with Hines, Miss Vaughan toured with his band for a year, 
working with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and trying to imitate their 
trumpet and saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
When Eckstine formed his own band in 1944, he hired Miss Vaughan and backed her 
in her first recording, "I'll Wait and Pray." 
</P>
<P>
Feather, a jazz musician as well as critic, received a demonstration record of 
Miss Vaughan's singing from Gillespie and arranged for her to record under her 
own name with Continental. She sang four songs for $20 each, with Feather 
playing the piano accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan first won a national following with her recording of "Lover Man," 
made with Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
Her early career, which she dismissed in interviews as paying "a lot of dues," 
included concerts in tobacco warehouses and barns in the South, as well as 
modestly successful records and a few appearances in places like New York's 
Copacabana in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until the early 1950s that Sassy began singing in the better spots 
and collected a following -- like at Birdland in New York . . . and the Blue 
Note in Chicago, where Dave Garroway heard her, called her 'the Divine One' and 
promoted her on radio and TV," John Malachi, an early accompanist who nicknamed 
her "Sassy," recalled in an interview a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s she had a strong international following and won Downbeat's 
international critics' poll for best female singer in the world six times -- 
1973 and 1975-79. She sang with major symphony orchestras and for heads of 
state and in prestigious places like Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, her concert performances prompted a reviewer to write 
that "she continues to cause excitement wherever she appears." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God," said Levy Wednesday, "we have her recordings to preserve her 
greatness. She was one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Vaughan married and divorced four husbands: trumpeter George Treadwell, 
former pro football player Clyde Atkins, Las Vegas restaurateur Marshall 
Fisher, and musician Waymon Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are scheduled Saturday in her home city of Newark. Levy said 
plans for a memorial service in Los Angeles are pending.
