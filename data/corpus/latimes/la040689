CHARTER PROPOSALS NEED MORE AIRING, COUNCIL PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With some of its members openly critical of the Charter Review Commission's 
proposals for realigning city government, the San Diego City Council's Rules 
Committee Wednesday agreed to allow the full council and the public to discuss 
them again before deciding which suggestions to place on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also sent the politically charged subject of redistricting to the 
full council, which will debate whether to put the issue in the hands of an 
independent body or leave it with the council members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's eventual decision on charter revisions, if ratified by the full 
council, is likely to delay a public vote on the package of 13 suggestions and 
might result in additions to the list by the council, which is expected to 
begin debate on the proposals in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Ratification appears likely because the Rules Committee is composed of six of 
the council's nine members. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six committee members, only Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Wes 
Pratt said they would honor the council's April 4, 1988, pledge to place all 
commission recommendations on the bal 
</P>
<P>
lot. Council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson, Judy McCarty and Gloria 
McColl did not address the issue or said that they did not necessarily intend 
to abide by the commitment. 
</P>
<P>
With some council members irked by the commission's decision to hold all its 
meetings in City Hall, the Rules Committee resolved to circulate the proposed 
charter revisions to community groups citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"Requiring people to come to you, I just don't think it was enough," said 
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, in a comment echoed by other council members. 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee also agreed to study forms of government in other U. S. 
cities with populations of more than 500,000, an effort similar to one already 
conducted by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Input Called 'Straw Man' 
</P>
<P>
Commission vice-chairman John Wertz called the discussion of lack of public 
participation a "straw man" set up by council members opposed to some of the 
recommendations. According to the commission's final report, it held 48 
meetings at which it heard testimony from representatives of 79 organizations 
and 123 individuals. Another 126 wrote to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The members of this Rules Committee were either not fully aware of what we did 
do, or they have another motive or agenda here," Wertz said in an interview 
after the decision. That motive is "to delay, if not deny, the voters the right 
to vote on these things this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, who was perhaps most critical of some commission 
proposals, said that he was not attempting to derail the commission proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"In no manner is that my intent," Henderson said in an interview. But he added 
that the seriousness of the proposals requires "thorough discussion" and 
"extensive deliberation" before they are placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 13 Commission Proposals 
</P>
<P>
The 13 commission proposals include the symbolic -- like changing 
gender-specific references such as "he" to gender-neutral terms -- and the 
profound. Substantive changes in the governmental system would be brought about 
by giving the mayor veto power and expanding the council by two districts. The 
commission also proposes establishing a neutral redistricting panel. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the commission placed on the ballot a proposal for an independent 
police review board. Though the measure was approved by a majority of the 
voters, it received fewer votes than a similar, weaker measure placed on the 
ballot by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Council committee members offered a wide range of criticism of the commission's 
recommendations, many of which were in response to last year's voter approval 
of district elections. In previous elections, council members ran in 
district-only primaries, with the top two vote-getters facing each other in a 
citywide runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, I find that the Charter Review Commission has provided us with no 
meaningful argument as to why we should change our form of government," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've done is come back with changes and you haven't been able to 
establish that there was a problem," said McCarty, who added that the provision 
for a mayoral veto would give the mayor "two votes" on issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Changes 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and McColl, however, argued for the changes that would strengthen the 
mayor, who will now be the only council member elected citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to go to a strong-mayor form of government," McColl said. "But 
what you have brought forward, I don't think goes far enough." 
</P>
<P>
On the redistricting issue, the committee heard Councilman Bob Filner urge the 
establishment of an independent commission that would leave politics out of the 
decision to remap council districts and equalize population. 
</P>
<P>
Because of uneven growth since the last redistricting in 1980, the districts 
now range in size from the estimated 111,257 people in Roberts' 2nd District to 
the 156,883 people in Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer's 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
A newly formed citizens' group has announced its intention to place an 
initiative on a ballot to establish an independent, seven-member redistricting 
commission to handle the 1990 redrawing of city political boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Filner is concerned that the council's Republican majority will draw district 
boundaries that put most San Diego Democrats in his 8th District and Pratt's 
4th District, creating an almost certain Republican council majority for the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can draw six Republican districts and two Democratic districts and keep 
that situation for the decade," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also must grapple with the Charter Review Commission's suggestion 
of expanding the number of council districts to 10, a proposal which, if 
implemented, could dramatically alter the size and shape of the existing 
districts.

SCE CHIEF ALLEGEDLY PROMISED SEATS ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of SCEcorp offered San Diego Gas &amp; Electric board member Malin 
Burnham a seat on SCEcorp's board of directors several days before SDG&amp;E 
accepted a proposed merger with Southern California Edison, a former SDG&amp;E 
board member said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
O. Morris Sievert, who in December resigned from SDG&amp;E's board to protest 
the controversial merger vote, testified about Howard Allen's purported offer 
to Burnham during a highly unusual public deposition sanctioned by the state 
Public Utilities Commission. Allen is chairman of SCEcorp, the Rosemead-based 
parent company of Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert said Allen might also have offered a board seat to Clair W. Burgener, a 
former congressman who serves on the SDG&amp;E board. Sievert said he learned 
of the purported offer to Burgener during a conversation with La Jolla 
businessman Charles (Red) Scott, who also resigned from SDG&amp;E's board to 
protest the planned buyout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Constituted Coercion' 
</P>
<P>
According to Sievert, Scott believed that Allen's alleged offers "constituted 
coercion" because they were made while Edison was lobbying SDG&amp;E board 
members to support the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert said Burnham subsequently told Allen that the offer was a "subject that 
he didn't want to discuss" before the SDG&amp;E vote. "My impression was that 
Mr. Burnham had not at all decided that he would take such a seat," Sievert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's daylong proceeding, Sievert stopped short of describing his 
own view of the reported offers. 
</P>
<P>
He said Scott and other board members were upset to learn that four SDG&amp;E 
executives, including SDG&amp;E Chairman Thomas Page, had negotiated lucrative 
employment contracts with Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert said he at first accepted those contracts as "rather logical," but 
within weeks came to view them as a "conflict of interest in the broadest 
sense" because Page and the other executives with contracts were also 
negotiating the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The employment contract seemed to sway Page, who previously had indicated that 
"he did not want to be a caretaker" working for Edison, Sievert said. "I began 
to feel that . . . Mr. Page (now) preferred to be a part of Southern California 
Edison rather than simply running SDG&amp;E," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was not immediately available for 
</P>
<P>
comment on Sievert's statement, and Jerry Coughlan, a San Diego attorney who 
represents Scott in the PUC proceedings, declined to comment. Burgener and 
Burnham also were unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for SDG&amp;E and Edison declined to comment on Sievert's 
wide-ranging testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert's deposition gave San Diegans the first real glimpse into the complex 
decision-making that led SDG&amp;E board members to accept a $2.4-billion stock 
swap merger offer from SCEcorp on Nov. 30. SDG&amp;E and SCEcorp shareholders 
are expected to vote on the proposed merger during meetings later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert on Wednesday maintained that SDG&amp;E shareholders have not been given 
adequate information to vote on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
During the deposition, which was conducted mainly by Washington-based attorneys 
representing the city of San Diego, Sievert also testified that SDG&amp;E's 
officers had failed to provide SDG&amp;E board members with adequate 
information about several substantive issues before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert said he subsequently learned about those issues by reading newspapers 
and talking to San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert said that, before the vote, board members dedicated substantial time to 
discussing the merger's effect on SDG&amp;E shareholders but little or no time 
on the proposal's effect on SDG&amp;E employees and the environment. However, 
several board members expressed "serious doubts" about Allen's highly 
publicized promise to seek a 10% rate decrease for SDG&amp;E's residential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urging From Cleator 
</P>
<P>
Sievert also said that former City Councilman Bill Cleator evidently urged 
Burnham, who reportedly voted against the merger, to remain on the SDG&amp;E 
board rather than quit in protest. Cleator, who was not available for comment 
Wednesday, evidently believed that Burnham "could do more to upset the merger 
on the board than off," Sievert said. Burnham did not resign. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert indicated that only a handful of SDG&amp;E's board members and 
executives correctly forecast the strong community protest that has arisen in 
the wake of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of them either didn't believe it was true or that it didn't 
matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgener, in a Feb. 14 letter to Sievert that was made public Wednesday, 
acknowledged that he has had to "eat a large portion of crow -- I was dead 
wrong when I opined that this proposed merger would be greeted in the community 
by a monumental chorus of yawns. That was almost total naivete on my part. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Sievert had planned to testify in depth Wednesday, as well as make public 10 
cartons of confidential SDG&amp;E documents. In a recent PUC filing, he said he 
had "no objections" to going public with details about the SDG&amp;E board vote 
because public concern in San Diego County over the merger "appears to outweigh 
any interest in maintaining the 'confidential' or 'privileged' status of the 
documents in question." 
</P>
<P>
However, earlier this week, SDG&amp;E asked a PUC law judge to issue a 
protective order that would keep the documents secret. During testimony 
Wednesday, Sievert on about 20 occasions declined to talk about sensitive 
documents because the law judge has not yet ruled on SDG&amp;E's request. It is 
uncertain when a ruling will be made. 
</P>
<P>
On more than 50 other occasions, James E. Lyons, a Los Angeles-based attorney 
who represented SDG&amp;E, complained that questions asked of Sievert by the 
city of San Diego's attorneys were vague, ambiguous, leading or without 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert was subpoenaed to appear at the deposition by the city, which has 
subpoenaed Scott to appear for a similar deposition Monday.

HEDGECOCK TO TESTIFY IN HUNTER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Mayor Roger Hedgecock will be granted immunity from prosecution to 
testify against Nancy Hoover Hunter, once one of his strongest political 
allies, at her trial stemming from her involvement in the fraud-ridden J. David 
&amp; Co. investment firm, according to a brief filed in federal court 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, prepared by Assistant. U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo, alleges that Hunter 
was intimately involved with virtually every aspect of J. David's business and 
personally opened all the firm's mail. While working as a broker for another 
firm, Bache, Halsey, Stuart, Shields, Hunter provided J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli with "false and misleading" documents he used lure investors and get 
his new company off the ground, the brief says. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's lawyers have said they hope to persuade the jury that she and the 
investors were victims of Dominelli and that she was not nearly as involved in 
the firm's business as the government claims. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the case continues today. Hunter is charged with 234 counts 
of fraud, conspiracy and income-tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter left Bache in April, 1981, and joined Dominelli's business as president 
of J. David Trading Co. Later, she became president of J. David Securities. She 
and Dominelli, who had met several years earlier while both handled small 
accounts at Bache, began living together, spending money freely and socializing 
with some of the wealthiest and most prominent people in La Jolla and Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forged Personal Friendship 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Hedgecock, with whom Hoover forged a personal friendship and 
political alliance that began when both began public careers in Del Mar in the 
1970s. Although their relationship was strained by Hedgecock's disapproval of 
Hoover's divorce after she met Dominelli, the two eventually reconciled, and 
she became one of Hedgecock's most ardent backers in his successful 1983 San 
Diego 
</P>
<P>
mayoral campaign. Using J. David money, she was one of his chief financial 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
The spending spree of Dominelli and Hunter lasted until 1984, when nervous J. 
David investors forced the firm into bankruptcy court after its checks began to 
bounce. Criminal indictments followed. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, which has been 
described as a huge Ponzi scheme in which money from new clients was used to 
pay off old clients and little or no actual trading was done. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and income-tax evasion 
and is serving a 20-year sentence in a federal prison. In 1986, Hoover pleaded 
guilty to state charges of conspiracy to funnel thousands of dollars into 
Hedgecock's 1983 campaign. She was sentenced to three years' probation, fined 
$10,000 and ordered to perform 350 hours of public service, which she did at 
the Santa Barbara Public Library. In addition to the case now on trial, Hunter 
faces a second set of federal indictments charging her with conspiracy and 
using the mails to sell unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removed From Office 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock was convicted after a trial for campaign-law violations related to 
his use of J. David money and was removed from office. Hedgecock, who maintains 
that he is innocent, is appealing the conviction and has said that he lost 
respect for Hunter after she pleaded guilty to the charges rather than fight 
them at trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock said Wednesday that he has not been told what prosecutors want to 
question him about and referred calls to his lawyer, Charles Sevilla. 
</P>
<P>
"Since they've not indicated to us what they want him to testify about, it's 
all speculation," Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marmaro, one of Hunter's lawyers, said Wednesday that Hedgecock's 
testimony is irrelevant to the case and that the government is "grandstanding" 
by granting him immunity and calling him as a witness. "He's not mentioned in 
any of the 234 counts," Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key to Investments 
</P>
<P>
Keeping J. David's dismal investment track record from public scrutiny was a 
key to the firm's continued ability to lure new investors. 
</P>
<P>
A key piece of evidence expected at the trial is a note, handwritten by Hunter, 
that says: "I'm not eager for J.D. Securities to clear your Interbank trades -- 
they will then be able to construct their own version of your track record. It 
could be bad." Prosecutors allege Hunter wrote the note to Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro said Wednesday that prosecutors have "totally misconstrued" the meaning 
of that note. When the trial gets under way, the evidence and testimony will 
provide the first detailed public account of the inner workings of J. David. 
</P>
<P>
According to the trial brief, Hunter told Internal Revenue Service agents that 
Dominelli's personal bank account was held in the name of J. David &amp; Co. 
and that Dominelli never reconciled or balanced the account. Hunter knew that 
practically all of the J. David entities lost money every month because she 
received monthly expense statements showing operating losses, the brief says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Magic Checkbook' 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli took money from customer accounts known around the office as "magic 
checkbook" accounts and deposited the funds in his personal account, according 
to the brief. 
</P>
<P>
When an accountant discovered the improper comingling of funds and confronted 
Hunter and Dominelli, Hunter replied, "We're here to have fun. Don't be so 
serious," the brief says. 
</P>
<P>
When the firm was at its prime, Hunter and Dominelli "continued to gain social 
prominence by contributing J. David investor money to numerous charitable 
organizations and events," the brief says. 
</P>
<P>
"They bought tables for the Jewel Ball and Night in Monte Carlo, block tickets 
for the symphony and contributed to the landscaping of Mandell Weiss Center for 
the Performing Arts at UCSD." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named to Boards 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Hunter was appointed to the boards of the San Diego Symphony and the 
La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli and Hunter spent "huge sums of money" remodeling and refurbishing 
their office space in La Jolla, which the employees called the "Mahogany 
Palace," the brief says. "Among its lavish appointments were mahogany paneling 
throughout, parquet floors, coffered ceilings, built-in Victorian-era bookcases 
and leather chairs." They paid membership fees for 50 employees to use the La 
Jolla Athletic Club, gave them cars, and sent them on weekend trips to Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors plan to call about 70 witnesses at the trial, which may last two 
months or longer. Whether Dominelli, who has suffered a stroke since the 
collapse of the firm, will be among them remains a mystery. His name is missing 
from a list of prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has remarried since her breakup with Dominelli after the firm's 
collapse. She now lives with her husband, Kenneth Hunter, a wealthy 
businessman, in an exclusive coastal community near Santa Barbara.

PARENTS APPLAUD SCHOOL'S DECISIONS ON ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a special meeting in the school gymnasium Wednesday night, parents at La 
Jolla Country Day School stood and applauded the decisions by the headmaster to 
place the safety of the children first before allowing ousted teacher Sharon 
Rogers to return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Headmaster Timothy Burns, addressing the parents in an open forum for the first 
time since Rogers was removed from the campus, was praised for his "courageous 
stand" during the past three weeks, in which the private school has been 
sharply criticized for its response after Rogers' van exploded in what may have 
been a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
One father drew sustained applause and cheers from the several hundred parents 
when he indicated that school administrators were justified in first worrying 
about the safety of the children, and in now attempting to negotiate a return 
to the school of the popular fourth-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Embarrassed' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not embarrassed to be a part of the La Jolla Country Day family," he said. 
"And I'm not embarrassed that we're trying to keep Sharon Rogers as part of our 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
School spokesman Richard Roth said Rogers did not attend the meeting because 
the school was unable to assure her safety there, as well as that of the 
parents and faculty. But he said a videotape was made of the meeting, and that 
the school plans to send her a copy today. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how Rogers will react to the overwhelming support for Burns and the 
</P>
<P>
school administration is unclear. Several sources close to her have described 
her as "very distressed" by his decision not to allow her to return to campus 
for the rest of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Cmdr. Dave (Matt) Dillon, who has been in routine contact with Rogers and 
her husband, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, said Wednesday that the couple will 
probably release a statement today describing their feelings about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Capt. Rogers about the meeting, and he seemed real interested," Dillon 
said. "They probably will have some comment about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, a teacher at the private school for 12 years, has not returned 
there since she narrowly escaped injury when a pipe bomb exploded March 10, 
destroying her van while she was stopped at an intersection en route to the 
school. Since then, she and her husband have been resettled at a secret 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal authorities are continuing to investigate the explosion to 
determine if it was in retaliation for Capt. Rogers' mistaken order last summer 
aboard the guided missile destroyer Vincennes to shoot down an Iranian jetliner 
over the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, La Jolla Country Day headmaster for the eight years, addressed the crowd 
Wednesday night by defending his and the school board's decision not to allow 
Rogers to return this year. He said his paramount concern was the safety of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Rogers is continuing to receive her salary as she 
assists her substitute teacher. And he said he has presented her two 
alternative contracts for next school year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Substantial Threat 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases," he said, "they clearly say she can return as a teacher if we 
can verify there is no substantial threat to Sharon, the school or the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Roth said one contract would allow Rogers back on campus if a 
"substantial" assurance of safety could be provided by the FBI, the Naval 
Investigative Service and the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said the second contract would permit her to return "at the discretion of 
the headmaster." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the school hopes to have an answer from Rogers by April 14. She has 
yet to sign either proposal, and attorneys for both her and the school are now 
entering the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Burns told the parents: "I want to be both reasonable and fair. This is a most 
unique situation we are in. I am waiting to hear a response on one of the 
contracts." 
</P>
<P>
He also urged parents to help their children overcome their concerns and fears. 
He said terrorist awareness seminars will be conducted and that continued 
private security will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseled Stockton Kids 
</P>
<P>
And he said the staff is meeting with a San Diego firm that counseled children 
at a school in Stockton, where a gunman opened fire Jan. 17 and killed five 
students and wounded 29 more. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get beyond finger pointing in this," Burns said. "We need to get 
beyond name calling. We need to get beyond blame. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue needs to be behind us as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Several parents charged that the school has been unduly singled out for 
criticism, even though federal and military security guards will not permit 
Rogers to return to her own home. 
</P>

"We have to wait for the U. S. government to give her the assurance that she is 
free herself," one mother said. "Our school needs to wait and see what happens 
and not rush into this situation. Let's give her the contract and see what she 
decides." 
</P>
<P>
The mother also described how she ran into Rogers at a pharmacy, and how she 
was frightened at seeing the teacher surrounded by four security guards in 
suits and ties and wearing earphones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Live With It 
</P>
<P>
"So how do you think your children and my children will react if she returns to 
school like that?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
But one father said he is "willing to live with less" than 100% security at the 
school if it means Rogers can return soon. And he said he hopes the events of 
the past several weeks do not make it appear that Rogers was flat-out fired, as 
Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) and other sources have contended. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like firing the chef and giving him two weeks' severance," the father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I can't live with congressmen and the press taking poetic license when they 
weren't in a burning van and they're not in trouble and they're not living in 
secret on a military base." 
</P>
<P>
That comment, too, was met by loud applause.

GRANTS EARN AIDE AN 'A' IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past six years, the Oceanside Unified School District has acquired a 
computer lab and begun a special summer school and drug-awareness program for 
the hefty price tag of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
District officials didn't spend much time worrying about the price of the 
valuable programs, though, because the district didn't have to pay for a penny 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Sherry Freeman de Leyva, the district's special-projects 
coordinator, has single-handedly obtained more than $1 million for the city's 
schools by successfully applying for numerous grants. 
</P>
<P>
According to her track record, it appears that when Freeman de Leyva asks for 
money, she usually gets it. Since 1983, she has applied for more than 20 state 
or federal grants, and in most cases, has walked away with a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Success Rate Impressive 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way, I get money more often than I don't," Freeman de Leyva 
said. "I would say I'm successful about 75% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Though her success rate is impressive in its own right, she and her colleagues 
are far more delighted with the results the money has delivered. Without the 
grants, several of the district's programs -- particularly those that cater to 
the needs of academically troubled students -- could not be offered. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, the money that I get is seed money for a new program," Freeman 
de Leyva said. "Without it, we couldn't get a new program off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
With the grant money she's won, she has helped the school district get the 
computer lab, begin the drug awareness program and start innovative summer 
school sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with establishing new programs is that start-up costs can be 
really prohibitive," she said. "It's so much easier to continue a program 
rather than start a new one." 
</P>
<P>
Persuading school administrators to finance a new, unproven educational 
program, is often a futile task, Freeman de Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't walk into their office and say, 'Hi, can you give me $100,000 
for this?' " Even if they like your idea, the district often just doesn't have 
that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the district's strangling budget restraints, Freeman de Leyva 
decided that she would have to go elsewhere to find money for her programs. And 
so began her moon-lighting career as a grant writer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have a Good Idea 
</P>
<P>
"Applying for grants was never one of my official responsibilities," Freeman de 
Leyva said. "I heard about a grant that I thought I might be able to get, so I 
asked my boss for permission to apply." 
</P>
<P>
That was the first of many grants to be won. And now, she no longer has to ask 
permission to apply. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, applications for grants mysteriously appear on my desk," Freeman de 
Leyva said. "People seem to think I have good luck, so they ask me to apply for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to winning grants than luck or good writing, she says. The 
secret of her success: have a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing is, you have to have a good idea . . . an innovative approach. 
And then you have to develop that idea from its inception, to the purchase of 
materials, to the implementation in the classroom, to its evaluation. All that 
has to come through in the application." 
</P>
<P>
William Bragg, the district's associate superintendent, agrees with that 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
"Her ideas are sound instructionally," Bragg said. "She has a practical 
understanding of what teachers need in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman de Leyva, who began her teaching career as an instructional aide and 
taught English as a second language, has always had a special interest in 
bilingual educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she won a federal grant to finance a summer school program that 
applied an innovative "thematic learning approach" to help students with 
limited English proficiency. Such students improved their basic skills by 
focusing all their educational lessons on a particular topic: space. 
</P>
<P>
"Math, language arts, science (courses) . . . everything they did had something 
to do with space," Freeman de Leyva said. "By intertwining all their subjects 
around a particular topic we believe it helps them to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Although having an effective educational idea is the path to grant writing 
success, the grants wizard offers other tips: "Have a catchy title and make 
sure you have a nice cover for your proposal."

DOCTOR KILLS SELF DAY AFTER SENTENCING IN DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An East San Diego physician killed himself in his office Tuesday, one day after 
he was fined $20,000 and placed on five years' probation for illegally 
distributing prescription drugs, the coroners office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Julius C. Gorton Jr., 59, was found dead in his office in the 4300 block of 
40th Street at about 9 a.m. Tuesday by his father-in-law, according to San 
Diego County Deputy Coroner Dan Matticks. 
</P>
<P>
Matticks said that Gorton died of a self-inflicted, .38-caliber gunshot wound 
in the mouth. Gorton had been despondent over legal and health problems, 
Matticks said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton had been sentenced and fined Monday by U. S. District Court Judge Rudi 
Brewster after he had pleaded guilty Dec. 12 to one count of illegally 
distributing a controlled drug to an undercover agent who posed as a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton was given a three-year suspended sentence, but no jail time was to be 
served, and Gorton's medical license was not suspended. Gorton was also 
ordered, under the conditions of probation, not to prescribe controlled 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton was indicted by a federal grand jury last April on 60 counts of 
distributing drugs without a legitimate medical prescription. All but one of 
the counts was dismissed when he pleaded guilty to one count.

'CORONADO COMPANY' FIGURE ARRESTED IN NEW DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another member of a former drug-smuggling ring known as the "Coronado Company" 
has been arrested on new drug charges, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Edward Wade, 47, of Del Mar was arrested Monday in the Northern California 
town of Leggett, the San Diego County Integrated Narcotic Task Force announced. 
He is the third former "Coronado Company" member to be arrested in the task 
force investigations since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wade was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to import marijuana. He was 
described by authorities as an "alleged partner and financier" in a plan to 
smuggle 10 tons of marijuana into the country by boat. Agents seized about 
$55,000 when Wade was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine other people arrested in connection with the smuggling plot was 
Edward R. Otero, 34, of Del Mar, another member of the "Coronado Company," a 
drug-trafficking ring that so named because it had its start among classmates 
at Coronado High School in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Otero was taken into custody Monday in Rockport, along the Northern California 
coast. Authorities said Otero was the leader of a group that had gone to 
Rockport to rendezvous with a boat off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
A third Coronado Company member, Robert Kent Lahodny, 39, of San Diego, was 
arrested Friday in San Diego by FBI agents in connection with an alleged plot 
to sell 11 pounds of cocaine.

OPERA PETITIONS NLRB FOR REMOVAL OF PICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLIARD HARPER, San Diego County Arts Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing the possible loss of "hundreds of thousands of dollars," the San Diego 
Opera on Wednesday sought to remove a picket line from the Civic Theatre by 
filing a charge of unlawful labor practices against the pickets' union with the 
National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
The opera stated in a news release that the union -- Makeup Artists and Hair 
Stylists Local 706, International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees -- 
unlawfully established a picket line Monday because it "never represented a 
majority of the opera's employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The opera would commit an unfair labor practice if it recognized Local 706 
prior to the union being chosen by a majority of the makeup artists and hair 
stylists to be their representative." 
</P>
<P>
Union stagehands, electricians and wardrobe workers have refused to cross the 
picket line, preventing the unloading of "Madama Butterfly" scenery and 
scheduled costume fittings for the opera's cast. Also, Local 325, the American 
Federation of Musicians, announced Tuesday that the picket line was sanctioned 
and notified musicians in the opera orchestra that they may legally refuse to 
cross the line for opera rehearsals and performances. 
</P>
<P>
A Saturday recital by mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne at the Civic Theatre is 
endangered by the pickets as well as four virtually sold-out performances of 
"Madama Butterfly." A series of four subscription concerts and one other 
performance of the opera are to begin April 15 at Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Local 706 filed a petition with the NLRB Jan. 5, alleging unfair labor 
practices by the opera. That petition alleges that the opera unlawfully ordered 
the members of its wig and makeup department on Dec. 15 to return season 
contracts before they could accept or reject the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the NLRB filed a request for a temporary injunction against the 
opera to force the opera to again offer the contracts to the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action by the opera was designed "to force some action," opera 
spokeswoman Brenda Hughes said.

DISTRICT 2 RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the race for the Los Angeles Board of Education District 2 seat, The Times 
has chosen to support the candidate who will uphold the views of the giant 
"bureaucracy on the hill," rather than the candidate who represents the 
position of the teachers (editorial, March 29). Teachers' needs are children's 
needs. Administrators are far removed from the classroom and children. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Slavkin has the support of United Teachers of Los Angeles and many 
concerned parents because they believe that remote bureaucracy cannot support 
or understand the needs of children or their partners, the teachers.

YAROSLAVSKY'S REELECTION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "This Is Zev's Turf," Metro, March 20: 
</P>
<P>
We have known Zev Yaroslavsky since before he ran for City Council. We are all 
long-time residents of the Fairfax community and have been involved in the 
preservation of Fairfax with Zev. 
</P>
<P>
Zev has represented the needs of our community in an exemplary manner. As a 
20-year member of Etz Jacob Congregation, he has been extremely sensitive to 
needs of all members of his constituency, including the Orthodox Jewish 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Zev initiated the revitalization of the stores along Fairfax Avenue from 
Beverly Boulevard to Clinton Avenue, utilizing $1 million in federal funds and 
$3 million in private funds. 
</P>
<P>
Zev co-sponsored the Beverly-Fairfax Patrol, which has over 100 members who 
patrol our area at night to assist in making the streets of our neighborhood 
safe. Zev was instrumental in the placing of a stoplight at the corner of 
Clinton and La Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Zev has helped make our community more liveable and safer. That's why we are 
supporting him on April 11.

MEESE TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now we know, from his own testimony under oath in a courtroom, to whom Edwin 
Meese III swore his oath on taking office as U.S. attorney general (Part I, 
March 29). He didn't mean it when he swore to uphold the Constitution of the 
United States. His first loyalty he now testifies was to Ronald Reagan, and he 
cheerfully broke his oath to his country to serve Reagan in breaking his oath. 
</P>
<P>
This action is, of course, grounds for impeachment -- of both of them. It is 
too late for a trial, perhaps. But let the record show how the Great 
Communicator and his police toady stack up as patriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
I refer to "New U.S. Policy on Contras Told," Part I, March 25: 
</P>
<P>
You state that under a bipartisan agreement, $45 million of humanitarian aid -- 
for food and shelter -- will be provided the Contras over a period of 10 
months. Based on a 12,000 troop count, this sum equates to $375 per month per 
Contra, or approximately $65 more than the general relief paid to the destitute 
by Los Angeles County -- and an even greater differential when compared to the 
relief provided in other areas of the U.S. where the cost of living is less. 
And many of those on relief live on the streets -- or in shelters, if they can 
be found -- because affordable housing is just not available. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to justify Contra support as a funding priority over needed 
social programs which, we are told by our legislators, cannot be provided 
because of budget deficits. With inadequate housing, food, medical care, and 
education, it is apparent that the poor in this country are effectively the 
source of the $45 million for the Contras.

Bravo for your editorial on the "new" Contra package, flawed with the old 
policy of Contra aid to keep an army together! 
</P>
<P>
Five Central American presidents have called for all aid to rebel groups to 
stop, and repatriation of the Contras before any elections in Nicaragua. 
Secretary of State James Baker's statements that they approve of his 
"bipartisan" package are erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats now have the opportunity to take the lead in setting a policy 
towards Nicaragua that a majority of American voters have wanted for years: 1) 
no more Contra aid (they can be disbanded with the money already accumulated 
from the last aid). 2) Negotiate directly with Nicaragua about treatment of the 
Contras. 3) Lift the trade embargo, so that the U.S. could be Nicaragua's main 
trade partner instead of the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration calls for more than $4 million per month out of 
our tax pockets to coddle the marauding Contras, it's time for the Democrats to 
resist the "bipartisanship" siren.

<P>
In its editorial "The Contra Package" (March 26), The Times tries to use two 
contradictory statements to promote the disingenuous cause of discontinuing all 
U.S. aid to the democratic Nicaraguan resistance. 
</P>
<P>
First, the editorial says that the Sandinistas are convinced that the 
resistance "is defeated." Then, the editorial quotes a Sandinista spokesman as 
saying, "Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a contradiction in 
terms." 
</P>
<P>
It appears to me that The Times is once again letting wishful thinking get 
ahead of it, while the Sandinistas know full well that they are in jeopardy so 
long as the resistance exists in any form. 
</P>
<P>
This alone convinces me that the bipartisan agreement on U.S. support of the 
resistance is the best way to effectively keep the focus of the Nicaraguan 
civil war clearly on bringing democracy to Nicaragua. Something The Times 
obviously doesn't feel as strongly about as it does promoting peace at any 
price.

Alan Gershman is a liberal Democrat who has totally devoted himself to the

President Wayne Johnson and his union. With Gershman defeated in the April 11 
election for the Los Angeles school board, the unions will own the school board 
lock, stock and barrel.

Irrespective of the merits of the current wage dispute, this conflict of

Wednesday afternoon on Simi Valley Freeway at Balboa Boulevard as temperatures

cargo of cardboard went up in smoke. Authorities blamed the fire on a broken 
oil line. The blaze lasted 20 minutes and tied up freeway traffic in both 
directions. Smoke was thick enough that emergency operators received calls 
reporting a brush fire. BORIS YARO / Los Angeles Times

SCHOOL BOARD CHALLENGERS WANT SEPARATE DISTRICT FOR VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The challengers seeking to represent the San Fernando Valley on the Los Angeles 
school board in next week's election said Wednesday that want to separate the 
Valley from the rest of the district and end such programs as bilingual 
education and voluntary busing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our own racial groups in the Valley and we need to be taking care of 
our own," said Cliff Stadig, a retired building contractor. He is one of five 
candidates running against West Valley school board member Julie Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers, speaking to 25 people at Birmingham High School in Reseda, 
said Korenstein and East Valley representative Roberta Weintraub must share the 
blame for district troubles such as a pending teacher strike. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years, can anyone here say that our schools are better off? I 
doubt it," said Barry Pollack, one of Weintraub's two challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Dauna Packer, Michael Kaliczak, Barbara Romey and Ernesto Llanes all 
said they agreed with proposals to break up the district and end voluntary 
busing. They have supported these proposals throughout the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh candidate, Gerald Horowitz, a Sun Valley junior high school 
principal, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub and Korenstein replied that the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles 
Unified School District had been studied in the past, but it has been largely 
discarded because of legal and financial barriers. 
</P>
<P>
They defended busing as necessary to relieve overcrowding in inner-city 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, school board president, is seeking her fourth term on the 
seven-member board. Her most visible challenger is Pollack, a Sherman Oaks 
resident, emergency room physician and former screenwriter. Also running is 
Llanes, an electrical contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, a former teacher and program coordinator, represents the Valley 
area west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Both incumbents have so far each raised more than $75,000 and are expected to 
surpass $100,000 by Tuesday's election. Weintraub and Korenstein each have more 
than $50,000 to spend in the last days of the election. Those figures are well 
ahead of the seven challengers, who together will probably raise only slightly 
more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Romey and Horowitz are Korenstein's most visible challengers. They hope to draw 
enough votes to force a runoff election. School board candidates must receive 
at least half of the votes cast to win. 
</P>
<P>
The problems facing the school district include declining academic test scores 
and a high dropout rate.

BERNARDI TAKES CHARGE IN DEBATE WITH 6 FOES BEFORE AUDIENCE OF 25 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi came out slugging Wednesday night 
in his first -- and possibly only -- appearance with his six challengers in 
Tuesday's election for the seat representing the northeast San Fernando 
Valley's 7th District. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting for his opponents to attack, Bernardi went on the offensive 
before an audience of about 25, who barely outnumbered the candidates at a 
political forum sponsored by the NAACP in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized his opponents for portraying Pacoima as a crime-plagued, run-down 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fine community," he said. "Yes, it has problems, and we're 
addressing them." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi used the forum to announce the opening Friday of his first field 
office in Pacoima. He also vigorously defended his record on fighting crime and 
controlling growth. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi lashed out at his leading challenger, Lyle Hall, for fighting pension 
reform when Hall was president of the Los Angeles city firefighters union. 
Bernardi contended that pension reform, which he sponsored, has saved the city 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Bernardi says there's a lot of money in City Hall, why hasn't that 
money come to the district?" challenger Irene Tovar asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hall pledged if elected to establish a citizens committee in each community to 
advise him on every proposed new building that requires council approval. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he is preparing to establish such a committee to advise him on 
development plans for each community, but he prefers to consult with residents 
of affected neighborhoods on specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger James Braun promised if elected to halt all construction in the 
district until a new development plan can be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Gribs, another challenger, said he would fight crime by providing 
"positive reinforcement" to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of more police, we need therapists," he said. "Instead of jails, we 
need drug treatment facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Jules S. Bagneris III questioned whether Bernardi has fought aggressively 
enough to close Lopez Canyon Landfill, to restore a lake in the Hansen Dam 
recreation area and to kill the proposed Nancy Reagan Center for drug 
rehabilitation in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's for once stop our area from becoming the dumping ground for Los 
Angeles," Bagneris said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, without mentioning Bernardi's name, said the district "needs someone who 
can work with the other councilmen." He was referring to Bernardi's reputation 
as a maverick on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel the quality of life in our community is just as good as it is in 
Sherman Oaks, then reelect the councilman," said challenger Al Dib. 
</P>
<P>
On crime, Bernardi pointed out that he had secured funding to install a 
wrought-iron fence around the crime-plagued San Fernando Gardens housing 
project and said he will seek to require all new apartment buildings in the 
district to install similar security measures.

PICUS DEFENDS RECORD IN 1ST DEBATE WITH RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus, appearing for the first time with her 
five challengers in Tuesday's election, defended her record on development and 
police protection at a debate Wednesday night at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, 58, was first elected to the council in 1977 and is running for 
reelection representing the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jeanne Nemo, 60, a Republican activist who lost to Picus in 1985, 
accused the councilwoman of pursuing a liberal political agenda at the expense 
of added police protection. Nemo cited Picus' sympathy for the Sanctuary 
Movement, which helps smuggle illegal aliens from Central America across the 
Mexican border and hides them in churches. 
</P>
<P>
"Joy Picus, who has never supported an increase in police strength, strongly 
supported making L.A. a sanctuary city," Nemo said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus responded that she supported bringing the Los Angeles Police Department 
to 7,900 members, a strength it is expected to reach in July. She also supports 
increasing the police force to 10,000 officers by 1993, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am on your side in fighting against these negative forces," she said, 
referring to crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Picus has managed to win reelection in the conservative west San 
Fernando Valley district despite her reputation as a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Peter Ireland, 42, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane 
Dana, criticized Picus for supporting the proposed development of an arts park 
in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mrs. Picus is reelected, I guarantee you there will be large-scale 
development going on in the Sepulveda Basin," Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus countered that the arts park would occupy only 60 of the basin's 3,000 
acres and would enhance public enjoyment of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Picus' other challengers are Morton Diamond, 57, a hot dog vendor; Paul M. 
McKellips, 30, who quit his job as vice president of an executive search firm 
to run for the council, and Ron Rich, 40, truck fleet manager for Metro Ford in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was attended by about 150 people.

NEW LAKE AT HANSEN DAM TO BE FILLED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small lake recently dug out behind the walls of Hansen Dam in Lake View 
Terrace is a community hazard, unfit for swimming and fishing, and will be 
filled in with sand this month, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land, comes at 
a time when area residents are demanding that a recreational lake be restored 
at Hansen Dam as part of the area's revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had hoped that the 10- to 15-acre body of water, dug out by a private 
contractor dredging silt from the dam, could be used for recreational purposes 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are going to get a lake; we're planning for it," said Lowell 
Flannery, chief of operations and maintenance at corps projects in the Los 
Angeles area. "But not this one this summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Excavation Allowed 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, corps officials allowed contractor Bill Blomgren to excavate an 
area in the dam with the hope that it could be used this summer for swimming 
and fishing. Blomgren said he would grade a road and parking lot for free. 
</P>
<P>
Blomgren is the sole contractor permitted by the corps to dig out silt for sale 
to construction firms. He pays the federal government 15 to 20 cents in 
royalties for each ton of silt removed. 
</P>
<P>
The water that has collected this past year, however, is now blooming with 
algae and is unhealthful for swimming because it contains runoff from horse 
stables upstream, corps officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's warm water temperature makes it undesirable for stocking with game 
fish, except for catfish, which are predators that would swim upstream into the 
Big Tujunga Wash, eating and possibly threatening the existence of native fish 
species, corps officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the lake is too close to the huge bulldozers and earthmoving equipment 
excavating sand and gravel, making the area dangerous for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent hot weather and impending summer months, the unsupervised lake 
is an "attractive nuisance" and could lead to injury or drowning, said Wanda 
Kiebala, chief of the recreation division for the corps. 
</P>
<P>
The decade-long deterioration of the Hansen Dam Recreation Area -- whose 
once-vibrant lake was choked dry in the early 1980s by a buildup of silt -- has 
been a source of community anger for years. It has come to symbolize what some 
people see as governmental insensitivity to the needs of the largely 
low-income, minority area that the park once served. When the lake was reduced 
to a stagnant pond, the surrounding park area slowly turned into an encampment 
of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) obtained congressional 
approval to use Blomgren's royalty payments to pay for park revitalization and 
lake restoration. Funds will total about $600,000 by the end of this year, 
corps officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the corps sponsored a community meeting to hear residents' 
recommendations on how the park should be redeveloped. The meeting was the 
first step toward creation of a corps-written master plan that will map out all 
future development of the 1,450-acre area. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming response was an angry call to restore the lake and horse 
trails through the park, destroyed by silt inundation and the subsequent 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone feels the same way," said Harlene Kelley, a 33-year Lake View Terrace 
resident. "We want what was once ours back again." 
</P>
<P>
Many were critical of the corps bureaucracy, which will need more than a year 
to complete the master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Cynicism prevails," said RobRoy McGregor of Lake View Terrace. "We all hope 
this lake is going to come to pass in our lifetimes, but dealing with the corps 
is like climbing the insurmountable."

COLEMAN FORCED INTO RUNOFF IN INGLEWOOD SCHOOLS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomasina Reed, a Ladera Heights attorney seeking office for the first time, 
beat out two other candidates this week to face 10-year Inglewood school board 
member Caroline Coleman in a June 6 runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was notable for Coleman's absence from the campaign trail and from 
the past four school board meetings because of illness. Coleman's last campaign 
disclosure statement reported that she had raised and spent no money as of 
March 18. Yet voters received a flurry of campaign mailers on her behalf in the 
days preceding the election, and Coleman won 44.3% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Reed ran the best-financed campaign among the three challengers, winning 26.3% 
of the vote. She said she spent about $16,000, considerably more than insurance 
underwriter Jewett Walker, who drew 19.2%, and businessman Emanuel Gary, who 
got 10.3%. Walker said he raised $6,200, and Gary filed a form indicating that 
he expected to raise less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 40, promised Tuesday night to focus her runoff campaign on Coleman, 51, a 
veteran political warrior who has been at the center of a score of 
controversies during her tenure on the Inglewood Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is a big upset for her," Reed said of Coleman, who was not 
available for comment. "I've never run for election before. I think very 
clearly I'm going to pick up those votes (that the other challengers 
received)." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman had the backing of fellow board members Larry Aubry and Joseph Rouzan, 
who were reelected over minimal or no opposition Tuesday. Inglewood Mayor 
Edward Vincent, a longtime ally, also strongly supported Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Reed questioned where the money to pay for Coleman's mailers had come from and 
speculated that Vincent may have been involved. She said she would press for an 
investigation of possible violations of Proposition 73, a new campaign spending 
law that prohibits contributions between candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said: "I think one of the things you've got to look at is where did her 
money come from? If Mayor Vincent put his money into it, then he's violating 
Proposition 73, and that's going to have to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's campaign spending after March 18 does not need to be reported until 
May 25. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue Reed said she would stress is Coleman's illness. Opponents and 
school district employees say Coleman is bedridden with cancer and may not be 
able to serve her board term if elected. In a telephone interview before the 
election, Coleman vigorously denied having cancer, calling her illness "a 
female thing" from which she would recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the true story on her illness?" Reed asked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reed appears to have a solid chance of unseating Coleman, whose opponents have 
accused her of allowing political connections to influence her decisions as a 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
At campaign forums -- which Coleman did not attend but to which she sometimes 
sent representatives with prepared statements -- the other candidates 
criticized Coleman's votes to demote rather than fire Leonard Matthews, a 
principal and political ally who faces criminal charges for embezzling $10,000 
in school funds. They also cited a 1985 indictment of Coleman on charges of 
misusing public funds, a case that a judge later threw out on grounds that it 
was a civil matter. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Coleman appears to be particularly strong in the Ladera Heights 
area where Reed and Walker live. Reed said Tuesday that she would attempt to 
expand her support into Inglewood and seek the votes of the other challengers' 
supporters and of the Inglewood Teachers Assn., which endorsed Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Reed already has the strong support of board member Lois Hill-Hale, who cheered 
her strong showing at a celebration at Reed's Inglewood campaign headquarters 
Tuesday.

BERNSON ASKS L.A. TO HELP PAY FOR BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson on Wednesday proposed that the city 
help finance construction of a bridge across Aliso Canyon with $2 million left 
over from another bridge project. 
</P>
<P>
The Aliso Canyon bridge is a key part of a proposal to develop 1,300 acres in 
the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
If the city approves the proposed 3,000 residences and 7.5 million square feet 
of commercial space, Porter Ranch Development Co. could be required to pay much 
of the cost of the bridge, which would allow completion of an unfinished 2-mile 
stretch of Sesnon Boulevard. The bridge and street extension are expected to 
cost $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of if it should be built, it's a question of when," 
Bernson said of the 700-foot-long bridge. Bernson's motion Wednesday was to 
help fund the bridge with the $2-million surplus from a separate bridge 
project. That bridge is being built to eliminate a jog in Nordhoff Street 
between Tampa and Corbin avenues in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to Committee 
</P>
<P>
The motion was referred to the council's Public Works Committee for 
consideration in the next several weeks. The council ordinarily abides by the 
wishes of a member on projects in his or her district. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's Porter Ranch plan cites an "urgent need" for the bridge but 
does not specify how or whether the company, run by Beverly Hills builder 
Nathan Shapell, would be required to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
If the development is approved, Shapell is "obviously going to fund part of the 
cost of the bridge," said Joseph Lucas, San Fernando Valley district engineer 
for the city's Bureau of Engineering. "There has been a lot of discussion and 
nothing has been finalized" about how much the developer might have to pay, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a February public hearing on the Porter Ranch plan, some residents 
complained that the Aliso Canyon bridge would open their neighborhoods to 
commuters trying to avoid the crowded Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Negotiable' 
</P>
<P>
But Bernson said his support for the bridge is "not, in my opinion, 
negotiable." No matter what sort of development is approved in Porter Ranch and 
elsewhere in the north Valley, the bridge is a needed transportation 
improvement, he said. It will also improve access for firefighters in an area 
where 15 homes were destroyed and 25 damaged by a brush fire in December, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson has not taken a formal stand on the entire $2-billion Porter Ranch 
plan, the product of negotiations between the developer, city planners and a 
citizens committee that Bernson appointed. But he said he will disclose his 
position April 13 when the city Planning Commission holds a public hearing on 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, city planners recommended that the proposal be changed to 
hold the developer to 1.5 million square feet of commercial space until the 
state funds an extra lane in both directions on the Simi Valley Freeway.

SWARMS OF MOTHS ECLIPSE PADRES' FIRST PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two seasons began at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium this week. The Padres began 
another quest for a National League championship. And the moths opened their 
season with a series of swoops and divebombings that had spectators dodging 
more than hard-hit foul balls. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the moths are off to the better start. The Padres earned their first 
victory in three tries against San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon, but the 
moths -- which for years have been attracted to the stadium lights -- are in 
the midst of what might be their most productive season in stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
Although the insect, known as the white-lined sphinx, is harmless to 
agriculture and wildlife, its size makes it alarming to humans. With a wingspan 
of 3 to 4 inches, it is among the largest moths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
So Big They're Scary 
</P>
<P>
"They're so big they scare people," said Tom Baker, chairman of entomology at 
UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The problems at the stadium appear to be part of a sudden Southern 
California-wide population boom in white-lined sphinx moths, according to 
several regional insect experts. The moths, which usually prefer desert-like 
climates, have been observed in large numbers in most parts of San Diego 
County, even in some areas close to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although the experts had no hard data on the increased population, all said 
they had noticed that the moth is more numerous and more widely distributed 
this spring than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them flying around in the morning on the freeway, and that is quite 
amazing," said Brian Harris, a lepidoptera technician at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History. "I haven't seen that in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The experts had no sure explanation for the population growth. But most 
speculated that it was a combination of favorable weather and the natural 
cycles that affect the population of the white-lined sphinx. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to run in cycles, every three or four or five years their population 
just explodes," said David Faulkner, curator of entomology at the San Diego 
Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The moths that are flying now are the result of eggs laid last summer, Faulkner 
said. He said the white-lined sphinx is a hardy moth 
</P>
<P>
that probably was not affected seriously by the lack of winter rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
That means they are here to stay, but only for another few weeks. The best news 
for stadium-goers and residents all the way from Mission Hills to Del Mar is 
that the adult moths have a life span of only four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just going to disappear on their own," said Kathy Williams, a biology 
professor at San Diego State University. "In a matter of weeks, they won't be a 
problem. They're a beautiful moth; they are just making a bad name for 
themselves because they were at the wrong place a the wrong time. If this 
happened before the baseball season, no one would have cared." 
</P>
<P>
But, because their population burst coincided with the baseball opener, stadium 
management is left to search for a quick cure. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had them, but I've never seen them quite like this," said Bill 
Wilson, stadium manager for four years. "Everyone is complaining." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Usually Nocturnal 
</P>
<P>
Normally, day games provide a respite from the bothersome moths. But not this 
year. Their numbers have made the usually nocturnal creatures quite bold. 
</P>
<P>
"They're flying around like crazy now, and the lights aren't even on," Wilson 
said one afternoon from his stadium office. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so acute that a crew will spray the stadium later in the week in 
an effort to control the moths, Wilson said. The work will be done while the 
Padres are in Houston for a three-game weekend series with the Astros that 
starts Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the spraying should provide relief in time for a seven-game stand 
starting Monday night against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
But the Natural History Museum's Faulkner said spraying is useless. 
</P>
<P>
"That will only kill the moths that are there now," he said. "As soon as they 
turn the lights back on, a new group will be drawn right back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Boom Later 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, residents can expect another outbreak of the insect, probably later 
in the summer when the eggs laid by this group eventually develop into adult 
moths. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Wilson said, he would not resort to spraying. He 
said swallows nesting in the stadium are usually able to keep the moths in 
check, but this spring the birds appear overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hungriest of swallows, entomologist Baker said, would have a tough 
time controlling such a large population of adult moths. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are big, big moths," he said. "A swallow eats one of those, and he won't 
have to eat again the rest of the night."

THOUSAND OAKS VOTES TO HIRE DISABLED-ACCESS COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Thousand Oaks, responding to a flood of complaints from a disabled 
rights group, will hire a handicapped-access coordinator to ensure that local 
businesses provide special parking spaces, wheelchair ramps and other aids. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the position Tuesday after city employees said they 
were overwhelmed by complaints filed by a local group called Advocates for 
Accessibility, or AFA. In the past 15 months, the three-member group has filed 
304 complaints with the city against local businesses for failing to provide 
access aids for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the complaints filed by AFA have been dismissed by city 
investigators as being too vague, but reviewing them has been time-consuming, 
said Barry Branagan, director of the city's Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
By agreeing to hire the coordinator, city officials "have seen the handwriting 
on the wall," said AFA member John Ellis. "There will be a few more skirmishes, 
but the disabled have basically won the war in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
The coordinator, who will earn $38,000 annually, will review developers' plans, 
conduct inspections of projects under construction and coordinate the efforts 
of various city departments, such as planning and public works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Laws 
</P>
<P>
State laws require that public buildings constructed since 1982, and older 
structures being remodeled, must be made accessible to the handicapped. The 
laws require features such as wheelchair ramps, special bathrooms and parking 
spaces for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
After AFA complained that city officials were ignoring many of its complaints, 
the state attorney general's office requested that the city report quarterly on 
compliance with the laws until further notice. The first report, released last 
week, said 193 of the 304 complaints that AFA filed, about 63%, were too vague 
to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said he was pleased at the 
"positive response" that the city had taken by approving the position. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday also approved creation of a five-member handicapped appeals 
board. Property owners and others who disagree with the city's interpretation 
of the state access laws can bring their cases to the board. For instance, a 
developer could claim that an older building was exempt, Branagan said. 
</P>
<P>
But council members put off deciding until a public hearing in May whether the 
board's decisions would be final or could be appealed to the City Council. AFA 
members want to give the board final authority, such as similar bodies have in 
other communities, including Los Angeles.

BURBANK REJECTS ACCUSATION THAT DOSSIN ILLEGALLY TOOK DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank Councilwoman Mary E. Kelsey on Wednesday accused Mayor Al F. Dossin of 
illegally accepting a campaign contribution during the city's February election 
that he did not report. But city officials said that Kelsey had made a mistake 
and that Dossin apparently has violated no laws. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey, who was defeated in the election, said Dossin's campaign accepted a 
$2,371 contribution from a political action committee formed by the Burbank 
Firefighters Assn. on Feb. 21, 10 days after the deadline for reporting 
campaign contributions to the Burbank city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey said Dossin was required by the state Political Reform Act to report any 
contribution greater than $1,000 within 24 hours of receiving it, or in a 
post-election report listing his contributions. The election was Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
She said the contribution was used to distribute what she called a "nasty 
brochure" that presented a "grossly distorted and misleading comparison of 
candidates" running for three seats on the Burbank City Council. The brochure 
endorsed Dossin and criticized her. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin finished fourth out of 14 candidates and earned a place in a runoff for 
two seats, which will be held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey said Dossin was trying to avoid disclosing the connection between his 
campaign "and the coordinated campaign to defeat me" by the firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was considering calling for an investigation into her charges by 
the Los Angeles district attorney's office, the Burbank city attorney's office 
and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin called Kelsey's accusations "ridiculous. There's absolutely nothing to 
it. I realize she feels bad about not making the runoff, but I had nothing to 
do with this." 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Merle Woodburn said Kelsey was mistaken. She said the firefighters 
committee did not contribute directly to Dossin's campaign, but spent the 
$2,371 in support of him, which is not a violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
She said Dossin apparently had no knowledge of the union's action and was not 
consulted about the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Stone, president of the firefighters association, said that through a 
clerical error, the committee neglected to mark the $2,371 as an independent 
expenditure on a form filed with the city clerk's office. He said that FPPC 
officials told him that the committee had not violated any laws and that he 
only had to file an amendment to the statement to correct the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unfortunate way for Mrs. Kelsey to end her tenure on the council," 
Stone said.

ARRESTED DRIVER HAD TWICE LEGAL LIMIT OF ALCOHOL, CHP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County woman had a blood-alcohol content more than twice the level of 
legal drunkenness when she was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving last 
week, authorities said, the night before she was arrested again after an 
accident that killed three young men and injured two others. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Helen Mannes, 34, of Somis had blood-alcohol readings of 0.25% and 0.26% 
in two Breathalyzer tests shortly after she was arrested at 1:10 a.m. Thursday, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rick Carter said. A blood-alcohol level of 
0.10% is considered legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was taken to the Van Nuys Division jail at 2 a.m. and released on her 
own recognizance eight hours later, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Mannes was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after a fatal 
accident on the westbound Ventura Freeway east of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' blood-alcohol reading after the accident will not be available for 
another week, CHP Officer Lisa Sowell said. The tests are being conducted on 
her blood. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was released Monday afternoon from Los Robles Regional Medical Center in 
Thousand Oaks, where she was treated for minor injuries, a nursing supervisor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory D. Totten said Mannes is not in 
custody but is in a "lock and key" situation at a hospital that was identified 
by Sowell as Simi Valley Adventist Hospital in Simi Valley.

BAGNERIS DENOUNCES GM PLANT CLOSURE IN BID FOR LABOR SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying he wanted to erode the strong labor base of one of his opponents, Los 
Angeles City Council candidate Jules Bagneris III on Wednesday opposed closure 
of the Van Nuys General Motors plant. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Hall, president of United Firefighters of Los Angeles from 1976 to 1984, 
generally has been acknowledged as labor's candidate in the 7th District race. 
But on Wednesday, Bagneris questioned that label. 
</P>
<P>
"I've handed out my literature early in the morning at various plants," 
Bagneris said. "They're telling me they're going to support my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
However, only one union representative showed up at Bagneris' mid-afternoon 
news conference in front of the plant, while streams of workers ending their 
shifts drove past him, some of them honking their horns. About 3,400 people 
assemble cars at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers union has already endorsed incumbent Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
The General Motors plant has been operating under a cloud since the fall, when 
managers first announced that the production of Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac 
Firebirds might be moved elsewhere in 1991. Final word was expected by March. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he was disappointed not to receive the UAW endorsement. But he said 
his union support remains strong. He said he has been supported by United 
Firefighters, the Police Protective League, Los Angeles County Federation of 
Labor and Teamsters Joint Council 42. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi accused Bagneris of "really stretching" for campaign issues. He 
defended his record, saying he has worked closely with General Motors 
executives and union officials over the years.

TOROS NINE HAS SLIM CHANCE AT 3RD CROWN IN CCAA RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where is the Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team going to finish in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. race? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe anywhere it wants in a league where no clear-cut favorite has emerged at 
the halfway point of the season. Dominguez Hills (6-7, 11-16-1 overall) begins 
a three-game series at UC Riverside this afternoon at 3. The teams meet Friday 
at 3 at Dominguez Hills, then return to Riverside for a 1 p.m. game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
All seven conference teams are within striking distance of first. Dominguez 
Hills, which has lost four of its last five games, is only two games out of 
first place. Only three games separate the top and bottom teams. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach George Wing, a former Riverside assistant coach, thinks the 
CCAA race could come down to the final week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see a runaway happening," he said. He thinks the level of play in 
the conference has gone "definitely down" over the last five years. Because of 
that the Toros, a scrappy but inefficient bunch, may be able to back into a 
third CCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, that would be more than Wing bargained for when he arrived in 
Southern California from his most recent post at Cosumnes River Community 
College near Sacramento. He had virtually no time to recruit because he arrived 
in late August. So what he is left with are last year's holdovers from a 19-30 
team, a few walk-ons and what players he was able to entice to Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know where to expect us to be," Wing said. "We have some quality guys 
and we have some good players, but not in numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Touted for his ability to rebuild programs in a short period, Wing sees the 
CCAA race coming down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of thing where everybody is beating up on everyone else," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason the CCAA is so wide open is that no team seems to be capable of 
putting together victories in numbers, most notably Dominguez Hills. Only 
recently have Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo shown signs of shaking the 
pack. Neither has been overly impressive. Pomona took three out of four games 
from Dominguez Hills recently but is 13-21 overall. San Luis Obispo (8-6 in the 
CCAA) has split its last six conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills has failed to score a lot of runs for its ace pitcher, Rick 
Davis (5-3). Against Pomona last week Davis hurled a six-hitter and struck out 
10 but lost, 3-1. At one point Davis was 5-1. In his last four outings he has 
lost twice and had two no-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a major league prospect, Davis has broken the school's single-season 
strikeout mark (116) and his earned-run average of about 2.00 is one of the top 
marks in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Ron Veazey (5-1) has been more fortunate. He is in the No. 2 spot 
in the pitching rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Wing received "a real shot in the arm" when Harbor College transfer David 
Haggard pitched "seven strong innings" in a 5-2 non-conference loss to U.S. 
International University last week. Haggard is considered the team's No. 3 
pitcher, but arm problems plagued him early in the year. At Harbor he was 14-3 
in two seasons, but at Dominguez Hills he is 0-5 with an ERA of 6.17. 
</P>
<P>
A few key pitching performances out of the bullpen could help. Right-hander 
Charlie Plumley (1-4) is the only pitcher to win a game in relief. That came 
last week in the Pomona series. 
</P>
<P>
But the team's .272 batting average and slugging percentage of .379 will have 
to improve if the Toros want to make a serious run in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Wing: "The bottom line is, this team will have to swing the bat just 
like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, things are getting smoother now that a few players are settling 
into new positions. But the team has allowed 43 unearned runs to opponents' 17. 
</P>
<P>
When Davis moved into the starting rotation as a pitcher, Dominguez Hills lost 
him at shortstop. So Wing moved a pair of community college players up the 
middle. Adrian Rodriguez, who played third base at El Camino College last 
season, was moved to second base and second baseman Fred Camerena, a transfer 
from Fullerton College, switched to shortstop. Like Davis a year ago, Camerena 
leads the team in errors with 11, followed by third baseman Ruben Jauregui with 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has been much smoother, committing just six miscues, including two in 
a mop-up role at shortstop. "Early in the year we were hurt in key situations 
by key people," Wing said. "But we are beginning to settle down a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Down the stretch Wing says good defense will play a major role. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep harping on the guys from the very beginning that we have a good 
pitching staff and we have to play catch behind them." 
</P>
<P>
The batteries need to play defense, too. Between the pitchers and catchers 
there have been 16 errors. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars, Jauregui leads the team in hitting, but his average is 
about 65 points below his CCAA-leading .408 of a year ago. However, last week 
he went nine for 22 to lift his average 50 points in 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Damon Neidlinger, forced to play second base last year on a team 
decimated by injuries, is beginning to look comfortable at his old position and 
has shown signs of awakening from a slump 30 points below his average of a year 
ago. He leads the team in runs batted in with 16 and in home runs, four. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really come on in the last 10 to 15 games," Wing said. "We are looking to 
him in key situations again." 
</P>
<P>
And center fielder Rob Campbell has "been on a terror," Wing said. He is 
batting .328 as the leadoff hitter and went 11 for 26 last week. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor College transfer Billy Keep is batting .313. 
</P>
<P>
A sweep of Riverside would send Dominguez Hills to San Luis Obispo with a 
chance to grab the CCAA lead. But Wing is more practical. He'd be happy winning 
two of the next three.

TIMES HONORS TOP PREP CAGERS, OUTSTANDING COACHES

Centers Ed Stokes of St. Bernard and Lisa Leslie of Morningside and coaches 
Carl Strong of Torrance and Frank Scott of Morningside were the South Bay award 
winners Sunday at The Times high school basketball banquet at the Anaheim 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes and Leslie were named players of the year while Strong and Scott were 
selected boys and girls coaches of the year. Scott, who guided the Lady 
Monarchs to the state Division I title, won the award for the second straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, a 6-11 senior, averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and four blocked shots a 
game to lead St. Bernard to a 23-6 record, the Camino Real League title and the 
second round of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs. His previous honors include 
Camino Real League most valuable player and Southern Section Division I player 
of the year. He has signed to play for Coach Lute Olson at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance was picked by coaches to finish last in the Bay League, but under 
Strong the Tartars surprised everyone by contending for the title until the 
last week of the season. They finished third and won two games in the Southern 
Section 4-AA playoffs before losing to eventual champion San Bernardino in the 
quarterfinals. Torrance finished with a 16-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-5 Leslie established herself as the most dominant girls player in the 
state and perhaps the nation by leading Morningside to a 32-1 record and its 
first state title. The junior averaged 26 points, 14.6 rebounds and nearly 
seven blocked shots as the Lady Monarchs rose to the nation's No. 2 ranking in 
USA Today. Leslie was named to the Parade All-American first team. 
</P>
<P>
Scott guided the Morningside girls to their best season ever. They repeated as 
Southern Section and regional champions before avenging last year's one-point 
loss to Fremont of Oakland in the state Division I final, 60-50. Scott did it 
with a team that had only one senior -- point guard JoJo Witherspoon -- and 
started two sophomores and one freshman. ROB FERNAS

SAN FERNANDO DEFEATS TAFT AS DE LA CRUZ GAINS CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His coach says it was more a matter of improved control, being strong enough to 
weather 100-degree temperatures with a heater of his own, and picking some 
timely spots to pick off baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Yet San Fernando High left-hander Hector De La Cruz believes a big reason he 
was able to slice Taft to shreds Wednesday is because of a hair-razing 
experience he had Tuesday evening. De La Cruz had a design shaved into the side 
and back of his noggin -- a detailed 'do that included his uniform number, 11, 
chopped in the back. 
</P>
<P>
The wild look symbolizes the exorcism of his previous demon, namely, wildness. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a new season for me," he said, beaming. "It called 
for a new look." 
</P>
<P>
Head games or not, De La Cruz (3-0) pitched his strongest game in a month, 
throwing a seven-hitter, striking out eight, walking three and allowing one 
earned run as San Fernando defeated Taft, 9-2, in a Northwest Valley Conference 
game at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 200-pound De La Cruz threw consistently in the strike zone for the 
first time since conference play began. Despite his perfect record, De La 
Cruz's earned-run average was above four entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the early innings, he blew away Taft hitters by serving up a blistering 
fastball-forkball combination. When he got into trouble in the fourth, he stuck 
a fork in Adam Zutler, easily picking off the Taft baserunner with the bases 
loaded and one out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lefty that throws very hard and there aren't many of those around," 
Taft Coach Rich McKeon said. "We never got a good piece of him, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando hitters, conversely, had little trouble piecing together numerous 
rallies off Taft right-hander Scott Tiano (1-2). The Tigers managed to get the 
leadoff man aboard in each of Tiano's five innings and took a 3-0 lead in the 
fourth when Tiano hit Richard Sanchez and walked Octavio Serrano and John Najar 
to open the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Munoz reached base on an error by third baseman Rich Cosentino, scoring 
Sanchez. Edwin Rivera singled in Serrano and Jess Romero knocked in Najar on a 
sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (8-5, 5-3 in league play) mounted its only threat in the fourth. De La 
Cruz, who had struck out six in three innings, surrendered three consecutive 
singles to open the inning, bringing Taft to within 3-1, then walked Zutler to 
load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
De La Cruz, however, fanned Benjie Belfield for the first out and caught Zutler 
napping at first when Munoz sneaked in to field a perfect pickoff throw. Doug 
Kougher grounded out to end the inning, and in essence, the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a great move," San Fernando Coach Steve Marden said. "We encourage 
our pitchers to work on that, because I can tell you, it's very demoralizing to 
have a runner erased when you're trying to get back in the game. It knocks the 
wind right out of you." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (8-2-1, 5-2-1) then set sail, scoring a run in the fifth, two in 
the sixth and three in the seventh to put Taft away. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that was a big play," said McKeon of the pickoff play. "But we were 
flat all day -- it wasn't the only mistake we made." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, three Taft pitchers combined to walk seven and hit three. In comparison 
to Tuesday's 7-5 win at San Fernando, McKeon said his team looked, well, 
wooden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like John Wooden said, 'For every artificial peak, there's a valley,' " 
McKeon said. "We beat them and we came out today with no spark at all." 
</P>
<P>
De La Cruz, to be sure, had plenty of fire. In seven innings of 100-degree 
heat, he stayed almost exclusively with hard stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I only remember throwing three curves all day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taft could have thrown Romero almost anything and it wouldn't have made much 
difference. For the second time in as many days, the senior outfielder, who 
bats in the leadoff position, had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando shortstop Bobby Corrales, a senior who had a nine-game hit streak 
snapped Tuesday, was two for five.

BIRMINGHAM WINS BEHIND SPRINTER BURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being disqualified for a false start in the 100 meters, Rodney Burt of 
Birmingham High ran with a vengeance in the longer sprints to lead the host 
Braves to a 79-38 victory over Van Nuys in a Mid-Valley League meet Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships, followed his 
100 mishap with a 49.3-second victory in the 400 and won the 200 with a 
personal best of 22.0. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Brian Gastelum and Steve Weinberger also turned in personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum won the 800 in 2 minutes and Weinberger was victorious in the long 
jump (20 feet, 8 1/4 inches) and triple jump (41-5 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
The victory clinched at least a tie for the Braves' second consecutive 
dual-meet title. Birmingham (6-0) -- which won the Mid-Valley League title last 
season -- can clinch the crown outright with a victory over Reseda (5-1) on 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham girls' team also remained undefeated, winning 78-31. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya Johnson won the 100 (13.1), 200 (27.8) and 400 (1:04.0) for the Braves 
and Tina Means won four events for Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Means, third in the high jump in last year's City championships, won her 
specialty at 5 feet, and took the 100-meter low hurdles (16.6), the 300 low 
hurdles (48.6) and the long jump (15-5). 
</P>
<P>
In other meets: 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 66, Cleveland 60 -- Tim Bowen won the 100 meters in 11.0 and the 
200 in 22.5 for the host Cavaliers (3-3), but San Fernando's depth prevailed in 
the North Valley League meet. 
</P>
<P>
The victory guaranteed the Tigers at least a share of the league title. They 
can win it outright with a victory over Granada Hills (1-6) on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Keary Johns led San Fernando (5-1) with a 15.1 victory in the 110-meter high 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 64 1/2, Monroe 62 1/2 -- Without hurdler Mario Armijo who didn't compete 
for disciplinary reasons, the Vikings lacked the firepower to match up with 
Reseda in the Mid-Valley League meet at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Armijo's absence, Monroe (4-2) won seven of 10 running events, but 
Reseda took four of the five field events to win the meet. Derril White led 
Monroe with victories in the 100 meters (11.0) and the long jump (21-1). Aaron 
Brumfield won the high jump (5-10) and triple jump (40-5) for Reseda (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 59, Granada Hills -- Kim Montgomery set a school record in the 400 
(59.8) and the Highlanders' 400 relay team (49.6) did likewise, but Kennedy won 
the North Valley League girls' meet at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The win improved Kennedy's record to 6-0 and guaranteed the Golden Cougars at 
least a share of their 12th consecutive dual-meet title. Kennedy can clinch the 
title against winless Cleveland on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Kathy McClain won the 100-meter low hurdles (16.7) and the 300 low 
hurdles (48.7).

HE BEAT THE HEAT;

PADRES NEEDED A VICTORY, AND WHITSON GOT ONE

<P>
The problem with Ed Whitson is that the guy can't buy a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday he was zero for two, which kept his season batting average at .000. 
He was called on to pinch-hit in the ninth inning Tuesday night and grounded to 
short. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. His average this season on the mound is 1.000. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson started in Wednesday's suffocating heat and cooled off a San Francisco 
Giants team that had the Padres' heads spinning the previous two days. He went 
6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs on six hits while striking out eight -- his 
high last season. 
</P>
<P>
When he turned the ball over to Dave Leiper in the seventh, the Padres were on 
their way to an over-the-hump, 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
At game's end, thanks in large part to Whitson, the Talking Heads were on the 
clubhouse stereo, and the conversations were flowing freely. As "Life During 
Wartime" slipped into "Wild, Wild Life" on the speakers, the turnabout of Padre 
fortunes from the first two games was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The change was as evident as the Whitson changeup that struck out Terry Kennedy 
with two on to end the sixth, preserving a 4-1 Padre lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first straight changeup Whitson had thrown in at least a couple of 
months, by his own estimate. "It was the perfect time -- it just dawned on me 
to try it," Whitson said. "(Catcher) Benny (Santiago) called for a fastball, 
and I thought, 'I'm not going to cross him up -- the straight change is the 
same as a fastball, only slower.' Benny kind of looked out at me after I threw 
it and said, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
Santiago wasn't the only one who was surprised. As Kennedy left the plate, he 
had a few words for the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that was probably the first straight changeup I threw for a strike 
in years," Whitson said. "It probably was." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants entered the game hitting .307, after sneaking up on Eric Show Monday 
and embarrassing Bruce Hurst Tuesday. The Padres were getting hot under the 
collars, and it wasn't just because of Wednesday's game-time temperature, which 
approached 100. It was 98 at Montgomery Field, about a mile north of the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
So up stepped Ed Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
"Whit's one of those guys who, when they go out there, you know you're going to 
get 100% from," said Pat Dobson, the pitching coach. "Every time. That's the 
way he is. And on a hot day like this, Whit's a good guy to have out there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "I knew it would take a good performance to beat these boys. 
They've been hot the last few nights. They've been hitting bullets. I wanted to 
keep them off stride, and fortunately that happened." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was easy. Brett Butler led off with a bunt single and stole second 
while Robby Thompson, the game's second batter, was still at the plate. The 
Giants put at least one runner on base in every inning but the fourth. Whitson 
endured. 
</P>
<P>
Padre-thumper Kevin Mitchell, who was batting .500 with two home runs entering 
Wednesday's game, was off stride all afternoon. Feeding him a steady diet of 
fastballs, Whitson struck Mitchell out all three times he faced him. Mitchell 
was hitless in five at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he was seeing the fastball too good," Whitson said. "Either he 
was behind on the fastballs, or he was looking for breaking balls." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson also held Will Clark, hitting .556 Wednesday morning, to zero for two 
with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Only Kennedy and Thompson, who each had a home run, really hurt Whitson, who 
said his only mistake was on the pitch to Thompson, a hanging slider that went 
over the left-field fence for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I let it go, I thought, 'Oh no, this man is looking for this 
pitch,' " Whitson said. "And he whacked the hell out of it." 
</P>
<P>
The pitch Kennedy hit was a slider up over the plate. The next batter, third 
baseman Matt Williams, was plunked in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"That was strictly accidental," Whitson said. "The pitch was meant to come 
inside and stand him up to where I could work him on the outside corner. We've 
been getting him out with sliders down and away. I asked him three times if he 
was OK. It was a purpose pitch, not a knockdown pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson was nonetheless able to enjoy an evening with his wife, Kathleen, and 
7-year-old daughter, Jennifer, who were in town to see their man beat the 
Giants. They return home to Columbus, Ohio, this morning, not to return to San 
Diego for the summer until mid-June, when Jennifer finishes school. 
</P>
<P>
"Win or lose, I was going to spend time with my family tonight," Whitson said. 
"We're having a barbecue on the patio, and I'll drink a few beers and play with 
my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that he went hitless at the plate won't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to go ask Jack if I can pinch-hit in the ninth the night 
before I pitch every time," Whitson said, smiling. "It got the early 
butterflies going."

GROSSMONT LEAVES 13 ON BASE BUT SCORES ENOUGH TO DEFEAT EL CAPITAN

The score should have been higher and the margin wider. But between Grossmont 
and El Capitan high schools, 22 runners were left on base Wednesday, and the 
result was a 2-1 nonleague softball victory for Grossmont. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont led, 1-0, going into the fourth inning and had the opportunity to 
greatly extend the lead, loading the bases twice. But the Foothillers added 
just one run when freshman Jolie Oliver led off with a double and scored on an 
error. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hitting the ball on the ground, but we weren't able to get the key 
hits we needed," said Grossmont Coach Steve Sutton, whose team left 13 runners 
on base. "We had a good chance of breaking it wide open. We just didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Foothillers got good hitting from softball rookie Lafrania West, who scored 
Grossmont's first run on a single by Brenna Hancock in the first inning. West, 
who was three for four with a steal, was playing in her first game. She 
competed in track her first three years. 
</P>
<P>
If Grossmont had lost, Sutton had a list of excuses. Although Hancock (9-2), 
was the winner, she wasn't pitching her best because of allergies and illness, 
Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's catcher, Barbara Dotson, returned after missing a week of practice 
because of a serious sunburn, and second baseman Heather Reynolds also returned 
after a bout with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having problems with my allergies and having problems breathing. It 
slowed me down a lot," said Hancock, who has also been battling a cold. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (4-4) also left runners on the bases. They loaded them in the 
fourth inning but scored only once when Buffy Myers came home on Hancock's 
overthrow of Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
"We left runners on second an third several times," said Alan Eber, El 
Capitan's coach. "We made too many mistakes, some key errors." 
</P>
<P>
Eber praised second baseman Andrea Bravo and center fielder Melissa Hatfield 
for their defensive play and said he thinks Bravo is the best second baseman in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrea knows the price you have to pay to be good," Eber said. "Some of the 
kids complain about long practices. Never Andrea -- she wants to practice more.

'CALLING MOSCOW' SURVIVES BUMPS, HOPES TO GROW

<P>
Doug Waldo survived a radio host's worst nightmare during an early segment of 
"Calling Moscow," the innovative KPBS (FM-89.5) telephone call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
During a live national hookup, Americans call in to speak with Soviet guests in 
a Radio Moscow studio via satellite hookup from KPBS in San Diego. For 20 
terrifying minutes, Waldo faced the stark horror of losing all communication 
with the program's Moscow guests, who are the only reason for the show's 
existence. Waldo had a national audience eager to talk to Russians, but no 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to remember that," Waldo said. "I just kept talking. I don't 
remember what I said. I think I started threatening to sing at one point. The 
show is difficult to do under the best of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Since it is broadcast only once a month, few public radio stations carry 
"Calling 
</P>
<P>
Moscow," said Don Martin, who directs KPBS' international projects. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS is considering producing "Calling Moscow" on a weekly basis, beginning 
next October, if more funding can be found. 
</P>
<P>
"We are rethinking the show in terms of how we might make it better," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of top National Public Radio stations showed that stations would 
prefer a weekly program, Martin said. Now, stations must cut into existing 
programming to carry "Calling Moscow" or find other shows to fill the Friday 
time slot when the show airs on the other three weeks in the month. 
</P>
<P>
"A weekly show could find its own place, probably on the weekend," said John 
Herrero, the show's producer. "Weekly, we could make it more current, give it a 
more newsy approach without making it a news program." 
</P>
<P>
The problem that KPBS faces is the increased money it will take to produce a 
weekly national program with satellite hookup. The current annual cost is about 
$70,000, which comes out of the station's operating budget, Martin said. The 
budget for a weekly program would be about $250,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrero hopes to find corporate and foundation support. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 stations across the nation now take the live satellite feed from 
"Calling Moscow," which celebrated its first anniversary last week. The show's 
support among those stations is strong. 
</P>
<P>
"It immediately caught my interest," said Regina Dean, general manager of 
KLRE/KUAR in Little Rock, Ark. "We have found there is a lot of interest 
locally for international programming in terms of the news." 
</P>

To air "Calling Moscow," Dean preempts one hour of National Public Radio's 
daily afternoon news magazine, "All Things Considered." 
</P>
<P>
"People call in and ask what happened to 'All Things Considered' today? We 
think ('Calling Moscow') is an important enough radio program. 'All Things 
Considered' airs seven days a week on this station. We feel that, once a month, 
we can pull one hour of 'All Things Considered.' " 
</P>
<P>
Program director Norris Dryer of WUOT in Knoxville, Tenn., is forced to cut a 
half hour of "All Things Considered" to carry "Calling Moscow" but has done so 
about 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the idea was relatively unique," Dryer said. "When they talked 
about the topics they'd cover each month, it seemed to me that they were Soviet 
subjects that are not often covered: artistic issues, education issues and drug 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest programs have been the ones on current issues, like the special 
broadcasts before Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit in May to 
Washington and programs on the Olympics and the earthquake disaster in Armenia, 
according to KPBS' Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a timeliness about the topic," Martin said. "Therefore, the topic was 
already on the minds of the callers." 
</P>
<P>
Besides its early technical difficulties, "Calling Moscow" has encountered 
other problems. KCRW in Santa Monica dropped the show in February, in part 
because the content was weak. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the purpose of the program was great," said KCRW consultant Will 
Lewis. "Like when 'Night Line' first started, you were excited. Now it whithers 
or dies, depending on whether it's dynamic or compelling. The novelty of 
talking with people from the Soviet Union has worn off. Now we want more 
substance, and I don't think we were getting it." 
</P>
<P>
KPBS' Martin agrees that "Calling Moscow" has not always been compelling. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the Soviets have been asking -- they wish the questions were 
a little more probing," Martin said. "The questions were a little 'light' there 
for the most part. I think, when the more probing questions came from callers, 
it perked up the program. I think it got the adrenaline flowing from the Soviet 
panelists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting philosophical question. We want the listeners to ask the 
questions they want to ask. If a question to us seems a little bit naive, 
that's OK. That's what they want to know about." 
</P>
<P>
The great strength of "Calling Moscow" is the call-in element, said Regina Dean 
of Little Rock's KLRE/KUAR.

Garrison Keillor will make his first Los Angeles appearance in seven years June 
9-10 in the "Third Annual Farewell Performance" of his "A Prairie Home 
Companion." The local dates at Universal Amphitheater will cap a 13-city tour 
that includes a stop June 6 in San Diego's Symphony Hall. The June 10 show here 
will be broadcast live on American Public Radio (locally on KUSC-FM, 91.5). 
Keillor, who quit his popular weekly radio variety program two years ago in 
favor of a writing career, has continued to spoof his departure from the 
airwaves with annual "farewell" programs. Last year, the second annual farewell 
show emanated live from Radio City in New York. Keillor says he decided to do 
the third annual farewell about a year ago, "a couple of months before the 
second annual. I was afraid if I waited for people to beg me to do it, they 
might not. It's a good rule in show business not to wait in the wings too long 
before you come out to do an encore."ALEENE MacMINN

The Who's reunion tour is set for this summer, including benefit performances 
of the English rock band's celebrated rock opera "Tommy" at the Universal 
Amphitheatre and at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Anne Weldon, the band's 
New York-based manager, would only say Wednesday that the tour is under 
discussion and details are unconfirmed, but sources close to the project say 
that the tour -- concentrating on a retrospective of the band's career -- is 
definite and that it will feature stadium appearances in approximately two 
dozen U.S. cities. It is expected to reach Los Angeles -- probably the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- in late August. The "Tommy" shows at the 
amphitheater and Radio City Music Hall will be benefits and will feature a 
series of guest artists, including Tina Turner in the role of the Acid Queen.

Award-winning Irish writer Christopher Nolan, who cannot walk, talk or control 
his twitching limbs, has confirmed reports that his life story may be filmed by 
producer Steven Spielberg. The 22-year-old author, called Ireland's new James 
Joyce, hammered out his autobiography "Under the Eye of the Clock" with a 
"unicorn" stick strapped to his forehead. Nolan's mother cupped his chin in her 
hands as he reached laboriously for each letter on a specially adapted 
typewriter. Last year, his book won Britain's literary prize, the $35,400 
Whitbread Award, and was adapted into a play for the Dublin Theater Festival, 
telling the story of how Nolan nearly died at birth from asphyxiation. ALEENE

MALLE DISSECTS FRENCH FAMILY LIFE IN 'MURMUR OF THE HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young Laurent Chevalier, hero of Louis Malle's sunnily sensual reissued "Murmur 
of the Heart" (opening Friday at the Music Hall) has a wide, droll mouth that 
curls up at the ends like a Picasso line drawing and ears almost like a faun's. 
Something about that look, combined with his skinny skittishness, lets us 
tolerate 14-year-old Laurent even when he behaves like a consummate brat; when, 
for example, in an agony of jealousy he deliberately drops a bottle of milk for 
their aging family maid to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it's 1954. Horrific manners are the mark of the lordly young Frenchman, 
these three particularly; sons of a well-off Dijon gynecologist and his 
free-spirited Italian wife. Their world would change soon enough; it is already 
changing: the French are losing at Dien Bien Phu; in a little more than a 
decade, kids this age from the bourgeoisie would became radicalized. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Malle, who wrote the film in one firestorm week in the spring 
of 1970 and finished it the following year, conjures up that family, that time, 
that insular smugness with a notable mixture of affection and observation. It's 
his family, something we recognize even more clearly after "Au Revoir Les 
Enfants." 
</P>
<P>
Malle, too, had the two older brothers, the love for Charlie Parker and Jelly 
Roll Morton, the heart murmur and the summer at the spa that his young Laurent 
shares. Even the hilarious game of spinach tennis is from memory. But the 
funny, earthy, faintly unhappy Italian mother, Clara, a wild bird untamed by 
her 20 years stifled in the bosom of the French bourgeoisie, is Malle's 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
She has been given indelible life by Lea Massari, an apricot-colored goddess 
whose charm lies in her exuberance, her physicality, her very un-Frenchness, 
and in an utterly disarming sprinkling of freckles. Clara, the daughter of a 
radical political exile, was a 16-year-old visitor to France when Charles 
Chevalier (Daniel Gelin) became her first lover and then her husband, to the 
consternation of his moneyed parents. 
</P>
<P>
Of their three sons, Laurent (Benoit Ferreux), the youngest, is her favorite. 
She adores and babies him; (somehow) he sees her spirit for what it is. His 
older brothers, Marc (Marc Winocourt) and Thomas (Fabien Ferreux, Benoit's own 
brother) have fallen into the habit of putting her down, telling her that she 
couldn't even pass their exams. 
</P>
<P>
When scarlet fever leaves Laurent with a heart murmur, Clara goes with him to a 
health spa up in the mountains. The two are like one closed fist against the 
young prigs and Royalists Laurent encounters, these children of the stuffy, 
social French families who populate the spa. Clara, by being herself -- playing 
her first game of tennis in sneakers and street clothes -- seems marvelous to 
these 16- and 17-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
It's at the spa, triggered by an evening of Bastille Day celebration, that the 
scene that made the film a cause celebre occurs. It's a subdued, nuzzling 
moment between boy-child and intensely affectionate mother, when all his 
impacted jealousy, fascination, adoration and curiousity carry Laurent across 
the line into incest. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, some of us were so busy priding ourselves on being 
shockproof that we didn't really think to question Malle further: to wonder at 
how firmly he denied the moment its reverberations -- to both parties. If this 
was incest, tasteful, "open," utterly without consequence, then what was all 
the fuss about? Actually, what today's audiences may wonder is what the movie 
is about if this moment, toward which the film is so insistently pointed, is so 
without effect. 
</P>
<P>
From today's vantage point, "Murmur of the Heart's" strongest memory becomes 
its climate: political, familial, full of warmth, family jokes and indulged bad 
manners, brotherly acts of rivalry and support. This may be just what Malle was 
aiming for: in his words, "a contemporary comedy of French bourgeois 
education." (The film is MPAA-rated R.) What we see now is elegant detail, 
sharp observation, perfect performances (especially by Benoit Ferreux and the 
sublime Massari). And a possibly far-reaching moment that becomes simply one of 
those enigmatic Gallic shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
Could it really be as weightless as all that? Perhaps. Possibly. One wonders.

PIANIST THOMAS LORANGO IN LOCAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stereotype of a callow pianist, technically promising but musically 
unformed, comes to life in Thomas Lorango, who made his local debut Monday 
night on the Gold Medal series at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to write off young Lorango's undeniable but largely undirected 
talent. But one can bewail its present state of transition, a state that tended 
to make the listener nervous during the young American pianist's intriguing 
performance of an ambitious program. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's Toccata in C minor, BWV 911, launched this agenda impressively, the 
29-year-old musician displaying reliable and independent fingers, a mellow, 
nonpercussive tone and a strong sense of line. Alas, the rest of the program 
did not remain on this level of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, there was an amiable, rather than ferocious, account of Prokofiev's 
familiar Seventh Sonata, one neatly laid out if not always clearly projected. 
Projection, indeed, is the quality most often missing in Lorango's playing. 
</P>
<P>
He does not lack for musicality, his temperament seems to be emerging, and his 
technique shows accomplishment, if not yet breadth. But communication with his 
listeners is a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
In Chopin's F-sharp-minor Polonaise, he seemed to wander all over the emotional 
countryside, offering a few moments of focused feeling, many more of merely 
aimless, dutiful playing. And what this single Chopin piece, all by itself, was 
doing, beginning the second half of his recital, never came clear. Nocturne, 
anyone? 
</P>
<P>
More frustrating for the listener was Lorango's half-baked -- but actually 
promising -- reading of Schumann's monumental Fantasy, Opus 17. Here, the 
pianist seemed to threaten at several places to cave in. Was it a failure of 
nerve, of memory, of octaves? Or simply a matter of finding oneself 
overextended and out on a limb? 
</P>
<P>
After the program proper, and with strong encouragement from a large audience, 
Lorango offered a single encore, "one of my favorite pieces," he said, 
Schumann's Romance in F-sharp. Why it is one of his favorites did not emerge in 
a pallid performance, however.

Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita received more than $370,000 in 1987 
from a company linked to a widening bribery scandal, the Kyodo News Service 
reported. It said Recruit Co. paid $376,000 for two fund-raising parties held 
in May, 1987, to support Takeshita's election campaign. Takeshita has confirmed 
to Parliament that the Recruit firm bought $150,000 in tickets for a 
fund-raising party in Tokyo. But in response to the new reports, he said he did 
not remember an additional $226,000 in tickets bought by the firm a week later.

SENATE TO BEGIN MINIMUM WAGE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Democrats invited a showdown with President Bush over the minimum wage, 
agreeing to take up a House-passed measure the President has repeatedly said he 
will veto. The Senate debate begins today, and the Democratic leaders hope by 
week's end to send to Bush legislation that would raise the minimum wage 30 
cents an hour higher than the President has said he will accept. The Democrats' 
version also includes a sub-minimum wage for newly hired people that falls far 
short of a six-month sub-minimum Bush has insisted must be part of the bill. 
The Senate bill actually due for debate today is one sponsored by Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). His measure would raise the hourly minimum wage from 
$3.35 to $4.65 by January, 1992, and there would be no provision allowing a 
lower wage to be paid to new hires. But Kennedy aides said he has decided to 
offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two 
weeks ago, which has a final target of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay 
new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum wage for two months.

Immigration officials refused to free from a Minnesota prison a Dutch visitor 
who says he has AIDS, saying that allowing him to attend a forum on the disease 
might endanger the health of others. "Parole is an extreme item that would be 
used only in extreme circumstances," said Tom Schiltgen, district director of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, explaining his rejection of the 
request from Hans Paul Verhoef. However, Schiltgen said a decision is likely 
today on Verhoef's request for a waiver from U.S. immigration laws denying 
entry to persons with a dangerous contagious disease.

Customs announced what may be the largest marijuana seizure ever aboard a 
commercial aircraft, confiscating an Air Jamaica jetliner and warning that 
nation to step up its anti-drug efforts. Inspectors found 3,595 pounds of 
marijuana packed into two unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the A-300 
Airbus, which arrived at Miami International Airport on Tuesday, agency 
spokesman Michael Sheehan said. "You could smell it from 50 feet away," Sheehan 
said. "We just cannot comprehend how the Jamaicans could not have discovered 
it, and allowed it to leave the country." Under federal law, the plane was 
seized and government-owned Air Jamaica could be liable for a fine of $28.7 
million.

A federal judge rejected a request by attorneys for Oliver L. North to show 
jurors about three hours of videotaped testimony by John M. Poindexter, North's 
former boss, during congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra scandal in 
1987. Poindexter, a retired admiral and former White House national security 
adviser, is due to be tried on criminal charges after North's own trial 
concludes. He has advised North he would cite his constitutional protections 
against self-incrimination if called as a witness. In his ruling, U.S. District 
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said the videotape selected by the defense "distorts 
the record from the congressional proceedings." In his testimony, Poindexter 
assumed responsibility for the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras and 
said he never told former President Ronald Reagan about it.

One of the highest ranking and most decorated black officers in the California 
National Guard has been cleared of allegations of sexual and financial 
improprieties. Lt. Col Ezell Ware Jr., 48, succeeded in retaining his 
commission and is working full time as a staff assistant in the California 
Guard headquarters. A panel of four officers recommended last year that he be 
stripped of his reserve commission. But the California National Guard 
commander, Maj. Gen. Robert Thrasher, overturned the panel's decision. 
Top-level officials at 6th Army headquarters and at the Pentagon have endorsed 
Thrasher's action, said Ware's lawyer, Robert Bernstein. As a helicopter pilot 
in Vietnam, Ware was shot down five times. He received an Air Medal with 21 oak 
leaf clusters, three Meritorious Service Medals and two Army Commendation 
Medals.

Defense consultant William L. Parkin, testifying in the first criminal trial in 
the defense fraud scandal, admitted he had taken $50,000 in bribes over a 
10-year period when he was a Navy procurement official. Parkin was testifying 
for the prosecution in the Alexandria, Va., federal court trial of three 
officials of Teledyne Electronics Inc. of Newbury Park, who are accused of 
participating with Parkin in an illegal conspiracy to bribe a Navy official for 
inside information on a $23.5-million electronics contract. Parkin has already 
pleaded guilty to fraud and bribery charges for his role in the scheme.

L.A. BAKES AT TORRID 105, AND IT WON'T QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The desert maintained its arid reign over Southern California on Wednesday, 
setting another string of record-breaking temperatures and threatening to 
linger through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures rose swiftly as the day progressed, reaching 105 by 5 p.m. at the 
Civic Center -- annihilating the previous record high of 90 degrees for the 
day. At one point, the thermometer jumped two degrees within the span of a 
brief morning radio weathercast. The heat seemingly bullied everything in its 
path, from car engines to hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
At the Charles Ross Hair Design School in West Los Angeles, the few customers 
who braved the blistering heat to keep appointments arrived with 
weather-induced emergencies. They came with their flips flopped, with do's that 
didn't and sideburns that did, power bobs that lost their juice and permanents 
well on their way to becoming temporary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'On Their Own' 
</P>
<P>
"Their hair designs are wilted," said William Towers, an instructor at the 
school. "When they start to sweat, the sweat relaxes the hairdos and they 
collapse. . . . We can fix them up in here, but when they get outside, they're 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters expected the heat wave to roll on through the weekend. Some 
100-degree marks might be broken in inland regions as late as Sunday, said Rick 
Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. which provides forecasts for 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 105-degree record posted downtown, the thermometer reached a 
searing 109 in Ontario, making it the hottest spot in the nation, 105 in Long 
Beach and 104 in Santa Ana, Monrovia and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said that the onslaught of summer-like temperatures might seem an 
aberration, but is not totally unexpected. The season for Santa Ana winds, 
which blow desert heat toward the coast, usually lasts from September through 
April, Dittmann said, and "the later in the season they occur, the hotter the 
temperatures you get." 
</P>
<P>
As of late Wednesday, a strong high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere was 
stalled over the Pacific Northwest, Dittmann said. That system, combined with a 
lower-level high-pressure system over the Great Basin states of Idaho, Nevada 
and Utah, was forcing warm air -- the Santa Anas -- to flow from inland out 
toward a trough of lower pressure over the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said power usage on Wednesday quickly 
eclipsed a record set only the day before. On Tuesday, 12,633 megawatts were 
used, setting a new mark for an April day. But by 4 p.m. Wednesday, usage had 
passed 14,282 megawatts. Edison's all-time high is 15,987 megawatts, set on a 
110-degree day in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all for air conditioning," said Don Bailey, regional affairs manager for 
the company. "Everybody's trying to keep cool." 
</P>
<P>
But when Southern Californians left their comfortable homes and offices, they 
were at the mercy of the sun. It was either cope or sweat. 
</P>
<P>
County lifeguards estimated that more than 200,000 people fled to the beaches. 
But in some places, the water was as treacherous as the atmosphere. Riptides 
forced lifeguards to make more than 50 rescues off South Bay beaches, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farther inland, Carmen Benalcazor and Gelma Castillo relied on a time-honored, 
Old World method as they went window-shopping on Fairfax Avenue. The two 
Ecuadorean women walked hunched beneath a bamboo parasol to shield their fair 
skin from the sun's rays. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my! It feels like an oven, like Las Vegas," Benalcazor said. "If I didn't 
have the umbrella I would boil away, no?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Bernard Varedi had only shadows to shield him from the sun. 
The owner of Bernard's Antiques and Decorative Accessories, Varedi had to sit 
outside the store -- as he does every day -- to watch for robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Varedi coped by setting his chair in the shadows cast by the merchandise he had 
set up outside the store's door -- a thicket of brass lamps and candelabra, 
stuffed ducks, a moose head and zebra skins. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I do?" he asked. "The heat is no good, but I have to watch." 
</P>
<P>
A group of Department of Water and Power crewmen, preparing to go underground 
to work on a 34,500-volt power cable in a manhole under Main Street, faced 
furnace-like temperatures that soar as high as 140 degrees on a day like 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a whole lot you can do, except stay in the shade and drink lots of 
fluids," said Richard Boyd, 34, an electrician. "But if you are working down in 
a hole and it gets real hot, you can pour cold water from a jug full of ice 
over your wrists." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd compared the method to running cool water through a radiator. "It cools 
the blood flowing through your body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in downtown, Carla Holland was braced for a blistering ordeal. She is 
head cook and driver of a catering truck that was to service a film crew. 
</P>
<P>
"We're cooking Italian food for 100 people today," she said, "and that means 
pasta, and that means steam. It'll be about 140 degrees in here when we get the 
steam tables, grills and ovens going." 
</P>
<P>
Radiators and other engine parts gave out all over the area. On a northbound 
stretch of the Harbor Freeway, dozens of cars sat frozen behind an overheated 
Datsun stalled in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
And in a gas station in Vernon, attendant Rene Moreno was approaching 
scalding-hot engine parts with caution and a wet rag. He had already serviced 
three overheated cars in the morning and turned his attention to a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to work around the hot parts," Moreno said as he doused a smoking car 
engine with water. "It's great for business, but you got to be real, real 
careful." 
</P>

BUSH ACTS TO FULFILL EDUCATION PLEDGES FROM CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President Bush, moving to back up his campaign pledge to become the "education 
President," dispatched to Congress on Wednesday a $441-million program intended 
"to make excellence in education not just a rallying cry, but a classroom 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would put into effect elements of the education platform Bush 
focused on during the presidential campaign, including cash awards for "merit" 
schools and top teachers, new science scholarships, promotion of magnet 
schools, and "alternative" certification to allow experts who lack training as 
teachers to work in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But critics immediately charged that the new measure did not make up for 
inadequate Administration support for education programs already in place. In 
his proposed budget for the 1990 fiscal year, Bush sought no increase over 
1989's level of $21.9 billion, in effect allowing a reduction since there was 
no adjustment for the anticipated inflation of 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shell game," said Bill Honig, California state superintendent 
of public instruction, in a telephone interview from Sacramento. Of Bush's 
"education President" vow, he said: "The reality belies that." 
</P>
<P>
In a full-dress announcement ceremony, Bush and Education Secretary Lauro F. 
Cavazos unveiled the details of the education program in the White House Rose 
Garden with the 1989 National Teacher of the Year Award winner, Mary Bicouvaris 
of Hampton, Va., standing by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rewarding What Works' 
</P>
<P>
"When education is the issue and budget constraints cloud everything on the 
horizon . . . we can start by rewarding what works," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can help those most in need. We can promote choice and flexibility for 
parents and school administrators. And we can raise expectations and hold 
ourselves accountable for the results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, responding to questions about how the program would be funded, said 
that the money would not be diverted from existing Department of Education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where the money will come from but that's another issue," he told 
reporters. "These are new dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposal would establish a "presidential merit schools program" to 
reward public and private elementary and secondary schools that make 
"substantial progress" in raising students' educational achievement, reduce the 
rate of dropouts, and provide a drug-free environment. Some $250 million would 
be authorized for the program in 1990, $350 million in 1991, $450 million in 
1992 and $500 million in 1993. No specific amounts were set for the individual 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creates Teacher Awards 
</P>
<P>
The program would also create $5,000 awards "to recognize first-rate teachers 
in every state, and reward them for a job well done," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also announced a plan to award science scholarships of up to $10,000 a 
year for four years for "our best high school seniors." 
</P>
<P>
The President called for $100 million a year to help begin or expand public 
"magnet schools," which offer specialized curricula to attract students and 
offer an alternative to the traditional community public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has frequently complained that knowledgeable experts in many fields 
are blocked from working in classrooms because they do not have teacher 
training and state teaching certificates, proposed "alternative certification" 
as "a way to expand the pool of talented teachers and administrators." 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're an acclaimed author like Alex Haley or John Updike, who aren't 
certified to teach the literature courses in which their books are read, or a 
businessman from Odessa, Tex., anxious to go into the classroom to share what 
you know, our schools ought to offer that opportunity," Bush said. The program 
would provide $25 million to the states to encourage greater certification 
flexibility for teachers and principals. 
</P>
<P>
The program would also make $25 million available in each of the next four 
years for grants to education agencies in urban areas with some of the nation's 
most severe drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost the endowments of the nation's historically black 
colleges and universities, the program would make $60 million available over 
four years in "challenge grants" to match private contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's chief Senate sponsor, Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, 
said prospects of passage are "very good," and Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), 
chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee's education 
subcommittee, praised its prospects as "pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education 
and Labor Committee, predicted that the program "has no future on Capitol Hill, 
since the President is attempting to strip programs long supported by Congress 
to pay for new initiatives of questionable value." 
</P>
<P>
And Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, 
said: "The bottom line is that the education budget of George Bush is less than 
the education budget of Ronald Reagan. It is less in dollars."

HOUSE BACKS UNIFORM POLL CLOSING IN NATIONAL RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House, responding to concerns that television reports of East Coast 
election returns have influenced voting in Western states, on Wednesday 
approved legislation to create a uniform poll closing time for presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved in a 238-154 vote. It now goes to the Senate, which has 
twice failed to act on similar legislation. But sponsors said its prospects 
have improved because key senators have promised to bring the measure up for a 
vote sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
House members of both political parties spoke in favor of the legislation, 
saying it would ensure that voters in Western states are not discouraged from 
participating in elections after seeing projections from states where polls 
have already closed. California Gov. George Deukmejian and other Western 
governors have endorsed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"With this bill, we're saying to West Coast voters that your votes count just 
as much as those in other parts of the country," Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said. 
Without a uniform poll closing time, he said, "the importance of Western votes 
for President could be diminished just because of where we live." 
</P>
<P>
But critics said the bill was unnecessary, arguing that no hard proof exists 
that election results in Western states have been affected by projections from 
the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's shown this to be the case at all," Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said. 
"This is reform without reason, a solution in search of a problem. The only 
time the federal government should be messing around with election laws is when 
voters are actually being disenfranchised, and this is not one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
The poll closing issue surfaced in the 1980 presidential election when 
television networks predicted the defeat of President Jimmy Carter several 
hours before polls closed on the West Coast. In California and other Western 
states, some elected officials believe that those news reports affected the 
outcome of state and local contests by causing large numbers of potential 
voters to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the major television networks refrained from declaring a winner 
before all polls had closed, but they hinted at the broad dimensions of 
President Bush's victory more than 90 minutes before polls closed in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Much of television's ability to predict elections reflects its reliance on 
sophisticated exit polls, conducted as voters leave voting booths. Rep. William 
M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), one of the sponsors of the uniform poll closing 
bill, said it is time for Congress to adopt a response to exit polling 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that these television polling techniques could predict results even 
in close elections; not just in landslides, but in a 52%-48% race," Thomas 
said. "If we don't pass a poll closing bill now, we're going to have to make 
that kind of a change later on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closing Times 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, polls would close at 9 p.m. on the East Coast, 8 p.m. in 
the Central time zone and 7 p.m. in the Mountain states. 
</P>
<P>
On the West Coast, daylight-saving time would be extended for an additional two 
weeks in presidential election years, enabling polls to close at 7 p.m. PDT, 
which corresponds to the closing time in the standard time zones. The bill does 
not address when polls open, and it has no effect on Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said they had considered a number of options, including holding the 
presidential election over a 24-hour period, scheduling the election on a 
Sunday, opening polls earlier across the nation and closing them later in the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
"All things considered, I think this was the best compromise," Wyden said. 
"It's the least intrusive plan we could develop."

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on 
Wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New 
York to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York 
City and hours later Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $500,000 -- 10 times what 
Alaskan authorities had sought. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition 
proceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges; Hazelwood was not 
required to enter a plea Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired by Exxon 
</P>
<P>
After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be 
legally drunk and was fired by Exxon. Hazelwood left Alaska before local 
authorities could interview him, and had been pursued since Saturday on a 
fugitive warrant on three misdemeanor charges: operating a watercraft while 
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Together, those three charges have a maximum penalty of 27 months in prison and 
a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at 
least in this country," Rohl said. "We have a man-made destruction that has not 
been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima." 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating whether Hazelwood 
could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits 
negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. 
</P>
<P>
No people have been killed or even seriously injured by the spill, but oil has 
seriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry. Also, 
animal-rescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and 
hundreds of sea otters. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of wildlife deaths are not easy to make because oiled birds are hard 
to spot from the air, and many beaches are difficult to reach for in person 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In the wildlife-rich sound, cleanup crews continued to skim emulsified oil as 
thick as pudding. As of Wednesday, 12 days after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, 
the 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware, 
and Exxon's fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the 
spilled oil. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Alaska condemned Exxon's cleanup on Wednesday and asked the Coast 
Guard to take over the effort. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a senior member 
of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee added during a tour of 
Prince William Sound that fraud "is not too strong a word to describe Exxon's 
cleanup claims." 
</P>
<P>
"What they are really doing is managing the failure," Miller said after meeting 
with Aleut Indian residents in the tiny fishing village of Chenega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle 
coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he said was too 
bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military system to get 
things done," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cowper said he did not want to be "extremely critical" of Exxon, a 
letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had 
been unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon has failed to provide . . . the information necessary to make sound 
planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of 
resources," wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance 
Spill Response Section. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and 
determined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary. Rear Adm. 
Edward Nelson Jr., commander of the Coast Guard's 17th District in Juneau had 
no immediate reply to Cowper's request. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was 
not handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization 
to manage the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We think the most 
effective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to 
continue," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. The 987-foot ship lifted off the 
reef three hours earlier than the Exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding 
without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support 
craft, including the Coast Guard Cutter Rush, to a cove on uninhabited Naked 
Island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a relatively well-known salvage technique was used to float the 
Valdez -- using compressed air to force water out of the ruptured hold and thus 
assist high tide in lifting the vessel off the rocks -- "we couldn't predict 
this by the exact hour or minute," said salvage coordinator Gary Gorski, who 
supervised from the ferry Glacier Queen II. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the Exxon Valdez to three 
smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as 
the last of the tankers left for Southern California refineries on Tuesday. The 
ship was made airtight above the water line, and then, on Wednesday, compressed 
air was forced inside. 
</P>
<P>
The air forced out some of the 998,000 barrels of sea water that had been 
pumped into the stricken tanker as oil was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Naval architect Richard Smith, hired by Exxon, estimated before the refloat 
that the pressure would force enough water out of the hull to lift the ship at 
least three feet. He added that this technique also would produce a pressurized 
buffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker -- about 15,000 to 
20,000 barrels -- and the once-pristine waters off Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Exxon officials warned in advance that refloating the ship could 
uncover additional oil that had been pinned in pockets between the ship's hull 
and rocky Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of 
other vessels as the refloating was attempted and Coast Guard spokesman Bruce 
Pimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the 
stricken tanker was safely anchored. 
</P>
<P>
However, flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of 
2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. Oil flow 
from the North Slope had been cut by 60% because the spill restricted tanker 
traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic has increased. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski said that the ease with which the refloat was accomplished may indicate 
that the damage, while severe, may not be as bad as earlier feared. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials were reluctant to estimate how long temporary repairs would 
take or discuss where the tanker would be taken to permanently patch its hull 
and rebuild its internal pumping system, which also was compromised in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, Ore., was the company's first choice, but it backed away from that 
option after Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt and managers of the Port of 
Portland expressed concern that the Exxon Valdez would still be leaking oil 
when it arrived there. 
</P>
<P>
Already under attack by Gov. Cowper for fouling Prince William Sound, Exxon 
said it would consider having the tanker repaired in the Far East -- Japan, 
Korea or Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Even as it made that concession, the company denied its ship would endanger any 
port it visited for repair.

PUBLIC IS VULNERABLE TO BAD DOCTORS, STUDY SAYS

California consumers are offered little protection from incompetent doctors by 
a state disciplinary system that has become unwieldy and too "solicitous" of 
the physicians it regulates, a public interest group concluded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a 100-page report, the University of San Diego's Center for Public Interest 
Law asserted that a massive restructuring of the California Board of Medical 
Quality Assurance and the procedures it uses for disciplining physicians will 
have to be undertaken by the Legislature before consumers can be assured that 
incompetent doctors are being weeded out of the medical system. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 70,000 physicians licensed to practice medicine in California, only a 
handful are publicly disciplined each year because the system is too "slow and 
lenient" and has become overburdened by a staggering backlog of cases, the 
report declared. Moreover, the authors of the report estimated that possibly as 
many as 10% to 15% of the state's doctors "are so severely impaired they are 
not fit to practice medicine," a figure emphatically disputed by the board's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a system in trouble on all fronts. . . . It doesn't need just one 
thing. It's broken down from A to Z," said Robert C. Fellmeth, the center's 
director and chief author of its report. 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth, who issued similar reports two years ago about the State Bar's 
disciplinary system and now serves as a discipline monitor for the Bar, said 
the report on doctors represents a yearlong investigative effort by a team of 
lawyers. He said the public interest law center monitored the board for years 
before finally deciding that the mountain of consumer and physician complaints 
it had collected warranted further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the highly critical document follows by two months a report by 
California's Little Hoover Commission, a state watchdog agency, which found 
that the board had been "singularly inactive" in disciplining incompetent 
physicians responsible for treating nursing home patients. 
</P>
<P>
The two reports, along with recommendations that the board itself will release 
on April 15, are expected to spawn a major legislative effort by lawmakers this 
year to reform the disciplinary process for physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth J. Wagstaff, the board's executive director, said he will welcome many 
of the proposed changes, particularly recommendations that physician licensing 
fees be raised to pay for a bigger investigative staff. 
</P>
<P>
But he took issue with the conclusion that the system had completely broken 
down and he accused the authors of the report of inflating some of the facts 
and figures, specifically the contention that 10% to 15% of the doctors are 
impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not 10,000 drunk and addict doctors walking the streets of 
California," he said. "I think it is true that the vast majority of the 
physicians of this state are dedicated and competent but it's also true that 
the system is slow and that the system has backlogs." 
</P>
<P>
James Wheaton, an attorney who worked on the study, said that because the 
system is backlogged it is unknown how many incompetent physicians are actually 
practicing in California. He said the estimates used in the document came from 
American Medical Assn. reports. 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth said the legal team concluded that the system is "moribund and no 
longer protecting the consumers of California" because of a series of factors 
that prevent the board from taking tough, swift action against incompetent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
He said these factors range from the board's failure to learn of most 
malpractice and criminal cases against doctors until months after they are 
filed in the courts, to its apparent unwillingness to put pressure on coroners 
to report any suspicions that doctor neglect may have contributed to a 
patient's death. 
</P>
<P>
Once a complaint has been lodged against a doctor, Fellmeth said, the case must 
wind its way through a procedural labyrinth that could take as long as seven or 
eight years to complete. He said that during the administrative process, which 
sometimes lasts as long as four years, the doctor will continue to practice 
because the board has no authority to temporarily suspend licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Because other physicians play a major role in each step of the disciplinary 
process, he said, a "Dutch uncle" approach is often taken. Instead of being 
disciplined, the doctor is counseled about his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is solicitous to physicians in the extreme and I think the board 
doesn't make any secret about that," Fellmeth said. "It openly describes the 
purpose of the system as rehabilitation of physicians." 
</P>
<P>
To reform the system, the report suggested sweeping changes, including: 
</P>
<P>
* The creation of a medical quality court, composed of lawyers with medical 
expertise, to decide doctor disciplinary cases. Those cases are now decided by 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
* The granting of new authority for the board to temporarily suspend the 
licenses of doctors who are accused of particularly egregious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
* The approval of large hikes in physician licensing fees to pay for increased 
staff to investigate disciplinary cases. 
</P>
<P>
* The establishment of new procedures to enable the board to learn immediately 
when criminal or malpractice cases are filed against doctors or when hospitals 
or clinics revoke their hospital privileges for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
* The establishment of a statewide toll-free telephone number for consumers to 
make complaints. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) said he will consider sponsoring 
legislation to put many of the recommendations into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Wagstaff predicted, however, that the establishment of a medical quality court 
would receive strong opposition from most doctors, who believe that physicians 
should continue to have a major role in the disciplinary process. 
</P>
<P>
Charles McFadden, executive director of the California Medical Assn., said his 
group has not taken a position yet on the recommendations but, he noted, 
"organized medicine historically has been very leery of non-physicians judging 
physicians in medical matters."

STUDY IS SAID TO CONFIRM FEARS OF DAMAGE FROM OZONE 'HOLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Results of new experiments conducted in the Antarctic last October during the 
austral spring appear to confirm fears that the large "hole" in the ozone layer 
caused by man-made chlorofluorocarbons may produce permanent damage to the 
fragile ecosystem, the National Science Foundation said in a statement to be 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
The first accurate measurements of biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation 
at the Earth's surface in Antarctica showed that levels were twice as high as 
is normal in the springtime. 
</P>
<P>
Calculations based on the new measurements also suggested that levels of the 
damaging radiation were higher still -- about five times normal -- in October, 
1987, when ozone depletion over the Antarctic was the greatest ever recorded, 
according to geophysicist John E. Frederick of the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate study also released by the foundation, oceanographer Osmund 
Helm-Hansen of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found that 
photosynthetic activity of microscopic plants called phytoplankton was reduced 
by about 25% in the upper three feet of the Antarctic Ocean in October as a 
result of the increased radiation. 
</P>
<P>
"Phytoplankton, by virtue of photosynthesis, furnish all the food materials 
which supply the needs of all the animals in the Antarctic Ocean," Helm-Hansen 
said. "So if the rate of photosynthesis is significantly affected, it would 
affect the amount of food available for krill, fish, penguins and other 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
Ted DeLaca, head of polar programs at the National Science Foundation, called 
Helm-Hansen's results "provocative," but cautioned that the biological impact 
of ultraviolet radiation is very complex and will require a great deal of 
further study. 
</P>
<P>
The two experiments are part of a continuing probe of the biological effects of 
increased ultraviolet radiation in the Antarctic sponsored by the foundation. 
Scientists hope the research will shed light on the eventual effects of 
increased ultraviolet radiation throughout the world caused by degradation of 
the ozone layer, which shields the Earth from most of the sun's ultraviolet 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the Earth's ozone layer has already been depleted by an 
average of about 2.3% worldwide, and some project that the depletion will 
exceed 10% early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic ozone hole, which covers an area the size of the United States, 
is caused by the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons in polar stratospheric 
clouds during the long, dark Antarctic night. When the sun comes back above the 
horizon in October, it triggers a massive destruction of ozone by the 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The hole normally disappears in November or December, when it is dispersed by 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, ultraviolet radiation in the Antarctic begins at a low level in 
spring and doubles in intensity in succeeding months, reaching a peak at the 
summer solstice when the sun's rays shine most directly onto the Earth's 
surface. Frederick and graduate student Dan Lubin found, however, that total 
ultraviolet radiation in 1988 reached the summer level almost immediately after 
the sun appeared in early October. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the summertime radiation levels come early," Frederick said. Based 
on their new measurements, he added, the researchers calculated that the spring 
radiation level in 1987 was about 2 1/2 times as large as the summer peak. 
</P>
<P>
Helm-Hansen and his colleagues collected phytoplankton at different depths of 
the ocean, enclosed them in sealed bottles with radioactive carbon dioxide, and 
lowered the bottles on tethers to the depth at which they were collected. They 
recovered the bottles later and measured the amount of radioactive carbon 
dioxide taken up by the phytoplankton, a direct measure of their photosynthetic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the jars allowed all the sun's radiation to reach the enclosed 
phytoplankton. Others blocked out all the damaging ultraviolet radiation, while 
permitting entry of the visible light necessary for photosynthesis. 
</P>
<P>
They found that phytoplankton exposed to the ultraviolet radiation in the top 
three feet of the ocean carried out only 75% as much photosynthesis as those 
shielded from it by the jars. Photosynthesis occurred at near normal rates at 
greater depths because the water absorbed most of the ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
A decrease in photosynthetic rate means that the phytoplankton do not grow as 
rapidly as normal, so that fewer of them are present to serve as food for 
organisms higher in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Both researchers will repeat their experiments in October, 1989, when the ozone 
hole, which seems to operate on a two-year cycle governed by weather 
conditions, is again expected to be severe.

KENNARD WINS QUICK APPROVAL, IS SWORN IN AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joyce Luther Kennard, an immigrant who overcame personal adversity to attain 
swift success in the law, was sworn in Wednesday as a member of the California 
Supreme Court, becoming the first person of Asian heritage and only the second 
woman to join the high court. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Kennard, who was on the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, 
took the oath of office from Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas shortly after her 
unanimous confirmation by the state Judicial Appointments Commission. She was 
nominated by Gov. George Deukmejian to succeed Justice John A. Arguelles, who 
resigned March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Born in what is now Indonesia, Kennard spent time as a child in a World War II 
internment camp, suffered the death of both parents and lost a leg during a 
life-threatening illness. She came to this country as a secretary and worked 20 
hours a week to finance her way through college and law school. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in a Quonset hut in the jungles of New Guinea, I never thought that I 
would ever make it to America, let alone achieve what I have," Kennard said 
after the hearing. "In no other country would I have had these great 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
During a 40-minute hearing that was punctuated by both light-hearted commentary 
and effusive praise from witnesses for the nominee, Kennard told the commission 
that in an interview several weeks ago with Deukmejian she had neither been 
questioned about nor given any assurances on how she might rule in future 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, she said, the governor had talked to her about her 
childhood hardships, and she had expressed a fondness for a delicacy called 
lulakebab, an elaborately prepared Armenian sandwich. "That brought a twinkle 
to his eye," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when questioned by reporters, Kennard declined to subscribe to any 
philosophical or ideological outlook on the law. "I don't have any judicial 
philosophy," she said. "I decide any case on the facts and the law. . . . I 
would not label myself as anything. I will leave that to others." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kennard is widely expected by legal authorities to follow the 
moderately conservative course charted by other Deukmejian appointees, who 
until Arguelles' retirement held a 5-2 majority on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, a resident of Sherman Oaks, is Deukmejian's sixth appointee to the 
court and his first female nominee. Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, an 
appointee of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. who was defeated in the November, 1986, 
election along with two other court members, was the first woman to serve on 
the court. The Republican governor was a leading critic of the liberal Bird. 
</P>
<P>
The new justice comes to the high court with only three years' experience on 
the bench. The governor named her to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1986, 
elevated her to the Superior Court in 1987 and then placed her on the Court of 
Appeal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extensive Experience Cited 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, as her supporters are quick to note, she has had extensive 
experience on other legal fronts. She began her professional career in 1975, 
handling criminal cases as a state deputy attorney general. From 1979 to 1986, 
she served as a senior attorney in the Court of Appeal, doing research and 
assisting in the writing of civil and criminal law opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a Dutch father and a Chinese-Indonesian mother, Kennard was 
born in the Dutch East Indies and spent her childhood in Japanese-occupied 
territory during World War II. Her father died when she was an infant, and she 
and her mother were confined in a camp and then sent to live in a Quonset hut 
without indoor plumbing in a segregated community in a town in New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
When Kennard was 14, she and her mother migrated to Holland, and Kennard began 
studies in a private high school. But her education was interrupted when she 
sustained an infection that forced the amputation of her leg above the knee. At 
age 20, after receiving training as an interpreter, she came to Los Angeles and 
began work as a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, her mother died and Kennard used a $5,000 bequest to enter 
Pasadena City College. Working part time, she subsequently earned a scholarship 
to USC where she was graduated Phi Beta Kappa and then earned a master's degree 
in public adminstration and a degree in law. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing, three colleagues on the Court of Appeal gave strong 
support to Kennard, and the commission -- made up of Lucas, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp and Senior Presiding Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of 
Los Angeles -- voted quickly to confirm the nominee to the $103,469-a-year 
post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Note 
</P>
<P>
The one negative note to the proceedings came when Appellate Justice Joan 
Dempsey Klein of Los Angeles assailed news reports speculating that Kennard 
might have been chosen over Appellate Justice Patricia D. Benke of San Diego 
because of Benke's reluctance to move the high court's headquarters in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Benke, who has two small children, told the governor's aides that, if selected, 
she would commute weekly to San Francisco from San Diego. Three court members 
have made such trips in recent years, but court observers have expressed 
concern that the burden could lead to professional burnout. Kennard plans to 
move to San Francisco with her husband Robert, a tax assessor in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us agree the subject of the so-called 'mommy track' limitation to 
working mothers is of real concern . . . ," Klein said. "Unfortunately, recent 
media coverage, inappropriately, has managed to cast a pall over this otherwise 
happy event." 
</P>
<P>
Klein said it was her view that Kennard was Deukmejian's choice "because she is 
so exceptionally well qualified for the position and for no other reason." 
</P>
<P>
A founding president of the National Assn. of Women Judges, Klein expressed 
"extreme pride" in Kennard's nomination, noting that there are only 31 other 
female state supreme court justices in the United States. A recent study of 
court votes by 21 of those jurists indicates that whether liberal or 
conservative, "they tend to unite on women's issues to increase women's 
rights," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Kennard declined to comment on the "mommy track" 
speculation, except to say that Klein had "eloquently addressed" that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Two other appellate justices from Los Angeles, Campbell Lucas and Armand 
Arabian, also praised Kennard as able, bright, well-prepared and hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian, citing Kennard's quick sense of humor, told Malcolm Lucas: "Chief 
Justice, as yourself one of the masters of puns, you will find her a challenge 
in the exercise of wit." Lucas smilingly replied: "We need a few laughs around 
here now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Kennard testified only briefly but seemed to captivate her audience with her 
good humor and a touching and unusual recital of a series of letters she had 
received following her nomination last month from a class of seventh-grade 
students at Parkman Junior High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Joyce," one student wrote. "I am glad you are a judge. There are a lot of 
male judges and it's time for a woman on the court. Good for you." 
</P>
<P>
Another student wrote: "I am sorry to hear about your parents. I don't have a 
dad. I never met him." And another said: "It must be exciting to be in the 
newspaper. You are very pretty. When you have a chance, please call me. This is 
my phone number."

WRIGHT ADMITS SELLING 504 COPIES OF BOOK TO UNIVERSITY, AVOIDING HONORARIUM 
LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) acknowledged Wednesday that he once sold 504 
copies of his book to a Texas university instead of taking a speaking fee, thus 
avoiding a House limit on honorariums and pocketing $1,650 that he otherwise 
could not have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's statement supported charges by his critics that he used a 
controversial publishing contract for the 1984 book, "Reflections of a Public 
Man," to evade congressional limits on outside income since House rules allow 
unlimited royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
The episode strengthened the possibility that a House Ethics Committee 
examining Wright's financial affairs may decide that the book contract and the 
sales, which were sometimes made in bulk to political backers, constituted a 
breach of the congressional standards. His aides said, however, it was an 
isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Likely Next Week 
</P>
<P>
The development came as the ethics panel resumed final deliberations in its 
nine-month investigation, with a decision likely sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Democrats said it was virtually certain that the committee would find 
that Wright violated several House rules, but it was not clear whether those 
violations would involve what are considered the most serious questions about 
the Speaker's activities or deal instead with what may be less serious 
technical missteps. 
</P>
<P>
If the violations should prove to involve serious misconduct, they could 
possibly trigger a move to strip Wright of the Speaker's post or at least 
weaken his leadership at the outset of his second two-year term in the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to see what the facts are," House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho 
(D-Merced), one of the most outspoken defenders of Wright in recent months, 
told reporters. "Everything depends on the committee report." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who once dismissed the allegations of improprieties against him as 
partisan sniping by Republican extremists, recently has said that he might have 
broken some technical provisions of the rules, but only unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel, working in secrecy, apparently is now focusing primarily on 
Wright's book-publishing venture and his complex financial relationship with a 
Ft. Worth developer, George Mallick. Meanwhile, sources close to the committee 
said it has decided to drop charges that the Speaker abused the powers of his 
office by intervening with government officials on behalf of Texas savings and 
loan firms and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
The discounting of these allegations concerning abuse of office, Wright's 
defenders said, was a major victory and made less likely that the remaining 
issues would severely damage his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Wright said at his regular pre-session meeting with reporters 
that he suggested to a staff aide that a $3,000 check for a speaking appearance 
on Oct. 16, 1984, at Southwestern Texas State University be used to buy copies 
of his book since the amount was $1,000 more than the House limit for a single 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Three thousand dollars is more than I can accept," Wright recalled that he 
told the aide he identified as Phil Duncan. "If he (the university president) 
wants to buy books, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 504 copies of the $5.95 book, which is a compilation of Wright's 
speeches, were delivered to the university in San Marcos, Tex., according to 
Pat Murdock, a spokeswoman. She said they were divided between the library and 
the political science department. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's financial disclosure report for 1984 indicated that he reached the 
$24,250 limit on speech-making fees in June of that year. After that, fees 
totaling $2,500 were donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Since the $3,000 fee for the Lyndon B. Johnson lecture at the university was 
made in mid-October, Wright would have been unable to accept it for two reasons 
-- it was more than the $2,000 limit for a single speech and it would have put 
him above the annual ceiling if he kept the money. 
</P>
<P>
By selling copies of his book instead, however, Wright personally received 55% 
of the $3,000 -- or $1,650 -- without exceeding the House restrictions on 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the book deal was a way of "laundering" the funds, Wright 
replied, "I don't follow these things very closely. I make about 200 speeches a 
year. I have never asked for a speaking fee in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wright said he has been preoccupied with his public career as a member 
of Congress, adding: "I haven't paid much attention to my personal finances 
over these past 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
Within the past month, there has been increasing anxiety among House Democrats 
about whether the panel would issue a "statement of possible violations" 
against Wright. If that were done, Wright would have an opportunity to reply 
and the committee then would give a final verdict on the alleged violations and 
decide what punishment to impose, if any. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Democratic hopes for a complete exoneration of the Speaker have faded. 
</P>
<P>
"A reprimand wouldn't be fatal, but it wouldn't exactly be a plus," said one 
Democrat close to the leadership.

Shells blasted street markets and a hospital in the Lebanese capital Wednesday, 
killing at least 22 people and wounding 70 in another of the fierce 
Christian-Muslim artillery duels that have confined residents to bomb shelters 
for a month. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight day in which residential neighborhoods have been 
heavily bombarded. 
</P>
<P>
At least 159 people have been killed and about 500 wounded since the current 
battle began about a month ago between Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army 
units and an alliance of Syrian troops and their Lebanese Muslim militia 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the casualties have been civilians in what has been called the worst 
fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, Kuwait's foreign minister and head of an Arab 
League mediation team, called for a truce after meeting in Syria with Lebanese 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Lebanese Premier Salim Hoss, who heads the Muslim Cabinet, endorsed the 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, head of the rival Christian Cabinet and leader of the 20,000 Christian 
army troops, did not react publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting began last month after Aoun's forces closed seaports run by 
militias, depriving the government of an estimated $100 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops in turn blockaded the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and 
east of Beirut, where one million Christians live. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has 32,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 
Arab League, and has become the country's main power broker. Aoun calls the 
Syrians an occupation army and has vowed to drive them out. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said most of the casualties Wednesday were in Muslim West 
Beirut, where shells fired by Aoun's gunners hit three vegetable markets and 
the Barbir hospital, one of the Muslim sector's four major medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
The murderous bombardment of Beirut has essentially squeezed people's daily 
lives to four hours of scurrying about their business and 20 hours underground. 
</P>
<P>
When the Syrian and Christian gunners rest at daybreak, thousands of residents 
cautiously emerge from bunkers to hurriedly buy supplies of food, water, 
candles, gas lamps, decks of cards and sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the antagonists resume the deadly duel, residents rush back to 
shelters on both sides of the Green Line that divides the city into Muslim and 
Christian sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Most nightclubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and movie houses are closed. So are 
schools and universities. Banks operate haphazardly for two or three hours a 
day, depending on the ferocity of the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that matters nowadays is self-preservation," said Amin Trad, a 
pharmacist in Christian East Beirut. "Survival is the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have statistics. But if this continues, we will soon run out of 
tranquilizers," said Trad, whose pharmacy is shielded by tall sandbag walls. 
</P>
<P>
Shukri Lahhoud, a banker who lives in a posh East Beirut district, said he and 
his neighbors play poker and backgammon in their three-floor underground 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The bouts of savage shelling have blown gaping holes in hundreds of houses, 
wrecked power plants, destroyed city water pipes and threatened to crush the 
nation's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show an average of 3,000 shells fell on the city and its 
environs every day of the past three weeks.

SHAMIR SEES BAKER, CITES THREAT OF ARAB ARMIES 
</P>

<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, facing growing U.S. criticism of Israel's 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, sought to change the focus 
Wednesday from the 15-month Palestinian uprising to the threat posed by the 
armies of the neighboring Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a 75-minute private meeting with Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, Shamir said, "We have discussed together some ways to solve 
the problem related to the conflict between Israel and the Arab world, 
including Arab countries and the Palestinian Arabs living in (Israel and the 
occupied territories)." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, later expanded on the prime minister's words: 
"We believe that our most important problem is not the problem that we face 
inside our country with the Palestinian intifada or uprising . . . the most 
serious problem that Israel faces is the problem of our relationship with the 
Arab world which, apart from one country, Egypt, does not recognize us and 
still finds itself, 41 years after our creation, in a state of war against us." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders are on much firmer ground in the United States talking about 
the military threat to their security posed by surrounding Arab states. 
Although the United States maintains normal diplomatic relations with all Arab 
nations except Libya and South Yemen, U.S. governments have, for years, pledged 
to support Israel's security against any attack that the Jerusalem regime might 
face. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials said that President Bush would not be distracted from 
his concern about the Palestinians' uprising when he meets Shamir today at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's meeting with Shamir, following his meeting earlier this week with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, marks the start of the new Administration's 
effort to put its own stamp on U.S. Middle East policy. 
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Mubarak, Bush expressed support for Israel's security but 
said it was time for the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to come to 
an end. Israel has controlled the territories, and the 1.7 million Palestinians 
who live there, since the Israeli army occupied them during the 1967 Middle 
East War. Before 1967, the West Bank was controlled by Jordan and the Gaza 
Strip by Egypt, but those countries have since renounced rights to them, 
maintaining that the territories should become an independent Palestinian 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In his comments to reporters after his meeting with Baker, Shamir said he 
brought some ideas for a possible peace settlement. But neither Israeli nor 
American officials would say what those ideas were before Shamir's meeting with 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has made some suggestions," Baker said. "We are going to 
continue our discussion with the objective of moving the peace process forward, 
if it's possible to do so. They were very encouraging. Hopefully they will form 
the basis under which we can move the peace process forward." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pazner declined to discuss the content of Shamir's meeting with Baker, 
he confirmed that the prime minister is ready to call for elections in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip once the violence of the uprising ends. Pazner implied that 
the election plan was central to Shamir's proposals, but he refused to say if 
there was more to the plan than that. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir outlined his policies in a speech Tuesday night to Jewish leaders in New 
York. In that speech, he insisted that Israel will never agree to a peace 
treaty requiring surrender of the West Bank and Gaza, will never participate in 
an international conference including countries from outside the region and 
will never negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's position is at variance with U.S. policy on all three points. Bush 
supports the land-for-peace formula and he has said that a "properly 
structured" international conference could help to advance the peace process. 
Baker has said that Israel should not totally close the door to possible 
negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seymour D. Reich, president of B'nai B'rith International and chairman 
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, issued 
a statement supporting Shamir's remarks to the New York meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always believed that the people of Israel themselves, as represented 
by their democratically elected leaders, must ultimately decide what is in 
their vital national interest," Reich said.

BUSH LIKELY TO PROPOSE PAY INCREASE FOR JUDGES; 
</P>

FEARS EXODUS FROM U.S. JUDICIARY BUT CONGRESS, DEPRIVED RECENTLY OF BIG SALARY 
HIKE, MAY BALK

Although no final decision has been made by President Bush, a consensus is 
emerging in the White House for seeking congressional approval of a 25% pay 
raise for federal judges, senior officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The President and his aides appear to be moving gingerly on the sensitive 
subject in light of the huge public backlash against a recent broader pay hike 
measure and are not ready to propose raises, the officials said. But some 
action is growing more likely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay Now Is $89,500 
</P>
<P>
A 25% increase for jurists would amount to $22,375 for district judges, raising 
their annual salaries to $111,875 from $89,500. The hike would be offered in an 
effort to counter a feared exodus of judges attracted by six-figure salaries in 
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Even a proposal to increase the pay of judges -- without touching the salaries 
of members of Congress and top government officials -- could threaten to 
rekindle the angry debate over compensation that embroiled Congress in January 
and February. 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), a former federal judge, 
predicted that any proposal by Bush to raise the salaries of judges without 
giving a similar increase to members of Congress would probably be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, after the House and Senate voted to forgo a proposed 50% pay 
increase, Bush called attention to the particular need to increase the pay of 
judges. According to a senior aide, when Bush signed the legislation that 
rejected the broader pay increase, the President added to the written statement 
announcing his decision an expression of "my special concern about the level of 
compensation for members of our federal judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
Said one Administration official, "Given the political situation, everyone 
feels it's the wisest course of action" to limit the proposal to the pay of 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Decide Next Week 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that Bush is not likely to make a final decision on the 
judicial pay increase, which would require congressional approval, until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find the potential for agreement between the legislative and executive 
branches is greatest there," rather than on salary hikes for legislative or 
executive branch officials, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
However, another official indicated that warning flags are being raised by 
members of Congress, giving him some cause for concern about whether a 
scaled-down pay raise limited to judges could be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said most members of Congress viewed linking their pay and that of 
federal judges as the only leverage they have for obtaining a pay raise 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be a widespread feeling that de-linking salaries would make 
it more difficult for members of Congress ever to get increases in pay," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resignations Predicted 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the concern over raising judicial salaries, regardless of the 
pay given to executive branch officials and members of Congress, is the 
possibility that the salary level is leading to an increase in resignations 
from the federal judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bar Assn. has estimated that one-fourth of the nation's more than 
1,000 federal judges may be planning to leave their posts because of 
dissatisfaction with their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Failure to reverse the trend of resignations could cause the federal judiciary 
to be viewed as merely a steppingstone to higher-paying jobs," U.S. District 
Judge Robert H. Hall, president of the Federal Judges Assn., warned.

U.S. MOVES TO SPEED SOVIET IMMIGRATION 
</P>

Goaded by a growing backlog of Soviet citizens trying to enter the United 
States, the Bush Administration asked Congress on Wednesday to allow admission 
of as many as 30,000 immigrants a year for "foreign policy reasons." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, drafted by the departments of State and Justice, would establish a 
five-year program to admit persons who fail to qualify as refugees because they 
cannot establish a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country and 
who do not satisfy normal immigration standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bill does not cite specific nationalities, the Administration said 
it was aimed at Soviet citizens -- mostly Jews, Armenians and evangelical 
Christians -- who are leaving the Soviet Union in increasing numbers under 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's relaxed emigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
More than 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow for permission to enter the United States as refugees, and another 7,000 
are waiting in temporary quarters near Rome. About 4,000 Soviets a month are 
seeking to settle in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden outpouring of Soviet citizens has swamped the U.S. government's 
refugee program, which pays transportation costs and provides welfare benefits 
to eligible persons. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new classification, qualifying immigrants would receive none 
of the financial benefits extended to refugees but would be eligible to become 
U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
By easing the oppression of earlier years, Gorbachev's policy has produced a 
dilemma for Soviet emigrants. The very fact that emigration has become easier 
has tended to undermine the claims of political persecution on which refugee 
status is based. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed statute would authorize the President to designate classes of 
aliens whose admission "is deemed for foreign policy reasons to be in the 
national interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apply for 'Parole' 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration had promised that all Soviet citizens seeking to 
enter the United States would be permitted to do so. Those who failed to 
qualify as refugees were invited to apply for a "parole" from Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The parole status has been unpopular with potential immigrants, however, 
because it does not permit them to become eligible for U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"This legislation is far superior to the exercise of my parole authority -- 
which is only a stop-gap response -- as it will allow these people to enter as 
permanent residents and qualify for limited social welfare benefits that are 
not available to parolees," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the legislation would also extend eligibility for U.S. 
citizenship to parolees admitted between Aug. 15, 1988, and Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviets awaiting U.S. visas in Rome are Jews who left the Soviet 
Union with visas to Israel but decided instead to settle in the United States. 
Under Soviet law, it is usually easier for a Jew to obtain permission to move 
to Israel than to the United States. Many Soviet Jews who apply for permission 
to go to Israel have no intention of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has long been a cause of friction between Israel and the United 
States, because Israel wants the Soviet Jews to settle there. The United States 
maintains that emigrants should have freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III told Shamir on Wednesday that although the United 
States has not softened its support for freedom of choice, he believes that 
persons with visas for Israel should go there. 
</P>
<P>
Pazner also said Shamir suggested that Soviet Jews who want to settle in the 
United States should apply for U.S. visas and remain in the Soviet Union until 
they are granted, instead of going to Rome, where living conditions for 
emigrants in transit have become overcrowded.

In the first prosecution under a 1986 anti-apartheid law, an aviation company 
and its chairman pleaded guilty Wednesday to importing four jet engines that 
were owned by South African Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Air Ground Equipment Sales Inc. of West Babylon, N.Y., and its chairman, Robert 
Fessler, had been indicted Monday. The guilty pleas were part of an agreement 
with federal prosecutors, who said the case was the first prosecution under the 
Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Fessler faces up to 10 years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Fessler told U.S. District Judge Mark A. Costantino of Brooklyn that he had 
been negotiating to buy the engines from South African Airways before the law 
was enacted. The company went ahead with the purchase and shipped the engines 
to Israel.

Two suspected Pomona gang members who were involved in the shooting death of a 
full-term fetus last week were being held without bail Wednesday after 
allegedly stealing two cars and firing at a passing driver while under the 
influence of PCP. 
</P>
<P>
Yamil Henderson, 18, and Anthony Coleman, 19, were arrested in Pomona on 
Tuesday night on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft auto, 
evading arrest and being under the influence of PCP, police said. They were 
later booked by Los Angeles police on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged spree began Monday, when a 1981 Ford Mustang was stolen in Upland, 
police said. The two men were reportedly driving the stolen car in Pacoima on 
Tuesday night when they fired three shots into another driver's car, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whom police would not identify, was struck at least once in the 
elbow, police said. The two suspects chased the man for several blocks, firing 
six to seven more shots before the driver eluded them, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects then went to a Pacoima liquor store, where they stole a Porsche at 
gunpoint from Michael Moungey, 17, of Glendale, police said. Later, police in 
Pomona tried to pull the Porsche over after it was seen being driven 
erratically, Detective Ed McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
The two reportedly led police on a car chase that ended when they abandoned the 
vehicle and fled on foot. Henderson and Coleman were caught after they were 
spotted by a police helicopter, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
On March 26, Coleman was arrested on suspicion of murder in the shooting of 
Lillian Kelley, 16, whose full-term fetus was killed when she was shot while 
visiting Coleman's apartment. According to witnesses, Henderson, who was also 
visiting the apartment, had been playing with a pistol when Coleman tried to 
take the weapon away from him and it discharged, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed after an investigation.

SCIENTIFIC GROUP WAGES CRUSADE TO EASE FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Our Food Supply Is Safe" was the headline of a full-page advertisement that 
ran in three major newspapers Wednesday. Signed by 65 scientists, it went on: 
"There is no scientific merit to charges that pesticide residues in our produce 
cause cancer in human beings." 
</P>
<P>
The paid statement was the latest effort of a little-known but frequently 
quoted science group that has been waging a high-profile crusade to counteract 
environmental groups' concerns about food safety. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the New York-based American Council on Science and Health 
have been on the media circuit the last several weeks trying to persuade the 
public that Alar, a chemical used on apples, is safe and should not be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Calling itself a "consumer education and advocacy group," the organization held 
a news conference in New York on Wednesday to highlight the signatures of 65 
scientists who agree with its view that Alar is not a serious health threat and 
should not be listed as one by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the (environmentalist Natural Resources Defense Council's) attack 
on food is the most significant and damaging attack on consumer confidence in 
our food that has happened in our lifetime," said Elizabeth Whelan, an 
epidemiologist who founded the American council 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan's ability to attract media attention has alarmed many environmentalists, 
who say the organization's title is misleading and its science faulty. Lawrie 
Mott, an NRDC scientist, worries that the American council's statements might 
confuse people who do not realize "that scientists are just as likely to get 
embroiled in political debates as anyone else." A representative of the 
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, an environmental group, calls the 
American council "industry attack dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said her organization receives up to 35% of its funding from 
corporations. Contributors include Uniroyal Chemical Co., the manufacturer of 
Alar, and the National Agricultural Chemicals Assn. Most environmental groups 
receive financial support mainly from dues-paying members and private 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
The group wins praise for its efforts to publicize the hazards of smoking but 
has raised eyebrows with its contention that saccharin, an artificial 
sweetener, is safe and does not cause cancer, that there is no evidence that 
the herbicide 2,4,5-T, an ingredient of the defoliant Agent Orange, causes 
birth defects, and that cyclamates, red dye No. 2. and EDB, a pesticide that 
was used on grain, should never have been banned. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that many of the council's scientific advisers have worked for 
or received grants from drug, chemical and other manufacturers whose products 
the council defends. For instance, Robert P. Upchurch, a professor of plant 
science at the University of Arizona who signed the council's Alar statement, 
said in an interview Wednesday that he worked for 10 years for Monsanto Co., 
which manufactures pesticides. Whelan scoffs at the charges of conflict of 
interest, saying "all money is industry money" and insisting that she does not 
ask her scientific advisers about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
Her group's views, in fact, are shared by many scientists. They argue that the 
potential hazards of such chemicals as Alar are overstated in proportion to 
natural carcinogens found in food; that health threats, like smoking and AIDS, 
dwarf any peril from pesticides, and that basing regulations on animal studies 
is inappropriate because animals and humans do not always react the same. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is expected to ban Alar based on experiments with mice. Albert Heier, 
an EPA spokesman, said that extrapolating cancer data from animal experiments 
is "controversial" but "that's the best we've got." 
</P>
<P>
The American council's advertisement appeared in the New York Times, USA Today 
and the Washington Post. Whelan, who has appeared on several television news 
shows in recent weeks, grumbles that she still has not received as much 
attention as Meryl Streep, who has lobbied for tougher pesticide laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have petitioned the Donahue program and '60 Minutes' to send a 
representative," she said.

BORDER OFFICIALS BRACE FOR INFLUX OF CENTRAL AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. border authorities said Wednesday that they expect greater numbers of 
undocumented Central Americans to attempt to enter into California from Mexico 
in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said that 
increased enforcement along the border in Texas, the usual crossing point for 
Central Americans, is likely to bring about a shift to California. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that there is no strong evidence to date of a significant 
shift of Central American traffic to the California border, but they said that 
enforcement is being bolstered in the expectation of more Central Americans 
converging on San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparent Increase 
</P>
<P>
The pronouncements come at a time when the number of Central Americans entering 
California from Mexico appears to be increasing, although that movement 
predates the crackdown begun last month against undocumented Central Americans 
arriving in Texas. For the last decade or more, large numbers of Central 
Americans fleeing poverty and warfare have traveled through Mexico to the U.S. 
border. 
</P>
<P>
South Texas, geographically closer to Central America, has long been the 
preferred U.S. entry point for many from those countries, particularly 
Nicaraguans. But a steady flow of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans have 
for years opted to enter the United States via San Diego, which is much closer 
to the booming undocumented job markets of the Los Angeles area. Authorities 
now fear that the increased vigilance in Texas may swell the ranks of illegal 
newcomers coming through San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If we see these Central Americans at the border, we're going to be ready for 
them," Harold W. Ezell, INS western regional commissioner, said at a news 
conference at the Otay Mesa border crossing here. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities announced that more agents of the Border Patrol, an enforcement arm 
of the INS, will be posted directly at the international boundary separating 
San Diego and Tijuana. Officials said an unspecified number of officers will be 
reassigned to the "line" from other duties, and that 45 agents recently 
assigned to South Texas because of the influx of Central Americans there would 
be reassigned to the border force in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really going to be beefing up operations down there," said Dale Cozart, 
chief Border Patrol agent in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable dispute whether the additional enforcement will be 
successful. "No number of new agents will deter the movement of Central 
Americans escaping warfare," predicted Haydee Sanchez, a paralegal with El 
Rescate, the Los Angeles social service firm that works with undocumented 
immigrants. Sanchez said word of the intensified enforcement in Texas had 
already spread to El Salvador, prompting some immigrants to seek to enter the 
United States via California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, attorneys for hundreds of Central American 
immigrants being held in a South Texas detention camp accused immigration 
officials Wednesday of violating a court order that guaranteed legal 
protections for Salvadoran refugees seeking political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys appeared before U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, seeking a 
temporary restraining order requiring that immigrants from war-torn El Salvador 
have access to legal counsel and be advised of their right to apply for asylum. 
Kenyon did not issue such an order, but said he may hold hearings in the Rio 
Grande Valley to determine whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
is complying with a similar injunction issued in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
A new INS policy stepping up processing of applications for asylum in South 
Texas has resulted in the detention of thousands of immigrants, whose 
applications have been denied, near Port Isabel. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for a coalition of immigrants' rights groups said Wednesday that the 
stepped-up enforcement program has so overcrowded the detention camp that many 
immigrants now face deportation hearings without access to a lawyer.

ON VIEW: TALKING UP SCIENCE AT MUSES LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who left the Muses of the California Museum of Science and Industry 25th 
celebration Woman of the Year luncheon at the JW Marriott walked away with 
little quartz crystal clocks inscribed Muses as well as the message from the 
honoree, Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds of the California State University system, 
that even more needs to be done to push scientific education among the young, 
which is what Muses members do through their science scholarships, seminars and 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless steps are taken immediately," Reynolds said, "we could suffer a 
shortfall of as many as 560,000 science and engineering professionals by the 
year 2010." The chancellor has served as co-chair of the Federal Task Force on 
Women, Minorities and the Handicapped in Science and Technology. Research, she 
noted that today 75% of the graduate students receiving financial support from 
university engineering departments are foreign nationals, and in the period 
between 1978 and 1987, the percentage of Ph.D.s earned in engineering by 
American students declined from 53.6% to 45.2% of the total. "Clearly," she 
said, "we cannot be competitive as a nation if we have to rely on other 
countries for our science and engineering needs. We have to grow our own crop 
of future scientists." 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was planned by Betty Miller. Heading the program were Margaret 
Thompson, Kevin O'Connell, June Haver MacMurray, Joe Campanella and Jan 
Crowther. 
</P>
<P>
PROMINENT: John Brooks Slaughter will be inaugurated as 11th president of 
Occidental College on Friday at 2:30 p.m., and two days of festivities are 
upcoming. Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm delivers the keynote address at 
the Inaugural Symposium following a black-tie dinner and reception today on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prominent Southern Californians attending festivities will be Donn 
(trustees chairman) and Peggy Miller, Dr. Allan and Weta Mathies Jr., Charles 
and Carolyn Miller, Peter and Pamela Mullin, David and Dona Schultz, Frank and 
Rary Simmons, Roy Anderson, Robert and Carol Finch, Walter and Darleen Gerken, 
Stanley and Ileen Gold, Stafford and and Robert Grady, Claremont-McKenna 
president Jack and Jil Stark. 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating in a symposium on "Preparing the Liberal Arts College 
for the Twenty-first Century" will be James J. Whalen, chairman of the board of 
trustees of the American Council on Education; Alexander W. Astin, director of 
the Higher Education Research Institute of Los Angeles; Richard J. Mahoney, 
chairman and CEO of Monsanto Co., and John D. Maguire, president of the 
Claremont University Center and Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
THE DERBY: Elaborate picnics will be brought to Santa Anita Park on Saturday, 
and diners will be among 100 Rolls-Royces and Bentleys whose owners have 
reserved the infield. The event sparks activity for the 52nd running of the 
Santa Anita Derby, the $500,000 race to determine the 3-year-old championship 
of the West. Of course, it's a prelude to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita president Robert Strub and his wife Betty will be entertaining at 
luncheon in the Directors Room. British Consul Gen. Donald Ballentyne and his 
wife Elizabeth will be there as will Thomas Meeker, president of Churchill 
Downs, and his wife, Carol, coming from Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
We're told tulips and peach and cherry blossoms will add to the ambiance as 
Patsy Pope, Grant Horn and Sheila and William Shay all come from the north, to 
join Southern Californians including Robert and Cammie Strub, John Strub, Gerry 
and Pat Frawley. Peggy Whittingham and Alice Rodich. 
</P>
<P>
LUNCHEON THAT GREW: Helene Irvin and Gloria Holden hosted what started out as a 
little luncheon (planned at the Ritz Carlton in Washington during the Bush 
Inauguration) for Gayle Wilson, wife of Sen. Pete Wilson, but it grew into an 
almost-no-regrets affair for 95 of the busiest women in Los Angeles at the Los 
Angeles Country Club on Tuesday noon. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Himmel in Santa Monica did the apricot and ivory invitations embossed 
"Gayle." Place cards were little chocolate blocks, ribboned with streamers 
printed "Gayle," and iced with names of the guests. Jacob Maarse of Pasadena 
built floral arrangements tall enough to intersperse the chandeliers. The heat 
almost wilted the club flowers, as well as those ladies who opted for Adolfos 
and a little wool, such as Rosemarie Stack, Joan Hotchkis and Mary Davis; but 
most were prepared for the temperatures with open-air cottons and trim linens 
of Ungaro ilk, including Beth Lowe, Susan Turtelot, Libby Doheny, Linda 
Blackburn (who chairs the fashion-chic Mannequins "Afternoon With Eve" this 
spring) and Suzanne Marx. 
</P>
<P>
There was no soliciting, no money talk. The G-word was never uttered as Helene 
Irvin reeled off Gayle's major accomplishments -- activist for Phoenix House 
Foundation (drugs), AIDS, Alzheimer's, Children's Institute (child abuse), 
House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, program chairman for Congressional Wives. 
</P>
<P>
At the head table, the honoree was between Margaret Brock and Jane Weintraub, 
and in the same circle with both hostesses were Erlenne Sprague, Joanne 
Kosberg, Betty Wilson, Lydia Heston and Robin Parsky. 
</P>
<P>
More in the crowd were Jean Smith (wife of the former U.S. attorney general), 
Jane (Mrs. Freeman) Gosden, Ginie Braun, Kate Graham, Betty Morgan, Maude 
Chasen, Carolbeth Korn, Suzanne Cavlovick (new director of the Fifth Avenue 
Club at Saks in Beverly Hills), Iris Dart, Raylene Meyer, Betty Irvin, Olivia 
Roth, Ramona Cappello, Marcia Hobbs, Bonnie Green, Virginia Rogers, Carol King, 
Nadine Tilley, Sandra Ausman and Genevieve Ryan.

LIFTING THE LID ON BOOK OF BOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Book of Boxes is a gift-wrapping item you can use yourself or give as a 
present. It's a book of patterned and pre-cut heavy-weight paper that can be 
fashioned into small Japanese gift boxes called washi. 
</P>
<P>
There are 14 pages of designs created by Kunio Ekiguchi a Tokyo expert in 
Japanese gift wrap, paper craft and doll making. They can be folded into 
square, oblong, round boxes ranging from simple cubes to small standing 
"houses" (called ioribako) to plum blossoms (umetato). 
</P>
<P>
The Book of Boxes, produced by Kodansha International of Tokyo and New York, is 
available in the Los Angeles area at Doubleday book shops, some B. Dalton 
stores, Kinokuniya Los Angeles at the New Otani Hotel and Amerasia Bookstore in 
Little Tokyo. The suggested retail price is $14.95. If there is no store in 
your area that carries the book, order directly through Kodansha 
International's toll-free number, (800) 638-3030. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check the Lead Out 
</P>
<P>
A Massachusetts company has just introduced a home test kit that lets consumers 
check the lead content in almost any household item -- such as ceramics, glazed 
dinnerware, toys, furniture, interior and exterior painted surfaces -- to 
ensure that the lead content is not at a hazardous level. 
</P>
<P>
LeadCheck Swabs are easy to use and give fast results, detecting to 2 ppms 
(parts per million) of lead level in the object, said Marcia Stone, president 
of HybriVet Systems Inc., the item's Framingham, Mass., manufacturer. "It's 
very, very fast," Stone said. "It detects lead in about 30 seconds to one 
minute." (FDA guidelines for safe lead content in most household items is 2 
ppms.) 
</P>
<P>
Each LeadCheck Swab kit contains 12 reactive swabs, a bottle of activator 
solution and 12 lead strips to be used as controls. To check items, put two 
droppers of solution on the swab so it is thoroughly wet, but not dripping. 
Begin the test within five minutes. Rub the tip of the swab over the test area

All around Southern California, the curtain is rising on this year's springtime 
show of colorful wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
This is the best month to see this glorious display, although blooms this year 
are later and more sparse than usual because of scant rainfall and an 
exceptionally cold winter. Still, there are plenty of locations where you can 
see wildflowers, especially in moist coastal areas and at some Southland 
botanic gardens, where patches of wildflowers are seeded and irrigated. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a sampling of places to find wildflowers near Los Angeles. To 
learn more about the flowers, join one of the nature walks offered at each 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are alone or with a group, remember that wildflowers are a fleeting 
annual treasure for all to enjoy. Look, but don't pick. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Payne Foundation, 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley, (818) 768-1802. Open 
Tuesday through Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
Walk up the hillside trail at this 21-acre nursery. Non-native plants have been 
carefully weeded from this hill so that native flowers can grow without 
competition. At the top of the hill, you'll be rewarded with the sweet 
fragrance of ceanothus (California lilac). 
</P>
<P>
Below, you can buy wildflower seeds or seedlings of more than 500 species of 
California native plants. The foundation is dedicated to the propagation and 
preservation of these plants. Stop by the office to pick up a set of "Exploring 
Wildflower Country" maps and a 1989 nature calendar. Call the foundation's 
24-hour hot line, (818) 768-3533, for a weekly update on wildflowers in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Charmlee Natural Area County Park, Encinal Canyon Road, Malibu, (213) 457-7247. 
Open daily, 8 a.m. to sunset. Free. 
</P>
<P>
You get a double viewing treat at this bluff-top park -- a close-up look at 
wildflowers in a wide meadow and long-range vistas of the ocean below. Stop 
first at the nature center to check the blackboard for a list of flowers that 
have been sighted recently in the park. Pick up a trail map at the center and 
head across the meadow. Wildflowers bloom in a thick carpet on the meadow's 
gently rolling hills, symbolic of nature's regeneration following a fire in 
1985. See if you can spot the chaparral currant, Indian paintbrush and 
California peony along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu State Park, 9000 W. Pacific Coast Highway (4 miles north of the 
Ventura County line), (805) 987-3303, (805) 488-1827. Open daily, dawn to dusk. 
Day-use fee, $4 per car. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drought, it's a fine year to see the giant coreopsis in bloom along 
the coast, and the trail up La Jolla Canyon at Point Mugu is one of the best 
places to see it. 
</P>
<P>
To see the oversized plants, start your hike at the Ray Miller trailhead on 
Pacific Coast Highway and continue along La Jolla Valley Trail. You'll find 
coreopsis blooming near a walk-in campground with picnic tables and restrooms 
about 1 1/2 miles along the trail. Join a ranger-led walk every Saturday at 9 
a.m. for a narrated tour of flowering areas. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton Canyon Park, 1750 N. Altadena Drive, Pasadena, (818) 794-1866. Nature 
center open Monday-Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Park open 
dawn to dusk. Free. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, Eaton Canyon is an easily 
accessible swatch of wilderness. Along hiking trails through chaparral and oak 
woodlands in the 184-acre park, you'll see a good variety of wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
The flowering season is expected to peak in the canyon at the end of this 
month. To learn about the park's wildflowers, take a free family nature walk, 
offered every Saturday at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, 1500 N. College Ave., Claremont, (714) 
625-8767. Open daily, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 species of native California plants thrive in this 85-acre, 
naturally landscaped garden. The garden is divided into several settings 
reflecting California's geography. Along the Riparian Trail, you will find 
hundreds of California poppies, as well as blue-eyed grass and meadow foam. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Garden features nearly all California cactus species, as well as 
succulents and desert shrubs. This month and in May, you might plan your visit 
for 2 p.m. on a Sunday, so you can join a guided garden tour. A gift shop has a 
number of books on California flora. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cove State Park, on Pacific Coast Highway 1 mile north of Laguna Beach, 
(714) 494-3539. Open daily, 6:30 a.m. to sunset. Day-use fee, $4 per car. 
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers thrive along most trails in this oceanfront park. Stop at the 
park's nature center at El Moro Canyon for information about the flowers. 
Rangers there will help you find and identify the park's two rare and 
endangered wild plants, Turkish rugging and multiflowered dudleya. Hike a trail 
from the center into the canyon to see bright-orange monkey flowers, 
fuchsia-flowered gooseberry and Indian paintbrush. Rangers lead hikes on some 
Saturdays and some Sundays at various times; the Crystal Cove Interpretive 
Assn. offers walks the third Wednesday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Oaks Regional Park, 2145 N. Windes Drive, Orange, (714) 538-4400. Open 
daily, 7 a.m. to sunset. Day-use fee, $2 per car. 
</P>
<P>
Visit the 1930s-style nature center near the parking lot to see photos of 
flowers in this 125-acre wilderness park. Two quarter-mile trails near the 
nature center offer colorful displays this month and next. The Windes Trail 
follows an easy loop up the hill. On a clear day, take the branching Pacifica 
Trail to the top of the hill to see more wildflowers and a bonus view of 
northern Orange County and downtown Los Angeles. Along the trail you may spot 
golden fiddleneck, ground pink and blue fiesta flower. Be on the lookout for 
snakes as the weather warms up. Rangers lead nature walks on Saturdays and 
Sundays at 1 p.m. 
</P>

STATE PROVIDES HELP IN PHYSICAL THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: As a physical therapist, I was interested in your recent column about 
the lady who wrote regarding the need for physical therapy for her infant son. 
If you can contact her, she should know that her child would be eligible for 
free physical therapy services, either in-home or center-based, through state 
regional centers. She probably is in the boundaries of the one on the west side 
of town if she has been using Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. If not, they could 
refer her to the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
Also, when her child turns 3 years, services could be provided through 
California Children Services (CCS), which is located in many therapy units 
within the Los Angeles city and county schools. 
</P>
<P>
It's a real shame what Blue Cross and other insurance companies are doing. 
There's no way 12 sessions a year at $25 per session could begin to fill that 
child's needs. Even Medi-Cal rates are $31.91 per visit for in-home physical 
therapy, and that's the lowest rate around. (That's what regional centers pay 
us therapists who contract with them). 
</P>
<P>
I recently had my own battle with an insurer to get paid for therapy services I 
provided to a patient. It took lots of documentation on my part to justify the 
need for my services, many aggravating phone calls and then continued review by 
everyone imaginable to finally get paid -- six months later, I might add. It 
hardly seems worth the effort to provide services to insurance patients anymore 
when you have to fight to get paid. I hope you can get this information to the 
lady with the developmentally delayed son. -- G.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, I'm indebted to you for passing the information along. Both of the 
sources you suggest are potential suppliers of physical therapy for Mrs. Z. 
A.'s son, who was born prematurely two years ago and needs therapy in learning 
to walk. (Blue Cross had provided 80% of the two- or three-times-a-week 
treatment at $125 per visit but, last year, cut physical therapy reimbursements 
on all of its Prudent Buyer policies to a maximum of 12 sessions per year with 
a $25 cap on each such treatment.) 
</P>
<P>
Of the two options you mention, California Children Services and the state 
regional centers, CCS may be the better bet because the eligibility standards 
are somewhat broader than they are at the regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Frank Rico, director of the L.A. County Department of Health 
Service's Children Services program, the agency maintains 43 medical therapy 
units -- many of them small, consisting of two or three therapists engaged in 
both physical and occupational therapy. Because this is considered part of the 
child's education, Rico adds, the service is provided without charge through 
the primarily state-funded agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More specifics 
</P>
<P>
"However, we have to know more specifics about the child's needs to determine 
his eligibility, and, of course, it has to be prescribed by a physician who has 
been paneled by the state," Rico says. Some treatments "like medical 
intervention, do contain some financial-eligibility yardsticks before the 
mother can qualify, financially. 
</P>
<P>
"And so, a medical determination first has to be made and then, based on the 
child's needs, we can either provide the service ourselves or farm it out." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't clear, however, what you mean when you say "when he (the child) turns 
3 years of age" because CCS has no minimum-age eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Rico suggests that parents call his office in Marengo for directions to the 
medical therapy unit nearest their home: (213) 226-2469. 
</P>
<P>
And, as you suggest, another source of possible help is through the state 
regional centers, private, nonprofit organizations that contract with the 
state. There are 21 regional centers state-wide, seven of them in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
But here, according to Mary Rollins, director of client services for the state 
regional centers, the agency offers no direct services. Instead, the centers 
provide diagnostic assessment, case coordination and individual planning, 
Rollins adds. "And then, if the patient is eligible, we broker them out to 
facilities that are available in the community." 
</P>
<P>
And physical therapy, as such, isn't the key goal with the regional centers. 
"We work with people having mental retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and 
autism, and physical therapy is just one of the services. 
</P>
<P>
"The child you mention," Rollins said, "might potentially qualify for physical 
therapy if our diagnostic assessment establishes that either mental 
retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy or autism has created a substantial 
physical handicap requiring therapy." 
</P>
<P>
The primary eligibility is that the child isn't already receiving treatment 
either through the schools or through CCS, and the only age stipulation is that 
the condition mandating the therapy must have occurred before the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins suggests that you contact the regional center at Culver City, and ask 
for the intake department: (213) 337-1155. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Mrs. Z.A. and I thank you for the tip. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I retired from full-time employment on my 64th birthday and started 
to collect Social Security. After one year of complete retirement, I decided to 
take a part-time job, working only two days a week for a total of 16 hours per 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In view of this employment, my employer deducts all the necessary deductions 
from my earnings (FICA, state and federal withholding and state disability). In 
view of the fact that my Social Security checks were originally calculated on 
my highest earnings, I would have no way of increasing my Social Security 
monthly payments, based on the additional income I am presently earning. In no 
way would a part-time job add anything to my "highest" period of earnings 
because I did formerly work full time. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, you can see that any monies that are presently deducted from my 
earnings are not helping me to increase my future Social Security earning and 
are merely going into the Social Security fund for future beneficiaries. Please 
advise if this assumption is correct and/or if there is anyway that I can avoid 
these deductions. -- S.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your assumptions, alas, are correct and there's nothing you/I/they 
(Social Security) can do about it. Once you re-enter the work force, part time 
or full time, the old withholding gambit that you retired to get away from is 
securely back in place. And yes, those Social Security withholdings from your 
check are, sure enough, going right back into the same giant pot from which 
your own monthly benefits are coming. A very peculiar game of round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Comfort 
</P>
<P>
I know you can't take a lot of comfort in it, but because -- in retirement -- 
your income tax liability has probably dropped off sharply, you'll very likely 
have most, if not all, of that tax withholding returned to you. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's no way in the world that the part-time earnings can 
ever lower your monthly Social Security check. It's firmly in place and will 
increase as cost-of-living adjustments are made to it. 
</P>
<P>
No, I was afraid that this wasn't the answer you were hoping for. 
</P>

MONTEREY'S WINDY VINEYARDS 
</P>

GONZALES, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the afternoon wind roars down the Salinas Valley, it rakes the leaves on 
25,000 acres of vines and peels them away from the clusters of grapes. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pretty sight: bunches of grapes glistening in the sun. But growers Rich 
Smith and Terrel West cringe at this display of nature's power because they 
fear that wine quality will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other ills visited upon this verdant valley famed for its greenery, 
excessive wind creates more havoc for the grape grower than any other malady. 
And there are plenty of maladies. 
</P>
<P>
Wind, cold weather, fog, pestilence and more have plagued most of Monterey 
County's grapevines for the three decades they have been here, reducing what 
once was America's most-promising wine-growing region to an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, after wrestling with the problems of growing their vines and 
with the image of their wines, the growers and wine makers of Monterey now have 
a map out of the maze. Science is showing the way. Monterey County, a 100-mile 
region stretching from San Francisco Bay in the north to San Luis Obispo County 
in the south, is slowly gaining vinous respectability. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been a hard fight from those days in the early 1960s when the 
wine-making experts from UC Davis first identified Monterey County as one of 
America's likeliest spots to grow fine wine grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Heartened by those reports, Wente Bros., Mirassou, Paul Masson and some large 
growers sank fortunes into the soil. By the late 1970s, Monterey County had 
more than 20,000 acres of vines growing; by 1982 that number had leaped to 
35,000 acres, more than Napa or Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
And the early wines from Monterey showed promise. But they also had in them a 
characteristic that has dogged the county's reputation for decades. In polite 
circles, it's called herbaceousness. Bluntly, it's called "the veggies." 
</P>
<P>
A strong vegetative character pervaded many of the varieties growing here. In 
some cases, the aroma was as faint as freshly cut grass or newly mown hay. At 
its heaviest, it grew to celery tops and cabbage smells, and some wines were 
even described as having the stench of week-old cooked asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
"The duration of heat during the day is shorter than any other wine-growing 
region in the world," said Smith, president of Vineyard Management of Soledad, 
who farms 1,700 acres of vineyard land. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the short daytime heat, combined with strafing afternoon winds, 
reduces the maturity in grapes. So even though grapes may get physically ripe, 
with plenty of sugar, physiological maturity is retarded, leaving the grapes 
with an under-ripe quality. 
</P>
<P>
That gives wine the veggies. 
</P>
<P>
So grape-growing experimentation began. But in solving one problem, others were 
created. Some growers tried to expose more grapes to the sun to get needed 
maturity into the grapes. But excessive sunlight burns grapes, and sunburn 
produces yet another non-wine aroma, akin to charred paper. 
</P>
<P>
Wente attacked the problem by planting different clones of the same variety to 
see how they would grow in different exposures; Mirassou tested the soil with 
water-measuring devices to see if soil moisture was a solution; Jekel adopted 
only tested grapes; Masson and Almaden harvested Monterey grapes, then blended 
them with grapes from other regions that had less of the veggies. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Meador of Ventana Vineyards, a former jet pilot and apple grower, used 
irrigation control as his first attempt to fight the problems. All had a degree 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
West, a respected grower with a row-crop background, attacked the problems 
using growing systems. He first asked himself the question: If wind, cold, fog, 
lack of heat, and excessive sunlight all were problems, was there a growing 
system that helped to maximize warmth and still minimize sun exposure and the 
effects of the wind? 
</P>
<P>
The answer came to his vineyards in Arroyo Seco from New Zealand, and it was a 
vine-training system developed by Richard Smart, along with data accumulated in 
New York. West, as well as Smith, Meador and other vine-growing experts here, 
adopted versions of the system. 
</P>
<P>
For lack of a better term, this system is called the Monterey Harp because the 
canes (arms) of the vines are trained to grow up in an arc higher than usual 
growing systems, simulating a harp. The leaves are then splayed out higher than 
in standard growing systems. 
</P>
<P>
Holding the canes in place and thinning them so there aren't too many leaves 
prevents them from swaying in the wind. It also prevents them from bending away 
from the clusters and allowing too much sunlight to shine directly on the 
grapes. Thus shielded, the grapes don't get sunburned. 
</P>
<P>
And by keeping the leaves spread out in a fan, no umbrella of leaves can form 
to can keep cold nighttime temperatures in and thus reduce maturity. The 
sunlight also has to filter through no more than three leaves to get to the 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, no one ever developed a very good system for growing fine-wine grapes 
in a cool, dry desert like this," said West. 
</P>
<P>
Meador, who founded Ventana Vineyards here in 1978, had been experimenting 
since 1974 when he planted some experimental plots of vineyard with closer 
spacing than the traditional 7 feet between vines and 12 feet between the rows. 
Meador used a 3 1/2-by-12-foot spacing, hoping the additional vines would help 
to control irrigation by additional competition for moisture. 
</P>
<P>
He found that reducing water to the vines was only one of the possible 
solutions. Meador also pointed out that when you hit a certain point, the acid 
balance found in the grapes goes out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
Meador tried a multitude of things, and by 1980 had reduced the spacing between 
vines to a 3 1/2-by-6-foot grid. He had 1,200 vines per acre, nearly 2.5 times 
the standard around the state, with each plant yielding less fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of all this work was that the failure to develop a special clip to 
hold the trellis slowed down development of the system. A clip was needed to 
hold the trellis wires, and growers wanted it to be so easy to use that the 
wire could be moved by hand, but strong enough not to be blown apart by the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
That clip became widely available only in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
It has been only five years since the velocity of the wind was identified as 
the major culprit here. Mark Kliewer, a viticulture specialist at UC Davis, 
showed that cold temperatures weren't as harmful as the strong wind coming in 
off San Francisco Bay and running down the county like a wind tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Various solutions appear to be working for some. J. Lohr Winery in San Jose has 
planted cypress trees to act as a windbreak. Lohr also is using a 
drip-irrigation system to better control water use by the vines. Jekel has 
planted new acreage under a high butte on the northern edge in the south part 
of the county, hoping that the severe winds will race by over the vine tops. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what has been accomplished here has been out of the pockets of the 
wineries and growers, though $400,000 of a $600,000 grant to the county's wine 
growers by the California Wine Commission has helped continue some of the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the problem is communication," said Jerry Lohr. "We're just a long 
ways away from Davis and Fresno physically," and the only two educational 
institutions that have active vine research departments are at UC Davis and 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, the frustrating thing is that even after you've identified the problem, 
all this stuff (research) takes so damn long to do," said Lohr. "At least 15 
years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Problems Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
Some properties in Monterey County have little problem with the winds. Durney 
Vineyard, for instance, makes exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon, making use of 
natural moisture in its soil atop a ridge overlooking the Carmel Valley, west 
of Salinas and east of Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Cabernet specialists, Smith &amp; Hook and San Saba, both to the 
south, grow their grapes out of the direct path of the wind, on western slopes. 
</P>
<P>
On the east side of the county, Chalone Vineyard is well off the wind-beaten 
path near the Pinnacles National Monument. There, the Burgundian varieties 
(Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc) seem to ripen and mature. 
</P>
<P>
Other wineries using Monterey County grapes have adapted well to the new 
growing methods and have made much better wine than in the past. Almost every 
producer has made a bolder, more directed statement toward maximizing wine 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
The one major characteristic about so many of the latest Monterey wines is the 
almost complete lack of bell pepperiness that once was the county's albatross. 
</P>
<P>
And one reason for this is the changing complexion of the county's vines. 
Though vine acreage has dropped from 35,000 acres to 25,000 today, Rich Smith 
said that about 10,000 acres have been changed from the varieties that were 
here in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
This means that only 15,000 acres remain from the 35,000 that were here in 
1982, showing that growers are tearing out varieties that simply don't grow 
well and planting those that do. 
</P>
<P>
The quality in this soil hasn't been overlooked. A year ago, the large Central 
San Joaquin Valley winery Delicato bought the massive 8,000-acre San Bernabe 
Vineyard in Monterey County. The world's largest contiguous vineyard, it 
represents nearly a third of the entire acreage in the county. Delicato has 
plans to produce premium wines from this land. 
</P>
<P>
Although the problems Monterey encountered in the past were almost strictly 
viticultural, great contributions to wine quality have been made by wine makers 
who have struggled to change procedures, to adapt to the grapes. The Monterey 
Vineyard has, in the last two years, done as much as anyone to track the source 
of poor quality grapes and make sure they don't get used. Wine maker Cary 
Gott's latest wines are striking for their lack of herbal components. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Vineyards' 1987 Johannisberg Riesling is delicately floral in 
aroma; a 1986 Chardonnay is fresh and lively, loaded with tropical fruit 
flavors; a 1987 Limited Release Chardonnay is an even better example of 
wine-making skill, with richness and fruit. A 1987 Pinot Noir is a marvelous 
example of how Pinot Noir fruit can be retained in a wine without making the 
end product taste like soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
Wente Bros. of Livermore, with most of its acreage in Monterey, has been hard 
at work improving its line of table wines, and now with the recent release of a 
delightful new 1986 Blanc de Noirs sparkling wine, Wente is making a big push 
in that direction too. 
</P>
<P>
Other grand efforts from Wente include a fine dry Gewurztraminer and a fresh, 
herbal, spicy Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Masson, now under the direction of Michael Cliff, a former Seagram 
executive and a British Master of Wine, has come out with a line of elegant 
wines bearing the Monterey County appellation. Masson's fresh, richly complex 
1986 Chardonnay and a lean, herbal, fragrant 1985 Cabernet Sauvignon are 
superb. Both sell for less than $8. Neither displays a hint of that vegetal 
aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Jekel, famed for its Riesling, has made strides with Cabernet and Merlot. 
Mirassou slowly is building its image, notably with its White Burgundy, a Pinot 
Blanc with a nom de plume. 
</P>
<P>
J. Lohr, so frustrated by its inability to tame the Cabernet in Monterey, 
finally bought land in the Napa Valley. But its Chardonnays have found favor 
with those who like the more tropical fruit style. Chateau Julien Chardonnays 
fit in that style, but with a bit more depth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barrel-Aging Technique 
</P>
<P>
La Reina and Talbott, on the other hand, have developed a barrel-aging 
technique that accents complexity over the tropical fruit often found in 
Monterey County Chardonnay. And Monterey Peninsula moves that style one step 
further with oak as a major component, in addition to the wine's tropicality. 
</P>
<P>
Even Pinot Noir, the grape of Burgundy, has found followers in Monterey. Wines 
from Jory, Morgan, Jekel, Monterey Peninsula and Ventana have been highly 
praised recently. 
</P>
<P>
Cabernet seems limited to the county's mountain slopes. Durney, Smith &amp; 
Hook and San Saba all are far off the Highway 101 path near which most 
vineyards sit, and high off the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
All three make fine Cabernets. Durney planted earlier than the others, in the 
mid-1970s. Its Cabernets are marked by opulent fruit laden with cherries and 
Bordeaux-like elegance, but with a hardness that requires time in bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith and Hook wines have a bit more California-like fruit and also are 
hard and astringent when young. The San Saba style is slightly more supple and 
approachable, but still with astringency. 
</P>
<P>
The county's most famous property, Chalone, sits 2,000 feet up and seems immune 
to the typical Monterey problems. It even has its own sub-appellation. 
</P>
<P>
Science once predicted greatness for Monterey County. What was created was a 
conundrum. So science accepted the challenge and, with the aid of dedicated 
growers, began to solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Today Monterey says it can hold its own with anyone. And the evidence is 
growing.

FOOD BRIEFS: CDC ISSUES TOXIN ALERT ON TROPICAL SEAFOOD SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thorough heating is inadequate protection against toxins that may be present in 
certain tropical seafood species, according to a study by the Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
An article in the agency's Morbidity &amp; Mortality Weekly Report found that 
cooking did not destroy elevated levels of scombroid toxin -- a naturally 
occurring contaminant -- in fish identified as the source of two outbreaks last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the incidents, which occurred in Chicago and Charleston, S.C., 
victims were diagnosed as suffering from scombroid poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
This particular toxin is fast-acting and is capable of producing symptoms in 
otherwise healthy adults in as little as five minutes after a meal. 
</P>
<P>
The attack, which can last up to 10 hours and may require emergency medical 
care, includes nausea, dizziness, facial swelling, diarrhea and fever. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 192 scombroid fish poisoning outbreaks in this country between 
1973 and 1987 resulting in more than 1,000 illnesses, according to the CDC. 
Hawaii, with 51, and California, with 29, topped all other states in the number 
of such incidents. None of the cases involved fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Those species most often implicated in these poisonings are mahi-mahi, tuna and 
bluefish. 
</P>
<P>
The scombroid toxin is produced in dark-fleshed fresh fish with high levels of 
the compound histidine, an amino acid. Under poor storage conditions -- whether 
on fishing boats, docks or in warehouses -- the histidine can be converted into 
histimine by surface bacteria on the fish. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a situation where the bacteria that are normally present on the fish 
break down the other normal surface materials to form abnormally high levels of 
toxic products," said Stephen Ostroff M.D., CDC medical epidemiologist familiar 
with the report. 
</P>
<P>
As little as 20 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams of fresh fish can cause 
symptoms, according to the CDC. Hazardous levels of the compound in tuna are 
considered to be 50 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chicago outbreak, which produced eight illnesses, mahi-mahi was 
implicated as the source of the contamination. Investigators found that the 
fish showed signs of freezer burn or had been thawed and improperly refrozen. 
Laboratory tests found levels of histimine in the remaining fish to be three 
times that considered hazardous by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Charleston case, contaminated yellow-fin tuna was identified as the 
cause of nine illnesses. However, local health officials who reviewed the 
incident found that the suspect fish was kept thoroughly iced throughout 
storage and handling. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, investigators found that histimine present in uneaten tuna was 10 to 
15 times above the level considered hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
"As these outbreaks demonstrate, cooking toxic fish is not protective," the 
article stated. 
</P>
<P>
The authors recommend continuous icing or refrigeration for all potentially 
scombroid-toxic fish from the point at which the catch leaves the water until 
cooking. This recommendation, however, is standard advice for all fish species 
-- not just the dark-flesh varieties. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing else the consumer can do if they get a bad piece of fish. You 
can't smell the toxin, feel it or see it," said Ostroff. "But people have to 
realize that, while this is a problem, it is not a frequent occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
Tropical Toxins -- Often mentioned in tandem with scombroid poisoning is 
ciguatera, another toxin found in tropical reef fish. The number of poisoning 
incidents involving ciguatera are estimated to be 25% higher than that from 
scombroid, Ostroff said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1973 to 1987 there were a total of 233 ciguatera outbreaks with a total of 
1,045 illnesses and three fatalities. Most of these incidents, or 167, occurred 
in Hawaii. Another 35 were in Florida and only three in California. 
</P>
<P>
Species linked to ciguatera, which is formed when fish eat a certain poisonous 
reef algae, include mahi-mahi, barracuda, amber jack and some red snapper 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC's statistics for seafood-related poisonings, including bacteria such as 
Vibrio cholera and Vibrio vulnificus, are considered fairly well documented 
because the contaminations are so distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
"Seafood-related illnesses tend to be more severe (than those caused by other 
foods)," said Ostroff. "Cholera, ciguatoxin, scombroid are often easily 
recognizable entities. Another one is paralytic shellfish poisoning. They 
usually involve a small number of people when noticed (by health officials). 
Cholera cases sometimes only involve one person." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of outbreaks, it appears that there are more poisonings and illnesses 
related to seafood than any other individual protein source. That's because 
illnesses caused by meats, such as salmonellosis and camplylobacteriosis, are 
harder to detect and are often not as identifiable. Symptoms in these cases can 
also be more variable. 
</P>
<P>
"A substantial portion of the outbreaks (documented by CDC) where there's a 
known contaminant and a specific food are seafood related," said Ostroff. 
</P>
<P>
There were 7,431 food-related outbreaks between 1973 and 1987. Seafood 
accounted for 11.1% of these, or 827 outbreaks and 12,766 illnesses, according 
to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
Half of all the episodes, however, have undetermined causes. As a result, the 
figure for seafood contaminations, as well as for those cases linked to any 
other individual food, can be doubled as a way of accounting for the percentage 
of unknown causes, Ostroff said. 
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of seafood-related illnesses are higher than any particular 
meat product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ostroff disagreed with some consumer groups who have claimed that the 
contamination threat from seafood -- in general -- is a greater health risk to 
consumers than is meat or poultry. 
</P>
<P>
Botulism Threat -- Improper storage conditions also played an important role in 
another food poisoning recently reported by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
The agency linked three botulism cases in the New York City area with 
consumption of a commercial garlic-and-oil mix that was kept at room 
temperature despite a label stating "Keep Refrigerated." 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation by health officials implicated a product no longer 
manufactured: Chopped Garlic in Extra Virgin Olive Oil made by Colavita Pasta 
&amp; Oil Co. The Newark, N.J.,-based firm discontinued the item a year ago but 
announced a recall of the product nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, each of whom required hospitalization, apparently used the oil to 
prepare garlic bread. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this and other recent cases, the FDA has alerted commercial 
producers of similar products to ensure that labels and bulk packaging 
materials prominently state, "Requires Refrigeration for Safety" or 
"Refrigerate Both Before and After Opening." 
</P>
<P>
FDA researchers have found that oils present an ideal environment for the 
growth of botulinum spores. 
</P>
<P>
"Clostridium botulinum bacteria are widespread . . . and may be found on 
various produce, including garlic, but their spores are harmless when there is 
oxygen in the environment," according to the FDA's account of the episode. 
"However, the spores can produce a deadly toxin when in an oxygen-free, 
low-acid environment." 
</P>
<P>
A similar contamination incident occurred in 1985, the FDA reported, when 37 
people suffered from botulism after eating a dish that included a commercial 
chopped garlic in soybean oil in a Vancouver, British Columbia, restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the recent problems with garlic in oil, the agency is warning 
that any such commercial or homemade mixes can pose serious health risks if 
left at room temperature.

 BACK TO BASICS: OMELETS WITHOUT ANY CRACKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nice thing about learning to make a French omelet is that even if early 
attempts at proper technique result in total disaster, all is not lost. You'll 
still be able to enjoy some very acceptable scrambled eggs, since only the 
method of preparation distinguishes one of these egg dishes from the other. 
</P>
<P>
Omelet preparation requires a special pan -- either one of the traditional 
French-style made of spun steel and used exclusively for omelet preparation, or 
any of the small (6-, 7- or 8-inch diameter), heavy-gauge skillets with sloping 
sides and nonstick interiors. Most of these pans have long handles to assist 
with the manipulation during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blend With a Fork 
</P>
<P>
Begin preparation by breaking three eggs into a small bowl. Blend the whites 
and yolks well with a fork, but the mixture should not be foamy. Some recipes 
call for a tablespoon of milk per egg or a little water, and most people add a 
little salt and pepper for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Heat about one tablespoon of butter or margarine in the skillet over 
medium-high heat. As it begins to melt, tilt the pan to thoroughly coat the 
bottom and sides. Then, just as the butter begins to sizzle and turn brown, add 
the beaten eggs. 
</P>
<P>
In the classic method, one hand is used to slide the skillet back and forth 
rapidly over the heat source while the other hand stirs the eggs over the 
bottom of the skillet with a fork as they thicken. It's easier for most people, 
however, to lift the edge of the eggs with a narrow spatula and tip the pan to 
allow the uncooked portion of the eggs to flow underneath (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
When the omelet is set, but the top still moist and creamy, add the desired 
filling down the center (Step 2). Lift the edge and check that the bottom of 
the omelet is golden brown, then with a spatula, fold the omelet in half or 
thirds (Step 3) and slide out of the pan onto a serving plate (Step 4).

THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN FIGHT BATTLE AGAINST FOOD-GENERATED GARBAGE

<P>
"In this world," Benjamin Franklin once said, "nothing is certain but death and 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
And garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Face it, human beings are trash machines -- incapable of consuming anything 
without creating a pile of garbage seemingly twice the volume of the product. 
The United States now produces more than 400,000 tons of trash a day and space 
is running out -- landfills are overflowing, waterways are clogged and beaches 
are becoming lethal playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the total solid waste in this country added up to 160 million tons -- 
a full 8% of which came directly from the kitchen as food waste. There are 
16,400 landfills nationally, half of which are expected to close by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
The one landfill that serves the District of Columbia and suburban Virginia is 
expected to be completely filled in the year 2003. The landfill for Montgomery 
County, Md., will be filled in this May. (A new application has been submitted 
to extend capacity until 2004.) 
</P>
<P>
How can you help break the wave of trash? 
</P>
<P>
According to Eric A. Goldstein, senior attorney at Natural Resources Defense 
Council in New York, three steps can be taken to substantially alleviate 
food-generated garbage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Make Compost 
</P>
<P>
First, he says, "to take a nice hunk out of the problem, people should set up 
composting programs in their back yards." Composting, the degradation process 
brought about by bacteria and fungus organisms, can effectively turn organic 
kitchen and garden refuse into a moist black soil conditioner. And, even 
apartment dwellers with balconies can compost, according to Pegi 
Ballister-Howells of the Rutgers Cooperative Extension for Middlesex County, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
To start composting, the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service suggests laying 
small twigs or chopped corn stalks down first to aid in aeration and drainage. 
Then, add both garden (yard waste accounts for a full 18% of landfill mass) and 
kitchen refuse such as husks, coffee grounds, crushed egg shells and canning 
wastes. Next, add a layer of a nitrogen-rich material such as fresh manure or 
fresh grass clippings, hay or green weeds (you can buy synthetic nitrogen 
fertilizer in the form of blood meal or cottonseed meal). Do not add meat -- it 
will attract rodents. Water the pile to keep the contents moist. If you smell a 
strong whiff of ammonia, the pile is either too tightly packed or too wet. Turn 
the heap, add some coarser material for aeration and start over. Every three or 
four weeks, fork over the pile, pushing outside material to the inside so that 
everything breaks down. 
</P>
<P>
As for the apartment method, here's how: Take a black (color is important 
because it absorbs heat) plastic bag, fill it three-quarters full with cooking 
and plant refuse (again only vegetable refuse; meat products could attract 
rodents), add a nitrogen product and fill with water (it will not decompose if 
dry). Set out on the balcony -- it needs the sunlight -- and poke holes in the 
bag to let the water drain out. "Every once in a while," suggests 
Ballister-Howells, "when you walk past, you can give the bag a kick, it moves 
things around and aerates it." If the bag loses its oxygen, she says, anaerobic 
bacteria will flourish and things will begin to get smelly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping Waste 
</P>
<P>
A second trash-reducing idea, according to Goldstein, is to be sensitive to 
waste in your shopping decisions. According to a report by Worldwatch 
Institute, an independent non-profit research organization, packaging accounts 
for about 30% of the weight and 50% of the volume of household waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The packaging explosion has gone too far," says Goldstein. "We don't need to 
wrap something in one layer, then rewrap in a bigger layer, and then put it in 
a plastic bag -- this is an area where consumers can make a big difference." 
The amount of packaging for food doubled, even tripled, after World War II, 
says Goldstein. In 1958, the per-capita consumption of packaging material in 
New York State was 404 pounds per year. By 1986, it had risen to 800 pounds. 
"Advertisers and marketing experts have assumed, and in some cases it's true, 
that packaging sells." So make sure, he says, that you're buying for the 
product, not the package. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious answer, says Goldstein, is bulk-food shopping. It not only benefits 
the consumer in price reduction and the environment in waste reduction, he 
says, it also benefits the producers themselves in overhead reduction -- they 
spend less on packaging, they lose less in the profit corner. "When I'm in the 
market," says Goldstein, the bulk-food aisle is "the most heavily populated 
aisle -- as the 1990s approach that will be an important trend emerging." 
</P>
<P>
According to a May 1987 article in Supermarket Business News, bulk food is, in 
fact, declining, as many supermarkets cut back on the number of items available 
or cut out the program completely. Safeway, which started its bulk-food program 
in 1983, sees no great increase or decrease in the number of people who shop 
from the bins. It has what Ann Cockrell of Safeway calls a stabilized customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Your Own Bag 
</P>
<P>
A third contribution: Bring a satchel. Follow European shopping fashion and 
take your own bag to the store. "It's stupid when you go to get something that 
is already packaged to dump it into another plastic bag. Then when you get home 
you unpack bags, and they're all strewn all over the kitchen, you realize that 
the products you bought make up just under half of the total volume." 
</P>
<P>
Other shopping decisions might include insisting on recyclable cardboard 
(rather than Styrofoam) egg cartons, reaching for milk in the paper (rather 
than plastic) cartons and asking for paper bags when checking out. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Safeway and Giant offer the choice of paper or plastic. At Safeway 
in the second quarter of 1988, customers chose plastic over paper 3 to 1. In an 
effort to do its bit for the environment, Safeway is testing at its Vancouver 
stores a photodegradable plastic bag that breaks down into fragments when 
exposed to light and eventually reduces to carbon monoxide and water. 
</P>
<P>
Giant places its plastic-paper bag ratio at 60%-40% in favor of plastic. It has 
not yet incorporated a photodegradable bag in its stores, preferring for the 
moment to research bags that can decompose without sunlight -- something Mark 
Roeder of Giant says will be more useful in an area served mostly by landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling should come back full force, says Goldstein, to help combat the trash 
problem. And according to a national poll of 1,000 adults taken by Penn &amp; 
Schoen Associates, 91% said they would be willing to pay a few cents more for 
products packaged in recyclable or biodegradable material. 
</P>
<P>
"In World War II, we had a lot more recycling because of the need to preserve 
precious metals for the war." Then as materials returned to abundance, we 
became extravagant, Goldstein noted. "The legacy of the postwar era, while 
being a very productive era for us, is that we became a throw-away society." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Sweeney of US Recycling Centers Inc. in Rockville and Hagerstown, Md., 
says many residents have gotten the message. When she opened the center in 1986 
in Rockville, 40 people showing up on Saturdays was considered good. In the 
last few months, the number of people has quadrupled. "Recycling is very 
suddenly big business. And I think it's because that garbage barge from New 
York scared a lot of people," she said. (Call your local Extension service or 
look in your local Yellow Pages for nearby recycling centers.) 
</P>
<P>
Items to separate from your garbage and recycle include glass bottles and jars, 
aluminum beverage cans, foil, aluminum pie plates from frozen foods, cardboard, 
brown paper bags and newspaper. Recycling of paper is especially important as 
it is the largest single component in landfill waste -- taking up 36%. 
</P>
<P>
A word about plastic. 
</P>
<P>
It makes up 7% of the municipal solid waste. And only 1% of it currently being 
recycled. The most widely recycled plastic product is the soft-drink container 
-- 20% of which is being recycled. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste in New 
York, Gov. Mario Cuomo declared in March that his administration would begin 
phasing out the use of Styrofoam cups and other unbiodegradable plastic food 
containers at several of the state parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packaging Helps, Too 
</P>
<P>
Of course, food packaging is not all bad. Much of it has allowed us longer 
storage time on certain foods. Says Lenus Barnes, chief of the Solid Waste 
Regulation and Collection Section of Montgomery County, Md.: "I remember when 
there wasn't a lot of packaging, when my mother would have to throw out things 
that nowadays we could have stored a longer period of time and have consumed." 
</P>
<P>
But gone are the days of the American Indian who used every last scrap of the 
buffalo he killed. 
</P>
<P>
Says Goldstein: "Now garbage is excessive and a very expensive proposition. 
Disposal fees have in some cases doubled because we are running out of landfill 
space. Incinerators have their own environmental problems and are very 
expensive -- in fact, sometimes the single most expensive decision a community 
will have to make." 
</P>
<P>
What makes economic and environmental sense in the end, concludes Goldstein, is 
recycling and waste reduction through responsible buying.

DEAR JEANNE: This Dutch Apple Pie recipe is one of my attempts to reduce the 
calories and cholesterol in a favorite recipe. I've had raves about my version, 
but I'm curious to know if you can cut out anything else to make it even 
healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN SMITH, Suffern, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
SUSIE'S DUTCH APPLE PIE 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened 
</P>
<P>
5 1/2 cups peeled, cored and sliced Rome apples 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
All-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup butter or margarine, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
Combine graham cracker crumbs and softened butter or margarine. Press firmly in 
bottom and sides of 9-inch pie pan. Place on baking sheet and bake at 375 
degrees about 5 minutes. Remove from oven. 
</P>
<P>
Toss apple slices with lemon juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons 
all-purpose flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Layer slices in crust. 
</P>
<P>
Combine whole-wheat flour, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, remaining 1/4 cup brown 
sugar and room temperature butter. Sprinkle evenly over apple mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Place pie on baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees about 50 minutes or until top 
is golden and filling is bubbling. Cool on wire rack. Serve at room 
temperature. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SUSAN: Since you have already made some good changes in the recipe, my job 
was a little easier. However, I was able to achieve a significant reduction in 
the bottom-line figures with a few adjustments of my own. 
</P>
<P>
I first tried to make this pie with only one-third cup crumbs and one 
tablespoon margarine in the crust. The resulting pie tasted fine, but when 
compared to your version the crust looked too skimpy. Therefore, I increased 
the margarine and crumbs so the revised pie more closely resembles the 
original. I was also able to reduce the amount of brown sugar by adding some 
apple juice concentrate, increasing the cinnamon and adding vanilla to increase 
the perceived level of sweetness. 
</P>

 KITCHEN CABINET: NEW LOOKS FOR 1988'S FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When a new product proves a success, there follows, almost inevitably, a 
variation on that product from the same or another manufacturer. Like sequels 
to hit movies, these follow-up products prove that tried-and-true ideas can be 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
The CafePresso ($200) is an innovative product from Krups that really took off 
as soon as it was unveiled in the marketplace last year. Consumers bought the 
machine not just for its black matte finish but mainly for its versatility. 
What's new this year is the addition of white CafePressos. Although there 
appears to be a strong demand and promising future for black kitchen 
appliances, outselling white in many cases, Krups gambled on a white unit to 
please people who go for a pristine, all-white look in kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The key selling point of CafePresso is its dual function. Compact looking, the 
appliance features a powerful four-cup espresso/cappuccino machine and an 
eight-cup drip coffee maker. Aside from being uncomplicated, the CafePresso 
offers speed. Its fast steam action froths milk for cappuccino in a matter of 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Another extremely handy feature, also available on Krups' other coffee makers, 
is Stop 'N Serve. Pioneered by Krups, this design makes it possible for the 
brewing cycle to stop when the carafe is removed as for a quick one- or two-cup 
serving. However, the brewing resumes automatically when the carafe is 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding heat in a brewed pot of coffee has been achieved in the 
invention of an insulated carafe in a coffee system. Ever since the concept was 
introduced by a European company a few years ago, other manufacturers have 
followed, hoping to achieve the same success. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Black &amp; Decker released its full-size Thermal Carafe Drip Coffee 
Maker ($58.98) in Euro-styling with a white base and smoked black water 
reservoir. Coffee is brewed directly into an all-white vacuum-bottle thermal 
carafe. When tightly covered with its lid, the insulated carafe keeps the 
coffee hot and fresh for hours even though the machine is shut off. The plastic 
carafe is totable and can be placed directly onto a serving table immediately 
after heating without damaging the surface. An automatic drip feature 
interrupts coffee flow when the pot is removed. 
</P>
<P>
A similarly styled upgraded version is equipped with an analog clock/timer 
($75.98). It can be set the night before and programmed to brew anytime within 
the next 24 hours. Taking advantage of the same concept and new this year is 
Black &amp; Decker's personal-size Four-Cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker 
($44.98). 
</P>
<P>
Considering changing patterns in coffee drinking habits, Black &amp; Decker's 
marketing manager Jeff Bye says, "More Americans than ever are drinking coffee, 
but they're drinking fewer cups a day. . . . Our new personal-size coffee 
makers were created so that coffee drinkers who want only a few cups can enjoy 
flavorful coffee without wasting a drop." 
</P>
<P>
Like the full-size models, the personal-size coffee systems are designed with a 
brewing light that signals when coffee is ready and automatic drip stop. And, 
for peace of mind after rushing out the door, all units were created with an 
automatic shut off feature after the brewing process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Black may be the strong statement in small portable appliances, but white seems 
to be the direction taken by manufacturers for major kitchen appliances. This 
clean contemporary look follows the sleek European style of kitchen design. GE 
Appliances' new line of kitchen and laundry appliances is called 
"white-on-white." Creating a softer, sophisticated design with an integrated 
look, the models are white with white control panels and subtle gray graphics. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first units to arrive is the Spacecenter 27 side-by-side 
refrigerator. The new all-white unit (model TFXW27F) offers the same GE 
Refreshment Center door, an exclusive custom dispenser offering chilled water 
and crushed or cubed ice. The door swings down and becomes a built-in counter 
space for handy serving of beverages and snacks. 
</P>
<P>
"This refrigerator, designed as a food management system that allows for 
efficient organization of a large quantity of foods and beverages, has been 
highly popular since we introduced it in 1986," said Gary M. Christensen, 
general manager of GE's refrigeration products. Another innovative feature is 
the electronic monitor with solid state electronics that light up and beep to 
alert the user of possible problems. 
</P>
<P>
For convenience, there is a Quick Serve System under the refrigerator shelf 
that contains five storage dishes that are microwaveable and dishwasher proof. 
The model also includes a food-saver system with three vegetable/fruit pans, 
door shelves that hold gallon containers, 3-liter bottles and six-packs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Krups CafePresso are available at Bullock's, Broadway and Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black &amp; Decker thermal carafe coffee makers will be available end of 
April at Broadway, Adray's and Home Express (Orange County). 
</P>
<P>
 The GE Spacecenter 27 (model TFXW2F) is available at GE appliance dealers. For 
nearest store, call GE'S toll-free consumer service number: (800)-626-2000.

 LET'S EAT OUT: SHARING STUDIO CITY'S CULINARY GOOD FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think there's this print shop somewhere in New Jersey that makes up the 
menus for Chinese restaurants all over the country," said a friend as she 
perused the offerings at Fortune West in Studio City. True, the menu reads a 
lot like umpteen others, but that provides a good basis for the reviewer to 
make comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
Take the pan-fried meat dumplings. Those at Fortune West have considerably more 
filling than most I've encountered elsewhere. The same is true of the plump 
little steamed shrimp shu mai, and both appetizers have well-flavored fillings. 
</P>
<P>
So does another of the dim sum selections, the minced chicken with lettuce. It 
typifies two of this restaurant's best features -- attractive presentation and 
tableside service. Our waiter expertly tossed the chicken and rice noodle 
filling tableside, then spooned it into the crisp lettuce cups and left hoisin 
sauce for us to drizzle over before rolling them up. 
</P>
<P>
On another visit we were impressed by how attractively the ingredients for 
spring pancakes were arranged for presentation. Again our waitress tossed the 
chicken, egg, carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts and cilantro tableside and deftly 
rolled them inside the thin Chinese pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
The chef's specialities portion of Fortune West's menu features their Hunan and 
Sichuan cuisine. While the Sichuan hot sesame noodles are served cold, an ample 
amount of chili sauce makes them a fiery accent to some of the milder menu 
selections. The sizzling beef, sauteed in honey sauce, is another recommended 
choice among the spicy dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Good contrasting selections include the orange-flavored chicken salad, a nice 
variation of the old favorite. The menu listed shrimp with mushrooms, snow peas 
and broccoli as separate items, but when we requested a combination, they 
gladly obliged with another mild-flavored winner. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly this is an Americanized Chinese restaurant, but I did find it 
disappointing that you needed to request chopsticks. One friend, just back from 
two weeks in Hong Kong, also pointed out our dinner-size plates. "You would 
never see any larger than the size of American salad plates in a restaurant 
over there," she commented. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune West differs from many Chinese restaurants in that it offers a full bar 
and a 25-selection wine list that includes four Champagnes and sparkling wines, 
a dozen white, two blush and seven red wines. Prices range from $12 to $30. 
There is also a selection of house wines by the glass; sake is available by the 
jug, plum wine by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
The bar, with 13 stools and four tiny tables, divides the restaurant's two 
dining rooms. One dining area is designated no smoking, the other has four 
smoking tables. The overall color scheme is mauve and gray, with black accents 
and very subtle lighting in the evening. A large expanse of windows lets in 
plenty of light during the day and the shrubs outside, decorated with white 
twinkle lights, become a part of the evening charm. 
</P>
<P>
No desserts are offered, but almond and fortune cookies are presented with the 
check. I guess the plastic wrappers keep them fresh, but serving an unwrapped 
version would seem more in keeping with the overall quality of this restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Finding Fortune West can be a bit of a challenge because a maze of buildings 
block it from the view of anyone driving along Ventura Boulevard. But it's 
worth the effort to seek it out at the back of Gaslight Alley shopping plaza 
just east of Coldwater Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fortune West, 12733 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 760-3867. Open for lunch 
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; dinner served Monday through 
Saturday from 4 to 10:30 p.m., Sunday from 4 to 10 p.m. All major credit cards 
accepted. Reservations accepted. Lot parking. Dim sum, $3.25 to $10; entrees 
$6.95 to $15.95; accompaniments, 65 cents to $6.95.

 THE BUTCHER: BASIC MEAT SAUCE: NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE FOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion we spend an unnecessary fortune on foods we perceive to be 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
In the market where I do much of my shopping, the three-tiered self-service 
meat case and the frozen food case are on either side of the same aisle. It is 
easy and -- for the seriously frugal shopper -- almost impossible not to 
compare the prices of frozen convenience entrees with the price of the fresh 
meat from which they are made. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to the market to pick up lean ground beef for 99 cents a 
pound, I stepped across the aisle to check on the prices of the stuff I would 
make with it: chili con carne, 8 3/4-ounce single serving, $1.95; spaghetti 
with meat sauce, 12 7/8-ounce single serving, $2.25; lasagna, 10 1/2-ounce 
single serving, $2.25. In my opinion, those prices border on the ridiculous 
when compared to my ground-beef buy. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a recipe for a simple Basic Meat Sauce that can be prepared 
ahead -- frozen in appropriate-sized portions and used to make all kinds of 
delicious dishes quickly. It's like making your own convenience foods. It takes 
a bit of time, but considering the savings to be made, it's well worth the time 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASIC MEAT SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
6 or 8 onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
3 or 4 carrots, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive or salad oil 
</P>
<P>
2 or 3 tablespoons parsley or 1 fresh bunch, chopped 
</P>
<P>
5 pounds lean ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree 
</P>
<P>
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups strong chicken stock (if stock is weak, add 1 to 2 chicken bouillon 
cubes) 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cook onions and carrots in oil in 8-quart stock pot until tender, but not 
browned. Stir in parsley and cook until tender. Remove vegetables from pan to 
large bowl and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Brown ground beef in same pot in 1 1/2-pound batches. As each batch is cooked, 
add to vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
After all beef is browned and removed, add tomato puree, tomato sauce and 
chicken broth and stir to loosen bits on bottom of pot. Return beef and 
vegetables to pot and simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes. Allow sauce to cool, 
package into 2- or 3-cup packages and freeze. Makes about 2 1/2 quarts. 
</P>
<P>
Now what are you going to do with all that stuff? Let me suggest a few ideas to 
get you started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

After nearly a year of study, the board that sets building design guidelines 
for most of Pacific Palisades is expected to vote on a plan later this month to 
curb the rash of massive homes being built in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Palisades Civic League will vote on a proposal to set a maximum 
single-family house size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the lot size. The 
plan would also restrict the height of new and remodeled homes to 28 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efforts Applauded 
</P>
<P>
"We're not proposing the ultimate guidelines, we're just trying to make them 
more restrictive than they are now," said Lila Gordon, president of the 
19-member board. "We recognize that people want to build bigger houses. But 
it's apparent that the current guidelines are not working." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the 70 homeowners who attended a Monday night meeting to 
discuss the plan applauded the board's efforts to address the problem, several 
complained that the guidelines hampered their ability to expand their own 
properties. In addition, they said, the plan offered no guidelines for specific 
neighborhoods, where in some cases large two-story homes would not be out of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the property owners also expressed concern that the proposed 
restrictions would make potential buyers wary and might lower home values. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the homeowners agreed unanimously that some stricter guidelines were 
necessary to stem the wave of "mansionizing" plaguing communities throughout 
Los Angeles County and particularly in the affluent areas of the Westside, such 
as Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the plan is approved, a homeowner with a 5,000-square-foot lot 
would be limited to a 3,400-square-foot house. The biggest home allowed on a 
10,000-square-foot lot would be 4,800 square feet. The guidelines also call for 
a maximum second-story addition of 800 square feet plus 12% of the lot area. 
</P>
<P>
Current guidelines, approved by the board last year, restrict the height of 
houses to 32 feet. But there are no other restrictions on the size of new and 
remodeled homes, and several developers have been tearing down existing homes 
and building massive houses that nearly fill the lot. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the trend toward erecting huge homes has forced 
city councils and planning boards throughout the Los Angeles County to begin 
grappling with the difficult issue of size restrictions for single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission is studying a proposal to place a 
25-foot height limit on house lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Homes on 
lots of up to 15,000 square feet would have a height limit of 35 feet. In the 
city of Los Angeles, the height limit for all single-family homes is now 45 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The palisades civic league's proposed guidelines are similar to restrictions 
studied by the city of Beverly Hills, where officials are looking at a cap of 
1,500 square feet for homes on small lots plus 35% of the lot size. Two years 
ago the Beverly Hills City Council adopted a temporary ordinance limiting the 
size of houses to 55% of lot size and made the ordinance permanent last June to 
allow the Planning Commission more time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The palisades board is responsible for design and building guidelines for about 
60% of the commercial and residential property in the community, with the rest 
governed by private deeds. In some areas, there are no restrictions at all. 
</P>
<P>
However, one neighbor complained that restrictions would be almost impossible 
to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like gun control," said the man, who declined to give his name. "You can 
pass any laws that you want but, unless you enforce them, people just (flout) 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The civic league maintains that it can seek a court injunction to stop any 
construction that doesn't conform to its guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that the guidelines may be altered slightly before the board votes 
on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think these guidelines are flexible," Gordon said. "If we don't provide 
something that is reasonable, then we will find a bunch of people who just 
choose to ignore them. We just need to get some guidelines in place, and then 
we can refine them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUILDING GUIDELINES 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Palisades Civic League is expected to vote on a plan later this 
month to curb the rash of massive homes being built in the community. The 
proposal would: 
</P>
<P>
* Set a maximum single-family house size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the 
lot size. 
</P>
<P>
* Restrict the height of new and remodeled homes to 28 feet. Current guidelines 
restrict heights to 32 feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit second-story additions to a maxiumum of 800 square feet plus 12% of the 
lot area.

STUDENT BRIGADE ATTACKS GRAFFITI; 
</P>
<P>
TEENS PAINT WALLS, INSTILL SCHOOL PRIDE AT SANTA MONICA HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every weekend school officials open the doors to Santa Monica High School and 
allow several tough, street-smart students to put their mark on the 
graffiti-covered walls of the high school bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in paint-smeared overalls, the students make their mark by painting out 
the various tags and messages scrawled on bathroom ceilings and walls by 
various campus factions -- from Malibu surfers to Santa Monica street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the student volunteers have worked to remove graffiti from five 
campus bathrooms as part of an effort to encourage campus pride. 
</P>
<P>
And school officials say they are having more success keeping the graffiti out 
by using student volunteers than by having district painters remove it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finding out that it is not just a process of painting out bathrooms, 
but changing attitudes," said Mike Escalante, a vice principal at Santa Monica 
High School. "Kids listen to other kids, and peer pressure is a much stronger 
tool to change attitudes. If they don't write on their bedroom walls, they 
shouldn't write on their school walls." 
</P>
<P>
There are no figures on the exact cost of graffiti at Santa Monica High School, 
but Escalante estimates that it takes hundreds of hours to remove it from the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, the student volunteers remove the graffiti and 
encourage friends and other students not to put it back. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Garcia, a 17-year-old junior, said that part of the problem is that 
students don't show the same respect when district employees remove paint from 
the bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"When they paint the bathrooms, the graffiti is back before the paint dries," 
he said. "That doesn't happen with us. When I paint, I feel like it's my work 
and to paint over it would be to disrespect me. I would have to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he understands why many students write graffiti on walls, because 
he once did it himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never a heavy writer," he explained. "It is something that is easy to 
get into, especially if your friends are doing it. You see something your 
friend wrote and you want to write something too. It goes on from there." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he hopes that by volunteering his time the cycle will be broken. 
"People need to learn that it is destructive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the program has received paint from the city and about $300 from the 
PTA for lunches and work clothes for the students. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the union representing the district's painters complained that the 
student volunteers were infringing on its turf, but it refused to press the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me if the painting of the schools should be done by our unit, I 
would say yes, but I do not hear any opposition to it," said Lacy Goode, chief 
spokesman for the classified employees union. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the district only has two full-time painters and they are 
usually swamped. 
</P>
<P>
And school officials seem more than willing to appeal to students to resolve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to an issue like graffiti, the students run the school," said 
Frank Estrada, a high school custodian who helped organize the program. 
</P>
<P>
And the program has benefits for the students too. "Some of the students would 
not be going to school if it were not for this program," Escalante said. "They 
are giving up their time, but the sense of pride and respect they get back is 
tremendous. It is a first step for many of them. And before you can develop all 
the tools to be successful, you have to have pride in yourself. That is where 
we are at." 
</P>
<P>
The students say it has not been easy explaining their volunteer jobs to their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"The first question is how much do we get paid," said Michael McKenna, an 
18-year-old senior. "This is not something we do for money, this is something 
we started and we want to make sure that we finish it."

SCIENCE, CONSERVATION AND THE LAW MAY STEM DECLINE OF THE VENTURA RIVER, ONCE 
LEGENDARY FOR ITS TROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long gone are the days when hotels reserved entire floors for out-of-town 
fishermen tempted by the thousands of steelhead that could be seen splashing in 
the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has passed the time when a tourist guide could gush, as one did in 
1911, that "a fine stream flows into the ocean at the west end of the city, and 
from May to October the breakfast tables of Ventura need never go troutless." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, dams, diversions, mining and pollution have battered the 
once-bountiful river, from its convergence with Matilija Creek 16 miles north 
to the brackish lagoon at its mouth near the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Left in between are countless stretches of parched stone, bulldozer-scarred 
banks and no more than 100 of the legendary seagoing steelhead trout. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a growing wave of interest in the river is beginning to stem that tide of 
decay. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of an ambitious four-year study of the lower river and tidal 
estuary being conducted by the University of California, Santa Barbara, is 
expected to be completed this summer. Researchers hope that the report, which 
is the first attempt to analyze plants, soil, and water quality in the area, 
will eventually persuade state officials to preserve the river's mouth as a 
wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, environmental groups are rallying to challenge a sand and gravel 
company's application to continue mining from 50,000 to 250,000 tons annually 
from the river bed about 1 1/2 miles upstream. Last week, those groups 
expressed their concerns in a meeting with Ventura County planning officials, 
who will require the Southern Pacific Milling Co. to undergo an environmental 
review later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the river were also buoyed last summer when the California Supreme 
Court rejected a proposed agreement between Ventura and the Casitas Municipal 
Water District to divert part of the stream as reserve for use in a drought. 
The court ruled that, even though officials had vowed to limit any ecological 
damage, the loss of water would probably decimate the few remaining trout. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing is to pass on to the public that this isn't 
just a stagnant puddle of water with no value," said Wayne R. Ferren Jr., 
curator of the UCSB Herbarium and coordinator of the university's study. "A lot 
of people don't realize that they have a gem in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for people accustomed to seeing rushing water in their rivers, the 
Ventura might seem more like a lump of coal. Low stream flow, exacerbated by 
three years of drought, makes walking long stretches of the river bed in tennis 
shoes a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The natural beauty is not enhanced by the industrial plants and oil fields that 
line its banks where the river parallels Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
High above, in the Ojai Valley, the Matilija Dam, a 152-foot-high concrete 
monolith built in 1948, holds back the flow that once made the stream the 
world's second-most-prolific trout habitat, behind the Santa Ynez River in 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
But for all that, the Ventura River has shown remarkable resiliency. Fed by 
four mountain creeks, it has still managed to sustain abundant plant and animal 
life. Idyllic nooks dot the stream's length. And its lower stretches are among 
only 25% of the state's coastal wetlands that have managed so far to survive 
20th-Century development. 
</P>
<P>
In the 200-acre area being studied by UCSB, more than 30 different vegetation 
types have been identified, including salt marshes, black cottonwood forests, 
intertidal cobble zones and riparian scrub. At least 230 plant species have 
been noted, including the California walnut, pickle weed, salt grass and 
bulrush. About 200 bird species have been spotted, including snowy egrets, 
Virginia rails, merlins and ruddy turnstones. 
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers bathe the dunes near the ocean in splashes of lavender and yellow. 
Flocks of red-winged blackbirds stir up a ruckus in the tall reeds. Flowering 
green duckweed floats on the surface of small tidal pools near the river's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"If your measure of health is a river loaded with 10-pound fish, then obviously 
this river is not very healthy," said Mark Capelli, executive director of the 
1,700-member Friends of the Ventura River. "But there are a lot of other 
resources -- maybe a bit more subtle -- that show the river is still enormously 
vigorous." 
</P>
<P>
UCSB researchers intend to make those resources more overt. In June, they will 
deliver a report that state officials paid $4,000 for, cataloguing plant life 
in the surrounding Emma Wood State Beach wetlands. With other grants, they will 
publish a final survey in 1990 recommending various methods of restoring and 
maintaining the ecologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
The project, they hope, will lead to greater appreciation of the lower river 
and its estuary, as well as to the creation of nature trails, guide books and 
informational maps. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just nothing indicating to the public the value of the site," Ferren 
said. "And the more enlightened the public is about our resources, the more 
protection we'll have for them." 
</P>
<P>
The stream has been lacking protection ever since Sebastian Vizcaino, the 
Spanish explorer, was invited ashore in the early 17th Century by an old man 
who urged, he wrote in his journal, that "we must go to his land, where they 
would give us much food and water, for there was a river." 
</P>
<P>
Vizcaino was followed 100 years later by the Franciscan padres, who founded the 
San Buenaventura Mission near the mouth of the river in 1782 and soon began 
diverting drinking water with the help of a six-mile-long wooden aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Trauma 
</P>
<P>
The river, which for thousands of years had sustained the Chumash Indians, 
suffered another blow when oil was discovered at the west end of the city in 
1916. For years, during the first heavy rain of the season, the oil companies 
used the waters to rinse their holding ponds of drilling-mud and brine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, through World War II, the Ventura River supported a substantial 
steelhead population, estimated to have been as high as 4,000 or 5,000 fish. A 
1911 newspaper reported a hefty trout caught by one George Pacheco that 
measured three feet and weighed 14 pounds. Fishermen, who competed in annual 
contests sponsored by sporting goods stores, lined up by the hundreds for the 
season's opening day. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the Matilija Dam was built 40 years ago to reduce flood hazards 
and provide additional water for neighboring communities that the trout stock 
began to disappear. The Casitas Dam, built in 1959 about 6 1/2 miles from the 
river's mouth, sounded the death knell. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more environmental hazards have been faced, including the Oak View 
Sanitation District's sewage facility, which discharges treated effluent about 
4 1/2 miles above the river's mouth; a now-defunct Shell Oil Co. chemical 
plant, which was found guilty of dumping ammonia in the river in 1972; and 
Southern Pacific Milling Co., which began its mining operation in the river bed 
and surrounding flood plain in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura River represents, one way or another, just about everything man 
can do to degrade a natural environment," said Charlie Price, president of 
Friends of the Ventura River and a former county Fish and Game Commissioner. 
"It's been a steady, long-term deterioration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped by Court 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the river has begun winning its battles. Perhaps the most 
significant was the ruling last August by the state Supreme Court upholding an 
Appellate Court decision that blocked a proposed diversion of the stream. 
</P>
<P>
Water-pinched Ventura had sought to protect itself from drought by allowing the 
Casitas Municipal Water District to divert more water than it normally does 
from facilities upstream. In return, Ventura, which itself extracts about 6,000 
acre-feet a year, or about 25% of its total water supply, would be guaranteed 
that amount by Casitas even in dry years. 
</P>
<P>
The city and Casitas pledged to carefully monitor the arrangement and "take 
appropriate measures" if significant environmental problems were to arise. They 
also agreed to maintain a minimum stream flow of one cubic foot per second in 
the 1.5-mile "Live Stretch," a leg of the river above Foster Park that is one 
of the few segments that enjoys year-round flow. 
</P>
<P>
But Friends of the Ventura River, contending that the plan would decimate the 
few trout that remain in the stream, filed suit in 1984 against the city and 
water district. In a harshly worded June, 1988, ruling, the Second Appellate 
Court agreed: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wishful Thinking' 
</P>
<P>
"The record reveals that it is mere wishful thinking that a one 
cubic-foot-per-second flow, coupled with monitoring and a vague promise to 
intercede if disaster strikes, would substantially lessen the impending peril 
that faces the steelhead under this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, without substantially increased stream flows, it would also be 
wishful thinking to assume that more than 100 trout will ever manage to survive 
in the river. As long as water remains scarce, say environmentalists, it will 
be difficult to persuade officials to release the necessary quantities to 
support more fish. 
</P>
<P>
But if the river can just avoid additional setbacks, they say, there is hope 
that it can still be returned to a far more vital stream. Drawing from a 
watershed that drains 228 square miles, much of it wilderness, the river, if 
given a chance, will always be able to rejuvenate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I've never lost faith," said Capelli, executive director of Friends 
of the Ventura River. "All you have to do is leave it alone for a while, and it 
will restore itself. Mother Nature doesn't give up very easily."

W. HOLLYWOOD BOND DEBATE FOCUSES ON CAMPAIGN BROCHURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders on both sides swapped accusations this week in the debate over whether 
to approve a $7.6-million bond issue to build a new library and fire station in 
West Hollywood. The issue will be decided in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Larkin, a leading opponent of the proposal, questioned City Councilman Paul 
Koretz's role in the circulation of a brochure endorsing the measure. Larkin 
called the brochure misleading and accused Koretz of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's misleading when a Democratic slate mailer represents itself as 
supporting the bond issue when the West Hollywood Democratic Club has voted 
overwhelmingly to oppose it," Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solicited Inclusion 
</P>
<P>
He attacked Koretz, who designed the brochure sent to about 6,000 registered 
Democrats, by saying: "It doesn't seem appropriate any time you have one 
council member giving money to another council member to promote the interest 
of one side on such a crucial issue." 
</P>
<P>
Larkin was referring to Councilman John Heilman, who is treasurer of a group 
supporting the measure. The group, called West Hollywood Citizens for 
Proposition A, solicited its inclusion in the mailer, which promoted candidates 
in races for the local school board and the Los Angeles County Community 
College District board. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz dismissed the accusations as "absurd," saying his only connection with 
the brochure was as a graphic designer. "That's what I do for a living," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz went on: "I obviously don't believe there is a conflict promoting 
something I'm on record as supporting." Of the five City Council members, only 
Councilman Steve Schulte is opposed to the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said neither Heilman nor anyone else discussed financial arrangements 
involving the mailer with him. "I work as an independent contractor for a 
variety of people -- including, in this case, a part-time political consultant 
who was the person putting out this mailing," he said. "I wouldn't have been 
the person to approach about money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critic a Republican 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said that to his knowledge the group had paid no money for inclusion in 
the brochure. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was "absolutely nothing inappropriate about the brochure. . . . 
It doesn't pretend to represent an official Democratic Party position with 
respect to the candidates it endorses or the bond issue. It's a slate mailer 
pure and simple, of the variety that is very common." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems strange that a conservative Republican like Tom Larkin should be 
concerned that somehow the West Hollywood Democratic Club might be offended for 
any reason, especially when it involves a piece of mail he hasn't even seen," 
Koretz said. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, a Republican who finished sixth in a field of 10 candidates when he ran 
for the City Council in 1986, has been singled out recently by supporters of 
the bond issue, who have criticized opponents for using the issue to try to 
undermine the council's pro-rent control majority. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman called Larkin's accusation about the mailer "crazy," saying: "He knows 
there's nothing wrong with a bond committee paying for a slate mailer to go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Heilman, Mayor Helen Albert and Schulte have hinted that they may not seek 
reelection when their terms expire next year. Heilman and other supporters of 
the bond measure have accused landlords of using opposition to the measure as a 
springboard for a possible bid to take over the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
He and other supporters point out that of the $4,500 raised by Fair 
Representation for West Hollywood -- a group whose organizers include Larkin 
and Schulte -- $1,500 came from the Greater Los Angeles Apartment Assn., a 
landlord group, and $2,500 from West Hollywood Concerned Citizens, many of 
whose members are landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opponents of the bond issue have criticized supporters for not 
disclosing the source of their funds. 
</P>
<P>
"They're obviously getting money from somewhere," Larkin said. "We'd like to 
know from where." 
</P>
<P>
He and Schulte have been especially upset that supporters have sought to cast 
the bond issue, and the debate over the city's long-awaited civic center, as a 
rent control issue. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman, Albert and Councilwoman Abbe Land are on the steering committee of the 
Coalition for Economic Survival, an influential renters' rights group that has 
endorsed the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Heilman declined to name any individuals or groups who have 
donated to West Hollywood Citizens for Proposition A, saying: "We will 
certainly disclose the list of our contributors as we are required to do under 
the law. . . . There's nothing mysterious or secretive about it." 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure would increase property taxes by up to $33.47 per 
$100,000 of assessed valuation over the next 20 years. The money would be used 
to replace a single-engine fire station that officials say is seismically 
unsafe and quadruple the size of the county branch library that serves West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But if opponents have their way, the election will also serve as a referendum 
on the civic center. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the bond issue represents a "down payment on the civic center," 
they say the measure is a transparent attempt to get more money for the 
project. The library and fire station were originally included in plans for the 
civic center. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by plans to use scarce park space to build what has derisively been 
referred to as a "Taj Mahal" and what Schulte has labeled "the B-1 Bomber of 
West Hollywood," opponents argue that the city should dip into its $14-million 
reserve fund to pay for the fire station and library and let the voters decide 
whether the civic center should be built.

<P>
However, supporters of both the civic center and the bond measure say it is 
inappropriate to use the city's reserves for county-owned facilities. They say 
the center, including a city hall, is desperately needed and that the $650,000 
a year West Hollywood pays to rent City Hall space is wasted money. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters insist that delaying construction of the center will only add to its 
cost. In addition, they point out that city officials have already budgeted 
$1.5 million for civic center planning this fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the architects, a project engineer has been on the job for several 
months, and preliminary design work and site surveying continues. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles County provides library and fire services to West 
Hollywood, county funds are not available to replace either the fire station or 
the library, officials have said.

ASSAULT GUN SALES BAN WINS INITIAL OK IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONG BEACH-The city this week took steps to join the list of Los Angeles County 
communities that have outlawed the sale of rapid-fire assault weapons in the 
wake of the schoolyard slayings of five Stockton school children by a gunman 
firing a semiautomatic AK-47 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after two of its committees voted to shelve the proposal, the 
City Council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance banning the local sale 
of the military-style guns, increasingly used in drive-by gang shootings that 
often claim the lives of people who are not gang members. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to more than two hours of testimony from a parade of opponents 
and proponents, the council voted 8 to 1 in favor of the ban, even while 
terming it a weak law that does not go as far as those recently adopted in a 
number of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possession Legal 
</P>
<P>
While the ordinance would make it illegal to sell the weapons, it does not 
outlaw their possession -- as do ordinances passed by Los Angeles, Compton, 
Whittier and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
The chief council proponents of the ban seemed content to restrict the 
prohibition to sales, a measure more easily enforced and less volatile than one 
that would require existing gun owners to give up their assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gun owners nonetheless condemned the ban as a dangerous first step toward total 
gun control. They insisted law-abiding citizens have a right to buy the weapons 
to protect themselves against criminals and terrorists, and argued that the 
measure would do nothing to thwart random gang shootings involving 
semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion it is nothing short of idiocy. . . . It can't possibly work," 
said Gene Snyder, one of 30 people who spoke against the ordinance at Tuesday's 
council meeting. "It's an emotional knee-jerk reaction to the publicity in the 
newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of council members who were expecting opponents to far 
outnumber supporters, nearly as many people spoke in favor of the measure as 
spoke against it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a step in the right direction," said Frank Berry, president of 
the Long Beach branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. Berry and others argued that whatever rights people have to buy 
semiautomatic weapons are outweighed by the right to live in a peaceful 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize when the rights of some should be given more consideration over 
the rights of others," said Berry, one of 26 people to testify in favor of the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg, who cast the only vote against the ordinance, 
said he was opposing it, not because he favored assault weapons, but because he 
thought the ban would be ineffective. Statewide legislation is the answer, not 
a local ordinance, Kellogg insisted. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Les Robbins, who last month voted with Kellogg not to draft an 
anti-assault weapon ordinance, this week voted to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I thought about it, the more I thought there are a significant 
majority of people out there, who say, 'Assault rifles, who needs them?' " 
Robbins said after his vote. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas J. Clark indicated that the council was probably satisfied 
just to ban sales -- rather than the possession -- of military-type weapons 
because members assumed statewide legislation will soon be enacted, overriding 
any local bans. "We were making a statement. We feel there's a good chance this 
will be moot," commented Clark, who said the ordinance was "about the weakest 
you could have" and still show support of a state ban. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which would go into effect 31 days after final approval, makes 
it a misdemeanor to sell semiautomatic rifles with a detachable magazine 
capacity of 20 rounds or more, including such guns as the AK-47, Uzi, Colt 
AR-15 and the Beretta AR-70. The sale of shotguns with a folding stock or 
magazine capacity of more than six rounds is also forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. John R. Calhoun, who drafted the measure, said it was modeled after 
other cities' ordinances, making it more likely that the Long Beach law would 
be affected by court rulings either upholding or overturning the legality of 
local bans. 
</P>
<P>
While the state has clearly preempted the authority to regulate the licensing 
and registration of firearms, precluding cities from doing so, Calhoun said 
state law is considerably murkier when it comes to the regulation of the sales 
and possession of firearms, leaving the door open for a local ordinance.

WHITTIER UNDETERRED BY LEGAL SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
SEARCH FOR ADULT-BUSINESS LAW CONTINUES 
</P>

<P>
Only hours after the city lost its last legal fight over the constitutionality 
of an ordinance regulating X-rated businesses, City Manager Thomas G. Mauk was 
enthusiastically talking about a new way to keep adult entertainment out of 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was and continues to be an important issue in this community," Mauk 
said of the battle that began 12 years ago, after the Pussycat Theater in 
Uptown Whittier began screening adult movies. "I think we'll come right back 
with some recommendations for a new ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Rebuffed 
</P>
<P>
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider Whittier's appeal of a 
federal court ruling that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it would 
have effectively forced the city's adult businesses out of town. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, when the City Council first passed the ordinance, there were about 15 
adult businesses in Whittier. Now, there are none. The Pussycat, the last 
remaining X-rated business, closed after being damaged in the October, 1987, 
earthquake and its owners say it will switch to general audience movies when it 
reopens in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Whittier officials are determined to continue the battle that has cost the 
city close to $500,000 in legal fees. Mayor Victor A. Lopez says it is 
important to keep Whittier, a 101-year-old city with Quaker roots, "free of 
those kinds of things" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got eight grandkids here and I want this to be a nice place for them to 
live," Lopez said. "I'm ready to fight for this principle. . . . People have 
died for a lot less principle than that." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Coda, president of theater owner Walnut Properties Inc., called the 
battle "a total waste of taxpayers' money." Whittier has spent about $300,000 
on the case, and the Supreme Court's decision means the city will also have to 
pay Walnut's court costs of $150,000 to $200,000, Mauk said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to go more, more, more?" Coda asked when told of Whittier's plans 
for a new adult business ordinance. "Why don't they just forget about it and 
use the money to improve their city?" 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a zoning ordinance that would have prohibited businesses from 
selling sexually explicit material within 1,000 feet of churches or schools and 
within 500 feet of residences. The City Council passed the ordinance in 1977 
after Walnut Properties bought the old Wardman Theater in the heart of the 
Uptown business district and began showing movies that included "Take My Body" 
and "Things My Mother Taught Me." 
</P>
<P>
Such risque fare raised the eyebrows and the ire of local residents, some of 
whom began picketing the theater. The ordinance passed by the City Council 
would have forced the Pussycat to move since it is within one block of four 
churches, and would have affected another 15 or so adult businesses in town 
during the late 1970s. The other businesses either closed or moved in the four 
or five years after the City Council adopted the adult business ordinance, Mauk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Properties, which owns a statewide chain of adult theaters, immediately 
sued to block enforcement of the ordinance, beginning a legal battle that ended 
Monday when the Supreme Court refused to consider the case. The refusal meant a 
1988 U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court ruling invalidating the ordinance 
will stand. 
</P>
<P>
"We are thrilled to death," Coda said. "It's a victory not just for Walnut 
Properties, but for the people who choose to go into an adult theater." 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Properties officials believed they were through fighting Whittier in 
1985, when a panel of 9th Circuit Court judges decided the ordinance was 
unconstitutional because the city did not provide justification for the 
1,000-foot limit. But in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a similar case 
involving the Seattle suburb of Renton and decided that such limits were 
constitutional as long as there were alternate sites for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court, ordered to reconsider Whittier's ordinance in light of the 
Renton decision, found a "glaring" absence of alternate sites in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only does it effectively deny (the theater owner) a reasonable opportunity 
to open and operate an adult theater within the city," the 9th Circuit Court 
opinion said, "but it also would force the closure of all adult businesses 
existing at the time the ordinance was passed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Ordinance Mulled 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Mauk said Whittier may now try to regulate adult businesses 
through an ordinance that would require owners to obtain a special permit from 
the City Council. The new ordinance would include the 1,000-foot limit upheld 
in the Renton case, Mauk said, but would increase the number of alternate sites 
for adult businesses by allowing exceptions through a special permit. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Properties attorney Stanley Fleishman predicted that such an ordinance 
would be rejected by the courts. "What they're trying to do is say there will 
not be any adult businesses in the city of Whittier," Fleishman said. "The 
reason they keep on failing (in court) is because they're trying to do what 
they're not allowed to do constitutionally." 
</P>
<P>
Although Walnut's court challenges have kept Whittier from enforcing its adult 
business ordinance, Fleishman noted that the controversy has accomplished what 
the city set out to do. 
</P>
<P>
The legal fight is "not just a waste of money," Fleishman said. "They have 
driven everybody out."

COUNCIL TO DECIDE CASES WHEN PLANNERS CAN'T VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier City Council has approved an ordinance to handle cases in which 
the Planning Commission is unable to vote because it lacks a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance came about after a recent Planning Commission meeting in which 
three of five commissioners disqualified themselves because of a potential 
conflict of interest. The disqualifications came when the commission was 
scheduled to vote on a controversial proposal to limit apartment construction 
north of the Uptown Village business district. The commissioners who 
disqualified themselves own property in or near the area that would be affected 
by the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, the planning director will report the lack of a quorum 
to the city manager, who will then refer the matter to the City Council for a 
vote. The City Council is scheduled to vote on the apartment construction issue 
Tuesday.

BIG ROCK MESA SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement has been reached among Los Angeles County, Caltrans, 16 Malibu 
homeowners and their insurance companies over a 1983 landslide on Big Rock 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners, who were not part of a larger settlement involving 238 other 
homeowners, settled for amounts ranging from $200,000 to $250,000, less court 
costs and attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of the homeowners, who were called the "strays" in the legal battle 
over the landslide, owned properties on the ocean side of Pacific Coast 
Highway, whereas the 238 homeowners who reached a $97-million settlement in 
January live above them on the mountain side.

PRAIRIE SPIRIT;

<P>
CHORAL MASS CELEBRATES HERITAGE OF THE GREAT PLAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melanie McCoy's love for the Great Plains began at the age of 4 when she would 
sneak out to her family's cow pasture each evening as the sun began to set and 
"introduce myself to God." 
</P>
<P>
"I would dance around on the hillside, singing songs to the cattle, the horses, 
the buffalo and the Indians," remembered McCoy, a 10-year resident of Simi 
Valley whose devotion to the Great Plains and its people is celebrated in her 
orchestral and chorale work, "The Heritage Mass, Prayer for the Children of the 
Prairies." The Mass will be performed by the Moorpark Masterworks Chorale at 8 
p.m. Saturday at St. John Baptist de la Salle Church in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The work also will be featured at the International Church Music Festival in 
Kristiansand, Norway, in May, 1990, and musicians in New York and Australia 
have expressed interest in staging it too, McCoy said. The Masterworks Chorale 
performed a portion of the Mass while on a 1987 European tour, and the entire 
chorale and orchestral Mass premiered last year in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspirational Memory 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's memory of dancing before God, celebrating all that was life just as the 
Plains Indians did in their ceremonial dances, prompted the composition. 
</P>
<P>
"With Native Americans, there is never a feeling of separation from the Great 
Spirit," said McCoy, who is one-eighth Cherokee. "That's what the Mass is 
about, a tribute not only to my Indian ancestors but to my non-Indian ancestors 
who came to Kansas by way of covered wagon. It is a tribute to anyone who grew 
up out on the Great Plains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a harsh environment for everyone, from Indians who were moved to it or 
from it, to the farmers and ranchers. It is not an easy country. It took very 
special people to stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
That pioneer spirit of sticking it out applies to McCoy, who worked for more 
than three years on the 45-minute piece. It contains harmonies, rhythms and 
prayers from American Indian cultures and is accented with the tom-tom, the 
turkey-bone whistle and ceremonial ankle bells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart of the Plains 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, 42, grew up in Coldwater, Kan., in the heart of the Great Plains, near 
the Oklahoma border. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Indian heritage was always quite important to my family," she said, "and 
it was something I learned from both my grandmothers and my mother. Tidbits of 
information would float down to me, and I remember being told, 'If you're 
Indian, you don't behave in that manner.' " 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a surgeon and an English teacher, McCoy began piano lessons at 
age 7, clarinet lessons at 9 and voice lessons at 11. She continued to pursue 
all of that at the University of Kansas. Much of her inspiration came from her 
piano and voice teacher, Leda King, a former mezzo-soprano soloist with the San 
Francisco Opera who settled "by the grace of God" in Coldwater, a prairie town 
of 1000 people, McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, after hearing a concert by the Masterworks Chorale, McCoy 
approached director James Stemen about her Mass. His encouragement led to her 
reorchestration of the piece, to lighten it so the chorale singers could be 
heard over the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Work 
</P>
<P>
McCoy has written other works, including a musical score for a cable television 
movie for which she was awarded the Bronze Halo by the Southern California 
Motion Picture Council, and a children's musical for public television. 
</P>
<P>
But the Heritage Mass has consumed her, entailing extensive research into 
Indian music. 
</P>
<P>
"I began writing the music and then I thought that I had better make sure I was 
doing it right. I found out I was doing it right, doing it automatically, 
probably from all those Indian chants I had heard while I was growing up. . . . 
There was this music in me and I had to write it down. Maybe somewhere in all 
of this, I'll get paid for what I do."

STOWERS STUDENTS ON SAFARI, READING WITH THE ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the outside, Stowers Elementary School in Cerritos looks no different than 
the other elementary schools in the ABC Unified School District. But inside, 
the school has been turned into a jungle. Cheetahs, zebras, gorillas, tigers 
and other wild animals and exotic vegetation created in crepe paper leap from 
the walls of classrooms, the library and administration buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 600 students at the school are on an African reading safari, aimed 
at stimulating them to read. It started March 2 with a visit to the campus by 
an ocelot, and will end May 26 with a "read-in" in a tent, a barbecue and rides 
on an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The student body has been challenged to read a total of 1 million extra minutes 
by the end of the expedition. Homework assignments do not count. Parents keep 
track of outside reading and report the results to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students earn "reading tracks" or paw prints. Kindergarten through third-grade 
pupils earn one paw print for 90 minutes of reading and fourth- through 
sixth-grade students earn one for 180 minutes. Paw prints cover the walls and 
ceilings of the school. Students who have earned 25 tracks get their pictures 
posted in the principal's office. Students receive prizes that include pizzas 
and trips to Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone participates -- students, teachers, librarians and administrators. 
Whenever jungle music is heard over the intercom system, everyone drops 
whatever they are doing to read something other than assignments. On Fridays, 
students and teachers wear jungle attire to get in the reading mood. 
</P>
<P>
The school scores above district and state averages on the state reading tests, 
and Principal Decla Johnson says she wants the students to do even better. 
Johnson said she hopes the students will develop a lifelong love for reading. 
</P>
<P>
"We have kids addicted to reading," said Johnson, who wore snake earrings, a 
giraffe necklace and a blouse covered with zebras and jungle flowers.

SCOPE: BEING DISABLED DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN THE END OF ARTISTIC CREATIVITY, IT 
JUST MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR STUDENTS IN A SPECIAL CLASS IN LAKEWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Barbara Davenport always liked working with her hands. She worked years ago as 
a cosmetologist, and owned a wig and beauty shop. "I couldn't read, write or 
spell, but boy . . . I sure could use my hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She speaks in past tense because an automobile accident 13 years ago severed 
her spine, leaving her a quadriplegic and ending her career. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who was in her early 30s at the time, thought her artistic talents 
also had been severed. But Oil Painting for the Physically Challenged, a 
monthly art class in Lakewood offered to the disabled, has enabled her to paint 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been painting for three or four years. I love it, I just love it," she 
said, her green eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
As many as six regular students attend the three-hour class, which meets the 
second Monday of each month at 1 p.m. in the A-frame building at Maywood Park 
in Lakewood. Most are paraplegics and quadriplegics who hold the paintbrushes 
in their mouths when they paint. 
</P>
<P>
"I am able to create and be artistically creative," Davenport said. "Losing my 
hands just cut down my creativity a little." 
</P>
<P>
The class was founded four years ago by Lakewood resident Bernita Wallar, an 
occupational therapist in private practice. For Wallar, witnessing Davenport's 
accomplishments is proof that "it can be done if you have the desire." But the 
painting process is time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
A foot-high pole, holding a tray with an assortment of brushes, is attached to 
the wheelchair, the brushes at mouth level. Taped to every brush is a stick 
with a rubberized grip at one end that is guided by the tongue. A specially 
designed easel, which can hold canvasses of various sizes, is positioned on top 
of the wheelchair armrest in front of the painter. The artists use oil paint 
because it does not dry as quickly nor run as readily as watercolor paints. 
</P>
<P>
At first, artists often have sore muscles after continuously using jaw and neck 
muscles to paint. But the completed work is worth the effort, Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never drawn an animal before in my life," said Davenport. "Here, I did 
it. I never did a still life. Here, I did daisies. It is such a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest challenge was painting a chipmunk's fur to resemble the full, bushy 
textured appearance of the real animal. It took a year to complete. "I was so 
sick of it," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The participants are assisted by volunteers, mostly members of the Lakewood 
Artist Guild, an organization of Southeast-area artists that also donates the 
art supplies. Wallar said more volunteers are needed, and art experience is not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Wallar was encouraged to set up the program by Jean Cook, a quadriplegic who 
had begun painting in 1964. They met a few years ago at an Artist Guild 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in a rest home for 15 years. It (art) filled a lot of my hours," said 
Cook, who contracted polio as a child. "A lot of people who are disabled don't 
do anything. They just sit around. . . . When they see that I can do it, anyone 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Another participant, Barbara Blake, paints by hand, but her movements have been 
restricted by cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent session, Blake was adding a few trees to finish a mountain scene. 
Billie Greer, a volunteer, gently held onto Blake's brush and attempted to 
guide it toward the proper spot, but Blake's hands and arms involuntarily 
resisted -- jerking and straining in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
"One, two, three, four, five . . ." Blake counted while resting before trying 
again. The attempt was successful, and her pride was evident. 
</P>
<P>
Blake and her husband, Robert, run a computer graphic greeting card business at 
home. She attends Oil Painting for the Physically Challenged when her schedule 
permits. Adhered to the back of her wheelchair is a sticker that reads: "Acting 
crazy is the only thing that keeps me sane." 
</P>
<P>
Her volunteer helper, Greer, also was encouraged by Blake's successful attempt 
to finish the painting. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here is very rewarding," Greer said. "I'm the one who goes home 
satisfied."

CITY MANAGER OBJECTS TO DEFAULT STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While we in the City of Compton usually appreciate the coverage we receive from 
the Los Angeles Times, I must take strong exception to last Thursday's story 
("Compton Transit Center Builder Declared in Default," March 30) on our new 
Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly the tone of the story made it seem as if city officials have 
been at the least naive and at the worst negligent in our dealings with Dalton 
Construction Co., the developer of the transit center. For your information, 
Dalton is a local minority developer with more than a 30-year history of 
developing projects. He has recently completed two major projects for the city, 
namely, the combined state-of-the-art Fire Station No. 3 and James H. Shern 
Training Academy, and the Dollarhide Senior Center. He has also completed two 
housing projects within the city. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Dalton has a proven track record. That, following careful 
consideration, we chose to issue a notice of default to Dalton only means that 
he is tardy in completion of the transit center and should take all possible 
measures to get back on track. We took this measure to protect ourselves, a 
normal procedure in this business. Part of the transit center is already open, 
having been rented by the U.S. Census Bureau which, incidentally, will soon be 
providing more than 700 jobs for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
Your story also reported that I would not respond to questions about whether 
the CRA had "properly monitored Dalton's progress." In fact, I said that we had 
an on-site construction manager as well as a project architect from the firm of 
Edward C. Barker &amp; Associates who, from the beginning of construction, 
monitored project activity on a daily and twice-weekly basis respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, you should be aware that it is our practice to keep City Council 
members fully apprised of development activity on an ongoing basis. 
</P>
<P>
Although Compton is not without problems, there are a number of positive 
activities going on here. Out of 16 major projects under way in Compton, we 
have successfully completed 12 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, your newspaper did not devote any space to the several hundred 
employees, community residents and young people who volunteered their time on 
March 11 to paint out almost all of the graffiti in Compton. We believe that 
such inspirational activities are the rule here, rather than the exception, and 
certainly worthy of your coverage.

WOO TO RETRACT ENDORSEMENT LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo's reelection campaign has mailed out 2,000 
copies of what appears to be a letter of endorsement by the Studio City 
Residents Assn., even though the group is not supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was printed under the group's letterhead and over the signature of 
its president, Polly Ward. After Ward complained Friday, the campaign agreed to 
send retractions to the recipients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glowing Review 
</P>
<P>
Ward said Woo had asked for an endorsement, but she approved only the use of a 
letter from her as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, mailed last Thursday, contained a glowing review of Woo's work 
since his 13th District was redrawn two years ago to include Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
It concluded with what appeared to be Ward's signature. However, she said she 
hadn't signed -- or seen -- a final version after a draft was read to her over 
the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"The Studio City Residents Assn. heading on it implied the association was 
sending the letter, and it was signed by me as president," Ward said. "I can't 
tell you what I said when I got the letter yesterday at my house." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said it is against state law for her association to endorse candidates 
because it has a nonprofit, tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
Woo apologized to her Friday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman was unavailable for comment. A spokeswoman pinned the mix-up on 
the campaign manager, Steve Afriat. 
</P>
<P>
"I misunderstood my instructions," said Afriat, a political consultant. "My 
understanding was that because it was a letter from Polly, we could use her 
letterhead." 
</P>
<P>
When Ward was not available to give him a proper letterhead, "We kind of mocked 
up one . . . I did what any campaign manager would do. I made the best 
letterhead possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Manager 
</P>
<P>
Afriat said he doesn't believe that the letter can be construed as an 
association endorsement, because it said at the bottom that Ward's title was 
given for identification purposes only. But he said he is drafting an apology 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he pledged, he'll let Ward read it in advance.

MONTEREY PARK, STAR 'MELTING POT,' GETTING FED UP WITH THE PUBLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last five years, Monterey Park has endured an uncomfortable 
journalistic spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters throughout the world are attracted by the melting-pot, immigration 
story of a Los Angeles suburb struggling with rapid sociological changes. 
</P>
<P>
But the frequent outside analysis has become tiring for the interview-savvy 
residents of a town that immigration changed from an Anglo-majority city into 
an Asian-majority one. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Christopher F. Houseman half-seriously suggested that the city 
should charge filming rights. "I think people of the town get a little fatigued 
from having the bright lights on them. It's like they're on a movie set all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When Channel 2 television crews from KCBS came to film several months ago, 
Houseman complained about "the Monterey Park movie ranch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tensions Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
And now community leaders are fretting about the latest media foray into the 
San Gabriel Valley: the ABC News magazine show, "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
With a mixture of pride and discomfort, residents await the airing of the 
network television show, tentatively scheduled for sometime this month. And 
residents say they worry that all this journalistic notice creates a distorted 
picture and makes community life difficult when neighbor is pitted against 
neighbor in 15-second sound bites or 15-paragraph stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'd do a better job if we weren't on the front page all the time," 
said Councilwoman Betty Couch, who was interviewed but not filmed by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"You know my story: Development is the main issue in Monterey Park, not 
racism," she said. "But I guess that's not what they want to hear on film." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia Reichenberger said she spoke with "20/20" but declined to 
be filmed because she feared the story would be one of "yellows against the 
whites." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Chu, the only council member whose ancestry is Asian, acknowledged the 
tensions over changes in the city's ethnic makeup in her filmed interview. 
"It's been painful. But people are starting to shift. I hope that comes across" 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good things in Monterey Park, and I'm concerned about the 
media portraying Monterey Park in a distorted way," Chu said. "That was the 
main message I gave in my interview." 
</P>
<P>
Lily Lee Chen, former mayor and council member, said: "We take pride for our 
accomplishments. But rather than having '20/20' to come in and generate 
controversies, (it's) now the time to leave us alone and give us a chance to 
iron out our problems." 
</P>
<P>
For an essentially residential community with a population of 63,500 -- besides 
the Asian majority, one-third of the residents are Latino -- Monterey Park has 
had its share of attention. 
</P>
<P>
The focus in large part began in 1983, when news stories circulated about 
Chen's becoming the nation's first Chinese-American woman mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken Chen was mayor when the city hosted the Olympic field hockey 
competition in 1984, and she worked on the community's successful application 
to be named "an All-American City" in 1985 during efforts to promote racial 
harmony. But there were tensions then, too, such as a libel suit filed against 
Chen after she complained about a sign in a service station that said: "Will 
the last American leaving Monterey Park please take down the American flag." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'City of Exploitation' 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Barry L. Hatch, the city has another outspoken mayor who wants a 
temporary ban on immigration and advocates that English be declared the 
nation's official language. 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Cable News Network has come to the city that journalists have 
referred to as "a suburban Chinatown" and "the Chinese Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on public television, the Washington Post and NBC 
have reported on Monterey Park. Foreign film crews have been there. Recently a 
student film crew came from Cal State Northridge. Atlantic Monthly magazine 
last year featured the city in an article titled "Growing Pains." 
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the frequent coverage given in the Los Angeles Times and 
in local and statewide newspapers. Four daily Chinese-language newspapers are 
published in Monterey Park and are distributed internationally. 
English-language magazines and newspapers aimed at Asian-American readers often 
report Monterey Park stories, such as a dispute about foreign-language books in 
the library and the debate about the amount of Chinese characters on business 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become the city of exploitation, with outsiders swooping in," Houseman 
said. "I don't know what ABC was doing in town. A sociological story? A 
political story? A critical story?" 
</P>
<P>
For its part, ABC has declined to talk about the story, except to say that one 
is being done. 
</P>
<P>
The television segment's genesis was partly due to comments made by Hatch, who 
these days is being quoted from Honolulu to Philadelphia and points in between. 
</P>
<P>
A producer from "20/20" contacted Hatch in February to say that she had read a 
front-page article in the Philadelphia Inquirer quoting Hatch. The Feb. 2 
story, "Immigration Spurs Debate Over English," quoted Hatch as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we're losing our country. They're buying up our property. 
They're taking Western culture out and replacing it with Eastern culture and 
Latin culture. They're taking us over. If their language is set up, all the 
rest will crumble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rear-Guard Action 
</P>
<P>
The article referred to Hatch as "the controversial mayor of Monterey Park, who 
sees his battle for English as a rear-guard action against the decline of 
Western civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch willingly has sounded this theme for journalists as a way to gain a forum 
for his view that the immigration problems of Monterey Park are the same as the 
nation's. He often is a guest on radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his belief that the news media has a liberal bias, Hatch said, 
interviews afford a chance to spread his conservative views. "I could not turn 
down the opportunity to get a portion of my message across." 
</P>
<P>
But he complained that during the ABC interview "they wouldn't let me expound 
on the issues. They wanted to keep it to a duel here in Monterey Park between 
the forces that be." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hatch was upset that ABC interviewed Stephen Tan, now a city 
planning commissioner, who two years ago was a leader of the unsuccessful 
movement to recall Hatch and Reichenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Tan said he, too, was unsettled by his "20/20" interview because he was asked 
questions about Hatch and the recall campaign. "I said: 'Let the past be the 
past.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was told the show would be a chance for him to address millions 
of television watchers, Tan said, he was reluctant to be interviewed for fear 
his comments might be misconstrued in Monterey Park as well as throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to think of the city as in hot water. I only want to talk 
about the good things and my ideas of how to get everybody together." 
</P>
<P>
But Tan, who moved to Los Angeles from Malaysia 10 years ago, said he was glad 
he could talk about Monterey Park in the context of the history of American 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, when the Jews came, the Italians came, the Spanish and the Irish came, 
we had all kinds of misunderstandings. Then there was the Japanese and now the 
Chinese. It's not a problem because they're Chinese. It's really just because 
they are the newcomers."

POLICE GIVE AILING BOY HIS WISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boy's wildest dreams were obviously coming true when Pomona police started 
giving Christopher Wilson everything they could think of. And that may be only 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they're through, Chris may have visited the Statue of Liberty and 
Disney World, and dozens of football-playing policemen will have had dreams of 
their own fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old Chris, who was born with cystic fibrosis, has already had a ride 
in the Pomona police helicopter and on a police motorcycle that he got to 
operate himself. 
</P>
<P>
His benefactors include the Pomona Police Officers Assn., officers of the state 
Department of Corrections and the Make A Wish Foundation, which makes dreams 
come true for youngsters under 18 who have life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when members of the police association, who often play on other 
football teams, decided to form their own squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go out and beat our brains out, and the recognition would go to the team 
we were playing for," said Pomona Detective Ray Birch. "We wanted some of the 
glory that we were helping others to get." 
</P>
<P>
So did officers of the California Institute for Men in Chino, who had the same 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they figured they could raise a lot of money if they held a charity 
football game and sold all the tickets themselves, rather than paying an agency 
to solicit ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donating Stadium 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department at Chaffey College in Alta Loma is donating its 
football stadium, uniforms and personnel for the game, which will begin at 7 
p.m. on April 14. Tickets will cost $3 for adults and $1 for children 5 to 17. 
Younger children will be admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
When plans started falling into place, Birch said the police association asked 
the Make A Wish Foundation to choose a special child to help. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson said her son had been recommended to the foundation by a teacher 
who tutors him in his La Verne home, through the Bonita Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Chris easily qualified for consideration, said Betty Strong of Riverside, 
speaking for the Make A Wish Foundation. Proceeds from the football game will 
not go directly to Chris, Strong said, but into a general fund. The foundation 
spends an average of $2,000 for each wish it fulfills. She said many hotels 
provide free or reduced-cost rooms, and the foundation gives each member of the 
family $50 spending money each day of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect on their lives is the excitement they get, the happiness," Strong 
said. "It's an upper you can't believe." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Pomona officers competed for Chris's attention during a 
get-acquainted visit last week. They urged him to accept a special cake, 
badges, a helmet and a baton. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how much this is doing for us," Birch said. "The kind of 
thing we see every day out on the streets -- we really need this. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the perfect kid," said Birch as he watched Chris easily take over the 
entire police facility. 
</P>
<P>
Chris is a blue-eyed, blond charmer with a disease that a spokesman at the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Southern California called "the No. 1 genetic 
killer of children and young adults." 
</P>
<P>
His big wish, say his parents, Deborah and Scott Wilson, is to see the Statue 
of Liberty. Disney World comes a close second. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Plans 
</P>
<P>
All that will likely come true soon after the April 14 game, said Strong. She 
has begun making plans for the family, including 3-year-old Cory, to spend a 
week traveling to New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Chris, who is currently in good health, required surgery for an intestinal 
blockage six hours after he was born, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis forms a thick mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive tract 
and makes its victims susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. Gary 
Green, executive for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said most of the 35,000 
victims in the United States have a life expectancy into their mid-20s.

COUNTY EXPLORING OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN FOR MARINA ROAD DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County planners developing a land-use plan for Marina del Rey are hoping to get 
around a controversial requirement for a new road intended to siphon off some 
of the traffic in a heavily congested area. 
</P>
<P>
The road proposed by the county would be in the Oxford Triangle, just outside 
the county border in Los Angeles. But Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who 
represents that area, opposes the plan. 
</P>
<P>
And Marina del Rey developers do not want future development tied to such a 
road, since Galanter's opposition prompts them to think it will never be built. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Slavin, a planner with the county Regional Planning Department, said the 
concept of having alternative routes to the proposed road is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said including language to that effect in the plan would allow county 
officials to discuss alternatives later with state Coastal Commission 
officials. Slavin added that specific alternatives to the road are now being 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Today 
</P>
<P>
The County Regional Planning Commission today is considering including such 
language in the plan, called the Local Implementation Program, at 9 a.m. in the 
Hall of Records, 320 W. Temple St. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the commission, the plan will go to the Board of Supervisors for 
its approval. The Coastal Commission, which must also approve the plan, is 
expected to review the recommendations late this year, Slavin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Implementation Program is one of two parts of a coastal plan required 
by state law. 
</P>
<P>
The other part, called a Land-Use Plan, outlines general development concepts. 
The Local Implementation Program sets development standards to achieve these 
concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists using Admiralty Way to avoid heavy congestion at the intersection of 
Washington Street and Lincoln Boulevard have created their own traffic problems 
on Admiralty. And it is this traffic that the road proposed by the county would 
relieve. 
</P>
<P>
As county officials try to move traffic from the Lincoln Boulevard terminus of 
the Marina Freeway to Washington Street, each end of that route requires 
coordination with Los Angeles city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, who represents the area, opposes the proposed bypass because it would 
pour additional traffic into residential Oxford Triangle. Residents there 
oppose such a road through their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Leslie, executive director of the Marina del Rey Lessees Assn., said the 
additional language proposed for the Local Implementation Program does little 
for developers because all possible alternatives have been explored in the past 
without success. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said he hopes the concept of tying development in Marina del Rey to a 
new bypass is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like being held up because of this requirement," he said. "There will 
have to be some kind of amendment."

<P>
The 24-Hour Nautilus health spa has closed permanently because of financial 
problems, according to its owner. 
</P>
<P>
John Robert Prell, 34, first closed the facility March 12. He was arrested two 
days later after Downey police received several complaints from patrons who 
said they were concerned that Prell was allegedly accepting memberships without 
notifying the buyers that the business would soon close. Prell, a Downey 
resident, was released the same day on $25,000 bail. He later reopened the spa 
in the Stonewood Shopping Center before closing it last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is continuing its investigation. A bail hearing 
has been set for May 3, according to a Downey Municipal Court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Imperial Health Spa in Downey and the Sporting Club in Anaheim 
said they will accept the contracts of 24-Hour Nautilus members. Michael 
Avellino, Sporting Club manager, said his facility will honor transfers until 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Prell said that members who joined the 24-Hour Nautilus after Feb. 14 could 
apply for a refund.

MAN CHARGED IN $3-MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT TAX FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale businessman was arraigned Wednesday on charges that he engineered a 
sophisticated scheme to swindle more than $3 million in state unemployment and 
workers' compensation taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, James P. Lund, 67, had set up 10 fictitious companies and listed 
four dead relatives as employees in order to establish good safety and 
employment records, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner told a press conference Wednesday. 
That scheme assured that the companies' workers' compensation and unemployment 
tax rates were very low, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more accidents you have, the higher your insurance rates are," Reiner 
said. "Clearly, Lund's pretend companies had a low number of accidents. I mean, 
what could happen to a bunch of dead employees?" 
</P>
<P>
Lund then transferred employees from real client companies to the dummy firms, 
pocketing most of the resulting tax savings, the district attorney alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Lund pleaded innocent Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to the felony 
charges, which included 26 counts of filing a false tax return, 22 of preparing 
false or fraudulent documents and 15 counts of forgery. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, calling the charges "fiction," asked that his $1-million bail be 
reduced, saying that Lund has no previous convictions and requires medical 
attention for a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David S. Milton denied the request and sent Lund back to County Jail, 
saying, "If any fraction of the allegations are sustained, Mr. Lund will 
probably serve time in state prison." 
</P>
<P>
In Lund's alleged scheme, he sought contracts with legitimate companies, 
offering to handle their payrolls and get them lower unemployment and workers' 
compensation rates, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Lund would take his clients' employees and list them as employees 
of one of his fake companies, Reiner said, so the clients would be taxed at the 
lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
Lund would keep the lion's share of the tax money saved and give a portion back 
to his clients, the district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Rate 
</P>
<P>
When the fake company's tax rate was increased at the end of the year because 
of the increase in the number of employees and employee claims, Lund would 
allegedly fold that firm and shift all the workers into another fictitious 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"What's unusual about this case is that (Lund) was very patient," Reiner said. 
"Usually con artists want a quick return, but it took Lund a few years to get 
the pretend companies established before he could start collecting any money." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said the investigation is continuing in an effort to discover whether 
Lund's clients, who were not named, were aware of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Rosenthal said the clients were generally companies 
that have large numbers of temporary employees, including security firms, a 
gasoline station personnel company, fireworks manufacturers and a bus company. 
Rosenthal said Lund handled close to $500 million in quarterly payrolls for the 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Client companies were located in Glendale and throughout the Southland, Reiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Lund, who his attorney said is married with two daughters, faces 
10 years in prison and a fine of $520,000, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Fiction' 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Paul Caruso called the charges "great fiction" and that 
evidence would prove that the case "is not as impressive as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
"My client owes $190,000 on a $300,000 home in Westlake Village," Caruso said. 
"That doesn't sound like a man who has lots of money floating around." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said Lund's scheme was uncovered after an employee at one of Lund's 
three legitimate personnel services businesses in Glendale tipped off the 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If not for that informant, I doubt we would have discovered Lund's ploy," 
Rosenthal said. "I'm sure there are other cases like this out there." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said the Employment Development Department will soon begin using a 
new computer system to monitor companies and to detect fluctuations in the 
number of employees or unemployment and workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
Lund's preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 18.

SENIOR CITIZENS MAY HAVE BIG SAY IN SCHOOL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask the folks at the Fairfax Senior Citizens' Center for their views on Los 
Angeles public education and you will get an earful. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing . . . is when the kids come out (of school), are they going to 
grab your purse?" Rose Lee, 78, said recently as she lunched at the busy 
Melrose Avenue center. 
</P>
<P>
At the next table, Dave Edson, 76, complained about students who bump and shove 
senior citizens on RTD buses. "They should learn to respect their elders," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And 90-year-old Sam Jacobs blamed his neighborhood's crime problems on the 
failures of education. "You're not safe to go out on the streets," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
These are not voices heard at PTA meetings, back-to-school nights or downtown 
school board debates. 
</P>
<P>
But they are among the voices that are likely to resonate the loudest in 
Tuesday's potentially pivotal Los Angeles school board election. 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens like Lee, Edson and Jacobs have a big say in low-interest 
school board contests because, voting patterns show, they dutifully go to the 
polls in elections big and small. 
</P>
<P>
As with other small-but-motivated groups of voters, including teachers, the 
elderly have become more important as voter participation in school board races 
has diminished. The once-broad base of school election voters -- those who 
repeatedly approved local school construction bonds in the 1950s and '60s -- 
have gradually eroded. 
</P>
<P>
In the last Los Angeles school board election two years ago, fewer than one in 
seven eligible voters cast ballots. A few years earlier when there was no Los 
Angeles mayor's race or major City Council contest on the ballot to attract 
attention, only 8% of eligible voters went to the polls in a school board 
election. Fifteen to 20 years ago, 35% to 45% of the voters turned out for 
school board races. 
</P>
<P>
Several political consultants said that with a lopsided mayor's race at the top 
of the ticket, Tuesday's turnout will be low, perhaps 25%. Participation in the 
school board election will probably be even lower. Four years ago, when 35% of 
the city's voters cast ballots for mayor, only 25% voted in some school board 
races. 
</P>
<P>
While the election is important to hundreds of thousands of students and their 
parents, it will largely be the senior citizens, most of whom have no children 
in school, who will tip the scales. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Steinberg, a San Fernando Valley-based veteran political consultant who 
has directed campaigns of several school board members, estimated that up to 
half of those who vote on Tuesday will be over 55. 
</P>
<P>
"Any candidate worth his salt" is going to be campaigning at retirement homes, 
said Steinberg, who is not working on this school board election. 
</P>
<P>
Older residents do not pay close attention to school issues, he said, but they 
do vote and "they care about wasteful spending and they care about crime and 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the senior citizen vote is most evident in the Westside district 
where two-term incumbent Alan Gershman is facing an aggressive challenge from 
Mark Slavkin, a county supervisor's aide who has the backing of the teachers' 
union, United Teachers-Los Angeles. Three seats will be decided citywide, but a 
win by Slavkin could tilt the balance of the school board the union's way at a 
time when the teachers are locked in a major contract battle for higher pay and 
other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairfax District is crucial because it has one of the city's largest 
concentrations of elderly. And Westside City Councilman Zev Yaroslavksy, who is 
popular in the heavily Jewish area, is facing a challenge that could boost the 
turnout there. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a sizable share of the precinct walkers and campaign mail for 
school board candidates in the Westside district will be targeted at Fairfax in 
the closing days of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"You need the senior vote," said Jerry Seedborg, a former aide to state Sen. 
Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who is directing Gershman's direct mail 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Taylor, Slavkin's direct mail strategist, agreed. Fairfax is important, 
and he will be hitting hard on the crime issue -- a big concern to seniors -- 
because that "seems to be everyone's major concern" and where Slavkin can get 
"the biggest bang for the buck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campus Crime an Issue 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin has made campus crime his leading issue. He often starts off public 
appearances by recounting school shootings and citing increases in arrests on 
Westside campuses. He calls for more police to be deployed at schools. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent precinct walk in Fairfax, Slavkin tried to deliver the message 
personally, knocking on the apartment doors of voters that a computer analysis 
told him were most likely to go to polls next week. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small but telling portrait of the campaign and the concerns of these 
important voters. At several stops, Slavkin was met only by voices -- 
frightened, old voices -- coming from behind sturdy, bolted doors. The seniors 
were not about to open up for a young stranger. 
</P>
<P>
The determined candidate responded by hollering through the barrier his pledges 
to do something about "the gangs and bureaucracy that are really affecting our 
kids." Before leaving, he would gently extract a promise that the faceless 
voice would look over the literature he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Gershman charged Slavkin is "playing on people's fears" by emphasizing the 
crime issue. "That's deplorable," Gershman said. "It is not factual to suggest 
we are rampant with crimes and gangs on the Westside. It's just not the case." 
</P>
<P>
But Gershman's campaign team appears to recognize the power of the issue. They 
acknowledged that crime is a major concern and said they will emphasize 
Gershman's votes to upgrade the school police force and his endorsement from 
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waste Alleged 
</P>
<P>
On another theme likely to have special appeal to senior citizens, Slavkin's 
mail is attacking Gershman for supporting allegedly wasteful spending and being 
"in the pocket" of high-paid school district administrators, many of whom are 
contributing to Gershman's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gershman has not yet responded at the mailbox, his strategy on the 
wasteful spending front is to portray Slavkin as an ambitious opportunist who 
wants to expand the school system's "political bureaucracy." He cites a Slavkin 
proposal to make the current $24,000-per-year, part-time board positions full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Older residents may be the most important group of voters, but teachers are 
becoming more significant as voter turnout declines. There are an estimated 
7,000 district teachers living on the Westside, and Slavkin is counting on 
getting most of their votes. The union, which represents 32,000 teachers, 
counselors, nurses, librarians and psychologists, has been attacking Gershman 
and promoting Slavkin and Julie Korenstein -- who is facing a strong challenge 
in her bid to hang onto her West San Fernando Valley seat -- through 
newsletters to its members. In addition, Slavkin has been going 
school-to-school appealing to teachers with promises to increase their pay and 
give them more say in how schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how low the turnout is, teachers could account for up to 10% of 
the votes, enough to sway an otherwise close contest. 
</P>
<P>
Low turnouts are a problem in many local elections, but they particularly 
trouble education officials. They worry that increasingly those making 
decisions about who will run the schools have no children attending them or 
have special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"People have abdicated their responsibility to a handful of folks who are 
making the decisions for everyone," said William Ingram, president of the 
California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between those using the public schools and those deciding who runs the 
public schools appears to be widening in urban school districts like Los 
Angeles. The pool of eligible voters is aging; many new minority students 
coming into the district have non-citizen parents; more middle-class families 
are fleeing to private schools, and many parents who choose to remain with 
public schools are both working and have less time to become involved and vote. 
</P>
<P>
While the campaign is keying on crime, allegations of waste and labor 
contracts, these are not what most troubles Warren Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principal's Problems 
</P>
<P>
As principal of Fairfax High School, which is a a block down Melrose from the 
Fairfax Senior Citizens Center, Steinberg said his biggest problems are getting 
"kids to perform to their capacity," getting enough personnel to counsel them 
and keep them from skipping school and to get more parents actively involved in 
what goes on at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not getting a lot of response from any level regarding educational 
matters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The folks at the Fairfax seniors center are the first to admit they pay little 
attention to school affairs until students bother them. 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors are interested in what affects them," Rose Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Lee and half a dozen others all said they will vote in the school 
board election. They said they will review the campaign mail and, as one 
89-year-old woman put it, try to figure out who is telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But as of several days ago, not one knew a thing about the school board 
candidates.

LINDSAY, 88, DUE TO ROMP HOME IN 9TH DISTRICT VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in 26 years, some prominent members of Los Angeles' black 
community are calling for the city's senior minority politician to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Gilbert Lindsay appears headed for a landslide reelection to his 
seventh term as councilman from downtown and South-Central Los Angeles, there 
is a growing wave of discontent in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"He has stayed too long," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, director of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. "It's a commonly held view, but out of respect 
for his seniority" one that is rarely voiced publicly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe, I hope, this is Gil's swan song," added John Mack, director of 
the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
At 88, Lindsay's age and health are clearly big issues. The councilman has 
problems hearing, sometimes depends on a cane to walk and has some residual 
weakening in his right hand from a stroke he suffered late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay says he is fit and ready to serve the district again. Although he 
acknowledges napping occasionally while on the job, he says he snaps awake when 
something important comes up. "When something affects the 9th District I wake 
right up, it hits my ear." 
</P>
<P>
But some community leaders say age is only part of the issue. They say they are 
just as concerned that Lindsay has lost touch with the needs of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said it's time to "re-order priorities" in the 9th District -- downgrading 
the importance of downtown development and upgrading the needs of the young, 
the poor and the "have nots" south of the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
"The general dilapidation and decay of parts of the district is intolerable," 
Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little chance, critics and supporters agree, that the April 11 
primary election will force Lindsay to relinquish his crown as the self-styled 
"Emperor of the Great 9th District." 
</P>
<P>
Around City Hall, Lindsay is respected and even feared, while he is also the 
butt of jokes. Lindsay is known to fall asleep in the council chambers, appear 
confused by the hectic pace of meetings and make long-winded speeches. An aide 
stands near his desk during meetings and when a vote or a procedural question 
comes up, the assistant walks over to the councilman and whispers in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow council members, lobbyists and constituents are generally reluctant to 
comment publicly on Lindsay's advancing age -- out of respect for his 
achievements and to avoid charges of age discrimination. But in private 
conversations, many who know and work with Lindsay complain of his 
inattentiveness and confusion during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In a public display two weeks ago, for example, Lindsay mistakenly voted yes on 
a council motion that required eight affirmative votes. His vote provided the 
margin of victory for an issue that he had spoken against. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council debated an issue that has come up every year for 
several years, a proposed ordinance abolishing the Public Works Board. It is an 
issue of particular interest to Lindsay because he is chairman of the Public 
Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off on Reference 
</P>
<P>
When he spoke, Lindsay mumbled much of the time, although he finished his 
speech with a strong close. But at one point, he referred to the author of the 
ordinance, veteran councilman Ernani Bernardi, as a newcomer to the body, 
unfamiliar with the importance of the Public Works Board. Council President 
John Ferraro smilingly reminded the councilman that Bernardi is the only 
council member with more seniority than Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Later in that session, Lindsay mistakenly voted against Mayor Tom Bradley, his 
political ally, on an issue of great importance to the mayor -- whether the 
council should debate Bradley's ties to financial institutions. Lindsay had to 
ask the clerk to correct his vote. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay says his critics never take note of the fact that he works long hours 
at City Hall and then spends most evenings attending district meetings. They 
"don't ever say the guy worked himself to death so he fell asleep. They never 
say that," Lindsay said. 
</P>
<P>
But while lobbyists, council aides and members themselves may roll their eyes, 
shake their heads or simply ignore him, few are willing to openly cross 
Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
He is an unabashed wheeler-dealer and master of the kind of horse-trading 
politics that keeps him flush with campaign funds and untouchable in an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Black on Council 
</P>
<P>
He is also a powerful symbol in the black community, a man who rose from a job 
as janitor to become the city's first black council member, then went on to 
become a major power broker in an emerging downtown. After 60 years, he still 
calls South-Central Los Angeles his home, living in a modest, six-room 
Spanish-style house. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, the Department of Water and Power employee met a young white man named 
Kenneth Hahn and campaigned for him for City Council. Hahn won and, when he was 
elected county supervisor four years later, made Lindsay a field deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay got his own council seat in 1963, when he was appointed to fill the 
unexpired term of Ed Roybal, who was elected to Congress. He has won reelection 
handily ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The success story has caused Lindsay to be regarded by many of his constituents 
-- even some critics -- as if he truly were an emperor. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a symbol of hope for a generation," said Kerman Maddox, who grew up in 
the district and now owns a public affairs consulting firm. "He made it, and he 
made it big. . . . You forget about the problems in the district and look at 
him with pride," said Maddox, who nonetheless believes Lindsay should now step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The People Remember 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lee, director of the South-Central branch of the Legal Aid Foundation and 
a lifelong resident of the district, echoed Maddox's views: "People have clear 
memories of when there were no black City Council members and no black mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The district includes some of the richest veins of political contributions, and 
some of the poorest residents in Los Angeles. In the north are the skyscrapers 
of an increasingly bustling downtown and Chinatown and Little Tokyo. But the 
district also includes Skid Row and swings south to include some of the city's 
poorest neighborhoods, made up primarily of blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Despite representing some of the poorest voters in Los Angeles, Lindsay has 
been able to raise $1 million in campaign and political action funds in the 
last four years, largely from downtown business interests. Real estate 
interests account for about 37% of Lindsay's campaign funds, financial 
companies about 13% and legal firms 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the large contributors with real estate business interests in the 
district are Thomas Maguire, Alexander Hagen and Edward Barker. The financial 
institutions include some of the largest banks and brokerage firms in the 
nation: Bank of America; Drexel Burnham Lambert; First Boston Corp., and 
Merrill Lynch. Carriage trade law firms on the campaign rolls include Gibson 
Dunn &amp; Crutcher; Latham &amp; Watkins, and Manatt, Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diverted Attention 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that it is those Central City interests that get far more of 
Lindsay's attention than the neighborhoods where most of the voters live and 
suffer through some of the city's highest rates of crime and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"The people (financially) supporting his campaign don't have to live with him," 
said one Skid Row-area businessman, who asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no major challenge awaits Lindsay on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There are two other candidates in this election, although neither is attracting 
the kinds of money, endorsements or attention necessary to force Lindsay into a 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
One is Mervin Evans, a self-employed business consultant who ran unsuccessfully 
for Congress against Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) three times and 
ran a losing campaign for City Council in the 8th District two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidate is Ocie P. Hinkle, a businesswoman who is challenging 
Lindsay for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Look at It Now' 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay has been able to pursue an agenda that he acknowledges is weighted 
toward downtown business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a party to it, the leadership to build this downtown," Lindsay said. 
"What was it 26 years ago when I came on? We had one, two major buildings: City 
Hall and the Union Bank building. That's all. Look at it now." 
</P>
<P>
Many district residents do look at it, and for them it raises more questions 
than praise. 
</P>
<P>
"Lindsay has brought a tremendous amount of money to downtown," said Legal 
Aid's Lee, "and it makes you wonder if it's at the expense of the rest of his 
district." 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Maddox, who once ran for the neighboring 8th District seat, said 
Lindsay should have used his considerable influence over development to steer 
downtown's growth south -- along the Harbor Freeway and into the heart of the 
district -- rather than west and out of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Cannon, a community activist who has worked with groups such as Concerned 
Citizens of South Central, said Lindsay could also do more about 
bread-and-butter constituent services, such as tree trimming, street cleaning 
and alley closures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Some council members and aides say that such complaints can be found in any 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But on at least one recent occasion, another council member went to bat for a 
9th District community group, when Lindsay refused to help. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Councilwoman Gloria Molina took up the cause of a group of Latino 
homeowners who were trying to stop an industrial development in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay supported the factory developers, but Molina was able to lead a fight 
in the City Council to deny the builders a needed zoning variance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these complaints, Lindsay said, "The district is better off than it has 
ever been in history. I've been in the district for 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
On issues of economic development, Lindsay said: "I think I've done my share. 
My leadership as far as providing jobs, I don't know anyone that is a more 
shining light than I have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doing Our Share' 
</P>
<P>
Issues of crime, drugs and gang violence, he said, are largely the 
responsibility of state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our share. We are doing everything we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of voters who agree. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay has incredibly dedicated supporters in South-Central Los Angeles, 
particularly among the church groups and older people who have the greatest 
tendency to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is there for him 100%," said Rev. J. Benjamin Hardwick, a 
longtime friend and supporter of Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say Lindsay is an old-fashioned politician who makes the rounds of 
the churches and social clubs, greases the wheels and helps make the 
connections that make the district work. 
</P>
<P>
Hardwick said it is through Lindsay's efforts that his church has been able to 
operate a food program that feeds several hundred people twice weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped us put it together," Hardwick said. "He knows the people who can 
deliver." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9TH CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
The 9th City Council District includes some of the richest and poorest areas in 
Los Angeles. It includes the prosperous downtown business center, as well as 
Skid Row and much of South-Central Los Angeles. Although it is generally 
recognized as a "black" district -- with a black councilman for the last 26 
years -- the 9th District has a large and growing Latino population. Together, 
the two ethnic groups account for 94% of the district's population. Just under 
32% of the residents are registered to vote, contrasted with 55% in the 11th 
District, the city's most affluent, and 15% in the heavily Latino 1st District, 
which has the lowest voter regisration in the city.

VICTIM WAS BACKING AWAY, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malik Smith, son of actress Beverly Todd and television director Kris Kaiser, 
was backing away from an argument at a Salt Lake City disco when accused 
assailant John Leota threw the punch that killed him, a prosecution witness 
testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 18, who lived in Los Angeles and was on a ski vacation, died two days 
after the encounter. Preliminary hearings are being held to decide whether 
Leota, who is charged with second-degree murder, should stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Foote said he was at Club 35, a West Valley disco, the night of March 18 
and saw Leota, also 18, strike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Foote said that when Leota hit Smith, the punch "lifted him six inches off the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
Before he was hit, it appeared Smith was stepping backward away from an 
argument with Leota, Foote added.

ENVIRONMENT REPORT ON PRISON REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-member state panel set up to determine the environmental consequences 
of building a state prison in East Los Angeles rejected an environmental impact 
study Wednesday for the proposed 1,450-bed penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection of the report could further delay the project, which has been 
entangled in political wrangling for two decades. Among other things, the panel 
said the Department of Corrections report did not prove that construction of 
the prison would not adversely affect property values. 
</P>
<P>
A corrections spokesman said the department was "disappointed by the delay" but 
would rewrite the report. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), an outspoken critic of the prison, hailed the 
decision and said it proved that the Department of Corrections "has again 
glossed over" important issues "in order to build a prison at this location at 
all costs." 
</P>
<P>
The prison was approved in 1987 in a compromise that requires construction of a 
second lockup west of Lancaster.

EX-CUSTOMS OFFICIAL GUILTY OF EMBEZZLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former U.S. Customs supervisor was convicted Wednesday of embezzling nearly 
$840,000 in duties paid by arriving passengers at Los Angeles International 
Airport and spending the money on clothes and trips for herself and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Betty J. Jones, 38, of Los Angeles committed the largest theft ever of import 
duties in Southern California. She was convicted of 21 counts of embezzling 
money from the United States and one count of filing a false income tax return 
after a two-day non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher was scheduled to sentence Jones on May 15. 
She faces a maximum of 213 years in prison, a $500,000 fine and restitution, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Maurice Leiter said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Jones' friends testified that she flew them on jaunts to Las 
Vegas and San Francisco and bought them clothes and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was responsible for collecting cash and checks from an airport vault, 
verifying cashiers' accounting records and having the money deposited into a 
Customs bank account.

BIT OF FREE AGENCY MAY BE ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
NFL MIGHT HAVE SOLVED PROBLEM, BUT UNION WANTS MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER KING, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the National Football League's Management Council implemented a 
free-agency plan for the marginal players on each team's roster nine weeks ago, 
the Minnesota Vikings' scouting staff figured that 134 of the 619 available 
players might be able to make their team. Might. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the wake of an unexpectedly high 229 players changing teams by the end 
of the free-agency period Saturday night, pocketing signing bonuses of a 
stratospheric $9.2 million, according to Chicago-based agent Frank Murtha, the 
question is this: Will it matter? Will it matter in the standings to the Green 
Bays who signed 20 of these living-on-the-edge-of-the-roster players, and will 
it matter to the union, which continues to oppose the limited free agency. And, 
most importantly, will it matter to the judge who must decide if the freeing of 
619 players is enough freedom of movement for the league? 
</P>
<P>
Quick looks at each question: 
</P>
<P>
The Teams -- The bottom line on the field is that Green Bay isn't going to 
gravitate to the top of the league and Cincinnati won't fall to the bottom 
because of the players those teams gained and lost in free-agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as being an earthquake on competitive balance," Indianapolis 
Colts General Manager Jim Irsay said. 
</P>
<P>
The Union -- The National Football League Players Assn., whose representatives 
have been telling some agents that they deserve some credit for getting the 
marginal players freed, still thinks the current free-agent situation isn't 
good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"What disturbs me is that the players have no say in who is a free agent," 
NFLPA Executive Director Gene Upshaw said. "What this proves is that your 
reward for being a good player is you can't have freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The union is interested in a much more liberalized form of free agency, more 
resembling baseball's. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get that," Bengals assistant general manager Mike Brown said, "this 
franchise is out of business." 
</P>
<P>
The Judge -- U.S. District Court Judge David S. Doty ruled last year that the 
Management Council has a right to have some sort of restriction on player 
movement, but he implied that the owners needed a system that would make some 
movement possible. 
</P>
<P>
The current plan -- Freezing the top 37 players on each team and freeing the 
rest -- was handed to the owners by the Management Council's lawyers. Doty 
doesn't comment on the case when he's out of court, but some club officials 
obviously hope he's been impressed by the movement of players so far. In all, 
37 percent have changed clubs. The owners also hope Doty has been impressed by 
the fact that 146 of the 229 who moved (64%) have gone to teams at or below 
.500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, our people have seen the movement as an aid to our case," Brown said of 
the Bengals. In fact, some of the more skeptical players and player agents view 
the massive movement as a way to influence Doty when the case is being heard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the system hasn't been artificially skewed by the court case," 
said Murtha, who nonetheless lauded the system. He had five clients change 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The general reaction to the system is that the marginal players love it, the 
established players covet it, the coaches hate it and the owners hope it 
prevents any more movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's created a bonanza for the bottom 10 players," Colts Coach Ron Meyer said. 
"They started feeling like unwanted stepchildren. Now they're coming up to me 
thanking me for putting me on the list. And I have established players in our 
weight room coming up to me and saying, 'Why didn't you put me on the list?' " 
</P>
<P>
"We got gutted," Oilers Coach Jerry Glanville said. The Oilers lost a 
league-high 15 players. "The thing that bugs me is that this thing totally 
changed the makeup of our team. We lost our chemistry. The upheaval from this 
thing will be felt for five years, in depth, in chemistry, in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, say the Bengals, who lost eight and signed none. "We think the market 
was overpriced," Brown said. "In our judgment, most of these players will be 
released by their teams, either at the final cut this season or next year (if) 
we cut to 37." 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of the players was "like college recruiting," said tackle Mike 
Ariey, who went from the New York Giants to the Packers. He had "recruiting" 
lunches with coaches Joe Gibbs of Washington and Lindy Infante of the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Infante said he gathered his coaching staff at the end of January to 
plot their course of free-agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," Infante told his staff, "we're back in college recruiting." He had to 
tell the coaches he wasn't kidding. The Packers spent about $900,000 in the 
system, hoping to reverse a losing trend in the '80s, and signed 20 players. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers had to outbid four teams for Ariey, who didn't play in a single 
regular-season game for the Giants as a rookie last year and wasn't drafted. 
Still, they paid him a $60,000 signing bonus, with salaries of $150,000 in 1989 
and $175,000 in 1990 and an extra $15,000 per year for making the active 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
Ariey is a prospect, and every team lost a few Arieys in this new pool of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Green Bay Packers, it's been a good thing," Infante said. "But I think 
the movement tells you what would happen if there was total unrestricted free 
agency. It'd be a disaster for teams."

DEFENDANTS IN LIBEL SUIT CALL ATTACKS ON BLASZCAK FAIR PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The defendants in a libel and slander lawsuit brought by Vice Mayor Frank 
Blaszcak filed a response this week saying that past campaign statements they 
allegedly made about him, including assertions that he was involved in drug 
sales, were merely part of fair political play. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed Tuesday in Pasadena Superior Court, the 12 defendants, all of 
whom opposed Blaszcak in last year's City Council election, questioned the 
legal basis for Blaszcak's suit, characterizing it as "an improper effort to 
resist a recall effort directed at him." 
</P>
<P>
The statements in question "do not amount to more than the usual slings and 
arrows which members of society are expected to encounter -- especially when 
they throw themselves into hotly contested local elections," their response 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, including a councilman, a former mayor, two former planning 
commissioners and the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, challenged 
Blaszcak's claim that he had been the victim of "intentional infliction of 
emotional distress" by political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blaszcak certainly must have expected to meet vigorous opposition, harsh 
criticism and attacks upon his character and qualifications for the office he 
was seeking," the defendants said in papers prepared for them by the Los 
Angeles law firm of Beck &amp; De Corso. "This has always been an essential 
element of American politics." 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak, who filed his suit three weeks ago, said Wednesday that he had not 
yet been served with the defendants' response. "Slander and libel stand on 
their own," he said in responding to the assertion that allegations against him 
were normal for American political campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak was elected to the City Council last year, after a bitterly contested 
campaign, as part of a three-man slate of slow-growth candidates. He faces a 
recall election May 23. 
</P>
<P>
One issue that has surfaced frequently during last year's council campaign and 
this year's recall drive is a charge by Santa Ana police 10 years ago that 
Blaszcak, who was then that city's public information director, had offered to 
procure drugs for a police officer. The allegations were investigated by the 
district attorney, who decided not to file charges because of insufficient 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Allegation 
</P>
<P>
During the council campaign, a flyer put out by a group called Concerned 
Citizens of San Gabriel accused Blaszcak of being "involved in drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the defendants in Blaszcak's suit were members of the group that put 
out the flyer. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Sabino Cici, one of the defendants, said the quick response was 
an attempt by the defendants to "get into the arena." 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't been served with his complaint," said Cici. "He's got three 
years to serve us. This could be held over our heads for a long time. If any of 
us were trying to buy a home, say, we'd have to declare that we were engaged in 
a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
He said the defendants' response allows them to subpoena records and testimony 
and to force Blaszcak to make a deposition in the presence of the defendants' 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, it's to Frank's advantage to drop the lawsuit now and pay our 
attorney," Cici said. "There are some heavy attorney's fees involved here. In 
the end, we'll file a malicious prosecution suit to recover our attorney's 
fees." He estimated that the defendants' total legal fees could amount to 
$250,000.

GLENDORA VOTES TO BAR TALLER HOUSES

<P>
For the second time in a year, voters this week spurned the advice of 
established community leaders and supported Glendora Pride, the city's 
slow-growth group. 
</P>
<P>
The issue on the ballot Tuesday was City Ordinance No. 1530, which would have 
raised the maximum height for two-story homes in some areas from 25 to 30 feet, 
and would have permitted heights of 35 feet with City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
Voters overwhelmingly rejected the ordinance, with 4,172, or 68.8%, voting "no" 
on the referendum and 1,889, or 31.2%, voting for it. The ordinance was 
defeated in all 22 precincts, losing by more than a 4-1 margin in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The council narrowly approved the ordinance last August, but Glendora Pride -- 
asserting that the measure would lead to overdevelopment of the city's 
hillsides -- gathered more than 3,000 signatures of voters demanding a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan "Save the Foothills," Pride members warned that the ordinance 
would allow developers to blot hillsides with massive, ostentatious homes. 
Proponents of the ordinance, led by a group called Glendora's Future, accused 
Pride of distorting the issues in the campaign. They secured endorsements from 
the city's five living former mayors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the council should realize that the people are beginning to speak out 
on what they want their community to look like," said Glendora Pride member 
David Bodley, who defeated a longtime incumbent to win a seat on the City 
Council last year. "This is the democratic process. This is the second time 
we've seen it work in the past year, and there will be more." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the ordinance said the outcome did not indicate a groundswell of 
support for Pride's slow-growth agenda, but merely proved the effectiveness of 
deceptive campaigning. The ordinance focused on heights of houses, they said, 
not the future of the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sorry the referendum went the way it did," said Dick Tunison, in a 
prepared statement on behalf of Glendora's Future. "We wish it had been 
better-understood by the voters. We tried to conduct our campaign on the facts 
and not on innuendoes and emotional hype, but it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Nichols, vice president of Glendora's Future, said Pride may have won the 
election with just three words. "Anytime you say 'save the foothills' around 
here, you're going to have people standing in line behind you," he said. "They 
made it a very emotional thing." 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Avina, who co-chairs Glendora Pride, said claims that the organization 
distorted the issue were insulting to voters. "I think they should give the 
people more credit for knowing what they want and understanding what they 
read," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack E. Mason, who opposed the ordinance, said Tuesday's outcome bodes well for 
Glendora Pride's chances in next April's City Council election. Three of the 
five council seats are at stake, and Pride members said the group plans to run 
a full slate of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are saying they want some control in how their city operates," 
Mason said. "They think two or three of the City Council members aren't 
listening to them anymore, that they're only listening to developers and 
special interests."

POLICE MAKE THEIR WISH, AILING BOY'S COME TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boy's wildest dreams were obviously coming true when Pomona police started 
giving Christopher Wilson everything they could think of. And that may be only 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they're through, Chris may have visited the Statue of Liberty and 
Disney World, and dozens of football-playing policemen will have had dreams of 
their own fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old Chris, who was born with cystic fibrosis, has already had a ride 
in the Pomona police helicopter and on a police motorcycle that he got to 
operate himself. 
</P>
<P>
His benefactors include the Pomona Police Officers Assn., officers of the state 
Department of Corrections and the Make A Wish Foundation, which makes dreams 
come true for youngsters under 18 who have life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when members of the police association, who often play on other 
football teams, decided to form their own squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go out and beat our brains out, and the recognition would go to the team 
we were playing for," said Pomona Detective Ray Birch. "We wanted some of the 
glory that we were helping others to get." 
</P>
<P>
So did officers of the California Institute for Men in Chino, who had the same 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they figured they could raise a lot of money if they held a charity 
football game and sold all the tickets themselves, rather than paying an agency 
to solicit ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donating Stadium 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department at Chaffey College in Alta Loma is donating its 
football stadium, uniforms and personnel for the game, which will begin at 7 
p.m. on April 14. Tickets will cost $3 for adults and $1 for children 5 to 17. 
Younger children will be admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
When plans started falling into place, Birch said the police association asked 
the Make A Wish Foundation to choose a special child to help. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson said her son had been recommended to the foundation by a teacher 
who tutors him in his La Verne home, through the Bonita Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Chris easily qualified for consideration, said Betty Strong of Riverside, 
speaking for the Make A Wish Foundation. Proceeds from the football game will 
not go directly to Chris, Strong said, but into a general fund. The foundation 
spends an average of $2,000 for each wish it fulfills. She said many hotels 
provide free or reduced-cost rooms, and the foundation gives each member of the 
family $50 spending money each day of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Upper You Can't Believe' 
</P>
<P>
"The effect on their lives is the excitement they get, the happiness," Strong 
said. "It's an upper you can't believe." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Pomona officers competed for Chris's attention during a 
get-acquainted visit last week. They urged him to accept a special cake, 
badges, a helmet and a baton. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how much this is doing for us," Birch said. "The kind of 
thing we see every day out on the streets -- we really need this. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the perfect kid," said Birch as he watched Chris easily take over the 
entire police facility. 
</P>
<P>
Chris is a blue-eyed, blond charmer with a disease that a spokesman at the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Southern California called "the No. 1 genetic 
killer of children and young adults." 
</P>
<P>
His big wish, say his parents, Deborah and Scott Wilson, is to see the Statue 
of Liberty. Disney World comes a close second. 
</P>
<P>
All that will likely come true soon after the April 14 game, said Strong. She 
has begun making plans for the family, including 3-year-old Cory, to spend a 
week traveling to New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Chris, who is currently in good health, required surgery for an intestinal 
blockage six hours after he was born, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis forms a thick mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive tract 
and makes its victims susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. Gary 
Green, executive for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said most of the 35,000 
victims in the United States have a life expectancy into their mid-20s. He said 
scientists may soon be able to identify the gene that causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson said Chris receives regular intravenous feedings and sleeps with 
a mask and a humidifier to ease his breathing. While he appears robust, he is 
not able to attend regular school classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Ride 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after touring the police facility and posing for photographers like 
a professional model, Chris and his mother went to Brackett Field in La Verne, 
where the Pomona Police Department's helicopter is kept. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking forward to this since I first heard about it," said pilot 
Dennis McCall. 
</P>
<P>
A somewhat reluctant Chris was persuaded to mount a cycle. He immediately 
identified the button that operated the siren. 
</P>
<P>
He lasted as long as the police officers did that afternoon, running, leaping, 
grinning and clutching his new possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave out and slept on the way home, but it was wonderful while it lasted," 
said his mother.

<P>
BROADER PHONE TAX PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a 4-2 vote, the Pasadena Board of Directors has instructed the city attorney 
to prepare an ordinance extending the city's telephone tax to interstate and 
international calls. 
</P>
<P>
Mary J. Bradley, city finance director, told the board that the extension would 
raise $1 million a year in tax revenue. The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way 
for the extension recently by upholding state and local taxes on interstate and 
international calls, rejecting the argument that the taxes are an 
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The city tax of 7.86% currently applies only to calls made within California. 
Representatives of the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and the Ralph M. Parsons 
Co. argued against broadening the tax, asserting that it would put a heavy 
burden on businesses. Director Jess Hughston agreed, saying the city has lured 
companies to Pasadena and should not now be raising their costs. Mayor William 
E. Thomson Jr. opposed the tax increase on grounds that the city had not yet 
identified a purpose for the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But other directors supported the increase, saying that the city's financial 
position is deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Crowley said the city is caught between declining allocations 
from the state and federal governments and rising demand for city services. 
Director Rick Cole warned that Pasadena has a "tough fiscal year ahead," adding 
that "this is probably not the only tax that is going to have to be raised next 
year." Directors Kathryn Nack and William Paparian voted with Cole and Crowley. 
Director Loretta Thompson-Glickman was absent.

SMALL BUSINESSES NEED PATRONAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
We at Katie McGuire's Pie &amp; Bake Shoppe in Hacienda Heights were one of the 
many small businesses that are taken for granted until we no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
We tried for almost two years to make a success of Katie McGuire's. The support 
and patronage we received will be a lasting memory. 
</P>
<P>
For customers who came by occasionally or when the nearby Vons grocery store 
was out of something, we only hope our closing serves as a reminder of how 
important it is to support local merchants. It is always easy to visit the big 
department stores, the malls or the discount wholesale clubs. But supporting 
local merchants benefits us all, since such businesses help make the community 
what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Such merchants are not outsiders. They are your neighbors, your friends. Give 
yourself a warm feeling from helping support the "little guy." 
</P>
<P>
Goodby for now.

HEAD START FINDS A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after denying a preschool program permission to operate in Olive 
Avenue Park because of residents' opposition, the City Council on Tuesday 
unanimously approved Recreation Park as the school's site. 
</P>
<P>
The federally funded program, Head Start, serves children in low-income 
families, abused or neglected children, and those with handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Services Commission voted 4 to 2 last week to approve Head 
Start's move to Recreation Park, on Mountain Avenue. The program has to move 
from Plymouth Elementary School because the facilities there do not meet state 
standards for a Head Start license, said Cliff Marcussen, program director. 
</P>
<P>
Options, the nonprofit child-care agency that runs Head Start, will pay the 
city $1 a year to lease a mobile classroom and 3,500 square feet for a 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
After a long hearing, during which residents had voiced concerns about traffic 
and noise if the program used Olive Avenue Park, the council on March 21 denied 
a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Community Services Director Eileen Brownell, who has been working with 
Marcussen to find an alternative site since that meeting, said the new site is 
surrounded by park space and faces a city maintenance yard.

'ANIMALS SUFFER IN BULLFIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired bullfighter Patricia McCormick claims to love horses (Times, March 26), 
yet these animals suffer terribly in bullfights . . . when the tormented bull 
charges them. Heavy padding soaks up the blood; it does not prevent injury to 
the horses. 
</P>
<P>
It is always amazing to hear people justify how they can "love" animals or be 
"horrified" by the clubbing of baby seals while defending other brutality. 
Bulls are not the vicious animals she suggests. In the ring they are confused 
and usually standing still.. 
</P>
<P>
Running a story about McCormick on Easter was crass. Calling someone who took 
part in this barbaric ritual a "lady" is stretching it a tad, don't you think?

As hardly more than a footnote to a long election campaign, that small,

This one, held before a hall of empty seats in the downtown library, was far 
from the most spirited of the election season's ritual -- if arguably 
ineffectual -- public dramas. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just the night before in the same auditorium, a much larger crowd 
enjoyed some first-rate political vaudeville when the candidates ejected one of 
their questioners in a League of Women Voters forum. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was James Gressinger, the new publisher of the old-guard Glendale 
News-Press. In a column under his name, Gressinger had endorsed the two 
incumbents, Ginger Bremberg and Mayor Carl Raggio, along with Richard Jutras, 
the inside favorite among the 11 challengers. He also questioned whether Joe 
Ayvazi, an Armenian, could represent all of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Ayvazi didn't like that. He said Gressinger should be disqualified for bias. 
Gressinger stepped down, and the candidates agreed to replace him with a 
working reporter from his paper. 
</P>
<P>
No such fun was in store for Thursday. The incumbents and their protege were 
away, being honored by a group of supporters at a dinner party that was 
probably a lot more fun than the forum on the homeless and politically more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
Their pre-written statements, read by moderator Greg Roth, suggested that none 
considered the topic worthy of great attention at the municipal level. They 
pointed out that the city gives about $25,000 to the homeless organizations -- 
most of it merely handed down from federal grants -- and that is the proper 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
As usually happens at candidate forums, many words were spoken, not too many of 
them compelling, incisive or even well thought-out. 
</P>
<P>
The most informative talk was by Roth, associate pastor of the Glendale 
Presbyterian Church. He merely reported what is known about homelessness in 
Glendale and what little is being done about it. 
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition was initially formed to coordinate existing community 
services, but became more activist when it learned that by going to every 
agency in town, "a homeless individual could get two boxes of groceries, six 
nights in a motel and maybe some used clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The group's research showed a daily average of 200 to 250 homeless. Sixty 
percent of them are Glendale residents whose problem, Roth said, is 
unemployment or underemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Many have families. Many are young. Many don't qualify for any aid. They're 
looking for jobs, trying to keep their kids in school, staying out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
"They're living in cars, moving from place to place," Roth said. "To really 
help the homeless in a significant way, we need food, shelter and clothing. 
Shelter is the biggest need in our community at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, allowed five minutes each, spoke in alphabetical order. Most 
were better at needling the Big Three than explaining what should be done about 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Ayvazi, who loaned his own campaign enough money to make it the richest in the 
race, told how he arrived in Glendale, broke and homeless 32 years ago, and 
found his first job. 
</P>
<P>
Nida Brown confessed that she asked a homeless woman to leave the doorway of 
her law office on Broadway. She worried that building a shelter might encourage 
more homeless to come. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Dorris, a former sheriff's deputy, said it's OK to help the homeless, but 
not anybody who is a "6-foot-2, 180-pound idiot lying under a cardboard box, 
sucking on a bottle of wine." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner representative Shirley Griffin, also in absentia, said it's a good 
thing to help the homeless as long as doing so doesn't attract any more. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Matthews, a vice president with Carnation, listed all the charity groups 
he has headed or joined. 
</P>
<P>
There was pathos in the earnestness with which the predictable losers applied 
themselves to an uncomfortable topic that had been all but abandoned by the 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
The pathos reached a climax when landscaper Richard Seeley stepped forward. 
Showing his lack of any sense of what campaigning is about, Seeley delivered a 
balanced, articulate, moving analysis of the role of local government in aiding 
the homeless. It was probably the best speech of his life. It showed he cared. 
</P>
<P>
In a private conversation, Lt. Ken Hodder, commander of the Glendale Salvation 
Army, conceded that the organizers never hoped their event would draw a large 
crowd or influence Tuesday's voting. Their major goal, Hodder said, was to pull 
in a little media coverage. For what it's worth, they did. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Seeley finished next to last. After doing little better, Ayvazi 
accused Gressinger of spreading xenophobia and vowed to run him out of town.

BOARD WON'T BACK GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The school board has decided by a 3-2 vote not to back a resolution supporting 
nationwide efforts to ban semiautomatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of board members believe that it would be inappropriate for the 
board to take a position on a general issue such as a weapons ban, said Supt. 
Stephen Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, board resolutions have dealt specifically with education-related 
matters, Goldstone said, and board members did not want to dilute the weight of 
any school-related resolutions they may adopt in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The gun-ban resolution had been proposed at a March 6 board meeting in response 
to a tragedy in January when a man with an assault rifle sprayed a Stockton 
schoolyard with gunfire. He killed five children and wounded 29 others before 
shooting and killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, legislatures at all levels have been pushing to ban assault 
weapons. In the San Gabriel Valley, the South El Monte City Council voted to 
ban assault weapons in March.

AZUSA TO ISSUE PERMITS TO CONTROL PROBLEM BARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, searching for a cost-effective way of combating unruly bars, on 
Monday adopted a permit process to regulate the city's 10 taverns. 
</P>
<P>
Conditional use permits, which can be revoked with relative ease, will allow 
the city to close the taverns if illegal or other undesirable activities take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa officials say the permit process is an innovative one based on 
regulations used by only one other city in the state. The ordinance, approved 
by the Planning Commission in February, is somewhat similar to one in the 
Orange County city of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a handful of Azusa taverns have proved a headache for police, 
who say they have become havens for drug dealing and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Argument 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously passed the ordinance, which covers establishments 
that serve alcohol as their primary function. No bar representatives appeared 
at Monday's council meeting to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing against a good cocktail lounge that has something to offer," 
said Councilman Tony D. Naranjo. "Unfortunately, we just have a lot of beer 
bars that seem to attract a lot of unruly drunks. 
</P>
<P>
"We can put tighter conditions on the bars that, if they violate them, can be 
used to revoke the permits." 
</P>
<P>
With qualified success, the city has used another approach to control what 
police say were two of the worst bars. The state Health and Safety Code allows 
municipalities to "permanently abate" properties where drug sales are a public 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Rejects Bid 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Pomona Superior Court judge rejected the city's bid to close JJ's 
Cocktail Lounge by imposing stiff penalties on the landlord and bar operators. 
Azusa had asked the court to permanently padlock the bar, where police reported 
65 arrests last year for drug-related offenses and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But the landlord, prompted by the city's action, evicted the problem bar 
operator. Then the judge found that the city had not given the property owner 
ample opportunity to remedy the problems. Although city officials praised the 
result, the judge's ruling prevented Azusa from recovering its legal costs, 
estimated at more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city has a second nuisance-abatement case pending against the La Villa bar, 
which has had similar problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes said the new bar-permit system gives the 
city more control while sidestepping the costly and time-consuming nuisance 
abatement process. Instead of going to court and having to build an extensive 
case, the city can simply revoke the permit if it determines that the tavern 
endangers the public's safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proven Track Record 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lloyd J. Wood said he hopes the permits can be as effective as the 
abatement process, which has a more proven track record statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how far we can go," he said. "My question is: Can this (permit) 
process take the place of the elaborate abatement process that we went through 
with JJ's and La Villa? If it can . . . then we're in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, if a bar operator is denied a permit or has an 
existing permit revoked, the owner can keep the bar open for three more years. 
If the bar continues to create problems during that time, Fuentes said, the 
city will follow up with an abatement procedure in court. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the former JJ's bar, which the landlord said will not be rented as a 
tavern, the remaining 10 bars have until mid-August to get a permit. Any bar 
that does not apply for a permit will face the three-year phase-out, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Powers 
</P>
<P>
Each bar must submit an operational plan for review by the Planning Commission, 
which grants the permits. The commission has broad powers to add conditions to 
the permit to safeguard residents and regulate conduct in the bars. 
</P>
<P>
City officials stressed that the aim is not to close all the city's watering 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent is to ensure that they are good neighbors, not to shut them down," 
Roy E. Bruckner, Azusa's director of community services, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major conditions each bar would have to meet include minimum 
requirements for parking, operating hours, occupancy limits, property 
maintenance, exterior lighting and on-site security. 
</P>
<P>
"These measures give individuals an opportunity to operate their establishments 
under certain criteria," Fuentes said. "If they abide by the criteria, their 
establishments can continue to exist." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said few of the bars currently meet all of the basic conditions.

ALLEN FREEMON COMPETES IN FOUR SPORTS ONLY BECAUSE A COACH TURNED HIM DOWN WHEN 
HE TRIED TO GO OUT FOR A FIFTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought Johnny Three-sport was dead, along came Allen Freemon, 
who is surviving -- and thriving -- at St. Francis High. 
</P>
<P>
During each of the past four years, Freemon has done what an increasing number 
of high school athletes have found almost impossible to do -- compete in three 
different sports. Before the 1988-89 school year ends, the senior will likely 
play four sports and he narrowly missed playing five. 
</P>
<P>
He's even found time to crack a book now and again. His grade-point average 
(2.8) has suffered because of the athletic distractions. Still, time and 
studies included, the most difficult aspect of participating in cross-country, 
basketball, golf and track is talking the coaches into allowing it. In these 
times of specialization and overlapping seasons, coaches -- even at the high 
school level -- would prefer not to share athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Freemon, however, is an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at St. Francis in 1985, Freemon planned on playing basketball, 
maybe golf, but cross-country Coach Mark Mitchell saw him run and quickly 
snagged him for his team. Initially, Freemon was less than enthusiastic. "The 
first day, they made us run five miles straight up a hill," he said. "Everyone 
was getting sick, throwing up. I thought, 'That's it for cross-country.' You've 
got to be some kind of fool." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Freemon became the first St. Francis freshman to make the varsity 
cross-country team. His junior year, he won eight of 12 races for the Golden 
Knights. This season, he took eight of 11 races. Freemon now says he has logged 
a "foolish" 6,000 miles for St. Francis in practices and meets. "I guess it 
became addictive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So habit forming, in fact, he also turned to track, where his quick fix came in 
the form of four events -- the 800 meters, the mile, the two-mile and the 
one-mile relay. 
</P>
<P>
Jammed in between the annual cross-country and track binges were Freemon's 
favorite sports -- basketball and golf. This past season, he led the basketball 
team in scoring (20.3-point average), three-point shooting and averaged 7.3 
rebounds a game. The 6-foot-2 forward ranked fifth in the Southern Section in 
three-point shooting percentage, making 83 of 211 attempts, and he was an 
All-Del Rey League selection. He scored in double figures in all 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of Freemon's senior season reveals not only the mental and physical 
stamina required to switch from sport to sport, but also an unusual level of 
consistency as he did so. Freemon's schedule has been rigorous indeed. After 
school ended in May 1988, he played summer league basketball with St. Francis 
teammates in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through July, he began daily cross-country workouts, running 12 miles 
and 15 quarter-mile sprints on alternating days. The cross-country season began 
in September and ended Nov. 14. He joined the basketball team a week late -- on 
Nov. 17. While the team had been practicing together since the beginning of 
school under the guise of a physical education class, Freemon hadn't touched a 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes about a month to get your quickness and touch back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country knocked his shooting touch so out of whack, he hit nine 
three-point shots and scored 37 points in the season-opening loss at Beverly 
Hills. To make up for lost time, Freemon said he took 500 shots a day during 
team and personal practice sessions. In a game against Alemany, the forward hit 
five three-point shots in the first half, enabling the Golden Knights to take a 
49-19 lead. Against Crescenta Valley, he made six three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, running cross-country helped him," said John Jordan, St. Francis 
basketball coach. "So many of his points came off the transition. I rarely saw 
him fatigued. In the fourth quarter, he'd still be going all out. That helped 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Jordan wanted his standout shooter to drop cross-country to 
concentrate on basketball. "He told me running was hurting my basketball," 
Freemon said. "None of the coaches ever really pressured me to quit other 
sports, but they advised me to concentrate on just one -- and the sport they 
wanted me to stay with was always the one they happened to be coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Four days after the basketball season ended in mid-February, Freemon played in 
a golf tournament and turned in St. Francis' best nine-hole score, a two-over 
par 38 at L. A. Royal Vista. "To me it's unbelievable," said golf Coach Mike 
Cannon. "He hadn't touched a club in who knows how long and he golfs like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Even though St. Francis' spring golf schedule conflicts with its track season, 
Freemon says he will attempt to step in and run "when the track team needs me." 
But, after almost four years of juggling his sports, Freemon may now be turned 
away by a coach unwilling to work with the athlete's revolving schedule. Track 
Coach Duane Harris said his practices began a month ago and he has yet to hear 
from Freemon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about this season," Harris said. "It comes down to the team 
aspect. It's not fair for him to replace a kid who's been practicing with us 
all the time. And if there's a conflict between golf and track, which meet will 
he miss?" 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Freemon has a solution: "I would want to play or run for the team 
that needed me the most." 
</P>
<P>
Freemon was turned down by a coach once before. Halfway through the football 
season, the senior wrote a letter to football Coach Terry Terrazone, whose team 
was struggling with a 1-3 record. In effect, Freemon volunteered for football 
duty -- he would play quarterback -- pending the coach's approval. 
</P>
<P>
It never came. Freemon insisted on continuing with cross-country in addition to 
football and Terrazone found that arrangement unacceptable. Johnny Five-sport 
was miffed by the reaction, finally dismissing it as "football mentality." 
Harris, an assistant football coach, said Freemon would have missed too much 
practice while off running the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Harris called Freemon's other sports "a distraction problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Being so talented, being so good at everything puts him into a bit of a 
problem," Harris said. "It's always been tough for him to decide which sports 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
So he did all of them. 
</P>
<P>
But his diluting sports agenda may have, his coaches say, cost him concrete 
rewards, such as a major-college scholarship. Cannon says Freemon (who has a 
4-handicap) could easily have been a scratch golfer and landed a free ride at a 
Division I school had he practiced year-round. Harris says the same is true for 
track and cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
Two months before his high school graduation, Freemon basically answers the 
could-have-beens with a "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
He'll probably attend a Division II school in California and try to play -- 
what else? -- three sports. Looking back, he claims his only regret in high 
school is not playing football and cementing his place at St. Francis as the 
school's Johnny Five-sport. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times I asked myself, 'What the hell am I doing this for?' " he said. 
"Everyone kept telling me to focus on one sport. But I was having fun. I was 
just being a kid. There's nothing wrong with that. I wanted to get my money's 
worth while I was young."

ONE-RUN WIN OVER VALLEY MAY WAKE GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale College's 10-inning, 11-10 baseball win over Valley last Saturday 
might have been more significant than the school's other Western State 
Conference victories. It could have been a coming-out party of sorts for the 
vacillating Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
Has Glendale, which has struggled with consistency in posting an 11-14 record, 
rounded the corner of mediocrity? 
</P>
<P>
"I sure hope so," Coach Steve Coots said. "It's the first time we really 
stretched and beat somebody ahead of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the potential) has always been there but we've always been a nickel 
short. Hopefully, we're over the hump and going downhill now." 
</P>
<P>
And Valley was no small hump. The Monarchs are 20-5-1 and ranked second in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale trailed, 10-9, in the 10th inning but came back when Chris Majors led 
off with a home run and Art Chute singled in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
But it was in the sixth inning that the ball began to bounce Glendale's way. 
Marco Asselin was able to bunt a bounced pitch to squeeze in a run to give the 
Vaqueros a 7-5 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Record setters: Occidental College softball Coach Mike Schmidt has grown 
accustomed to the ribbing he gets from fellow coaches. 
</P>
<P>
He's the winningest coach in Occidental softball history, but when you check 
the history, that's not really saying much. The Tigers won just one game last 
season and did not fare much better in the previous two seasons softball has 
been a varsity sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 5-9 and 0-2 in Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference play this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent-wise I think we match up with just about everybody," Schmidt said. "But 
it's hard to instill that, 'Hey, we should never lose a game attitude' when 
it's never been there before." 
</P>
<P>
Double time: Crescenta Valley High runner Morgan Bateman says he won't be at 
his best in the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At least he hopes he isn't. Bateman wants to save his best performances for the 
state championships in June. 
</P>
<P>
His coach, Keith Gilliland, agrees. "A lot of kids don't do well in the end," 
he said. "When kids hit that peak there's a tendency for them to start 
panicking, especially when they see others improve around them." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman, the Souther Section 4-A Division 800-meter champion, says he was 
running much faster at this point last year. But his decision to run both the 
800 and 1,600 this season has slowed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stronger but I'm just not as sharp yet," Bateman said.

ELLIOTT EDGES FERRY TO WIN THE WOODEN 
</P>

<P>
Disclosing its balloting for the first time in a further attempt to make its 
John R. Wooden Award the basketball equivalent of football's Heisman Trophy, 
the Los Angeles Athletic Club was rewarded with its first public horse race, 
between Arizona's Sean Elliott and Duke's Danny Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
And as emcee Tom Hawkins actually said, "The envelope please:" 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, 1,871 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry, 1,721. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," said the soft-spoken Elliott, when Wooden made the announcement 
Wednesday. "That's a big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a compliment, There were several players more deserving than I. 
I'm just ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott and the top four finishers, comprising the club's first "All- American 
team," were honored at a banquet Wednesday night at the Biltmore Hotel, with 
the public invited for the first time. It was also the first time that club 
facilities were too small for the 12-year-old award, obliging the ceremony to 
be moved. 
</P>
<P>
"We have several player-of-the-year awards, and I'm sure football does, too," 
said Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs, attending with his star, Stacey King. "Is 
there a Naismith Award? (There is.) This would be great, to have this as the 
equivalent to the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need it. . . . But I don't think that all the coaches are sitting 
around and talking about it. The big thing they're talking about now is, 'Who 
you getting?' " 
</P>
<P>
Behind Elliott and Ferry came the other members of the club's first team, as 
chosen by popular vote: King, 895 votes; Charles Smith of Georgetown, 486, and 
Sherman Douglas of Syracuse, 356. Glen Rice, who led Michigan to its National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title and broke the tournament scoring title, got a 
late write-in surge but finished four votes behind Douglas with 352. 
</P>
<P>
And who was the more worthy? 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard," King said. "You didn't have that one player who dominated 
everything. Last year it was Danny Manning, the year before David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they both meant a lot to their teams. You take Sean Elliott from 
Arizona, and they go from a great team to an average team. You take Danny Ferry 
from Duke and they go from a great team to an average team. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you have to let them go head to head and they have to guard each 
other. Whoever scores the most points and his team wins, he's the one. That's 
one way to get out of that one." 
</P>
<P>
All the first-team members except Smith, who was back on campus, attended. 
Ferry and his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, retired the competition in the who-went- 
to-the-most-trouble category, flying home to Durham, N.C., from Seattle Monday 
for a campus reception, then turning around and flying here. 
</P>
<P>
Award Ceremony Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second team: Glen Rice, Michigan; Jay Edwards, Indiana; Todd Lichti, Stanford; 
Hank Gathers, Loyola Marymount and Lionel Simmons, LaSalle. . . . Mike 
Krzyzewski to John Wooden, from the dais: "You hear a lot of (talk) at these 
things but I hope some of us as coaches put as much back into the game as you 
have. It's nice to see someone put back as much as they took out -- and you 
took a lot. I'm going to have a special meeting with Coach Wooden and ask him 
how to take that final step and win a national title." Krzyzewski's teams have 
been to three of the last four Final Fours, but have been beaten in all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim on Sherman Douglas: "Somebody asked me the other 
day, 'Who's going to take over at Syracuse?' I said, 'I think it's going to be 
me. The last three years, this guy did.' " . . . And a bit of byplay between 
the free-wheeling Oklahoma duo: Stacey King, reminding his coach, Billy Tubbs, 
that he'd be watching from now on, told him: "I'm an alum now." Replied Tubbs, 
sotto voce: "Send money." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott: "Somebody asked me one time, 'How do you feel when Coach (Lute 
Olson) compares you to Magic (Johnson)?' It's like your dad, calling you the 
best football player in the world. I really don't listen to that kind of thing. 
(Laughing) I think if it came from Coach Wooden, I'd listen to it more." . . . 
Elliott also talked of wanting to defend the fallen banner of western 
basketball drawing this response from Douglas: "You talk about West Coast 
basketball, you'd better talk to Coach Boeheim. Because he has at least four 
players from L.A."

ANGEL LOSING STREAK FINALLY ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
TEAM GETS FIRST WIN SINCE SEPT. 18 AS WHITE SOX FALL, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
And on the 199th day, the Angels won again. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 18, 1988 may now be retired to the history book. So may the club-record 
losing streak that stood at 12 after last October's season finale and was 
extended to 13 with Tuesday's season-opening defeat by the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
With a long, cold winter sandwiched in between, it had been more than six 
months since the Angels had won a game that counted. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing hit a leadoff home run Wednesday night at Anaheim Stadium, Chili 
Davis hit a three-run home run, Lance Parrish went four for four and Chuck 
Finley threw a four-hitter for 6 1/3 innings as the Angels defeated the White 
Sox, 6-2, before a crowd of 20,969. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels (1-1) are at .500 for the first time since last Sept. 18, when their 
record rested at 75-75. Twelve losses later, that mark was 75-87 and the 
countdown to the streak-breaker began. 
</P>
<P>
To reach such a milestone, the Angels used three managers. Cookie Rojas was 
fired after the first four defeats, and interim manager Moose Stubing went 0-8. 
Doug Rader was hired to alter the course in early April. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning the 1989 season with a 9-2 drubbing by Chicago, the Angels 
finally got it right on Day 2. Opening a 3-0 lead after two innings, the Angels 
kept the White Sox at bay until Davis put them away with his home run in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting timing, that. Davis had been benched on opening day, giving way to 
Rader's hunches and rookie Dante Bichette. Returned to the starting lineup on 
Wednesday night, Davis walked and scored in his first at-bat, singled in his 
second and homered in his third, a three-run shot off Chicago's top relief 
pitcher, Bobby Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
Before Davis, though, there had been Downing, who gave the Angels a lead as 
quickly as possible -- sending Chicago starter Eric King's first pitch into the 
left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
For Downing, a weight-lifter's leadoff man, it was the 18th leadoff home run of 
his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave the Angels a lead they would never relinquish, setting up Finley 
for his first victory since last Sept. 2 and letting relief pitcher Greg Minton 
re-experience the feeling of saving an Angel win. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no significance (to the victory) outside of shutting you guys up," 
Downing told a reporter. "There was absolutely no carry-over from last year to 
yesterday. But at least this takes all the negative talk away and we can get on 
to something more positive." 
</P>
<P>
The inning after Downing's homer, the Angels added two runs to increase their 
lead to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, a luckless 9-15 in 1988, is 1-0 after limiting the White Sox to one run 
before giving way to Minton. 
</P>
<P>
The only run Finley allowed came in the fifth, when Greg Walker doubled off the 
right-field fence, was singled to third by Carlton Fisk and came home on Dan 
Pasqua's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
That at-bat figures be the last in quite a while for Pasqua, Chicago's starting 
left fielder. In the bottom of the sixth inning, while chasing a foul ball off 
the bat of Jack Howell, Pasqua slammed into the fence along the left-field box 
seats and broke a bone in his right wrist. Pasqua is scheduled to undergo a 
bone scan today at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Finley would face five more batters before Rader replaced him with one out and 
one on in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
On came Minton, making his fifth appearance in seven days, including both 
regular season and exhibition games. Minton worked the final 2 2/3 innings for 
the save, allowing Chicago a final run in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Both Finley and Rader credited a new pitch -- the forkball -- with an assist in 
Wednesday's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked with it all spring and I'm not going to give up on it," said Finley, 
who estimated he threw one forkball out of every four pitches. "It's the pitch 
that will get me over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
Rader agreed. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, will the home-run ball. A frequent victim of offensive non-support 
last season, Finley was encouraged and excited by the two Angel homers struck 
in this game, especially Davis', which he kind of called. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Dr. (Lewis) Yocum (the Angels team physician) if they throw Chili a 
fastball, he'll jump all over it," Finley said. "He'll unleash on it. He's a 
big-play hitter." 
</P>
<P>
And that big play gave the Angels a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the kind of offense now that's going to put some runs on the board," 
Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Put enough of them up there and you're going to win some games. After nearly 
200 days, the Angels finally were able to relive the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Vance (Lucky) Lovelace, the rookie pitcher who made the Angel roster despite a 
9.00 spring earned-run average and a twisted intestine, is feeling no 
after-effects from the ailment that hospitalized him for one day last week. 
"All the major tests came back negative or normal," Angel Manager Doug Rader 
reported. "If it happens again, he'll have to get a CAT-scan. The same thing 
happened to him about a year ago." A twisted intestine can be a bothersome 
thing, Rader said. "To call yourself an ambulance at 3:30 in the morning, 
there's got to be a lot of pain involved." . . . Dan Petry, pitching in the 
bullpen to work his right shoulder into shape, was available for duty Wednesday 
night. "He's on the list," Rader said. "He's making some progress. He's coming 
along good." . . . With his pinch-hit home run in Tuesday's season opener, 
Claudell Washington became the seventh player in club history to homer in his 
first Angel at-bat. The others: Bob Cerv (1961), Ted Kluszewski (1961), pitcher 
Don Rose (1972), Frank Robinson (1973), Dave Machemer (1978) and Mark Ryal 
(1986). Washington's home run matched his previous career total at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Carlton Fisk, who also homered Tuesday, has now hit 304 home runs as 
a catcher (324 overall). That's within two of Yogi Berra and 23 of Johnny 
Bench, the all-time leader among catchers with 327. . . . Smalltown Boy: The 
press-notes bio White Sox starter Eric King lists the pitcher's residence as 
Semi-Valley, Calif. . . . The Angels announced they had sold a total 18,001 
season tickets for 1989. That's a slight dropoff from the 18,424 they sold last 
year. . . . Bert Blyleven makes his Angel debut tonight on his 38th birthday. 
It will be Blyleven's 606th career start and if he wins, it will mark his 255th 
career victory. Ex-Dodger Shawn Hillegas will start for Chicago.

JIM MURRAY: EVEN HIS CAREER WAS A FAST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was, as one longtime associate put it, "a race driver's race driver." He was 
the last guy in the world you'd want to see in your rear-view mirror with the 
race on the line and two laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
His name went into the language. Every wife in the country would turn to her 
husband as he was driving too fast down the freeway and observe, "All right, 
Parnelli, you can slow it down now. You qualified!" 
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that he moved a car up two laps just by being in it. He drove 
in seven Indianapolis 500s. He won one, should have won two more. He was on the 
pole twice and never started farther back than the second row. He was almost 
the last guy to win without extensive factory or corporate support. 
</P>
<P>
He used to go back to the Speedway with automotive cayuses known affectionately 
as "Ol' 98" or "Calhoun." They were front-engine roadsters that weren't exactly 
held together by glue and baling wire but neither were they the computerized 
marvels Roger Penske puts on the track today. 
</P>
<P>
His mentor was the late J.C. Agajanian, an improbable character who made his 
money in garbage and who showed up at the Speedway in a ten-gallon hat with a 
rattlesnake band on it, a diamond stickpin and reptile boots. 
</P>
<P>
Rufus Parnell Jones was probably as good an athlete as ever sat behind the 
wheel of a race car. He was fearless but not foolish. He was daring but not 
desperate. He had eyes like a cat and the reflexes of a crouched lion. He could 
see the whole track at a glance. 
</P>
<P>
It was just about impossible for him to go slow. In the 1962 race at Indy, he 
lost his brakes with 50 laps to go, and his crew had to stop his car coming 
into the pits by throwing tires in front of it. He didn't win the race but he 
finished it. In fact, he finished four of the seven races he drove there. He 
caught fire in one, lost a wheel bearing in one and had a bearing fail in a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first to go over 150 m.p.h. at the Speedway. He won the pole and the 
race in 1963. He was second in 1965 and, to all intents and purposes, had the 
1967 race won in a revolutionary turbine car when, three laps from a coasting 
finish, a $6.98 bearing burned out -- taking about $600,000 with it. 
</P>
<P>
And then, he walked away from it. 
</P>
<P>
No one cold believe it. It was as if Mike Tyson announced his retirement over 
the fallen body of Frank Bruno, Magic Johnson hung it up after a playoff. In 
all of sports history, only one other man, also a Jones -- Bobby -- had ever 
quit at the height of his powers in this way. 
</P>
<P>
People thought it was a grandstand stunt. Parnelli was only 34 years old. 
Parnelli would be back. An Indy 500 at the time without Parnelli Jones was as 
unthinkable as a U.S. Open without Jack Nicklaus. Parnelli was a part of auto 
racing lore, the kind of driver they made movies about. How could he park the 
Offy and go away and leave the game to A.J. Foyt, the Unsers, the foreigners? 
It was un-American. 
</P>
<P>
That was 22 years ago. I had lunch with Parnelli Jones the other day. The flat 
fighter's face is still the same. The eyes still take in everything without 
glasses. The stomach is flat. He still looks as if he belongs on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli did not give up racing altogether. He drove the occasional off-road 
race, a few Trans-Ams. But he never stepped into an Indy car again after 1967. 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of things," he said. "The danger? I don't think so. You 
learn to live with the danger. Danger is exciting. You know, people who live 
with danger tend to appreciate the other things in life more. They see how 
quickly it can all be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was more that I was winning that 1967 race so ridiculously easy -- 
yet I did not really savor the feeling. My first win was like the highest 
moment of my entire life. I couldn't sleep the night I won. This time, it was 
like, 'Well, I've done this before.' " 
</P>
<P>
Was the fact that he lost the race so shatteringly a factor in his decision? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll tell you: the race had been called by rain after 18 laps. It was 
re-started the next day with the parade lap, pace lap and all the warmups. That 
bearing quit with only three laps to go and I figured, without those extra 
re-start laps, it would have held together for the checkered flag." 
</P>
<P>
Had the turbine won, would he have remained in racing? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose. I would have been defending my championship. But I was anxious to 
get on with my business career. Agajanian and my partner, Val Miletich, had put 
me in real estate deals. I had my tire business. I stayed in racing. I just 
didn't stay in a car." 
</P>
<P>
Did he miss the adulation? Wasn't 34 too early to become a part of the past? 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli laughs. "I was speeding on the Pomona Freeway once and a cop stops me. 
He comes up to the car and he says 'Who do you think you are -- Parnelli 
Jones?' I had to admit, that was a boot." 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that he "stayed in just enough racing to keep the guys respecting 
me. They couldn't be sure I wouldn't return in a fast car. Nobody was ever 
quite sure he could write me off." 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli, who got his nickname when a friend fixed him a fake I.D. under the 
name Parnelli Jones so he could race when he was only 16 years old, resisted 
the lure of the track even though contemporaries Foyt and Al Unser still tee it 
up at the Brickyard in or near their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli will be on the track at Long Beach this month but not in the Grand 
Prix. He will drive in the Toyota Pro-Celebrity Race on Saturday, April 15, the 
day before the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli will take the wheel against a field of disc jockeys, running backs 
(Walter Payton), anchor men, movie stars and the sons of race drivers. One of 
these will be Parnelli Jones' son, P.J. 
</P>
<P>
The race is 10 laps or about 190 fewer than Parnelli was used to, and it will 
be 16.70 miles, 484 fewer than his rides of more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The pros have to give the celebrity drivers a 30-second head start, which means 
they will get to see one of the most terrorizing sights on a race track -- 
Parnelli Jones in their rear-view mirrors. Not to worry. He won't be there 
long. As the Indy racers of the '60s could tell you, pretty soon they'll be in 
his.

MASTERS GOLF TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CALCAVECCHIA DOESN'T HESITATE TO SAY HE'S AMONG PLAYERS TO BEAT 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mark Calcavecchia was asked Wednesday who had the best chance to win the 
Masters golf tournament, beginning today at Augusta National, he didn't 
hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Myself, Seve (Ballesteros), (Ben) Crenshaw, (Craig) Stadler and (Greg) 
Norman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he paused and added: "I forgot about Tom (Kite) and Curtis (Strange). You 
better slide me back." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia also said it wouldn't be surprising if a relatively unknown player 
wins the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did he rule out the prospect of a first-time player at the Masters 
upsetting the field. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia said that the players today are not intimidated as they might have 
been in the past, when Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson dominated the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus laughed when apprised of Calcavecchia's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is intimidated by me anymore. Half the players can't even pronounce my 
name." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the intimidation factor, he added seriously, "Nobody is winning on a 
regular basis now. It might be different if Seve and Norman began to win 
regularly." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, 49, who has won the Masters a record six times, doesn't regard 
himself as a top contender even though he has played decently in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As for Calcavecchia, he is one of game's the rising young stars. He finished 
second here last year, rather shockingly, when Sandy Lyle made a spectacular 
shot out of a fairway bunker on the 18th hole that found the green. 
</P>
<P>
He birdied the hole and beat Calcavecchia by a shot. Calcavecchia, who had 
already finished, watched Lyle's shot on television. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife cried and so did my buddies, but I don't think about it until someone 
brings it up," he said. "I shouldn't be disappointed at all. I did my best to 
make it a golf tournament and I was beaten by a great shot." 
</P>
<P>
The players here say the course has never been in better shape, even though it 
rained Tuesday and and late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rain is not expected today, but there is a chance of showers for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has won twice on the tour this year, but he isn't coming in on a 
roll, having missed the cut in three of his last five starts since he won the 
Nissan Los Angeles Open in February. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't played, though, in two weeks, choosing instead to rest for the 
Masters, one of the four major tournaments, along with the U.S. Open, British 
Open, and PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, 28, regards himself as one of the favorites because his style as 
a long hitter and expertise near the greens is suited to the course. 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus said Calcavecchia, Norman, Ballesteros, Lyle, Crenshaw, Strange and 
Kite are the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus played with Calcavecchia at the Doral Ryder Open last February at 
Miami. When the round was over, and Calcavecchia had shot a 65, Nicklaus said: 
"He hit he ball so well and so far that I felt totally inadequate. Now I know 
what other people once said about me." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia was appreciative of Nicklaus' tribute, but he said he isn't 
letting it go to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hit some great shots that I couldn't even believe," he said. "Nicklaus 
was looking at me like, 'What is this kid doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has five victories since joining the tour in 1981 but has yet to 
win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
He is aware of the importance of the Masters, but he said he would get more 
personal satisfaction out of winning the Ryder Cup this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a team deal," he said. "That will be a highlight of my life, the night 
after we beat the Europeans." 
</P>
<P>
Although Calcavecchia says there's a new wave of hungry young golfers, he still 
regards Nicklaus as a factor here. 
</P>
<P>
"He can still win," Calcavecchia said. "And if he played 25 times a year, he 
would be winning." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus says he is playing better now and has had some decent rounds, because 
his sore back hasn't bothered him in recent months as it had in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he had a back spasm last Friday, not as the result of 
an exercise program that was prescribed for him by Pete Egoscue, an anatomical 
therapist in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a stupid thing," he said. "I went to a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed. I'm not 100% going into (Thursday). However, last 
fall I didn't think I'd be playing period." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he wouldn't approach the first tee today if he didn't 
think he had some chance of winning. 
</P>

"I've always said I'll play golf as long as I enjoy it and can successfully 
compete, even though I haven't won this year, or have been close to winning," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who believe that persistence finally pays off, then Kite, the tour's 
leading money winner this year and an established veteran, should be given some 
consideration this week. 
</P>
<P>
He is often described as the best player never to have won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has had 10 finishes in the top 10 here -- he was runner-up twice -- 
and has missed only two cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I am anticipating a good week," said Kite, who has won twice this season. 
"I've never come here playing as well as I am right now. Whether that 
translates into winning, I can't say. 
</P>
<P>
Masters Notes 
</P>
<P>
Much discussion concerning the course concerns the par-five, 465-yard 13th 
hole. The water level of Rae's creek, guarding that hole, has been allowed to 
rise. In the past, some dramatic shots have been played from the creek when 
only a trickle of water passed over the rocks. "What they did to the creek is 
terrible," Mark Calcavecchia said. "If you hit in there, you have no chance of 
playing it out." Other pros don't seem concerned with the water level, or the 
lessening of the severity of the swale, the low lying portion of land on the 
left front of the 13th green. 
</P>
<P>
Hord W. Hardin, the Masters chairman, is fretting about the escalating prize 
money on the PGA Tour, hoping that the Masters won't have to go commercial to 
survive. "I don't seriously consider it, but I'm not saying a successor or 
change in membership might consider it rather than give up the tournament," he 
said. "I see it as a problem." The purse for last year's tournament was $1 
million. The purse for this year won't be announced until later in the week, 
but it is expected to be in that range. The PGA Tour, on which corporate 
sponsorships have become the vogue, has 16 events paying $1 million or more 
this season, topped by the $2.5-million purse for the Nabisco Championships at 
Hilton Head, S.C., in October.

HEALY'S WORTH IN NET IS EVIDENT, UNTIL OILERS SCORE TWO LATE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Kings, who were transformed into a contender when they traded for Wayne 
Gretzky last Aug. 9, underwent another change Feb. 22 when they acquired 
goaltender Kelly Hrudey from the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us from a team that was playing very well to a team that believed it 
could win the Stanley Cup," said Marty McSorley, echoing the sentiments of 
almost everybody in the long-suffering organization. 
</P>
<P>
The implication was clear: The Kings didn't have the same kind of faith in 
Glenn Healy. 
</P>
<P>
But with Hrudey suffering from the flu and unable to play, Healy was 
unexpectedly pressed into service Wednesday night in the opening game of the 
playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers. And for all but the last few 
minutes, he played brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
"He was terrific," Oiler Coach Glen Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, though, scored twice in the last four minutes for a 4-3 victory in 
Game 1 of the best-of-seven Smythe Division semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the way the game went, except for the outcome," said Healy, 
who spoke for most of a sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody could have expected him to play as well as he did. 
</P>
<P>
Although he won 25 games in the regular season, Healy was ineffective after the 
announcement of the Hrudey deal, losing all four of his starts and compiling a 
6.20 goals-against average and a .798 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hrudey was 10-4-2 with an excellent 2.90 goals-against average, 
including a shutout, and a .904 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
He was 3-1 against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Healy had been 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very difficult time for me," Healy said. "I had 25 wins with 20 
games left and didn't really get much of an opportunity to play after that. But 
I can't be selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"I seem to have adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
Healy didn't find out until Wednesday morning, when Hrudey phoned in sick, that 
he would face the defending Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
And Healy didn't feel his best, either. Only last Sunday, he missed a start at 
Vancouver because he had a 102-degree fever. 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't eaten much for two days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a little drained myself," he said. "But I'm the better of the two of 
us, so I gave it my best shot." 
</P>
<P>
He and the Kings led, 3-2, until the Oilers' Esa Tikkanen and Craig Simpson 
scored in a span of only 1 minute 7 seconds, Tikkanen on a rebound at 16:06 of 
the third period and Simpson on a shot from the right circle at 17:13. 
</P>
<P>
"The rebound went out through a maze," Healy said of Tikkanen's goal. "Their 
guys went to the net and caused a big traffic jam. I don't know where Tikkanen 
put it." 
</P>
<P>
Through Healy's legs is where, but not until after he had crashed into the 
Kings' second-year goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
On Simpson's goal, Healy said: "We had a defensive error, and they capitalized 
on a three-on-two (breakaway). They had a late trailer and made a nice pass. He 
had pretty much of an empty net to shoot at." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the night, though, the Oilers didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a long time to build confidence," Healy said, "and only a short time 
to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
In stopping 31 shots, he regained some of it. 
</P>
<P>
But still he lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?"owner Bruce McNall of the Kings asked. "We can't get any 
luck at all." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how far they advance, Wayne Gretzky could become the all-time 
playoff scoring leader on the Kings this season, surpassing Marcel Dionne, who 
had 43 points in 43 postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had 43 points last season in 19 playoff games, including a National 
Hockey League record 31 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The former Oiler, who established a National Hockey League record when he 
accumulated 47 points in 18 playoff games in 1985, has 253 points in 121 
postseason games, including an assist Wednesday night against his ex-teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The assist on Mike Krushelnyski's third-period goal extended Gretzky's 
point-producing streak in the playoffs to 18 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Former King Jimmy Carson, who was traded to the Oilers last August in the deal 
that brought Gretzky to the Kings, was on pace for a 60-goal season with 41 
goals in 55 games but he scored only eight goals in the last 25 games of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he went 12 games without a goal, the longest drought of his 
three-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's recent struggles pale, though, in comparison to teammate Glenn 
Anderson's. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who averaged more than 44 goals in the previous seven seasons, got 
goals in only 12 of 79 games, including scoring droughts of 16 games and 13 
games and, at the end of the regular season, 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a career-low 16 goals. 
</P>
<P>
And neither Anderson nor Carson scored in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Grant Fuhr made his 38th consecutive postseason start for the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
He is 31-6 in the streak, including a no-decision in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup 
finals last season, which was canceled midway through the game because of a 
power failure at the Boston Garden.

NHL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;

BOSTON BRUINS STILL BUFFALOED BY SABRES AFTER LOSING FIRST GAME, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Buffalo Sabres struggled to edge the Hartford Whalers for third place in 
the Adams Division. The Sabres needed to finish third to play the one team they 
dominated during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
It was only because they played the tough Boston Bruins eight times that the 
Sabres finished above .500. They were 5-0-3 over the Bruins in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The mastery continued in the opening game of the playoffs Wednesday night at 
Boston. The Sabres, with four power-play goals in the first two periods and 
outstanding goaltending from Jacques Cloutier, romped to a 6-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres dominated from the start and Cloutier had few really tough moments. 
He stopped 29 shots and registered his first playoff shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier, the backup goalie, replaced injured Clint Malarchuk, who suffered a 
deep slash in his neck, and was 4-1 in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his club's poor showing against Buffalo during the regular season, 
Bruin Coach Terry O'Reilly was confident there would be a change in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to slight Buffalo's goaltending," O'Reilly said. "But I feel real 
confident with our goalies. 
</P>
<P>
He selected Reggie Lemelin, who gave up six goals on 19 shots, the Sabres 
getting three goals in their first six shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will get another chance to beat the Sabres for the first time this 
season tonight, again at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Calgary 3 -- The Flames were expected to blow away the Canucks in 
four. Instead, the Flames find themselves down, 1-0, after a former Flame, 
defenseman Paul Reinhart, scored at 2:47 of overtime at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the third period, Petri Skriko brought the Canucks even with 
the first playoff goal of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Thwarted after moving in front, 3-1, in the second minute of the second period, 
the Flames fired six shots at goalie Kirk McLean in 2 1/2 minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play again tonight at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Two-time scoring champion Mario Lemieux was 
a little shaky in his first playoff appearance, but fortunately, in Paul 
Coffey, the Penguins had a playoff-tested star. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive-minded defenseman scored two power-play goals at Pittsburgh to 
give the Penguins a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had an assist, but most of the night he seemed to be bothered by the 
close-checking Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Tom Barrasso, also a veteran of Stanley Cup play, gave a solid 
performance, stopping 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Hartford 2 -- As expected, the Canadiens breezed in their opening 
game at Montreal. A short-handed goal by Ryan Walter early in the second period 
gave the Canadiens a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They broke it open with three scores in the last period. It was a costly win. 
Veteran forward Bob Gainey, just back after missing six games with a sprained 
left knee, reinjured the knee in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 3, Philadelphia 2 -- For the first half of the game at Landover, 
Md., the Flyers played tough defense and held a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But within 95 seconds shortly after the middle of the second period, the Flyers 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
First, Rick Tocchet lost control of the puck at center ice, Kevin Hatcher got 
the puck and set up Michal Pivonka for the tying goal. The Capitals quickly 
went in front when Dale Hunter knocked Gord Murphy of the Flyers off the puck 
and Lou Franceschetti grabbed it, went behind the net and his wraparound shot 
hit goaltender Ron Hextall's stick into the net for the decisive goal. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by Brian Propp and Tim Kerr in the first 12 minutes gave the Flyers a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Chicago 2 -- Dave Barr scored two goals, and the Red Wings' tight 
defense led the way at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit goalie Greg Stefan faced only 23 shots, but the Blackhawks scored 
twice. However, Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against Detroit this 
season, couldn't handle Barr. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Minnesota 3 -- It was only fitting that Brett Hull, who led the 
Blues in scoring during the regular season, would get the winning goal at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, who had 41 goals, scored at 11:55 of overtime. Bob Brooke, who had not 
scored since March 7, scored the three North Star goals. His last, with 2:35 
left in regulation, sent it into overtime. DAN HAFNER

AYAKO OKAMOTO DOESN'T EXPECT TO WIN THIRD STRAIGHT SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT

Ayako Okamoto is not optimistic about her chances of winning her third 
consecutive Red Robin Kyocera Inamori golf tournament, which starts today at 
StoneRidge Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready yet," Okamoto said Wednesday. "Last year was the best time of my 
life. I never won before that early. Last year was a special year. This year is 
a normal year. It takes time for me." 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto, 38, of Hiroshima, won a tournament last year as early as February -- 
the Orient Leasing Hawaiian Open. She finished the season with three victories 
and earned $300,206, which gave her sixth place on the LPGA tour despite 
playing in the fewest events of anyone in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Even without such a fast start, Okamoto was the tour's leading money winner in 
1987, earning $466,034 in a year that included four victories. All told, she 
has made $1,546,783 in eight-plus seasons, good for 10th place on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, does Okamoto doubt her chances to win her third consecutive San 
Diego tournament? 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to her head and her heart, then said, "I just haven't been playing 
that well." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Okamoto is in 52nd place with winnings of only $12,946, and has 
finished no higher than a tie for 18th. She failed to make the cut in the 
Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament last week at Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything (is going) slow for me right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of this season's top 10 money-winners will play here. They are Juli 
Inkster of Los Altos, Calif., winner of the Dinah Shore, who ranks fifth; 
Allison Finney of Palm Desert, winner of the Turquoise tournament in Phoenix, 
who ranks seventh, and Sherri Turner of Sugar Land, Tex., winner of the Orix 
Hawaiian Open, who ranks ninth.

JOHNSON OFFERED MONEY FOR INJECTION OF STEROID, CANADIAN ATHLETE TESTIFIES

Andrew Mowatt, who has competed for Canada in both the Winter and Summer 
Olympics, said Wednesday that Ben Johnson once offered him money for an 
anabolic steroid injection. 
</P>
<P>
Mowatt, a track sprinter and a bobsledder, also told the Canadian government's 
inquiry into drug use by athletes that he was given steroids by Coach Charlie 
Francis and Dr. Jamie Astaphan without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Mowatt said that Johnson offered to pay him in 1986 if he would inject him with 
a syringe full of liquid stored at Francis' Toronto apartment. Mowatt said the 
vial of milky white fluid looked the same as a bottle of steroids earlier 
entered into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You give me a shot, and I'll give you a shot,' " Mowatt said, adding 
that he initially refused because he had never given an injection. "Then, he 
said, 'C'mon, be a friend. I need a shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mowatt said he consented after refusing Johnson's offer of cash. 
</P>
<P>
But Mowatt did not indicate whether Johnson seemed aware that the injection was 
for a steroid. Johnson is expected to testify next month that he never 
knowingly took banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings are scheduled to continue today with testimony by Johnson's 
longtime friend and adviser, Ross Earl.

Black students go to college from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and with 
poorer academic preparation than whites, according to a study done for the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Once in school, black basketball and football players do about the same as 
white athletes, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Black football and basketball players earn an average grade point of 2.16 at 
predominantly white schools and 2.21 at predominantly black schools. White 
football and basketball players average a 2.48 grade point. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that most black student-athletes are basketball or football 
players. Although about 12% of the population is black, 37% of the football 
players and 56% of the basketball players at Division I schools are black. Of 
the women's basketball players in Division I, 33% are black.

Sports agent Norby Walters was a victim of "poisonous innuendo" and broke no 
laws, a defense attorney said in his summation. But a federal prosecutor argued 
in Chicago that Walters and associate Lloyd Bloom had perpetrated fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were to begin deliberating the fate of Walters and Bloom today after 
receiving instructions from U.S. District Judge George Marovich. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been about fraud from day one and it will be about fraud when you go 
back to that jury room," U.S Attorney Anton Valukas told jurors in his closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy to commit 
fraud and racketeering, accused of luring dozens of college athletes with cash 
and other gifts to sign contracts with them in violation of National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. rules, then using threats to keep the athletes in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Walters may have violated NCAA rules but he never violated for an instant 
any law," said Walters' attorney, Robert Gold.

Newport Beach police said Wednesday that they arrested the wealthy Pomona 
physician accused of ordering an attack on his ex-wife, the daughter of actor 
John Wayne, because they feared that he was planning to flee the country.

Police said Thomas A. Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon, had been making telephone 
calls to Greece, where he has relatives, had obtained a passport for himself 
last January and last month obtained a passport for his 2-year-old daughter, 
Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
"We feared he would flee the country and take the child with him," said Sgt. 
Mike Jackson, one of the investigators assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 35, who owns a string of five clinics from Beverly Hills to Palm 
Springs, was involved in an unusually bitter child-custody battle with Aissa 
Wayne, 32, his former wife, when the attack occurred last October. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, two men approached Wayne and her companion, financier 
Roger W. Luby, in the garage of Luby's Newport Beach home, bound and beat them 
and slashed one of Luby's Achilles' tendons. 
</P>
<P>
One of the attackers told Wayne: "You're (messing) with the wrong guy. Next 
time, we kill you," police have said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men have been arrested within the last 3 weeks on suspicion of being the 
attackers. Police identified them as Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed 
apartment manager from Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool 
cleaner from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued for a Century City private investigator, O. 
Daniel Gal, who worked on behalf of Gionis in the custody case and who police 
allege hired Hintergardt to make the attack. Hintergardt once worked for Gal's 
investigation agency, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, who was interviewed by Newport Beach police after the attack, is believed 
to have fled to Europe. Newport police said Interpol, the international police 
agency headquartered in Paris, is trying to locate Gal for arrest and 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis was awarded custody of the couple's child, Anastasia, after a hearing in 
which his lawyers argued that the attack on Wayne showed that the child would 
be endangered in Wayne's custody. The judge, holding that both were fit 
parents, nevertheless criticized Wayne as being "emotionally immature." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne's lawyer said Wednesday, however, that in light of Gionis' arrest, he 
would try to reopen the custody case. 
</P>
<P>
Three Newport Beach officers watched Gionis' home in Pomona Tuesday night and 
arrested him when he drove up in his chauffeured limousine at 10:50 p.m., 
police said. Gionis was returning from a business trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Newport Beach City Jail, where he was held without bail on 
suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said Wednesday that she was "shocked" by news of the arrest. "After 
everything Tom Gionis and I have gone through, I'm still shocked to think he 
could do something like that to me," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Luby said he was "pleased" and that his injuries are "98% healed." He said that 
if Gionis ordered the attack on him as well as on Wayne, it was probably 
motivated by jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Harbor Municipal Court Wednesday afternoon, a solemn-faced 
Gionis entered an not guilty plea to the charges as his former wife and her 
mother, Pilar Wayne, looked on from the back of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis did not acknowledge them, but mouthed "hi" to his father, Matthew 
Gionis, and his sister, Xanthia, who were seated in the courtroom. They had 
arrived earlier in Gionis' limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, wearing a white dress shirt and light-blue dress pants, appeared in 
court without handcuffs. He was flanked by armed bailiffs as photographers shot 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Through his attorney, Byron K. McMillan, Gionis surrendered his and his 
daughter's passports in hopes of persuading Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom 
to allow his release on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis was being held on a no-bail arrest warrant based on the statements by 
police that they believe Gionis might flee if released. Bostrom scheduled a 
bail hearing at 1:30 p.m. today. Gionis' preliminary hearing was set for April 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, McMillan and Albert M. Graham Jr., a Santa Ana lawyer 
who represented Gionis in his divorce case, belittled the case against Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
Police said records of Gionis' telephones show that he called Gal four times 
from his limousine and his office on the day of the attack. The calls were made 
before and after the attack, and one was made to Gal's car at the time police 
allege that Gal was parked outside Luby's home. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' bank records showed he had paid a total of $65,000 to Gal during the 
custody dispute, $40,000 of which was paid 2 weeks before the attack, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McMillan insisted that Gionis is the victim of Gal, who was employed by Gionis' 
attorney and not by Gionis. He said Gal tried to "shake down" Gionis for money 
before he fled to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He said Gionis' arrest was outrageous because Gionis had offered to surrender 
whenever he was wanted. "They're cowboys, just cowboys," McMillan said of the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said the police are stretching credibility when they connect the $40,000 
that Gionis paid Gal with the attack itself. Graham said Gal had been retained 
to watch Wayne every day she had custody of the child. The surveillance went on 
for months, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Add up what it takes to do that much surveillance, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
every day," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans, declined to comment on 
the Gionis case other than to compliment Newport Beach police on their 
"thorough investigation" and "excellent job."

PRESIDENT SEEKS CLASSROOM REALITY FOR EDUCATION PLAN 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, moving to back up his campaign pledge to become the "education 
President," dispatched to Congress on Wednesday a $441-million program intended 
"to make excellence in education not just a rallying cry, but a classroom 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would put into effect elements of the education platform that 
Bush focused on during the presidential campaign, including cash awards for 
"merit" schools and top teachers, new science scholarships, promotion of magnet 
schools and "alternative" certification to allow experts who lack training as 
teachers to work in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But critics immediately charged that the new measure does not make up for 
inadequate Administration support for education programs already in place. 
</P>
<P>
In his proposed budget for the 1990 fiscal year, Bush sought no increase over 
1989's level of $21.9 billion, in effect allowing a reduction because there was 
no adjustment for the anticipated inflation of 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shell game," said Bill Honig, state superintendent of public 
instruction, in a telephone interview from Sacramento. Of Bush's "education 
President" vow, he said: "The reality belies that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
Some Orange County educators said that they will welcome any extra money but 
added that they have grown cynical over federal promises that make barely a 
ripple in local classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't overlook the fact that we are still dealing with less money (for 
education)," Supt. Cynthia Grennan of the Anaheim Union High School District 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of how it's going to be implemented or what restrictions will be 
placed on that money, I guess I'm getting cynical in my 10 years as 
superintendent. . . . But having someone say he's the education president, or 
the education governor -- at least this puts the focus on education." 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Stapleton, an official with the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District in southern Orange County, said Bush's plan to recognize good schools 
is a luxury that the U.S. education system cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like a lot of money is being spent on beauty pageants, awards 
for schools that are doing well," Stapleton said. "We know what schools are 
good -- just give us money to help us improve the other schools." 
</P>
<P>
E.G. (Ted) Kopp, a Capistrano Unified School District board member, said 
federal funds make up less than 1% of his district's budget. "It won't put 10 
cents in every classroom," he predicted. "A great amount of it will be used for 
administrators to fill out the paper work to qualify for it." 
</P>
<P>
In a full-dress announcement ceremony, Bush and Education Secretary Lauro F. 
Cavazos unveiled the details of the education program in the White House Rose 
Garden with the 1989 National Teacher of the Year Award winner, Mary Bicouvaris 
of Hampton, Va., standing by. 
</P>
<P>
"When education is the issue and budget constraints cloud everything on the 
horizon . . . we can start by rewarding what works," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can help those most in need. We can promote choice and flexibility for 
parents and school administrators. And we can raise expectations and hold 
ourselves accountable for the results." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, responding to questions about how the program will be funded, said 
that the money will not be diverted from existing Department of Education 
programs. "I don't know where the money will come from, but that's another 
issue. These are new dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposal would establish a "presidential merit schools program" to 
reward public and private elementary and secondary schools that make 
"substantial progress" in raising students' educational achievement, reduce the 
rate of dropouts and provide a drug-free environment. About $250 million would 
be authorized for the program in 1990, $350 million in 1991, $450 million in 
1992 and $500 million in 1993. No specific amounts were set for the individual 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
The program would also create $5,000 awards "to recognize first-rate teachers 
in every state, and reward them for a job well done," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also announced a plan to award science scholarships of up to $10,000 a 
year for four years for "our best high school seniors." 
</P>
<P>
The President called for $100 million a year to help begin or expand public 
"magnet schools," which offer specialized curricula to attract students and 
offer an alternative to the traditional community public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The program would provide $25 million to the states to encourage greater 
certification flexibility for teachers and principals. The program would also 
make $25 million available in each of the next four years for grants to 
education agencies in urban areas with some of the nation's most severe drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost the endowments of the nation's historically black 
colleges and universities, the program would make $60 million available over 
four years in "challenge grants" to match private contributions.

104 SETS O.C. RECORD, AND IT WILL STAY HOT 
</P>

Orange County baked for the second-straight day Wednesday as unusual weather 
conditions sent temperatures soaring into the record books. In Santa Ana, the 
high was 104, breaking a previous high of 84 set on April 5, 1904. 
</P>
<P>
According to county historian Jim Sleeper, the 104-degree reading on Wednesday 
also became the highest April temperature ever recorded anywhere in Orange 
County. Sleeper said the county's previous all-time high reading for any day in 
April was 101, recorded in Santa Ana on April 15, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Hot, dry Santa Ana winds also made for unusually high readings elsewhere in 
Orange County: 102 in Fullerton and San Juan Capistrano, and 101 in El Toro and 
San Clemente. Only Newport Beach, aided by coastal breezes, posted nearly 
normal temperatures for the day -- a high of 81, up from a low of 56. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ontario Reaches 109 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Southland, Ontario was the nation's hot spot with a high of 
109 degrees Wednesday, and temperatures hit 103 in Long Beach and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the heat spell is expected to linger over most of the 
Southland until at least the weekend, although sea breezes could bring a slight 
cooling to coastal Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to be another hot day on Thursday, with near record temperatures," 
said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Sea breezes along the coast will be somewhat cooling on Thursday, but the 
first real relief in the heat for inland areas will not come until Saturday or 
Sunday," Dittmann said. "By Monday, there will be quite a bit of wind (in the 
Orange County area)." 
</P>
<P>
Officials for Santa Ana Unified School District, the largest in Orange County, 
announced that there would be slightly shorter class days today because of the 
continued hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
"None of our schools is totally without air conditioning, but we have 16 with 
partial air conditioning and 21 entirely air conditioned," district spokeswoman 
Diane Thomas explained. "Fans are used in classes without air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also said classes at some Santa Ana high schools are being held in shady 
areas, and elementary school children were having "quiet recesses," to 
discourage strenuous activity in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said the onslaught of summer-like temperatures may seem an aberration 
but is not totally unexpected. The season for Santa Ana winds, which blow 
desert heat toward the coast, usually lasts from September through April, he 
said, and "the later in the season they occur, the hotter the temperatures you 
get." 
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday, a strong high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere was 
stalled over the Pacific Northwest. That system, combined with a lower-level 
high-pressure system over the Great Basin states of Idaho, Nevada and Utah, was 
forcing warm air -- the Santa Anas -- to flow west toward a trough of lower 
pressure over the Pacific Ocean, Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said power usage in the Southland on 
Wednesday quickly eclipsed a record set only the day before. On Tuesday, 12,633 
megawatts were used, setting a new mark for an April day. But by 4 p.m. 
Wednesday, usage had passed 14,282 megawatts. Edison's all-time high is 15,987 
megawatts, set on a 110-degree day in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relief Sought at Beaches 
</P>
<P>
"It's all for air conditioning," said Don Bailey, regional affairs manager for 
the company. "Everybody's trying to keep cool." 
</P>
<P>
Others sought relief on Orange County beaches, under cloudless sunny skies 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of day we see in mid-July, not early April," said Lifeguard 
Jim Turner in Newport Beach, where about 45,000 people gathered at the shore to 
cool off. 
</P>
<P>
Major hospitals reported no unusual activity with heat-related ailments on 
Wednesday. But emergency room physicians at UCI Medical Center warned of 
hot-weather dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room physicians say that people should stay out of the heat, 
especially if they are very young or elderly," medical center spokeswoman 
Elaine Beno said. "People having any sort of health problems, such as heart 
disease or lung disease or being out of condition, should try to avoid being 
out in the heat. They also urged people to drink a lot of fluids during this 
hot period." 
</P>
<P>
In normally cool Huntington Beach, the temperature jumped to 90 degrees shortly 
after 10 a.m. on Wednesday,and by noon the temperature in Seal Beach was 94 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, the summer-size crowds that flocked to the beaches 
threatened to overwhelm the off-season marine safety staff, Lifeguard Lt. Steve 
Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
"With so many people coming to the beach this early, we're trying to put out 
warnings because we don't have as many lifeguards this time of year," Davidson 
said. "We're operating at a skeleton staff, and so we're warning people to be 
very careful, especially since the water is colder this time of year,and it 
makes people tire easier." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department officials on Wednesday expressed concern about 
dry brush in canyon areas and predicted another early start to the fire season. 
</P>
<P>
"Red flags are not out yet because fortunately there haven't been strong winds 
so far with this hot weather," Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond 
said. "We've been pretty fortunate so far. But it's very dry, and anything will 
burn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're warning people about matches and cigarettes. It looks as if we're not 
going to get any more rain (for the season), and so we face another critical 
year of extreme fire hazards." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, Wednesday's heat wave seemingly bullied everything in 
its path, from car engines to hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
At the Charles Ross Hair Design School in West Los Angeles, the few customers 
who braved the blistering heat to keep appointments arrived with 
weather-induced emergencies. They came with their flips flopped, with do's that 
didn't and sideburns that did, power bobs that lost their juice and permanents 
well on their way to becoming temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"Their hair designs are wilted," said William Towers, an instructor at the 
school. "When they start to sweat, the sweat relaxes the hairdos and they 
collapse. . . . We can fix them up in here, but when they get outside, they're 
on their own."

CITY WON'T APPEAL SLOW-GROWTH RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed not to appeal a judge's ruling 
that struck down the city's slow-growth initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald in February ruled the initiative, 
Measure X, unconstitutional. It officially became invalid March 10. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, brought against the city by Verde San Juan Estates General 
Partnership and Kaiser Development Co. in January, claimed that the measure 
required developers to build all the streets in their projects as well as deal 
with traffic problems on the city's existing roads. 
</P>
<P>
Measure X passed by 379 votes in the city on Nov. 8. It is identical to Measure 
A, the countywide slow-growth plan that failed on the June ballot, and San 
Clemente's Measure E, which passed last June but also was declared 
unconstitutional.

A Santa Ana man suspected of kidnaping his former girlfriend from her Santa Ana 
home was being returned to Orange County on Wednesday after he was picked up by 
authorities in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Cuong Tran, 18, was being held on suspicion of kidnaping and assault 
with a deadly weapon in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged kidnaping occurred Monday at 8 a.m. when 17-year-old Trang Nguyen 
was abducted from her home in the 1000 block of W. Central Ave., according to 
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. She said that Nguyen, who was not 
harmed, was reunited with her family Wednesday. The girl was in the car with 
Tran at the time of his arrest.

SCHOOL DISTRICT WON'T BUILD IN TUSTIN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Unified School District board of trustees has abandoned a 
controversial plan to build a new high school within Tustin Unified School 
District's boundaries, choosing instead a northern Irvine site that had been 
considered previously, district officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Tustin was very opposed to the plan . . . caused us to consider 
choosing an alternate site," said Corinne Riave, facilities planning 
coordinator for the Irvine district. 
</P>
<P>
Board members voted unanimously against the 40-acre Tustin site at the 
intersection of Culver Drive and Irvine Boulevard, Riave said, explaining that 
Tustin Unified's opposition would have delayed plans, thereby jeopardizing 
Irvine's chances of obtaining state funding for construction of the new school. 
</P>
<P>
The new site, one of four Irvine locations rejected by the school district in 
January because of community opposition, is at the northwest corner of Yale 
Avenue and the proposed Portola Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
To secure a $25-million bid for state funds, Riave said the school district 
plans to purchase the site and make arrangements with the Irvine Co., which 
owns the land, to exchange it if it later is found inappropriate by residents 
or the school board. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, construction of the school, which will cost an estimated $50 
million, should begin between 1992 and 1994 and serve about 2,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Ross, superintendent of Tustin Unified School District, who had 
complained that an Irvine school would attract his district's students and 
interfere with his district's future plans for a new high school about 2 miles 
away, said he was pleased that the problem had been resolved at this level. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is in the best interest of everyone involved," Ross said.

Pair of robberies: Two Orange County branches of the Bank of America were held 
up Wednesday with the robbers in both incidents escaping on foot, authorities 
said. At 11:15 a.m., the branch at Brookhurst Street and Slater Avenue in 
Fountain Valley was robbed of an unknown amount of money when a man presented a 
note to the teller stating he had a gun, according to Fountain Valley police. 
The robber was described as a white man in his 20s, with a medium build and 
short blond hair. An hour later, another bank branch in the 1800 block of West 
Orangethorpe Avenue in Fullerton was robbed of an unknown amount of cash by two 
men, Fullerton Police Sgt. Jeff Roop said.

LONGTIME LAGUNA BEACH RESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
JOAN SELZNICK, OF THE MOVIE FAMILY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Selznick, a member of one of Hollywood's most celebrated families, died at 
her Laguna Beach home, a family spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Orange County coroner's office said Selznick, 58, was found 
dead at her residence March 28. A preliminary autopsy report says that she had 
died of natural causes March 27. The coroner's office is waiting for 
toxicological tests to be completed, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Joan Selznick to agent Myron Selznick, who helped launch the 
careers of some of the biggest names of the silent screen, including Olive 
Thomas, Constance Talmadge, Owen Moore, Lew Cody, Bert Lytell, Corinne Griffith 
and Marjorie Daw. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Selznick married Daw, Joan's mother, but they were divorced in 1942, 2 
years before he was to die in his mid-40s of an internal hemorrhage. Joan was 
14 at the time and living in the East with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Changes 
</P>
<P>
Joan had changed her name several times, however. The name listed on the death 
certificate is Frances Whitcomb, said Geoffrey Selznick, a cousin of Joan and a 
film producer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Selznick said Joan had been married and divorced twice and that "for 
reasons we don't know" took the name of Frances Whitcomb. She had no children. 
She had been living in Laguna Beach for at least 20 years, he said, as a "very, 
very private person." 
</P>
<P>
"She loved it in Laguna Beach," Geoffrey Selznick said, "but she was a recluse, 
and the neighbors report that she had not been out of the house in the last 10 
to 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Selznick inherited some prime real estate from her father, including the 
corner plot in Beverly Hills now occupied by the Neiman Marcus department 
store, which is leasing the land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncle Was Producer 
</P>
<P>
Joan's uncle was producer David O. Selznick, whose most successful film was 
"Gone With the Wind," released in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
She was the granddaughter of Lewis J. Selznick, one of the film industry's 
early moguls. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that her father brought Vivien Leigh to David Selznick during the 
filming of the burning of Atlanta and told him, 'Here's your Scarlett."' 
</P>
<P>
At the time, David Selznick had tested other actresses but had not made a final 
selection for the coveted role of Scarlett O'Hara, the heroine of the story. 
</P>
<P>
The county public administrator/guardian's office has opened an investigation 
to help settle Joan Selznick's estate. The office routinely opens such an 
investigation after a resident dies alone, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Graveside services will be Saturday at Pacific View Memorial Park in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by several other cousins, including film producer Daniel 
Selznick of Los Angeles and Florence Howard of Los Angeles.

WAYNE CAMP GAINS CUSTODY AMMUNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The charge that Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis directed an attack on his 
former wife, Aissa Wayne, gives the film legend's daughter powerful new 
ammunition to attempt to regain custody of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, 
Anastasia, Wayne's attorney and family-law experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis was given sole custody of Anastasia in January when a Superior Court 
judge found that her mother was "emotionally immature" and spent little time 
with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, Judge Ronald E. Owen said, could better lead his daughter toward a 
"useful and productive future." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney E. Robert Lemkin, previewing a motion for a new custody hearing 
that he expects to file next week on Wayne's behalf, said Wednesday that the 
conspiracy charges against Gionis belie his image as a stable and virtuous 
family man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Had the Judge Fooled' 
</P>
<P>
Lemkin said of Gionis, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday: "He had the judge 
fooled. He had everybody fooled. . . . (These charges) far outweigh any of 
Aissa's shortcomings as a parent." But Gionis' lawyer, George J. Stephan, 
asserted the doctor's innocence in connection with the attack on Wayne and her 
financier boyfriend, Roger W. Luby. He said the criminal conspiracy charge 
against Gionis should have "no effect" on the emotional and prolonged custody 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
And specialists in family law stressed that a judge has broad discretion in 
determining what is in the "best interests" of a child and that criminal 
charges or convictions are not an automatic barrier to custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a person could be a bank robber or an embezzler and still be a great 
parent," said Jeri R. McKeand, who heads the family-law section of the Orange 
County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wayne's Chances Bolstered 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, McKeand and other lawyers specializing in family law agreed that 
the Newport Beach police investigation tying Gionis to the attack on Wayne and 
Luby greatly bolsters Wayne's chances for gaining a new custody hearing and 
perhaps overturning Judge Owen's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis stands accused of orchestrating the October attack, in which two 
assailants broke into Luby's $3-million Newport Beach estate and assaulted Luby 
and Wayne. The assailants slashed Luby's Achilles' tendon and threatened them. 
</P>
<P>
In March, police arrested two men who worked for a private investigations firm 
retained by Gionis. The attack's motive, police believe, centers on the dispute 
between Gionis and Wayne over custody of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne declined to discuss what impact the criminal charges against her former 
husband might have on her effort to regain custody of Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Effect on Child 
</P>
<P>
But she did say in an interview: "I'm just terribly worried about how this is 
going to affect my child's environment. . . . This is going to hurt her worse 
than anyone else. She's 2 years old. She doesn't understand now, but later in 
life, it's going to be pretty tough on her." 
</P>
<P>
Anastasia was in San Diego on Wednesday with Gionis' parents, police said. 
Aissa Wayne was to assume custody Friday, one of the mother's twice-monthly 
weekend visits. But Lemkin -- Wayne's attorney -- said he may ask Judge Owen 
for temporary and immediate custody of the child if Gionis is held in jail 
following a bail hearing scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Lemkin said he plans next week to ask Owen for a new custody hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Gionis' character, Lemkin said, the charges raise questions about O. 
Daniel Gal, a Los Angeles private detective for whom an arrest warrant has been 
issued. The last contact with Gal in the case was a telephone call from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gal was a key witness against Wayne at her custody trial, testifying that he 
had kept Wayne under surveillance for weeks and had seen firsthand her lack of 
attention to the child, Lemkin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Dramatic Twists Ahead 
</P>
<P>
If Owen grants a request for a new custody hearing, it is likely to feature 
even more of the dramatic twists that have marked the dispute since its 
beginning in mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have traded accusations. At the outset, Wayne accused Gionis of 
trying to kill her and of warning that "he would take the baby to another 
country" if he and Wayne broke up. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gionis' family countered with their own allegations that Wayne had 
harassed them and that one of her employees had pointed a loaded gun at Gionis' 
mother when she had dropped off Anastasia one day. 
</P>
<P>
And Gionis' attorneys pointed to the October attack on Wayne as an example of 
the potentially dangerous environment in which Anastasia was being raised. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lot like a three-ring circus," Lemkin said.

EL TORO'S BATTERS COME OUT BLAZING AND CAPISTRANO VALLEY IS LEFT BLISTERED, 
15-1 
</P>

<P>
El Toro High School had its hottest offensive day so far this season with a 
15-1 victory over Capistrano Valley Wednesday in a South Coast League baseball 
game at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Scott Toppo, shortstop Sean Drinkwater and center fielder David Nemeth 
led El Toro's 12-hit attack with three hits apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"We were due to put everything together, and the hitting became contagious," El 
Toro Coach Dan DeLeon said. "I wish we could have saved a few runs for our next 
game." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (11-4 overall, 3-1 in league play) scored seven runs in the first two 
innings and then put the game away by scoring eight runs in the fourth, when 13 
batters came to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Rob Johnson (5-1) shut out Capistrano Valley through six 
innings, allowing an unearned run in the seventh as El Toro moved into a 
first-place tie with Mission Viejo (10-3, 3-1) in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke it open early and then it became a laugher," Capistrano Valley 
Coach Bob Zamora said. "Our young sophomore pitcher (Chris Lugo) walked two 
batters and hit two more in the first two innings and that was very unlike 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Lugo (3-1) had walked only three batters in 28 innings, but El Toro eventually 
scored four runs in the opening two innings by capitalizing on Lugo's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkwater, breaking out of a three-game slump, hit two doubles and a single 
and drove in three runs. Nemeth scored three runs and made several nice plays 
in the outfield. Toppo had three consecutive hits and stole a base as the 
Chargers blistered three Capistrano Valley pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in the offensive display was a fine pitching performance by 
Johnson. The sophomore allowed a hit in every inning, but had the Cougars shut 
out by stranding 10 runners until an error by second baseman Chris Sauritch on 
a potential double play ball gave Capistrano Valley its only run. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Rob pitched a great game," DeLeon said. "He's a competitive kid, and 
the shutout meant a lot to him. It's unfortunate that the error cost him the 
shutout." 
</P>
<P>
In other South Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 3, San Clemente 1 -- Eric Cedarstaff (5-0) allowed four hits over 
6 1/3 innings and Steve Evans finished up for his fourth save for host Mission 
Viejo (10-3, 3-1). Jeff Hawkins had two hits and two RBIs for Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills 5, Irvine 3 -- Ricky Whipple (1-0) pitched 4 1/3 innings for the 
victory and Mark Kania finished it out to pick up the save. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills opened a 5-0 lead after three innings. Nathan Ure had a two-run 
single in the first for the Dolphins (6-8-1, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
In the Angeles League: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 3, St Paul 2 -- Tony Pena (5-0) pitched a complete game with six 
strikeouts for the victory at St. Paul. Mater Dei scored three runs in the

Carl's double. Jason Gill had an infield single and Rob Ickes walked to load 
the bases. Jeff Ciccarella drove in a run on a ground out and Jim Kelly singled 
in the third run for Mater Dei (11-3, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 4, Esperanza 2 -- Los Alamitos pitchers Todd Gragnano, Curt Graham 
and Tony Napolitano combined for a two-hitter at Esperanza. Doug Kieck had two 
hits, including an RBI double, and scored a run for Los Alamitos (7-8, 2-2). 
Jason Bates hit a solo home run for Esperanza (6-4-3, 0-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Loara 2, Cypress 1 -- Loara scored twice in the the sixth at Cypress. Jon 
Gardikis had three hits and an RBI for Cypress (1-2-1, 3-5-3). 
</P>
<P>
In the Freeway League: 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 8, Sonora 6 -- Brent Smith had a three-run triple in the fourth as 
host Sunny Hills (10-5, 4-0) scored six runs to take an 8-1 lead. Sonora came 
back to score five runs in the fifth. Brian Veronda (3-1) got the victory, and 
Ryan Frace worked the final three innings for the save. Benny Rodriguez had two 
hits, scored twice and stole two bases for Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 5, Troy 3 -- Rene Arias pitched a complete game for his fifth victory 
of the season. He also had two hits and an RBI for host Fullerton (7-6-1, 3-1). 
Troy is 8-4, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 4, Santiago 3 -- Greg Hansell (5-1) pitched a six-hitter with 11 
strikeouts for host Kennedy (11-3, 3-0). Erine Franco had two hits and two RBIs 
and Steve Rath had two hits and drove in a run for Kennedy. Enrique Brito had 
two hits for Santiago (4-7-1, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 9, Bolsa Grande 7 (eight innings) -- Host Bolsa Grande (7-6, 0-3) 
scored a run in the seventh to tie the score at 7-7. La Quinta (12-3-1, 2-1) 
capitalized on a hit batsman and a throwing error to score two unearned runs in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 5, Los Amigos 4 -- Roddy McCall hit a three-run home run in the 
sixth for Rancho Alamitos (7-5, 1-2) to tie the score, 4-4, and Chris Colbert's 
sacrifice scored Chris Singletary with the go-ahead run at Rancho Alamitos.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Estancia 6, Corona del Mar 3 -- Gabe Javage pitched four shutout innings for

teammate Clayton Nelson had an RBI double and scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
University 8, Newport Harbor 0 -- Jason Williams carried a no-hitter into the 
seventh before giving up a one-out single. That was the only hit he gave up, 
and he struck out 11 in pitching his second consecutive shutout. Bryan Smith, 
Dave Dieter and Aaron Butler each had two hits for visiting University (5-8-1, 
2-2). 
</P>

Jeremy Sherman's two-run double sparked a four-run sixth inning Wednesday to 
lead Katella High School to a 5-3 Empire League baseball victory at El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights (8-4 overall, 4-0 in league play), ranked eighth in the Orange 
County Sportswriters' Assn. poll, trailed fourth-ranked El Dorado, 3-1, when a 
single by Ken Peters and two errors loaded the bases with one out in the sixth. 
Sherman then tied the score with his double. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado starter Pete Janicki (1-1) intentionally walked Bill Fitzgerald to 
load the bases again, and then ran the count to 3-0 on Jess Evans. El Dorado 
Coach Steve Gullotti replaced him at that point with Travis Dowdell, who threw 
the fourth ball to Evans to give Katella the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Boone's sacrifice gave Katella its fourth run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado, which took a 1-0 lead in the third, saw Katella tie the game on 
Sherman's fourth-inning home run. The Hawks regained the lead, 3-1, in the 
fifth on Shane Borowski's solo home run and Dave Moore's run-scoring double. AL

CRITIC AT LARGE: '77 SUNSET STRIP': A KOOKIE LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time has a habit of getting away from you. One day you're learning to tie your 
shoes and the next day you're adjusting to bifocals. 
</P>
<P>
Driving along Sunset a couple of weeks ago I saw a construction fence around 
the long-closed restaurant -- it was once called Dino's -- that had been the 
location for the fictional joint that gave the early television series "77 
Sunset Strip" its name. 
</P>
<P>
The series had hit the air in 1958, a few months before I hit Los Angeles, so 
our histories were somehow entwined. There would be riots on the Sunset Strip a 
few years later, but for the moment the show seemed to confirm a particular 
vision of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The show's heroes were Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Roger Smith, with the late Louie 
Quinn as a side-of-the-mouth sidekick and a young, long-haired New York actor 
named Edd Byrnes as the restaurant's hip parking attendant. 
</P>
<P>
As I drove past the site, I remembered talking to Zimbalist about a piano 
sonata, I think it was, that he was composing but that he had been unable to 
get back to once his life was taken over by the series (which ran until 1964 
and established a trend in cool, hourlong adventures). 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence I had recently learned that Edd Byrnes appears in the new 
Shelley Long comedy, "Troop Beverly Hills," and we arranged to meet for lunch 
to talk about his post-"Strip" life. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes was called Kookie on the show and he did a novelty record called 
"Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb," which became a big hit. The Kookie 
characterization threatened to be one of those mixed blessings which give you 
fame, along with an image that clings like lint. 
</P>
<P>
He is now 55 but, in the enviable way actors have, looks a decade or so less 
than that. In his urbane way he suggests the owner of 77 Sunset Strip, not even 
the parking concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in his subsequent career has had the outreach, let's say, of the role 
as Kookie, but Byrnes has kept busy, working in movies and television here and 
overseas. In "Troop Beverly Hills," he plays an American actor just back from 
making films in Italy; it is typecasting of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happier now than I was when I was doing '77 Sunset Strip,' " Byrnes said 
at lunch. His son Logan, from his marriage to Asa Maynor, is now 24. Byrnes, 
who never remarried after he and Maynor separated, has a house near Venice and 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The useful legacy of the Kookie days is that it makes him an attraction in 
dinner-theater productions and summer stock and for appearances in a growing 
number of '50s nostalgia packages, including one called "Hot August Nights" 
staged at Reno a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a Warner Bros. contract player for nearly seven years at the start of his 
career, Byrnes said his first on-camera lines in a small role in "Marjorie 
Morningstar." He appeared in William Wellman's last film, "Darby's Rangers," 
and in "Up Periscope" and "Yellowstone Kelly," in which he had second billing 
to Clint Walker. 
</P>
<P>
After "77 Sunset Strip" ended, Byrnes engineered a release from his Warners 
contract to make "The Secret Invasion," a Roger Corman thriller starring 
Stewart Granger and Raf Vallone and shot in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes lived for a time in London at the start of the '70s, made commercials 
directed by Milos Forman and Richard Lester and appeared in "Stardust," one of 
David Puttnam's earliest ventures as producer, directed by Michael Apted. It 
starred rock 'n' roller David Essex and looked at the pop-music life. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Byrnes says, "There was talk of doing a new series, 'Return to 
Sunset Strip.' But Efrem and Roger wanted big money and script approval and the 
deal fell through. The last time the three of us were together was as 
presenters at the 1985 Emmys." 
</P>
<P>
It may be as well the deal fell through. "77 Sunset Strip" was very much a 
piece of its time. The breezy, adventurous series and the several near-dupes 
(e.g. "Surfside Six") Warners made of it were a phase in the evolution of 
television formats. And the show's vision of a Los Angeles, cool, cocky, 
mobile, was also a piece of time which now looks as dated as black-and-white 
television itself. 
</P>
<P>
Like Los Angeles '58, the series was a phenomenon that can be remembered

'TALK,' 'PIRATE' STATIONS WAGE WAR OVER ID TAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Radio wars are being waged these days not only over the airwaves but also in 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-AM (790) has filed a lawsuit against KFI-AM (640) over the use of its 
"talk radio" moniker, while KQLZ-FM (100.3), which dubs itself "pirate radio," 
has threatened to sue a Philadelphia-based station over that nickname. 
</P>
<P>
KABC's suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court here, accuses KFI of trademark 
infringement, saying that KABC has the sole right to use the "talk radio" label 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled Monday to determine whether a temporary restraining 
order will be issued against KFI. 
</P>
<P>
KABC said in its suit that it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972, 
"invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' KABC has 
used 'KABC Talk Radio' as its trademark and trade name since 1972 and has 
invested millions of dollars in advertising, marketing and promoting its 
services under that name and mark." 
</P>
<P>
The suit said that KABC was the only station to use the talk radio label for 17 
years and that it used the term on the air "on over 500,000 separate 
occasions." 
</P>
<P>
"Early in 1989, KFI used as its identifying name 'Talkin' Southern California.' 
In March, 1989, without obtaining authorization or consent from KABC, KFI began 
to identify itself as "Talk Radio" and/or KFI Talk Radio," the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
KFI officials said that the term "talk radio" does not belong to any one 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"We use a variety of lines to distinguish ourselves as a talk-radio station, 
but the fact remains that we are a talk-radio station, and for one station in 
the market to actually lay claim to a generic term is ludicrous," said program 
director George Oliva. 
</P>
<P>
KFI attorney Michael Bierman said that the phrase "talk radio" is generic 
because it refers to a kind of programming format used by many radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Philadelphia station WIOQ-FM reacted similarly when they received 
a letter from attorneys for KQLZ asking that they stop using the term "pirate 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
Program director Mark Driscoll said that the station uses 37 slogans. Its 
premier slogan is "renegade of the air waves," he said, and the pirate name is 
connected with its renegade image. "We give out pirate paraphernalia -- eye 
patches, planks and swords," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They have not stopped using the slogan since receiving a "cease and desist" 
letter earlier this week, he said, and do not intend to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absurd that someone could walk around and say 'pirate' is 
theirs," Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do -- go around the country and chase down everybody 
that uses 'hot,' 'power' or 'magic'?" he asked. "Are they going to sue 
everybody?" 
</P>
<P>
Eric Weiss, vice president of legal and business affairs for Westwood One, 
which owns KQLZ and only began using the "Pirate Radio" moniker March 17, said 
Wednesday that the company is seeking to stop its use in Philadelphia because 
it plans to market the KQLZ format on a national basis in the next few months.

SOME GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DEW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the young man he plays in director Michael Hoffman's off-beat comedy "Some 
Girls," Patrick Dempsey has experienced rejection where he wanted acceptance, 
and found love where he least expected it. 
</P>
<P>
In the critically acclaimed film (showing exclusively at the Beverly Center 
Cineplex), Dempsey's Michael accepts an invitation to spend the Christmas 
holidays with his girlfriend's family, only to discover when he shows up that 
she no longer cares for him. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate and confused, Michael stays with the close-knit family anyway, 
eventually receiving love and an invaluable life lesson from his girlfriend's 
elderly grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
The desire for acceptance against seemingly overwhelming odds is a feeling 
Dempsey says he has experienced often in his own life. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up, I longed for acceptance," said the 23-year-old actor, recalling 
his childhood in rural Maine. "I felt like a misfit, an outsider. I was a 
failure in school as well as socially and I'm still trying to shake some of the 
insecurity left over from that." 
</P>
<P>
Curled up barefoot in a big easy chair in the living room of his comfortable 
Santa Monica home, Dempsey appeared anything but insecure. 
</P>
<P>
Two affectionate Yorkshire terriers jumped in and out of his lap; his friend, 
Rick Stevenson, the producer of "Some Girls," jogged by the house and was 
persuaded to stay for a piece of pie; a photographer snapped pictures as he 
spoke; his wife-manager-coach, Rocky Parker, popped into the room periodically 
to offer gems of insight and wit. And Dempsey maintained an air of pleased 
contentment throughout it all. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey is quick to credit his wife of two years with his growing sense of 
security. She is a petite, vivacious woman who comes across as glowingly 
confident and not self-conscious about the fact that she is about 30 years 
older than her husband. 
</P>
<P>
With graying hair, without makeup or pretense, she makes no attempt to disguise 
her age, and though they kept their marriage secret for two years, neither she 
nor Dempsey is uncomfortable discussing their age difference. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey jokes about the fact that Rocky's three grown children are all older 
than he is and refers to one of her sons as his best friend. He also notes with 
humor that his career has been launched playing characters who have affairs 
with older women. He played Sonny Wisecarver in "In the Mood," the true story 
of a Los Angeles teen-ager who ran off with two older women (one at a time) 
during World War II, and in the upcoming "Loverboy," he plays a pizza delivery 
boy who delivers more than pizza to an assortment of lonely older women. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey and Parker met 3 1/2 years ago when both were touring in "Brighton 
Beach Memoirs". 
</P>
<P>
"We were on the road for a year," Parker said, "and since it was a young cast, 
I kind of became the mom. I had taught acting for years so we would all get 
together when we weren't working and do scenes or rent videos and watch old 
films." 
</P>
<P>
"That 'mom' word scares me a little bit," Dempsey interjected, teasingly. 
</P>
<P>
She laughed, "Well, I've been a mom for so long . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how they came to marry, Parker threw up her hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it happened," she said. "I thought it was insane when a young 
cousin of mine got involved with an older woman years ago. But then when it 
happens to you . . .," her voice trailed off. "You certainly don't look for it, 
but it teaches you to never say 'never.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I like being in a relationship with someone who's lived through more than I 
have," Dempsey volunteered. "If I was with someone my own age, I don't think it 
would work. We'd both be too inexperienced, too caught up in our own stuff. 
Rocky has helped me tremendously just by assuring me that I'm OK and not 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Childhood feelings of stupidity were not uncommon for Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I had learning difficulties that made me think I was mentally inferior," he 
said. "I was in the seventh grade before my parents found out I was dyslexic 
and by then my self-esteem was really low. Even now, I sometimes get nervous 
around very intelligent people, wondering if I'll be able to hold a 
conversation, or worried that I'll get stuck if I feel pressured to read 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to have to prepare a week in advance for a script reading. Rocky got me 
to practice reading out loud every day. She taught me to relax about it, take 
it easy. Now I do a lot of meditation to get calm, then I can go in and read it 
over once and I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
In "Some Girls," Dempsey has a film encounter with an older woman unlike any 
he's played before. The relationship that develops between his character, 
Michael, and Granny, played by Lila Kedrova (Oscar winner for her supporting 
role in "Zorba the Greek"), provides the most touching moments in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Granny, who is senile and near death, is convinced Michael is her dead husband 
come to rescue her. When she escapes from the hospital, Michael finds her in 
the snow-covered forest, wet and cold, trying to find her way to the home she 
had shared with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
He takes her to the house, gently helps her to undress, wraps her in warm 
blankets and allows her to fall peacefully asleep in the cradle of his arm. The 
next morning, he follows her to a nearby abandoned chapel where she talks to 
him (thinking he is her husband) about God and about their life together. 
Dempsey said these scenes changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Lila came on the set it was magical for me; she was so natural and 
real. While we were doing the scene in the chapel it hit me that I didn't 
really believe in God, didn't really trust, and that it has been a major 
problem throughout my life. I saw that I need to trust, to be willing to get 
out of the way and allow it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"The character I play feels lost, unconnected, because his girlfriend has 
rejected him. Then he learns from Granny that you feel wholeness in God, not in 
another person. In our society, we're led to believe that if you sleep with a 
certain amount of women, you'll find self-worth, or that if you have a gorgeous 
girlfriend, life will be perfect. But it's not true." 
</P>
<P>
In a scant two years, Dempsey has gone from an actor who couldn't get film work 
("I first had to learn how to be comfortable with a piece of paper in front of 
me -- cold readings were a nightmare") to one who enjoys the luxury of as much 
work as he wants. He's made six films almost back-to-back, and has two more 
coming out this year -- Joan Micklin Silver's "Loverboy" for Tri-Star and 
"Happy Together," (Apollo Films) a romantic comedy set for fall release. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey's directors have high praise for his ability to swing between comedy 
and drama in the same role with the ease of a much more seasoned actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know how gifted Patrick was when we signed him for 'Some 
Girls'," director Hoffman said. "I had seen glimmers but I had no idea of his 
emotional range. Because our film starts out as a comedy of sexual manners and 
then starts to look deeper, expanding out to explore family, memory, work and 
God, Patrick's role requires great range and believability. His talent for 
projecting this wonderful bemused, bewildered 'everyman' image is what made it 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Silver said she was impressed by Dempsey's talent for physical comedy, "which 
is very rare to find in a young actor. He is exceptionally inventive, 
constantly coming up with ideas. Audiences respond immediately to his innate, 
innocent charm and his fabulous use of body language." 
</P>
<P>
In "Loverboy," Dempsey delivers pizzas and romance to beautiful, lonely women 
played by Kirstie Alley, Carrie Fisher, Kim Miyori and Barbara Carrera. The 
film is a light comedy romp that allows Dempsey to demonstrate the balance and 
coordination skills he learned as a boy by mastering downhill skiing, unicycle 
riding and juggling. 
</P>
<P>
His graceful clumsiness reflects a vulnerability producer Gary Foster wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick has a Buster Keaton comedic quality that gets the audience's sympathy 
while they're laughing at his predicament," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Dempsey will play a less innocent character "with more of an edge" in 
"Coupe de Ville." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dempsey fills his days with his favorite pastime -- acting -- in a 
small studio behind his home that serves as his workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why I bought the house," he said, guiding a visitor through the 
studio. "Rocky teaches here, and we have a group that gets together to do 
scenes. I'm not into Hollywood partying. I'd much rather be here, surrounded by 
creative people who generate a positive energy. It keeps me tuned up."

DENNIS PATRICK RESIGNS AS FCC CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young, personable Los Angeles attorney who former President Ronald Reagan 
appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission two years ago 
surprised the broadcast industry Wednesday by resigning, effective as soon as 
President George Bush finds a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-page letter he hand-carried late Tuesday to White House personnel 
director Chase Untermeyer, FCC chairman Dennis R. Patrick outlined what he 
believed to be the outstanding achievements of the commission under his 
leadership, but gave no reason for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
During a 30-minute press conference Wednesday afternoon in Washington, Patrick 
reiterated his accomplishments (repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, putting caps 
on American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance rates and 
deregulation of the broadcast industry) and said only that he planned to return 
to the private sector. In his upcoming job search, Patrick said, "I haven't 
ruled out either coast or any given profession," except for politics. 
</P>
<P>
Though some broadcasters speculated that Patrick might resign with the change 
in administrations, the 37-year-old attorney affirmed as little as two months 
ago that he had no intention of quitting the five-seat commission to which he 
was first appointed in 1983. He was named chairman in 1987, replacing Mark S. 
Fowler, another Reagan appointee. Prior to his FCC appointment, Patrick had 
been a White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
Some veteran broadcasters suggested Wednesday that Patrick quit, in part, 
because of his frequent battles with Congress over his deregulatory approach -- 
an approach that has only lukewarmn support in Bush's "kinder, gentler" 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
It was a suggestion Patrick heatedly denied. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration has really been very supportive," Patrick told The 
Times after his press conference. "I sort of believe what Ronald Reagan used to 
say: If you stay in government too long, you become part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent defeat of a 51% pay hike for federal officials was a 
factor in his decision to leave, but not the deciding factor. Last month, 
Patrick's fellow commissioner James Quello publicly complained about the defeat 
of the pay raise when both the Senate and Congress voted it does on Feb. 7. As 
chairman, Patrick currently earns $82,500 a year and Quello's annual salary is 
$80,700. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect I could earn substantially more in the private sector but one doesn't 
serve in government for economic reasons," Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick said his biggest accomplishment was the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine 
-- the 40-year-old FCC policy that requires broadcasters to air programs on 
controversial issues, but he attached equal importance to the commission's 
recent action on phone companies' long-distance rates. He said the lid that the 
commission has put on rates will eventually save consumers about $900 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Under both Patrick and Fowler, the commission has moved to change the way 
broadcasters are licensed and has generally followed a deregulatory approach 
that became a hallmark of most federal agencies during the early Reagan years. 
Critics have argued that too much deregulation has led to large, longterm 
problems in a number of industries, ranging from airlines to savings and loans 
to television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick said he believes the competition that deregulation spawned was 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should draw any quick conclusions on the Bush Administration. 
I don't think we'll see any substantial stop in the flow of these issues 
because we can't . . . partially because the evolution of competition will 
drive the process." 
</P>
<P>
Since early last year, the commission has had only three members: Patrick, 
Quello and commissioner Patricia Dennis. With Patrick's announcement, there are 
now three vacancies, giving Bush the opportunity to virtually create a whole 
new commission. Some sources have blamed congressional displeasure with Patrick 
as the primary reason that appointments to the commission have been held up. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick conceded that he will probably be remembered, in part, for his strong 
stand on broadcast indecency -- an issue that blossomed the week after he took 
over from Fowler in April of 1987 when the commission censured three radio 
stations for allegedly broadcasting indecent material. Since then, the 
commission has actively pursued complaints about obscenity and indecent use of 
sexually explicit language and pictures on television and radio. One Kansas 
City TV station was fined $2,000 for broadcasting the R-rated comedy "Private 
Lessons" during prime time, but the station has never paid the fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've certainly taken a more active enforcement role in the past three years," 
Patrick said. "We've also taken some enforcement actions against dial-a-porn 
companies. I think that will be part of my legacy and I don't apologize." 
</P>
<P>
A legal challenge against the FCC's enforcement of a recent federal 
anti-indecency law was filed late last year by a coalition of broadcast and 
entertainment industry organizations and is currently pending before the 
federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.

JOTTAY PUPPETS ADDRESS SOME WEIGHTY QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vi's in hot water. She's not sleeping with her husband anymore. Her kids think 
she's a shadow of her former self and the endless news of war on her Sony sends 
her into a suburban tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
Vi's a 13-inch rod puppet -- as are most of the forlorn beings in her world. 
Pulling the strings: New York visual artist, Janie Geiser, who uses puppets to 
engage audiences about choices between involvement in social issues or passive 
alienation. 
</P>
<P>
While the former political activists from the '60s sit at home and watch 
"thirtysomething," now, at least, there are puppets to rail against wars in 
Central America and the Persian Gulf. It's a comment on a willingness to 
delegate anything unpleasant and a lesson in creative enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Geiser's seven-member Jottay Theatre ensemble will present two West Coast 
premieres -- "The House," co-written by Geiser and Neill Bogan, and "The Fish," 
based on a short story by Russell Banks -- at MOCA's Ahmanson Auditorium 
tonight. Chip Epsten's score for toy piano and electric guitar will be 
performed live. 
</P>
<P>
Why use puppets to dramatize the dilemma of choosing between what Geiser calls 
"helping only oneself" versus "also helping the world"? Wouldn't 
flesh-and-blood human beings, in all their violence and greed, be more 
appropriate for the role? 
</P>
<P>
"There's something pretty mysterious and mythic about puppets, like 
pre-classical Greek figures, that remind us about our essential humanity in a 
way that can sometimes be startling enough to get people thinking," Geiser 
replies. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the puppets, in transcending class and race differences, get at 
something eccentric and vulnerable in all of us," she says, "things that I 
think powerful people, people with a lot to lose, don't want to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Geiser believes that Vi's decision to jeopardize her cozy home life by spending 
her entire day educating herself about the worldwide wars and genocide she had 
once blocked out "may seem surreal but it's also very telling." 
</P>
<P>
Vi discovers she has the magic ability to affect the outcome of global 
conflicts by picturing them correctly in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, she forestalls plane crashes and ends conflict in the Persian 
Gulf. For Geiser's part, the implications are obvious: "In a world so 
dangerous, Vi learns that not only does she have a responsibility to be 
informed, her actions seem to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Does Geiser, 38, see any parallels between Vi and herself, the string-puller? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always dangerous to make connections between puppets and their creators," 
she asserts. "But I do think that artists occupy a privileged role in society, 
and we should use our position to try and lead ourselves out from our own dark 
ages." 
</P>
<P>
As a painter until age 30, Geiser remembers experiencing a "deep and strange 
reaction" when visiting the Center for Puppetry Arts in her native Atlanta 
(where most of Jottay Theatre's members live and work) and seeing Bread and 
Puppet Theater and puppeteer Bruce D. Schwartz perform. 
</P>
<P>
With no theatrical experience, but a desire to "make work that dealt with 
political issues and that was live," she began learning about puppets from 
scratch, discovering "a Geppetto love of puppet mechanics with rods and 
strings" she never knew she had. 
</P>
<P>
But Geiser wasn't content with Punch-and-Judy gimmicks. She began to 
incorporate much of the gestural body work she saw in the New York dance-based 
performance art scene and began overlaying live speaking roles (performed by 
members in her troupe) with the puppets' silent actions. 
</P>
<P>
These "puppet beings" -- who took on the appearance of Kabuki monsters and Paul 
Klee children -- apparently touched a nerve when first seen in New York in 
1985, and no less when Geiser dealt head-on with such controversial issues as 
plague, serial killings and the abuses of leaders who lack compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she received a Bessie Award, the equivalent of an Academy Award in 
the New York dance and performance art world. 
</P>
<P>
But Geiser bristles at suggestions that it's the visual component of her work 
that moves people the most. 
</P>
<P>
"The visuals are just a tool to get the meat," she says. "Gosh, I would hate to 
do something just because it looked nice or was pleasing to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I was painting, I was making these narrative dioramas, always 
fascinated by the story of people and the forces that surround them, like in 
Vi's case, where she finally encounters what all of us are looking for: a way 
to give our lives meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"My partners in Jottay Theatre -- who usually get little credit because they're 
behind the scenes, pulling the strings -- and I are attracted to work that 
moves closer to a more engaged relationship to the world -- even if it makes 
you despair."

WINNING PIANIST; 
</P>
<P>
FOCUS ON GIVING A GOOD PERFORMANCE -- PLUS PERSEVERANCE -- PAYS OFF THE SECOND 
TIME AROUND FOR 19-YEAR-OLD COMPETITOR 
</P>

<P>
Winning was easier the second time around for 19-year-old pianist David 
Andruss. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Andruss entered the eighth annual Young Keyboard Artists Assn. West 
Coast International Piano Competition and made it to the finals but wasn't able 
to place. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he took both first place in the Concerto Division, winning a 7-foot 
Young Chang grand piano valued at $15,000, and first place in Division 6, for 
entrants ages 18 to 20, for which he pocketed $500. In all, more than 300 
musicians competed in six divisions in the March 19-25 event at Chapman College 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
What made the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"I attended the association's summer institute," Andruss said in a recent 
interview. "I learned a lot about competitions, about what it means to become a 
performing artist and the work behind it all." 
</P>
<P>
But above that, he credits studying with Malcolm Hamilton at USC, where he 
enrolled in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everything I've heard from the time I started studying with 
Dottie Nix (in Orange) has all been a piece of advice here and a piece there, 
and I haven't really understood how they fit together. 
</P>
<P>
"After I came back this year to USC, Malcolm Hamilton helped me (take) the 
information I've been getting from all these other sources and put it together. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"Where I used to learn the notes and get tips on interpretation, now I'm more 
able to take a piece and see what it's about using the analytical skills I've 
learned at the university, and apply those principles and make my own 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "It hasn't restricted me in terms of interpretation. It's opened 
up my musical ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Andruss was born in Covina, grew up in Placentia and, in 1987, moved to 
Anaheim, from which he commutes to USC. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother tells me that I was getting up at the piano around 3 years old, 
trying to pick up things my brothers and sisters were playing," he said. "I 
started lessons when I was 4. I've been taking lessons ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-born among the siblings, Andruss has one brother and three sisters. Of 
the others, only his youngest sister, a 17-year-old soprano, is pursuing music 
professionally, studying at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
"I always loved to play and practice," Andruss said. "But in my senior year I 
really got serious about it. My teacher, Dottie Nix, started training me for 
the things I would have to do to really begin playing the piano professionally. 
Before then, it had been a matter of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Under her tutelage, he began entering competitions and waking up to the 
realities of better competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard others who were as good as if not better than I was, so I had a goal 
to look up to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He placed first in a 1986 Musical Arts Club competition, an event at Cal State 
Fullerton open only to Orange County residents. Other small awards followed. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss was cagey in his strategy, choosing the firepower Prokofiev First. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really one of my favorite concertos and also an excellent competition 
piece," he said. "This was a one-movement concerto competition, and the First 
is a chance to play the entire one movement continually. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, I get four movements in one with this concerto." 
</P>
<P>
For the Senior Division, he learned two new pieces: the Overture to Bach's 
Partita in D and the first movement of Beethoven's Sonata No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent 20 hours a week practicing the solos, in addition to school work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss said he felt he was up against challenging competitors at the recent 
contest, but he confessed that he didn't hear many of the others play. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes me too nervous," he said. "After I play, then I can go and listen 
to the others." 
</P>
<P>
The day of the finals was grueling for the young contestants: Andruss competed 
in the senior division during the day, then come back in the evening for the 
concerto finals. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tough battle," he said. "I was so exhausted. I went home to relax 
before coming back to play for the concerto. I tried to take a nap," he said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
But he did have a change in attitude to help him. "It's always been 
nerve-wracking before, going in thinking, how do I have to play to win the 
prize? But my goal has changed a little bit. Malcolm has helped me. I go in now 
trying to make music. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time I could go in and think, 'What do I need to do to make 
a good performance?' That was the goal this time. I was thrilled. I was so 
happy with the way I played." 
</P>
<P>
He is not letting winning the awards go to his head, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really sure what (winning) does for me, to be truthful," he said. "It 
feels wonderful. But at the same time I'm not sure what this means. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for me to do is go right back to work, and if opportunities 
come as a result of this, I'll be there and ready to take them. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't sit back and relax and think, 'Look what I've done.' If I do that, 
then this is really worthless." 
</P>
<P>
Andruss plans to compete in the Young Keyboard Artists Assn. East Coast 
International Competition, to be held June 26 through July 2 in Winter Park, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a lot tougher," he said. "There will be a lot of people 
from the East Coast, maybe even from the Juilliard (School of Music) prep 
school and maybe even Juilliard students because it's open to 20-year-olds. 
I've got my work cut out for me."

COSTA MESA'S FREEWAY TRIANGLE: ACCESSIBILITY WITH A CAPITAL A

<P>
For those people who rank freeway access high on their list of life's most 
important ingredients, a triangular area of Costa Mesa bordered by the San 
Diego, Corona del Mar and Costa Mesa freeways could well be Shangri-La. 
</P>
<P>
Located just south of the shopping bustle of South Coast Plaza, this triangular 
piece of real estate is home to a variety of establishments catering to the 
hectic life styles of young professionals who live or work in the area. A 
myriad of businesses including fast-food restaurants, drive-through cleaners 
and convenience stores cram the busier streets of Bristol and Baker. 
Flat-topped buildings housing light industrial or service companies face each 
other across quiet side streets. 
</P>
<P>
For business travelers in search of lodging close to clients, shopping and, of 
course, the freeway on-ramp, the area is about as centrally located as it is 
possible to get. A number of hotels, including the 486-room Red Lion Inn and 
the 227-room Holiday Inn, rim the area near its northernmost edge. 
</P>
<P>
Hemmed in by three freeways, the potential for commercial sprawl in this wedge 
of land is naturally restricted, but this has not impeded the construction of 
one of the biggest projects in the area. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Corporate Center, a 362,000-square-foot, tri-tower complex will be 
completed in late April. Asking rents for the brick-skinned structures are 
between $1.85 and $2.05 per square foot -- at least 8% higher than commercial 
rents in other sectors of the city. And, according to one commercial real 
estate market executive, the difference is largely due to (what else?) freeway 
accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that in the late afternoon of a recent weekday, the on-ramps of the 
San Diego, Costa Mesa and Corona del Mar freeways filled again with masses of 
harried motorists, while all around, the dull and ever-present roar of traffic 
filled the air.

The attempts to ban so-called assault rifles is just the latest in a series of 
controversies involving firearms. Police officers have complained, for example, 
that they are being outgunned. And while no one can be sure what the bad guys

DISCOVERY: CULTURES LIVE IN HARMONY AT MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So you've invited the gang over for your bimonthly Greco-Israeli, 
Egyptian-Lebanese, Armenian-style, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean potluck 
dinner and poker party, and you discover that you've forgotten the tabooleh, 
the lavash, the bagels, the grape leaves, the couscous mix and the feta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Turn up the stereo, refill the veggie tray and stall the party for a few 
minutes -- dinner can probably be salvaged, courtesy of Jack and Bonnie Saba, 
who run what may be the most ethnically diverse market and deli in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The newlywed Sabas opened their Saba's Mediterranean Market and Deli in Tustin 
about 1 1/2 years ago, with the American-born Bonnie relying on Jack's 
multicultural culinary knowledge to keep the place stocked with the sort of 
food that would probably stump the buyers for Ralphs and Alpha Beta. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Saba, born in Syria and raised in Kuwait, served as the buyer and half of 
the work force when the market and deli opened. He and his wife stocked the 
shelves with such esoterica as jars of grape leaves, tahini (ground sesame 
seeds), fava and garbanzo beans, a selection of olive oils, fig and eggplant 
jams -- many of them oddities in American markets but staples in the 
Mediterranean and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Little incongruities exist throughout the small market: stacks of Arabic pocket 
bread on top of Lebanese lavash (crisp bread) and bagels, all of which sit next 
to shelves stacked with Greek and Lebanese wine. Greek beer in a cooler 
alongside six-packs of yogurt soda. Tubs of Greek feta cheese soaking in brine 
behind a sign reminding Muslim customers that Ramadan, the Islamic holy month 
of fasting, is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
Similar signs go up at the approach of Passover and the Easter celebration of 
the Eastern Orthodox Church (in late April). 
</P>
<P>
"We have customers who celebrate all those occasions," said Bonnie, "so we have 
to keep them straight." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere are small sealed packages of exotic spices, such as very hot chili 
powder, curries, cardamom and other Eastern specialties, along with various 
grains of Bulgar wheat and various types of seeds, such as small unshelled 
melon seeds for snacking. ("The Egyptians love them," said Bonnie.) 
</P>
<P>
The deli menu is perhaps the most obvious giveaway to the lack of homogeneity: 
It features such exotic offerings as falafel (a type of vegetable burger), 
gyros, Armenian basturma and provolone cheese sandwiches, lahmajune (Armenian 
pizza), Greek salad, tabooleh (a Bulgar-based salad) and a large selection of 
Greek pastry. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural clashes are few, said Bonnie, when one is talking about food. However, 
she said, preferences do surface. 
</P>
<P>
"There are little things sometimes," she said. "Like if an Israeli person picks 
up a can and sees that it's from Lebanon, he might put it back on the shelf. 
But the feelings one way or another aren't strong. I think it's because 
everybody's at ease with Jack. There were so many foreigners in Kuwait when he 
was growing up, he was around them all."

LIFE ON WHEELS: RARE ONE-CAR FAMILIES FEEL NO HARDSHIP AND RELISH THE FUNDS 
SAVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tee time was 6:30 a.m., so he slipped quietly out of the house without waking 
her. Only hours later, sipping her morning coffee, did she realize she had 
forgotten to tell him she would be needing the car that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the car. This Newport Beach couple, who asked to remain 
anonymous, are an Orange County aberration: a one-car family. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, it's not a problem, she says. They live on the Balboa 
Peninsula, where "you can walk to any store you would need." Both in their 
early 30s, they work independently in home-based businesses, so neither of them 
commutes on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're modified hermits to begin with," she says. "Days go by when we don't 
move the car. We have no children, no clubs, no routinized activities of any 
kind. There aren't any givens on the schedule. If somebody has to use the car 
for something, we talk about it over coffee in the morning. It's pretty 
free-floating." 
</P>
<P>
They also live within walking distance of a car rental agency, which comes in 
handy "seven or eight times a year" when they both have to drive somewhere, 
such as the times he has to be in West Los Angeles at the exact time she is due 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But on this occasion, she hadn't brought up the subject the night before 
because "I expected him back by around noon." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. It was his day off and after the last hole, he and his buddies 
weren't quite ready to call it a day. There was no hurry, right? 
</P>
<P>
Her business appointment wasn't flexible; she had to be there and the time -- 7 
p.m. -- couldn't be changed. She didn't start seriously worrying until about 4. 
By 5 she started getting dressed, car or no car. At 5:45, she took off jogging 
in her work clothes -- pumps and all -- to the rental car agency more than a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just about to close when I got there," she said. "I asked them for 
the cheapest car they had. They wanted to show me the car and go over where all 
the nicks and scratches were and I just said, 'Look, does it go forward?' " 
</P>
<P>
She made it to her appointment, just in time. He made it home, only to find an 
angry note. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only time in 3 1/2 years that we've had a real problem about the 
car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine getting another car. It's just not the way that I would like 
to spend my money," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Before they moved to Orange County in 1985, these two had no car at all. They 
were Chicagoans, living in the heart of the city and managing just fine with 
public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's no coincidence that the other two one-car couples who wrote to us 
are also Back-Easties. Vincent and Genevieve Marangi, who have lived in 
Rossmoor for the past 30 years, met at the legendary Trianon ballroom on 
Chicago's North Side. And Frederick and Florence Kohler lived on Long Island in 
New York until they moved to Laguna Niguel 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Genevieve doesn't drive at all, so the Marangis end up spending a lot of time 
in the car together. But they don't mind. After all, that's how they got to 
know each other. 
</P>
<P>
After they met on the dance floor during World War II, the couple spent a lot 
of time driving around in his 1931 Model A Ford. "Gasoline back in those days 
was 8 gallons for a dollar," Vincent remembers. "So that's what you did then; 
you drove around. It was an important part of our courtship." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they drove; other times they parked. "We'd park near an airport and 
watch the airplanes at night," he remembers. "Or we'd go out to a forest 
preserve." 
</P>
<P>
It was in the car one sunny Sunday morning that Vincent popped the question. 
Shortly after that, the newlywed Marangis drove away together in that same car, 
with tin cans tied to the back bumper. 
</P>
<P>
That was 45 years ago, and Vincent, 76, says those memories -- and the memories 
that have been made since -- are a big reason he doesn't mind driving his wife 
around if she needs to go somewhere. The Ford, by the way, has been succeeded 
by a series of newer cars, from a 1945 Nash Rambler to a 1984 Volkswagen 
Quantum, which Vincent now drives. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy her company on any occasions that she wishes to accompany me," he 
said. "We enjoy each other." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Vincent says he wishes Genevieve at least knew how to drive, just in 
case. "It bothers me more now than it used to," he said. "There's always the 
possibility that something will happen to me, and I worry about what she's 
going to do then." 
</P>
<P>
He did try to teach her himself once, "about 40 years ago," said Genevieve, 68. 
</P>
<P>
They both agree that didn't work. "I was too worried she was going to scratch 
the fenders," he said. "I should have worried about her instead." 
</P>
<P>
Several times since then, he has signed her up for driver's school. But each 
time she has backed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks it up, but I don't listen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not interested in learning to drive. I'm kind of used to having a 
chauffeur," Genevieve said. "I'm very fortunate to have good friends who can 
take me places when my husband can't, so it's really not a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Their three children are grown now, but Vincent said even when they were at 
home it wasn't so difficult to be a one-car family. "The boys weren't really 
all that interested in cars," Vincent said. "They had enough girlfriends who 
had cars, so they could go where they wanted to go. Our daughter had plenty of 
people to drive her too. And kids didn't need to be driven everywhere then, 
even in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The Marangis' oldest, 44-year-old Ronald, may have overcompensated for his 
one-car childhood. "He has five cars now," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kohlers, both in their late 70s, have been a one-car family since they were 
married 55 years ago, although they both drive. They courted in a 1927 Dodge 
Roadster, complete with rumble seat (the couple who usually occupied the rumble 
seat back then have now been married 54 years, Frederick said). Now they share 
a 1974 Pontiac Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to Santa Anita Race Track together almost every Saturday," he said. "We 
go to church together, to visit friends' houses together; we shop together; we 
even make joint dentist and doctor's appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a problem. When we lived in New York, I commuted to work by 
train, so Mrs. Kohler had the use of the car all day. Now that I'm retired, we 
have no conflicts because we sort of plan for that in all our dates. We're 
usually together when we do anything special. When I go out and play golf, I 
ride along with some of the other guys. And if she goes to a women's club 
meeting, I drop her off and then pick her up later, or she gets a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be silly to have two cars," Frederick said. "We only need 
one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's for You! (Or Is It?) 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a phone in your car? If so, we would like to know why you decided 
to go cellular. If not, tell us why you prefer to remain incommunicado on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watch Out! Slow Down! Turn Left! 
</P>
<P>
So many of us drive solo in Orange County that back-seat driving is becoming a 
lost art. But we would like to acknowledge it by searching for the county's 
best -- and worst -- back-seat drivers. Tell us about your favorite candidate 
for either category.

A PALL AT THE 'PREDATORS' BALL'; 
</P>
<P>
CORPORATE RAIDERS PACKED THE HOTEL FOR DREXEL'S FIRST "JUNK BOND" CONFERENCE IN 
THE POST-MILKEN ERA. BUT THE OLD ELECTRICITY WAS GONE. 
</P>

At lunchtime at the annual Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" extravaganza, the 
rich, the mighty and the famous found little white books next to their plates 
titled, "Tom Smith and his Incredible Bread Machine." 
</P>
<P>
The book is a parable in verse about a man who invents an amazing machine that 
produces bread for under a penny a loaf. He feeds the world and becomes 
tremendously rich. But he then is vilified by the press, indicted on false 
charges and cast down. The book jacket says it's about "the age-old conflict 
between the productive individual and the compulsory state." 
</P>
<P>
The point of passing out the book was lost on no one. 
</P>
<P>
As Drexel's 11th high-yield bond conference got under way Wednesday at the 
Beverly Hilton, there were few signs of contrition for the legal problems that 
have beset the firm and led to the racketeering indictment of Michael Milken, 
the man who had built Drexel's own incredible bread machine. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Milken, the former chief of Drexel's junk bond department, 
wasn't there to preside over what is known unofficially as "the Predators' 
Ball." His traditional role as keynote speaker and ringmaster for the rounds of 
financial presentations was being filled by others. But there was a record 
turnout of more than 3,000 top corporate executives and institutional 
investors. And the message was still the same: Junk bonds are great. Junk bonds 
create jobs. Corporate buyout artists and raiders help keep the American 
economy strong by eliminating waste and keeping alive the entrepreneurial 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel speakers made clear that even though Milken has taken a leave of 
absence since his indictment and is expected to permanently sever his ties to 
the firm, they aren't about to disown the man who almost single-handedly built 
the $183-billion junk bond market. John H. Kissick, the newly designated head 
of the junk bond department, referred almost immediately to Milken in his 
remarks opening the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Milken's "vision and genius" and enormous contribution to Drexel's 
growth, Kissick said that "over the coming months our thoughts will be with 
Mike" and the two other former Drexel employees indicted with him. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's chief executive, drew sustained applause at 
lunch when he mentioned Milken's absence and said: "From a personal point of 
view, we certainly miss his immense brainpower." 
</P>
<P>
The remarks were all the more remarkable because Drexel itself has agreed to 
plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million in penalties on charges 
of securities fraud and defrauding customers. The firm is under intense 
pressure from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan to publicly admit guilt 
and not minimize the importance of its guilty plea. But the decision to plead 
guilty was hardly mentioned by Drexel officials in their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Under original plans, according to well-placed sources at the conference, 
Milken was scheduled to make a surprise appearance Wednesday night at one of 
the Drexel-sponsored dinners. But Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder confirmed 
that the firm's lawyers passed word to Milken at the last minute that his 
presence at the dinner probably wouldn't be appreciated by the U.S. Attorney's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
But if Milken couldn't be physically present, many at the conference whose 
fortunes were made by his creative use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds went 
to him. Sources said Milken spent the day in an office just blocks from the 
Beverly Hilton, receiving a parade of well-wishers. More than 100 others were 
said to have telephoned. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who denies any wrongdoing and plans to vigorously fight the charges 
against him, was ensconced in an office in the same building that houses the 
Drexel junk bond department in Beverly Hills. Since he is on a leave of 
absence, he isn't officially allowed in Drexel's offices. But Milken, his 
brother Lowell and several other individuals own the building. And he was said 
to be in an office there that was separate from Drexel's rented premises. 
</P>
<P>
If Drexel's legal misfortunes were about to have an impact on the firm, there 
was little evidence of it in the crowded meeting rooms and corridors of the 
hotel. As dawn broke over the hotel Wednesday, droves of limousines had already 
deposited most of the attendees. Men in thousand-dollar suits eagerly clutched 
canvas maroon-and-white Drexel tote bags handed out with free goodies and 
schedules of events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pickens, Turner, Kravis 
</P>
<P>
There was no shortage of big names in the corporate world who were there or 
would be shortly -- including corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr., television 
mogul Ted Turner and Henry Kravis of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co. With major help from Drexel, Kravis' company recently 
completed the largest buyout in history, that of RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
And dozens of executives interviewed said they stand by the firm, that they 
think it was victimized by the government and that Drexel will remain a 
powerhouse even though Milken is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not one person, it's an entire company," said Geoffrey H. Ramsden, an 
executive at Kansas City-based Ferrell Cos. Referring to the $25-billion RJR 
Nabisco deal, he said: "They've just completed the largest debt offering in the 
history of corporate finance. The organization has transcended Michael Milken." 
</P>
<P>
Although the annual conference is noted for extravagance and lavish 
entertainment that in past years included Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross and Dolly 
Parton, the real purpose is to conduct business. Corporations that raise 
capital by issuing junk bonds put on presentations to institutional investors 
who buy them. Big companies in a single meeting get to make a presentation to 
what is undeniably the biggest assemblage of junk bond buyers. And there are 
similar chances for the Cinderellas at the junk bonds ball -- the small, 
upstart companies -- to make a pitch for the money that could mean big 
expansion and success. In the side rooms and hallways, Drexel employees stand 
by to sign up deals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Junk Will 'Clearly Survive' 
</P>
<P>
Comparing this year's conference to previous years' Fredric M. Roberts, the 
head of the investment banking firm F. M. Roberts &amp; Co., said: "While there 
is a perceptible reduction in the electricity in the atmosphere, the crowds are 
clearly larger, and the amount of fundamental business being done is as great 
or greater." 
</P>
<P>
He said this is an indication that "the business is now institutionalized, and 
that it will clearly survive any individual." 
</P>
<P>
And while some at the conference admitted that they had been shocked by the 
amount of Milken's annual compensation, recently disclosed by prosecutors, 
which in 1987 reached $550 million, nearly everyone interviewed voiced 
solidarity and support for him. "He's being pilloried," said Philip N. Cohen, 
chief financial officer of Integrated Resources, which has long done business 
with Drexel. "I just don't believe that somebody who was making that kind of 
money was going to bother to chisel on a couple of minor things." 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Escalante, the school teacher portrayed in the film "Stand and Deliver" 
was the second speaker at the conference, extolling the importance of 
education, a favorite Milken theme. 
</P>
<P>
And although the atmosphere was more subdued than in previous years, hype was 
still in evidence. In the center of the Hilton lobby was a six-foot revolving 
space station, modeled on something in "Star Wars," labeled "Drexel Burnham 
presents High Yield City 2089 A.D." The space station included rotating TV 
monitors promoting Drexel's clients and emitting Top 40 rock 'n' roll songs 
with special Drexel lyrics dubbed in. Above the din of investment bankers and 
corporate CEOs doing business, one could catch strains of: "Drexel makes it 
real/We've got that higher yield," and another favorite, "They built this city 
on high-yield bonds."

LOCAL PUMP PRICES LEVEL OFF; ALASKA TANKER NEARS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prices at the gas pump in Los Angeles showed signs of stabilizing Wednesday as 
the first Atlantic Richfield tanker from Alaska to reach California since the 
March 24 oil spill prepared to dock today in Long Beach and more crude oil and 
gasoline steamed this way from other ports. 
</P>
<P>
Industry and government officials said Southern California could even face an 
oil glut and a steep drop in prices in two to three weeks as extra oil, lured 
by the fat prices commanded for petroleum in the region since the oil spill, 
arrives along with regular Alaska shipments. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, some critics said, business operators at several levels of the 
intricate commercial oil network -- with the exception of some gasoline station 
dealers -- have profited handsomely from what most describe as an unwarranted 
price run-up. 
</P>
<P>
"The only ones who were hurt were the otters in Alaska and the consumers in 
California," said Fereidun Fesharaki, an expert on Pacific Rim oil trade at the 
government-funded East-West Center in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The prices charged by area refiners remained flat for a second straight day, 
while futures prices for gasoline contracts traded on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange tumbled by 3 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield said the Arco Alaska, carrying 1.3 million barrels of crude, 
was due to reach Long Beach today to replenish stocks at Arco's 
230,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Carson and an adjacent Shell refinery, which 
Arco also supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Traders hoping to cash in on the inflated local prices bought up cargoes of 
crude from Ecuador, Mexico and the Far East to supplant the anticipated 
shortfall in California, which normally gets nearly all its oil from Alaska and 
its in-state oil fields. Meanwhile, the California Energy Commission estimated 
that 2 million barrels of gasoline was also bound for California. 
</P>
<P>
The energy commission said the influx of oil could lead to a temporary glut and 
a tumble in prices in two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles oil trader said: "A lot of traders have gone out and acquired 
cargo, speculating that the market will continue to go up. The first guys will 
make a fortune, but the later cargoes might overtake the market. They might get 
here and find the Alaskan crude is flowing again." 
</P>
<P>
The flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline reached its full capacity of 
2 million barrels per day Wednesday and was replenishing storage tanks in 
Valdez, the port near where an Exxon supertanker struck a reef and spilled 10 
million gallons of crude oil. But tanker traffic from the port was interrupted 
once again while the tanker Valdez was being refloated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crude Unproduced 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12 million to 14 million barrels of crude oil went unproduced 
since the spill because tanker traffic was halted and then only partially 
resumed. The interruption led to cutbacks at three large West Coast refineries 
as Arco, Exxon and BP America told dozens of customers they would be unable to 
supply all the oil that was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis Ekloff, a former Exxon official who is now analyst at Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates, said crude oil inventories at the time of the spill 
were normal in the five-state Western region and "could be drawn down by at 
least 12 million barrels without encountering operational problems." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of any true shortage, analysts and industry and government 
officials said the fear of shortages, coming on the heels of steadily climbing 
crude oil and gasoline prices and near-capacity operations at refineries here 
and elsewhere, touched off panic, greed and other responses.

<P>
One week before the oil spill, the Los Angeles market had been hit by a 
particularly steep run-up in wholesale gasoline prices that wasn't duplicated 
anywhere else, trade publications suggest. Independent refiners boosted the 
prices they charge for gasoline by a full dime, to 72 cents a gallon, in the 
six days before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant James McDonald said this set the Southern California market apart, 
and he said it was caused by one of the occasional maneuvers by major oil 
companies to squeeze independent dealers by tightening supplies of the gasoline 
they normally sell "out the back door" of their refineries to independent 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
With distributors suddenly short of supplies, independent dealers had to 
scramble for alternative sources of gasoline. This was already happening at the 
time of the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The independent refiners saw them coming, and they jacked up their prices," 
said McDonald. "So they were having this private war and then Alaska fell right 
into their laps. Since then, everybody's been making hay." 
</P>
<P>
Prices charged by independent refiners soared by an average 27 cents a gallon, 
while prices charged by major brand refiners climbed just 10 cents on average 
in the 10 days after the oil spill. That stacked the deck against independent 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm paying $1.13 a gallon to my distributor for gasoline and the Chevron 
dealer down the street is selling his for $1.03," said Bernie Svalstad, owner 
of Campus Gas in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
That imbalance creates an opportunity for price increases by the majors -- for 
the stated purpose of closing the gap between major and independent stations so 
that motorists don't all converge on the major brand station and empty its 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
An Arco spokesman said, "If you stay too far below the market in a 
low-inventory situation, you're dead." Consultant McDonald called that "a 
legitimate concern, and they cry all the way to the bank."

CONGRESS BEGINS DESIGNING BAILOUT OF THRIFT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress begins the delicate and complex task today of fashioning the biggest 
financial rescue in history, the bailout of the savings and loan industry, 
under the threat of a possible presidential veto if it tampers with key 
provisions of the plan proposed by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady warned Wednesday that he will consider 
recommending that President Bush veto the bill if Congress weakens the 
Administration's proposed tough new capital requirements for S&amp;Ls or if it 
includes the full cost of the rescue in the federal budget. Such actions, Brady 
told reporters, would be "terrible mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
But Congress is determined to put its own stamp on the legislation, which is 
necessary to raise the money needed to close or sell 500 insolvent institutions 
across the country and make good on federal insurance of individual deposits up 
to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shifting Cost to States 
</P>
<P>
Members of a House Banking subcommittee have prepared 97 proposed amendments to 
the Bush plan, which would cost an estimated $157 billion over its first 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the amendments are proposals to require California and Texas, homes of 
the biggest S&amp;L failures, to pay some of the financial cleanup costs. 
However, these amendments do not appear to have majority support within the 
House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Brady expressed greater concern Wednesday about proposals in Congress to 
postpone or dilute the requirement that S&amp;Ls maintain capital reserves 
equal to 6% of their assets beginning in 1991, compared to 3% now. Capital 
reserves consist largely of stockholders' equity, retained earnings and cash; 
the assets are mostly loans. 
</P>
<P>
Brady contended that the tougher capital requirement is essential to ensure 
that the S&amp;L crisis will "never happen again. If we give way on the capital 
part, we're really asking for it." 
</P>
<P>
But the S&amp;L industry, while stripped of much of its political credibility 
by the present financial crisis, apparently retains enough influence to wage a 
determined battle against the tighter financial standard. 
</P>
<P>
Sympathetic members of Congress have prepared amendments giving thrift 
institutions additional time to meet the stricter capital standards. Industry 
executives argue that as many as 1,000 of the nation's solvent 3,000 S&amp;Ls 
could disappear because they would be unable to raise the additional funds 
necessary to meet the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking a Clean Bill 
</P>
<P>
Brady also warned that financing the S&amp;L bailout with a one-time, up-front 
appropriation, which would show up entirely on the federal budget, would "make 
a fool out of" the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has recommended that much of the cost of the bailout be met 
through a $50-billion bond sale by a new government corporation, with only the 
annual interest costs appearing as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) has proposed 
using direct federal financing instead, even though the full cost would 
immediately be part of the budget. The annual interest expenses would be an 
estimated $4.5 billion less over 30 years, he says, because the Treasury 
Department can borrow money more cheaply than the new government corporation 
could. 
</P>
<P>
But Brady told reporters that the benefits would be more than offset because 
Riegle's approach would swell the federal deficit, which in turn would boost 
prevailing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Brady's warning of a possible veto, Congress does not seem prepared to 
swallow a so-called clean bill -- the Administration's proposal without change. 
</P>
<P>
"What may be a clean deal for the regulators and the industry may well be a 
dirty deal for the public," said House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.) "A clean bill, by my definition, is one that balances public 
costs with public benefits. Let's have that kind of clean bill." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has proposed several amendments that would make mortgage loans at 
subsidized low rates available for people with low and moderate incomes. He 
also wants to use vacant homes and apartments acquired from insolvent S&amp;Ls 
to help alleviate homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue in Congress will be the Administration's proposal to jack up the 
fees paid by S&amp;Ls for their federal deposit insurance. The S&amp;L industry 
has enlisted Riegle's support for requiring banks to pay as much as S&amp;Ls by 
the year 2000 for their federal insurance on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;Ls now pay an annual fee of $2.08 for every $1,000 in deposits, compared 
with bank payments of only 80 cents per $1,000. The Bush plan would narrow the 
gap by eventually bringing S&amp;Ls down to $1.80 and banks up to $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
The premiums support the deposit insurance funds, which guarantee the safety of 
accounts up to $100,000. The insurance fund for banks is in strong financial 
shape, but the S&amp;L fund lacks the cash it will need to close crippled 
institutions and pay off their depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort proposed by the Administration would draw cash from the 
S&amp;L and bank industries and from taxpayers to buttress the insurance fund 
and dispose of insolvent S&amp;Ls.

REGULATORS IN 3 MIDWEST STATES SEEK CONTROL OF MAXICARE UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State regulators in the Midwest said Wednesday that they have formally moved to 
have Maxicare Health Plans Inc.'s operations in those states dismissed from the 
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
If the motion filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana is successful, 
Maxicare Health Plans of the Midwest Inc., which operates the company's health 
maintenance organizations in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, could be controlled by 
those states. The states could force a liquidation of the plans if they decide 
that is the best way to protect members and ensure payments of debts owed to 
medical-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Maxicare released a preliminary financial report showing that 
it lost $267.8 million in 1988. The company said the report reflects operating 
results only; Maxicare doesn't yet know how it will treat the effects of the 
Chapter 11 proceedings. The company reported revenue of $1.67 billion for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare also said it no longer intends to sell its California HMO, which 
analysts have said it should retain to rebuild the company as a profitable 
concern in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Option to Switch 
</P>
<P>
On yet another front, Maxicare was trying to stop employers from allowing 
Maxicare members to switch to other health-care plans. Some employers have 
decided to give their employees the option immediately to remain with a 
Maxicare plan or switch to another medical plan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which represents federal employees, 
recently sent a notice to employees in several states explaining Maxicare's 
financial problems and saying that employees have the option to switch, said 
spokesman Dick McGowan. Xerox Corp. also has informed Maxicare members that 
they have the option of switching to the in-house Xerox Medical Plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Some employees are anxious to move out of Maxicare. Others are not," said 
Patricia Nazemetz, Xerox's director of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare spokeswoman Tobi Nyberg said the company believes that the OPM is 
violating a federal court order obtained shortly after the March 16 bankruptcy 
filing. The company intends to seek a restraining order against OPM, she said, 
but not enough is known about the Xerox situation to take action. 
</P>
<P>
The March 16 order bars doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers from 
refusing to treat Maxicare members solely because of the company's past-due 
debts. Such orders are typical in Chapter 11 cases in which companies seek to 
prevent suppliers of essential goods and services from shutting them down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Attorneys 
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said Maxicare believes that the order also prevents employers from 
changing their normal group insurance enrollment periods to allow employees to 
leave Maxicare. Typically, employers have open enrollment periods once a year, 
usually in January, to allow employees to switch plans if they choose to do so. 
Some employers also hold special open enrollments to accommodate special 
circumstances. Both Xerox and OPM said their actions can't be characterized as 
open enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers have moved cautiously in advising employees on whether they can 
switch. But several are known to be consulting with attorneys on whether the 
court order applies to them. 
</P>
<P>
The issue may end up in court, said Robert F. Atlas, a Washington health-care 
consultant who advises employers on group health plans. "There is nothing in 
employers' contracts with HMOs that says they can't allow employees to switch. 
There is nothing that says they have to guarantee a minimum number of members." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge from state regulators is a serious threat, Atlas said, adding 
that bankruptcy court control is Maxicare's best chance for survival as a 
corporation. If state regulators are in control, the corporation's survival 
will be their least concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
State control might be the best option for "the greater good," Atlas said. "If 
the bankruptcy goes through and Maxicare is not able to recover, a lot of 
members will be left out in the cold. Doctors and hospitals will end up eating 
a lot of losses if that happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators argue that the plans in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana are 
insurance companies, which are prohibited by federal bankruptcy law from filing 
under Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the three states agreed to delay pressing their case in court while 
Maxicare attempted to place the members in other plans. Arnold Dutcher, 
Illinois deputy insurance commissioner, said the motion was filed because 
Maxicare didn't seem to be moving quickly enough to sell the plans. "We filed 
to get in line on what looks like is going to be a very crowded court docket 
regarding this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Trying to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Only Illinois and Indiana officials actually filed the motion, but Ohio also 
would be governed by the ruling. Ohio Deputy Insurance Commissioner Neil Rector 
said the department didn't formally join the motion because it believes that 
Maxicare is very close to a deal to sell the Ohio membership. 
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said Maxicare isn't actively trying to sell any of the Midwest plans 
because it wants to remain in the states. "There was no agreement. This was 
their idea," she said. However, she said, Maxicare has been negotiating with 
Ohio officials and, as a "show of good faith," agreed to consider bids for the 
Ohio plan that were solicited by Ohio officials. "We're not ruling out the 
possibility that the plan will be sold. Some of the bids may make sense for 
us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dutcher said Maxicare Midwest, with a membership of about 250,000, lost $12.3 
million in 1988. "All of it occurred in the first three quarters. The fourth 
quarter was a break-even quarter with the profits in Indiana and Illinois equal 
the losses in Ohio," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare's California plan lost about $4.2 million in the first nine months of 
1988, according to the latest available records from the State Department of 
Corporations. Nyberg said the company decided to keep the unit because the 
Chapter 11 filing had solved some cash flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Maxicare has sold its Tucson, Ariz., plan and shut down the 
Phoenix operation. About 12,000 Phoenix members were transferred to 11 other 
HMOs, Nyberg said. Currently, the company has entered into agreements to sell 
its Seattle and Alabama units. Maxicare now has about 900,000 members 
nationwide.

FIRST INTERSTATE JOINS OPEN-SATURDAY CLUB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
First Interstate Bank joined the herd Wednesday, announcing that its 321 
branches statewide will be open on Saturdays, beginning in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based bank was the last of the state's five biggest banks to 
decide to open its branches on Saturdays. The hours will be from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m. and the branches will offer full services. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past week, Bank of America, Security Pacific, Wells Fargo and Union 
Bank all have announced plans to open their branches on Saturdays, beginning 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate said its move to Saturdays was in response to customer surveys 
and to the decision by the other big California banks to increase their 
business hours. Many smaller independent banks have maintained Saturday hours 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate said additional branch employees may be hired, but that staff 
costs are not expected to increase significantly. First Interstate is in the 
midst of a companywide cost-cutting campaign. 
</P>
<P>
While the other four banks also have extended their weekday hours, First 
Interstate did not and will continue to be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday 
through Friday.

Citizens &amp; Southern Corp.: The Atlanta-based financial services firm said 
first-quarter net income rose 19% to $57.8 million over a year ago. The results 
reflect a return on assets of 1.11% and a return on average common equity of 
18.28%, the firm said, up sharply from a year ago. C&amp;S said: "The strength 
and momentum of our community-based franchise is evident in our strong earnings 
and excellent return measures this quarter. This performance is clearly at the

BUSH'S THIRD-WORLD DEBT PLAN FACES HURDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a series of recent endorsements, the Bush Administration is facing an 
uphill fight in its efforts to launch its new plan to solve the Third World's 
debt problem. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank threw their 
support behind the plan Tuesday, two days after finance ministers of the seven 
major industrial nations signed on. But their support was lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got some serious problems ahead," Alan J. Stoga, a debt analyst at 
Kissinger Associates, said of the Administration's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which some officials had hoped would contribute $10 billion to the 
effort, announced that it would allocate only $4.5 billion. West Germany, which 
harbors major doubts about some provisions of the U.S. plan, has declined to 
ante up any new money. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical European finance ministers limited the amount that the IMF and World 
Bank can divert for Third World debt relief. And the United States is under 
serious budget constraints of its own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Big Banks 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration will also need to pressure the big U.S. banks to step 
up -- or at least maintain -- their current levels of lending to Latin American 
debtor nations. But U.S. bankers have served notice that they are not eager to 
increase their lending to Latin American countries and do not want to write 
down the value of their existing loans without attractive sweeteners from 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Administration faces opposition within the Federal Reserve Board 
to easing bank regulations and accounting rules to make it easier for 
commercial banks to discount their Third World loans. The Fed has already 
rejected suggestions that it penalize banks that do not go along with the 
Administration plan. 
</P>
<P>
The debt plan, written by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, is still in 
outline form, and the Administration must work out enough details by July to 
win endorsement from the heads of government at the annual seven-nation 
economic summit conference in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
To make its plan credible, the United States must also move quickly to apply it 
to some specific "test" cases. Mexico, Venezuela and the Philippines are the 
primary candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady plan marks a major turning point in management of the Third World 
debt problem. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the United States sought to spur more bank lending to help 
Third World debtors pay their bills, an approach that helped debtor nations 
stave off default but also inevitably resulted in increasing their debt 
burdens. The Brady plan seeks to reduce their debts. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the proposal would provide new ways to encourage banks to discount 
a portion of their Third World loans and to exchange them for new long-term 
bonds that debtor countries would provide with guarantees by the World Bank. 
The Administration had also hoped for more from Japan and a significant 
contribution from West Germany to supplement the World Bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the formal endorsement by the World Bank and the IMF earlier this week, 
the plan has received something of a lukewarm reception from individual 
creditor and debtor countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven major industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, West 
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- approved the proposal in 
principle but expressed reservations about several key specifics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Unrest 
</P>
<P>
Both British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and West German Finance 
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg were publicly critical of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from the Latin debtor countries was mixed. Although Brazilian Finance 
Minister Mailson Nobrega called the Brady proposal "a major conceptual 
breakthrough," he warned that "the question remains: Where will the necessary 
resources come from?" 
</P>
<P>
And some Latin American officials have privately expressed chagrin that the 
Brady plan would offer debt reduction to do-nothing governments as well as 
those that have made sacrifices to restructure their economies. Brady offers 
debtor countries no incentives, these critics say, to adopt necessary but 
unpopular austerity measures such as tighter budget and monetary policies. 
</P>
<P>
What worries critics most is that, for all of Brady's efforts, the proposal may 
not provide enough relief to help Latin American countries back on their feet. 
Instead, they fear, it could tighten the economic squeeze in the region and 
exacerbate the political unrest already developing there. 
</P>
<P>
"These ideas raise new hopes. They should be translated into immediate action," 
Brazil's Nobrega told the IMF delegates earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Brady told reporters Wednesday that the Administration was not troubled by the 
criticism. "Now's the time to light a candle rather than curse the darkness," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said Wednesday that Treasury officials have already "been talking to a 
number of countries" about qualifying for the new debt-reduction plan and were 
hoping to move quickly to negotiate agreements with specific countries and to 
iron out the program's details. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has already submitted its own proposal, combining Brady's debt-reduction 
scheme with a request for a major new lending package from commercial banks. 
And Venezuela is drafting a plan of its own. 
</P>
<P>
But as Brady concedes, time is of the essence. Several major Latin American 
governments are facing elections this year in which leftists or populists have 
early leads, and a series of victories there could lead to reversals of 
economic restructuring programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial," Nobrega said this week, "that such new hopes do not give place 
to new frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
MOST INDEBTED NATIONS 
</P>
<P>
The 17 countries classified as highly indebted by the International Monetary 
Fund owed more than a half-trillion dollars at the end of 1988. Five of them 
account for two-thirds of the total debt. 
</P>
<P>

SIMMONS CUTS HIS LOCKHEED STAKE TO 4.2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Harold C. Simmons, the corporate raider who disclosed only Monday that he held 
a 5.3% stake in Lockheed, sold off 200,000 shares Tuesday, cutting his 
ownership to 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons had reacted negatively to a restructuring announced by the big 
aerospace firm Tuesday, in which the firm created an employee stock ownership 
plan and accelerated plans to sell certain assets. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday after the New York Stock Exchange closed, Simmons said: 
"I am considering selling some or all of my stock." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. At the time of the interview, Simmons had apparently already sold two 
blocks of 100,000 shares each, one for $48.75 a share and the other for $48.87 
a share for a total of $9.8 million, according to a filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
When Simmons disclosed his 5.3% holding in Lockheed, some analysts expected 
that it might prompt a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said Tuesday that the company already had 
that idea and had been planning the overhaul since last fall. According to 
Lockheed, it was a coincidence that Simmons' disclosure was made the day before 
Lockheed planned to announce its restructuring, which will result in employees 
obtaining a 17% share of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're giving stock to the employees, that's obviously not good for the 
public shareholders," Simmons said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since his holdings have fallen below the 5% mark, Simmons is no longer required 
to disclose his actions with regard to Lockheed, headquartered in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' disclosure of his Lockheed holdings on Monday sent the share price up 
$3, but the stock dropped back $2 on Monday. It closed Wednesday at $46.675, 
down another $1.125.

DAVIS PROMISES NO BREAKUP OF NORTHWEST AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil and real estate tycoon Marvin Davis pledged Wednesday not to "bust up" 
Northwest Airlines if its parent company accepts his $2.6-billion takeover 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our planned financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the company's 
strategic assets," the Los Angeles millionaire said in a letter to NWA Inc.'s 
directors. In fact, he said, "our plan is to expand NWA's operations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NWA's shares rose on rumors that a second buyout proposal, valued at 
about $105 a share, was in the works by unidentified investors. Kevin Whalen, 
an NWA spokesman, said the company had not received a second offer. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Davis did not say how he would finance the full purchase but 
said he would use some of his own money in the deal. He also seemed to suggest 
that he would sell NWA's valuable Japanese real estate, which is not crucial to 
the airline's operations. Airline analysts have estimated that Northwest's 
Japanese properties are worth at least $300 million, perhaps as much as $600 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see him doing anything to weaken the airline too badly," said Louis A. 
Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with the investment firm of Janney 
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. He said Davis' letter "puts the onus on the 
NWA board to come up with a definitive reason for not considering his offer." 
Whalen said NWA would make no comment on Davis' letter. He said the board would 
meet soon to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, NWA shareholders are being asked to vote on a measure that 
would give NWA employees 90 days to come up with a counteroffer for the company 
in the event of a takeover. NWA's directors recommend a vote against the 
proposal "because it gives us less flexibility when considering offers," Whalen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Davis said he would go ahead with Northwest's plans to buy 
much-needed, new aircraft. NWA has orders and options on 148 aircraft, worth 
$7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' letter seemed to address concerns of government leaders in Minnesota, 
where the airline is based. Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich has vowed to fight a 
takeover of the airline if it involves selling aircraft or routes or moving the 
company's headquarters from Eagan, a Minneapolis suburb.

Three D Departments Inc. is getting out of stores it doesn't own. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based retailer, which owns and operates the Three D Bed &amp; Bath 
chain, has also been leasing space in department stores for several years and 
currently operates linen and domestics departments in seven Van Leunens stores 
in Kentucky and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But it has agreed to sell Van Leunens the inventory, furniture and fixtures of 
those departments. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Three D does not anticipate any gain or loss on the sale, the company said. 
Sales in the seven leased departments amounted to about 6% of Three D's sales 
of $34.9 million in fiscal 1988, ended July 30. Net income after tax totaled 
$719,000 in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With the sale, Three D will no longer lease any departments in stores that it 
does not own, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Three D Departments Inc. stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange. MARY

CAR STEREO THEFT: SOUND THE ALARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do you prevent thieves from stealing your car stereo? Keep it under lock 
and key in the trunk? Bolt it to the dashboard? Lug it with you whenever you 
leave the car? 
</P>
<P>
Or buy one of the more expensive beeping stereo alarms or a unit with a "secret 
code" so only you can operate it? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever precautions you take with your stereo/tape deck or CD player, remember 
this: If a car burglar wants your expensive electronic gear -- and stereo/tape 
equipment can run into the thousands of dollars -- he'll probably figure out a 
way to get it, and/or your car, too, because stealing from cars is a large and 
lucrative profession. 
</P>
<P>
National law enforcement statistics show that auto theft, including theft of 
contents and accessories, is a $6-billion-a-year business in the United States. 
In 1987, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports list 2,849,944 reported thefts from 
cars -- 1,267,475 of car accessories, which include stereos, CDs, hub caps, 
etc. and 1,582,469 of auto contents, classified as golf clubs, purses and other 
valuables. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Los Angeles alone there were 56,448 burglaries from locked 
vehicles reported to LAPD. Another 13,868 thefts from "unsecured" autos brings 
the total to 70,316. 
</P>
<P>
"Stealing radios is big business," said Victor Obregon, manager of Graf 
automobile radio and alarm specialists in Hollywood. "And these guys make more 
money than we do in our jobs. They sell a $500 radio for $25. But it's the same 
way they sell drugs -- they can turn it over in minutes, so they just made 
$25-$30 on that radio in three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Who buys them? People on street corners, at swap meets," Obregon contends. 
"Somebody will buy it for $25. Even honest people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suppliers Fight Back 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, though, electronic equipment manufacturers and automobile 
companies are doing their best to try to secure your equipment, and your car, 
from thieves. 
</P>
<P>
There are stereo covers that disguise an expensive radio to look like a cheap 
one -- but most car burglars, according to police, know the fake covers from 
real radios. 
</P>
<P>
There also are cheap-looking grille covers for expensive speakers, small 
"safes" bolted to the inside of the car trunk that hold much of the CD 
equipment; stereo alarms that are rigged so that if a thief cuts the wires to 
the radio, the car horn begins to beep. 
</P>
<P>
And due out on the market in late May is a new Swedish-designed cassette alarm 
(estimated price: $29.95) being imported by Anes Electronics in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
This device locks into a cassette player with a key and has a flashing red 
light. If someone tries to remove your stereo/cassette a high-decibel alarm 
goes off and can't be deactivated without the key. If a burglar tries to pry 
the alarm device off anyway, he doesn't get anything worth selling because the 
cassette mechanism will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
You also can get special steel brackets that bolt your stereo into the 
dashboard, but many alarm installation specialists don't recommend them because 
if the burglar trys prying the brackets from the plastic dashboard, chances are 
your dashboard will crack. 
</P>
<P>
Since most dashboards are now constructed of plastic and made in one piece, 
you'll be out the radio, plus the dashboard, which costs about $400, and 
another $350 in labor to install it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Theft Units 
</P>
<P>
Among the newest and most effective protection for your stereo/cassette 
combinations are the "anti-theft" units that are coded by the manufacturers and 
require you to punch in a multi-digit security code in order to make it work. 
Thieves don't know the code, so the radio doesn't work after they lift it from 
your car. But the crook may not know it is that kind of sophisticated stereo 
and steal it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many electronic companies are now offering the "secret code" 
device (price range: $250 to $700) and since 1987, many auto manufacturers are 
equiping their higher-priced models with the "anti-theft stereos." Most come 
with window stickers warning the thief that the stereo will not work without 
the proper coding. 
</P>
<P>
But you run the risk that the car burglar might not be able to read English or 
might believe the sticker is a fake and break into your car anyway. 
</P>
<P>
If the crook gets your coded radio, it is virtually useless to him. There are 
ways to bypass the code and reprogram the unit, according to Graf's Obregon, 
but that process costs about $200, far too expensive for most car burglars. 
</P>
<P>
Peugeot is among several auto manufacturers now fitting its cars with the 
"anti-theft radios." 
</P>
<P>
"They can't call Peugeot and get the code number," said Morrie Karpoff, general 
manager of Peugeot Dealer of North Hollywood. "They keep those codes locked in 
files at Peugeot and no one can get the code unless he's the owner of the car." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retractable Radios 
</P>
<P>
Quite popular with consumers interested in theft-deterrent devices are the 
retractable radios with handles (prices start at $230) that can be slipped in 
and out of the dashboard. You can either lock this unit in your trunk when you 
leave the car or take it with you. 
</P>
<P>
If you leave a removable radio in your car, though, and a burglar steals it, 
you may not get reimbursed by your insurance company because the unit was not 
an installed one considered to be part of the car. Check with your insurer to 
see if your policy covers a retractable stereo. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback to the retractables, according to industry sources, is that car 
burglars often presume the stereo is stored in the car, either under the seat 
or in the trunk. So, they break your window or pry the trunk open with a 
crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Greg Vasquez of LAPD's BAD squad -- that stands for Burglary Auto Theft 
Division -- suggests drivers who have retractable stereos simply use a little 
common sense when storing them in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to get out of your car and put the radio in the trunk, do it 
somewhere other than where you're going to park," he advised. "You don't want 
the burglar to be standing there watching you put your radio in the trunk." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez pointed out that you don't have to own an expensive automobile -- a 
Mercedes, BMW or Porsche -- to have the car or the stereo stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"The most frequently stolen vehicle in Los Angeles now is the 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai," he said. "They have very good Panasonic radios in them, and the 
crooks know that." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez feels that any anti-theft devices are merely deterrents to car 
burglars, but that the best thing to do is have a good audio alarm -- that will 
safeguard your stereo as well as your car -- and a car cover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car Alarm Price Range 
</P>
<P>
Car alarms can range in price from $200 to $1,000 and up, depending on how 
sophisticated they are. But you should be able to get a good audio alarm with a 
"kill" switch for the ignition for $225 to $300 installed so the car can't be 
hot-wired by the thief. 
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking of getting an alarm for your car, call your insurance agent 
and ask if the company gives a discount. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Western Insurance Information Service in Tustin, some 
insurance companies will give a discount to drivers with car alarms, and if 
they offer a discount at all, it will be about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"Audio alarms can keep them from stealing the car or its contents and warn 
anybody in the vicinity," Vasquez explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest and best deterrent of all is a car cover," said Andy Cohen, 
president of Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories. "You can get a custom fit-all 
cotton one with a locking cable for $110-$150. You lock it on and they can't 
see in the car." 
</P>
<P>
Last year for $400, Cohen offered his customers an elaborate device that made a 
stereo recede into the dashboard behind a plain flap that locked, but he quit 
selling it "because it was too expensive and complicated to install."

THE WAIT WATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
SICK OF LIFE IN THE SLOW LANE? TAKE A QUEUE FROM AN EXPERT WHOSE LINE IS SAVING 
TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Southern California, they seem to be everywhere -- at the post office, the 
market, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the automatic teller machine, the 
Saturday night movies. And standing in them leaves us plenty of time to ponder 
the Big Question: If this is life in the fast lane, why do we spend so much of 
it waiting in snail's-pace, teeth-grinding lines? 
</P>
<P>
Wait in a line just 15 minutes a day, every day, and by year's end you've 
kissed 91.25 hours (almost four days) goodby. No wonder 15% of respondents in a 
recent Los Angeles Times quality-of-life poll cited waiting in line as a pet 
peeve (and no respondents mentioned a love of lines). Hating lines is natural 
for most people, says Richard C. Larson, a professor of electrical engineering 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and self-described "wait watcher" 
who has spent much of his operations research career studying queues. 
</P>
<P>
Besides wasting time, lines can be socially unjust. People sneak in; sometimes 
those in adjacent lines who arrive after you are served before you. "Control 
freaks" may have extraordinary difficulty dealing with lines, Larson observes. 
They may believe, for example, that the person on the other side of the 
fast-food counter shouldn't have the power to decide how quickly they'll get 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"The aggravation can add up," says Larson, who was in town last week to speak 
at a seminar at Rand Corp., a Santa Monica private, nonprofit research group. 
"Lines can ruin your whole day." 
</P>
<P>
Dismal as it all may sound, there's light at the end of the line. Or at least 
at the end of some. The good news about lines? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some are getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A certain type of line is used increasingly because it minimizes social 
injustices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Businesses are trying to take the agony out of lines by providing 
diversions, offering estimates of the anticipated wait or enticements such as 
free goods if the wait grows too long. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consumers can learn to make the best of even the worst lines. 
</P>
<P>
Lines aren't getting shorter all by themselves, of course. Increasing numbers 
of firms, trying to shed their reputation as "time bandits," are analyzing 
their lines to try to shorten them and to retain customers who feel they can't 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis depends on "queuing," a mathematical discipline that uses 
complicated probability theory to obtain practical information such as how many 
people might arrive at a bank's automated teller machine during a weekday lunch 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Queuing theory originated in the early 1900s, when a Danish telephone engineer 
devised a mathematical approach to help design phone switches. Queuing, once 
the domain of the communications and computer design industries, is slowly 
spreading into other fields as well. 
</P>
<P>
To help a bank reduce its automatic teller machine lines, for example, Larson 
and his students observe the sites and watch videotapes to analyze factors such 
as the mean wait in line, mean time spent in the entire system and the lapse 
between transactions. 
</P>
<P>
He accounts for how many customers balk (don't join the line at all) or renege 
(join the line but drop out in exasperation). Recently, he created a set of 
equations that allow interpretation of queues without direct observation. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on all this data, he then advises the bank on how many ATMs are needed 
and at which locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychology of Queueing 
</P>
<P>
But this analysis isn't all. "The queue environment is important," says Larson, 
who believes he is one of few researchers to consider not only the mathematical 
aspects of lines but psychological reactions to them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The type of line a business uses, for example, can mean the difference between 
customers waiting patiently or stomping off, Larson says. 
</P>
<P>
In his studies, he finds that customers prefer single or "serpentine" lines 
over multiple lines, the kind often found at fast-food restaurants, where 
customers line up to order from many servers but aren't necessarily served on a 
first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
Single lines increasingly are used by airlines, banks and other businesses, he 
says, noting that customers prefer them because their first-in, first-out 
policy makes what he calls "slips" and "skips" nearly impossible, unlike what 
often happens in multiple lines. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're waiting in line, and somebody joins (another line) after you and 
gets served before you, from your point of view you've been victimized and they 
have slipped by you," he explains. "From his or her point of view, they've 
incurred a momentary benefit and they're skipped over you." 
</P>
<P>
Larson's laws on slips and skips: "For every slip there's a skip." Slips cost 
companies more than skips, because customers tend to remember slips but not 
skips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Personal Interest 
</P>
<P>
That is so even for consumer Larson, whose interest in queues was heightened 
five years ago by his own slip experience. He stood patiently at the window of 
a major department store, waiting for a clerk to fetch the bike he bought for 
his son Erik, now 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to wait about a half hour for the bike to be delivered from the 
stockroom," he said. "Meanwhile, it seemed like 20 people came and gave their 
inventory receipts to the clerk and got their waffle irons and coffee makers. 
They came 10 or 15 minutes after me and then left with their goods. I was still 
there waiting. As exasperating as the 30-minute delay was, what was infuriating 
was the social injustice." 
</P>
<P>
The store, he later learned, ran on a "shortest service time first" principle. 
Translation: Waffle irons and coffee makers simply were easier than a bicycle 
to grab in the stockroom. 
</P>
<P>
But for Larson, like many others who have been slipped, the experience meant 
that he made a lifetime pledge never to return to that store. 
</P>
<P>
The accordion queue, another type of line, has been gaining in popularity, 
especially at Southern California grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Accordion queues run on the principle of adding servers as customer congestion 
increases, then subtracting them as it eases. But like multiple lines, 
accordion queues can be unfair; when a new line opens and customers dash to it, 
those waiting the longest aren't necessarily served most quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But people waiting in lines want more than social justice, Larson finds. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they want the time to seem to pass as quickly as possible. To 
that end, queue diversions have increased in recent years, with more businesses 
following the lead of a New York bank that began lunch entertainment, sometimes 
including jazz music and clowns. "One day, unknown to the manager, there was a 
guy outside selling tickets to get in," Larson recalls. "Now that suggests 
they've changed a negative experience into a positive one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Human Touch 
</P>
<P>
Some diversions, like playing television or radio news reports, can make people 
feel they're making productive use of a wait by keeping abreast of current 
events. Other diversions, like a restaurant hostess who walks down a line to 
hand out appetizers or balloons, employ a human touch. 
</P>
<P>
Still other businesses warn the customers about delays. In wait-watchers' 
jargon, that practice is "queue delay feedback." At a New York bank, for 
example, it means employing an electric eye to count the number of arriving and 
departing customers in line and displaying the anticipated wait. This system is 
based on the same principle, albeit more technologically advanced, as 
Disneyland signs telling park visitors how long it might take to board 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses also entice customers to put up with lines or waits in exchange 
for promises of free goods or services. The coffee shop in Larson's hotel, much 
to his delight, prominently displayed a sign at the entrance.: "Your lunch in 
10 minutes or we'll dessert you," meaning that during weekday lunches, 
customers who don't have food in front of them 10 minutes after ordering get a 
free piece of pie. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that!" Larson exclaims. "A queue delay guarantee!" 
</P>
<P>
The promotional technique, says Tom Wirt, vice president of marketing services 
for Bakers Square Restaurants, which recently introduced the plan in all 84 of 
its California restaurants, seeks to "convey the message that you can get in 
and out quickly." 
</P>
<P>
That is the word many businesses hope to spread. Last year, Chemical Bank in 
New York, for example, introduced its "5-4-7" program in 25 of its busiest 
Manhattan branches, says spokesman Ken Herz. Customers standing in a teller 
line longer than seven minutes get $5. "We're giving out less than one claim 
per branch per week," Herz says, "and it's on the honor system. But we believe 
we've improved the quality of our service very dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than offer money or free pie, other companies simply promise to try 
harder to reduce the wait, Larson observes. "There's lots of emphasis on 
avoiding queues and waits these days." 
</P>
<P>
He found three examples at his fingertips: the hotel's no-wait check-out; the 
rental car company's express check-in; and the airline pre-boarding pass. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what improvements do occur, beastly lines sometimes still are simply 
unavoidable. There's no telling, for example, when you'll end up behind the 
indecisive customer who plods through a fast-food order for 17 teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for such worst cases, Larson suggests, "Bring your life to the 
queue." He always carries a mini tape recorder, taking advantage of a line to 
enter his observations. Some of it might be useful, he reasons, for his coming 
book, "Our Lives on the Line," which he will write with his wife, M. Elizabeth 
Murray, who is trained as a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
Those impatient with the wait also might take a lesson from retirees, who tell 
Larson they sometimes view lines as an opportune place to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
And one last tip from the queue master: Once you leave the country, all bets 
are off on techniques for conquering lines. With the exception of international 
airports, he notes, first-come, first-served is not a universal queue concept. 
In certain regions, he says, queue etiquette is best described as "survival of 
the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
QUEUE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
People who talk and write about lines don't always seem to speak English. Here 
is sampling of their vocabulary: 
</P>
<P>
Serpentine queues: Single-file lines. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple queues: Several single-file lines for related goods and services from 
many servers. 
</P>
<P>
Accordion queues: Lines served by increasing numbers of servers as they get 
longer, and decreasing numbers of servers as they get shorter. 
</P>
<P>
FIFO: First in-first out. 
</P>
<P>
 SIRO: Service in random order. 
</P>
<P>
Queue delay guarantee: The promise of free goods or services if there is a long 
wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
Queue delay feedback: Information about the length of the wait in line, given 
verbally or by printed or electronic signs. 
</P>
<P>
Balking: Deciding not to join a line, often because it is too long. 
</P>
<P>
Reneging: Leaving a line before getting goods and services. 
</P>

A FEMINIST WITH FUNNY FIRST NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, Moffet is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willis Jane Digby wears a tuxedo and rabbit ears to get into the mood for 
reading the letters-to-the-editor at SIS magazine, "a bimonthly cross between a 
feminist Time and a liberated Ladies' Home Journal." 
</P>
<P>
Digby wears her ears for a newspaper photographer in poet Carol Muske-Dukes' 
wacky first novel, "Dear Digby," newly out from Viking. But her creator isn't 
about to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Muske-Dukes owns a pair of wired-together rabbit ears someone gave her as a 
joke, but she blushes at the idea of putting them on. Instead, she offers the 
ears to her 5-year-old daughter, Annie, who wears them willingly. 
</P>
<P>
A picture of herself in rabbit ears "is the sort of thing that could follow you 
for the rest of your life," the writer says. "I don't think I'd ever live it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Muske-Dukes draws clear lines between herself and her character in every way. 
"I really dislike the idea that when you write a novel, you're writing 
autobiography," she says. That idea "gives no credence to the transformative 
power of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
At 42, Muske-Dukes seems both self-assured and somewhat demure. Married for six 
years to actor David Dukes, she lives in a light-filled house on a quiet street 
in Hancock Park. She teaches fiction and poetry writing at USC, where she's an 
assistant professor. 
</P>
<P>
David Dukes puts in an appearance to say hello, then takes Annie and the 
5-year-old family dog, Digby, for a walk. ("I figured if you name your dog 
after your novel, it'll embarrass you enough to make you finish" the book, 
Muske-Dukes says.) 
</P>
<P>
Well-respected in literary circles (she's won praise from Pulitzer 
Prize-winning poets Carolyn Kizer and Donald Justice, critic Marjorie Perloff 
and others), Muske-Dukes has published three books of poetry and continues to 
publish poems and essays under her maiden name. 
</P>
<P>
She reviews poetry for the New York Times Book Review and her fourth book of 
poems, "Applause," is due out from the University of Pittsburgh Press in May. 
Although she's published under the surname Muske all these years, the writer 
added her husband's last name for her novel because "the novel felt so 
different." The part-time name change "doesn't really make sense but it does to 
me in some writerly way," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reviews 
</P>
<P>
Early reviews of the book have been mixed. Publishers Weekly called the novel a 
"silly, sentimental valentine of a book saved by Dukes' natural flair for 
comedy" while Library Journal tagged it "funny, sad and highly recommended" and 
Kirkus Reviews described the book as "something of a Miss Lonelyhearts for the 
liberated Eighties." Several film companies, including Bette Midler's All Girl 
Productions, have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
Like her character Digby, Muske-Dukes was a tomboy. She grew up in St. Paul, 
Minn., with four brothers and a sister, attended Catholic schools, studied 
English and journalism at Creighton University in Nebraska and earned a 
master's degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
Also like her character, the writer is a strong feminist. "I was always a 
feminist, from the time I was a kid, actually. I thought certain things that 
are considered masculine would be open to me, and I was quite shocked to 
discover they weren't," she says. "I expected to have no obstacles in my path, 
the way young men expect. I was quite a happy child but an unhappy adolescent" 
when, at puberty, she began encountering societal expectations that women be 
"fragile, and weak, and indecisive." 
</P>
<P>
After she finished school, Muske-Dukes went to Europe for a year and stumbled 
into a job singing in the French stage production of the musical, "Hair." 
</P>
<P>
"I was disastrous," she remembers. "My French was inadequate, so when they said 
'stand up' I'd sit down." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the United States, she lived in New York City for 12 years, 
free-lancing articles to Ms, the Village Voice and other publications, teaching 
part-time at Columbia University, working as an assistant editor for the 
literary magazine Antaeus and founding a writing program for Rikers Island 
prison inmates, "Art Without Walls." For a few years she was married to Edward 
Healton, a neurologist; metaphors drawn from the human nervous system run 
through some of Muske-Dukes' poetry. She also taught writing at the University 
of Iowa Writers Workshop, UC Irvine, George Washington University and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Grants 
</P>
<P>
Muske-Dukes has won numerous grants, including a 1981 Guggenheim fellowship in 
poetry that paid her way for a year in Italy. There she met David Dukes while 
he worked on the television miniseries, "The Winds of War." 
</P>
<P>
"We traveled all over the Italian countryside together. It was like a fairy 
tale. It was very romantic, I have to admit," she says. Back in the United 
States, they were a bi-coastal couple until her pregnancy, when she moved to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our marriage works because we're from different worlds and we can 
teach each other a lot about what we do," she says. "We have friends in both 
worlds. It's invigorating." 
</P>
<P>
David Dukes is "a very good critic" of her writing, Muske-Dukes says. When she 
reads things to him "he'll give me his instant feedback, which is uncannily and 
annoyingly right. He's a natural editor, I guess." The two have written a 
screenplay together, and "I'm trying to get my husband to work with me, to 
write a (stage) play. I don't know why I keep trying these projects that 
terrify me!" 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Muske-Dukes' novel originated in her New York years, from 
conversations with a good friend who worked as letters editor at Ms. But SIS, 
the author hastens to add, "really isn't Ms. It's just a mythical feminist 
magazine." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Muske-Dukes and the letters editor planned to write the novel 
together. The editor, however, lost interest, and Muske-Dukes also found 
herself losing steam. She put the manuscript away for six years. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea stayed with her, and she returned to it in the summer of 1987, 
when she and her husband lived in London while he acted in the Eugene O'Neill 
play "Strange Interlude," with Glenda Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had been writing (the novel) all those years in my head, because (in 
London) I found myself sitting down at 9 or 10 at night and writing" steadily, 
Muske-Dukes says. "It was a remarkable experience; it just came all of a piece; 
it just flowed." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'll ever write another novel," she adds. "I'm not a natural 
fiction writer. I feel poetry comes much more easily. In poetry I feel like I'm 
working on long-term themes, life themes. With fiction, there's that linear 
release, that sense of a door closing" once an event is described. 
</P>
<P>
"I think poetry can save the world. I'm a real believer in its power of healing 
and transforming. I wish more people read it. . . . Poetry is probably as close 
as I would get to religious feeling. I think poetry makes the world stand 
still," Muske-Dukes says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she turned to fiction, she says, because "there's a point at which you feel 
poetry is so cut off from the majority of people in the world, or the majority 
of people in the world are cut off from it. (With fiction) you at least have 
the illusion people can pick up your words and understand them." 
</P>
<P>
Her first book of poetry, "Camouflage," was published in 1975 by University of 
Pittsburgh Press. Muske-Dukes' poems, particularly those of "Skylight" 
(Doubleday: 1981) and "Wyndmere" (University of Pittsburgh: 1985) and the 
coming "Applause" "are probably a lot closer to my self" than the fiction, she 
says. "They draw on my life; they're closer to the voice I cannot use in 
everyday life to express what I feel." 
</P>
<P>
These days, much of the writer's energy goes into teaching her USC classes and 
taking care of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Annie appears in a number of the writer's newest poems. "I'm not consciously 
trying to include her, but she's part of my psyche and she just keeps turning 
up. She functions as a kind of touchstone in the poems. 
</P>
<P>
A writer who seems to have everything -- work she loves, enough money, critical 
acclaim, charming husband and child -- Muske-Dukes asserts that she's worked 
hard to reach this point in her career, but she also feels "there's a special 
blessing in my life; there's an angel. 
</P>
<P>
"Guardian angels, I believe in those. There's something out there, something 
that's kept me safe and blessed me. I think if you leave yourself open to 
possibility, the world is filled with miracles."

MORNING REPORT: 'WANDA' DOES SWIMMINGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

international news services and the nation's press.

<P>
All the strong new competition hasn't been able to flush "A Fish Called Wanda" 
out of the top spot of the Billboard magazine rental chart. Kevin Kline's 
best-supporting actor Oscar is expected to drum up new business for "Wanda." 
Michael Keaton's fans are renting his drama "Clean and Sober" as if it were one 
of his comedies. It's up to No. 9 in just two weeks. For a movie that grossed 
$109 million at the box office, " 'Crocodile' Dundee II" is doing surprisingly 
slow business, inching from No. 9 to No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
* The Tom Hanks comedy, "Big" was big at the box office, raking in $110 
million. It looks like a rental smash too, probably shooting up to No. 1 
sometime in the next few weeks. "Big" burst onto the rental chart at No. 11. 
Hanks' other movie, the comedy/drama "Punchline" (No. 18), is off to a sluggish 
start.

CITIES MOUNT THEIR OWN TAX REVOLT; 
</P>
<P>
TEMPLE CITY, OTHERS SUE TO GET PROPERTY TAX REVENUES DENIED THEM BY PROP. 13 
LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Temple City residents paid $7.5 million in property taxes in 1986-87, but the 
city received none of that revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city is not alone in that plight. 
</P>
<P>
About 33 of Los Angeles County's 85 cities either did not have a property tax 
or were not yet incorporated when Proposition 13 was passed in 1978, according 
to Sam Olivito, executive director of the California Contract Cities Assn. 
Under state legislation enacted to implement the proposition, such cities do 
not qualify for a slice of the property tax pie. 
</P>
<P>
"We were excluded forever" from receiving benefits, Temple City Manager Karl 
Koski said of his community, which has never levied a property tax. 
</P>
<P>
Joined by Compton, El Segundo, Carson and Rancho Cucamonga, Temple City has 
taken the issue to court. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that their residents are being taxed without receiving due benefits, 
the cities filed a suit with the state Supreme Court challenging the 
constitutionality of the current system of tax revenue distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Supreme Court last Friday declined without comment to hear the 
case, John Sturgeon, the attorney for the petitioners, said he will file the 
suit Friday in San Bernardino Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is being filed there, he said, because Rancho Cucamonga is the biggest 
loser from the current system among the five cities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was originally filed with the state's highest court because the issue 
is constitutional and the decision could shift millions of dollars among city 
coffers statewide, Sturgeon said. He had urged the court to act quickly because 
cities have to begin planning their 1989-90 budgets soon. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City Councilman Ken Gillanders, who initiated the research leading to 
the suit, was not perturbed by the action by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll just take a little longer to resolve, but the constitutional issues are 
the same," he said. "It will ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
The cities want the court to invalidate legislation adopted to implement the 
landmark tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the legislation unfairly penalizes cities that levied low 
property taxes, or none at all, before Proposition 13. If successful, it would 
benefit 270 cities statewide, Olivito said. His organization, which has written 
to the court in support of the action, represents 65 California cities, 46 of 
them in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
However, not every city would gain. 
</P>
<P>
For example, six cities in the San Gabriel Valley, including Pomona and 
Pasadena, would stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 limited property taxes to 1% of a parcel's assessed value and 
restricted increases in assessments to 2% annually. Although taxpayers pay at 
the same rate regardless of where they live, revenues have been distributed 
among cities according to how high their tax rates were before Proposition 13 
was passed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature's scheme allocates property taxes without regard to who paid 
them," attorney Sturgeon stated in the suit, which was filed with the Supreme 
Court last month. He said this "completely arbitrary" formula punishes cities 
that had shown fiscal restraint before Proposition 13 by imposing low taxes, 
while rewarding those with high taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to 
correct these inequities. The counties were named as respondents in the suit 
because they collect residents' property taxes and distribute them to cities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit suggests that a fairer distribution system would rely on the total 
value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of the tax-revenue 
pie it should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City would have gained about $1.46 million in revenues in fiscal 1986-87 
under the proposed system. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner among the petitioners would be El Segundo, which would have 
received $7 million more that year. The city had a property tax of 0.15% in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which had a 2.56% property tax, would be hurt more than any other city 
in the San Gabriel Valley, Olivito said. Under the proposed formula, it would 
have received about $1 million less than it did in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, Sierra Madre and La Verne also would get 
less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Picture 
</P>
<P>
Expressing disappointment that other cities are seeking a solution that would 
penalize his city, Pomona City Manager A. J. Wilson said the larger picture of 
who needs the money most should be examined. Each city's per capita spending 
also needs to be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to give away the resources of our community," Wilson promised, 
adding that Pomona is exploring its legal grounds for a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena City Manager Donald McIntyre acknowledged that the petitioning cities 
have a legitimate concern but said it was their choice not to levy higher taxes 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena City Manager John Bernardi agreed: "I certainly feel for them, 
but I don't know why South Pasadena should suffer for (their) not imposing a 
property tax. We can't afford to lose any more than we've already lost." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the current revenue allocation system violates a 
provision in the state Constitution requiring that taxpayers directly benefit 
from the taxes they are paying. 
</P>
<P>
Cities with high pre-Proposition 13 tax rates receive more than their fair 
share of revenues, violating another constitutional provision mandating uniform 
taxation, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Profited Most 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which had the county's highest property tax, 2.76%, in 1978, is 
cited as profiting the most from the current system. The city received at least 
$117 million more in property tax revenues than its residents paid in the 
1986-87 fiscal year, said Rodney Smith, economic consultant for the 
petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would bear 95% of the losses under the proposal, Smith said. 
Besides the six San Gabriel Valley cities, Long Beach and Hermosa Beach would 
be the only other ones in the county to suffer if the court agrees that changes 
should be made. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stressed that county tax revenues are in a separate pool from the cities' 
revenue and would not be affected by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Olivito said the petitioning cities have long felt that "something just wasn't 
right" and have repeatedly approached the state Legislature about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Services 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to find a solution for the last 10 years, and we haven't 
received a dollar," he said. "The issue just kept snowballing." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of tax revenues has limited the services the petitioning cities have 
been able to provide their residents, the suit alleges. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Inadequate flood control facilities were a main reason for Rancho Cucamonga's 
incorporation, yet the city has been unable to afford community-level flood 
control projects. 
</P>
<P>
* Compton has been forced to put off several youth programs and cannot fund 
Neighborhood Watch projects. 
</P>
<P>
* Carson cannot afford to rehabilitate four toxic chemical sites and 20 
abandoned landfills. 
</P>
<P>
* Temple City has postponed implementing a school drug awareness program and 
cannot afford a senior center. Law enforcement levels have not been increased 
to keep up with growth since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spending Our Money' 
</P>
<P>
"We're struggling to keep our heads above water, and other cities are spending 
our property tax money," said Temple City's Gillanders. As a property owner, 
Gillanders is also named as a petitioner in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor in 1984, Gillanders began consulting with Smith, also director of the 
Lowe Institute of Political Economy at Claremont McKenna College, about the 
validity of the allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, the City Council commissioned Smith to research the issue. 
"In 1986 I discovered the constitutional flaws," said Smith, who now serves as 
an independent consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The other cities decided to join in the suit within the past year, Koski said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed by five Southern California cities attacks the way that property 
tax revenue is allocated to cities. Their suit challenges the constitutionality 
of the distribution system that was enacted to implement Proposition 13. If 
successful, the suit could shift millions of dollars among city coffers 
statewide. The following is a breakdown of the tax revenue received by cities 
in the San Gabriel Valley under the existing system and the distribution under 
the proposed reforms.

The mercury shot up to record highs in Los Angeles today for the third 
consecutive day, and thousands fled to the beach but found only a sandy 
furnace. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m. the temperature was 101 degrees downtown, breaking the April 6 record 
of 91 set in 1932 and tied in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service predicted Los Angeles' Civic Center would end the 
day with a high of 102. The overnight temperature at the Civic Center fell only 
to 73 this morning. 
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 people were already gathered on Santa Monica beach by mid-morning, 
but the temperature there was 80 degrees at sunrise and neared 100 before noon, 
lifeguard Randy DeGregori said. 
</P>
<P>
The spring heat wave was spawned by a high pressure system expected to linger 
over the West for several more days, forecaster Michael Lewis said.

UEBERROTH GROUP AGREES TO BUY EASTERN, SHARE IT WITH EMPLOYEES

<P>
A group led by former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth has agreed to 
buy Eastern Airlines in a $464-million deal that would give the strike-crippled 
carrier's employees a major share of the company, the parties announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, subject to approval by Eastern creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, followed lengthy negotiations with Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. and 
was greeted with cheers by union members locked in a bitter struggle with 
Eastern management. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase was also conditioned on Eastern reaching new work agreements with 
its striking unions by April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal accepted by Texas Air, Ueberroth and Thomas Talbot, a former 
airline executive from California, would own 30% of the airline. Eastern's 
unions would get another 30% of the company in exchange for wage and work-rule 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Ardshiel Inc., a smaller New York firm, will 
place securities for the remaining 40% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said if the unions 
agreed to the deal, the nation's seventh-largest airline could resume flying 24 
hours later. He also said the airline intended to file a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan that would pay creditors 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is approved, but 
Ueberroth will participate in formulating the reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said the purchase includes about $200 million in cash and the rest in 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Eastern has been virtually paralyzed since March 4 by a machinists 
union strike that has drawn the support of pilots and flight attendants. 
Eastern filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in U.S. 
bankruptcy court in New York on March 9 as its cash dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"To sum it up, it's a mammoth challenge. I'm convinced that there is a spirit 
amongst the people in the company that I can help bring together to help this 
airline," Ueberroth said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air would get $200 million in cash, Eastern notes worth about $185 
million, plus Eastern assets valued at about $79 million, including Eastern's 
Miami-London and New York-Montreal routes, plus eight landing slots and one 
gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 striking machinists jammed their local union hall in Miami, chanting 
and cheering "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to go" and "Take me out to the 
ballgame" as they heard news of the sale.

The United States has revoked the visa of Paraguay's ousted dictator Alfredo 
Stroessner, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on reports that Stroessner was seeking to come to the United 
States for medical treatment, a State Department official said he knew of no 
visa request. 
</P>
<P>
"Stroessner's visa has been revoked. He'd have to reapply," the official said, 
adding that a visa request from Stroessner, like all others, would be given due 
consideration. Another State Department official, a Latin American specialist, 
said it was highly unlikely that the request would be approved, given 
Stroessner's background as a harsh foe of democratic liberties. 
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains Stroessner can get adequate medical care in Brazil, 
where he has lived in exile since being toppled by a former ally in a bloody 
coup last February.

The longest house arrest to date for a Los Angeles slumlord was imposed today 
on the owner of the Palms Wilshire Hotel, who was sentenced to spend 100 days 
in his own dilapidated building. 
</P>
<P>
Amiya K. Goswami, 54, of Long Beach was ordered by Municipal Judge Suzanne 
Person to surrender next Thursday to begin serving the house arrest in a room 
at the four-story, 197-unit residential hotel at 626 S. Alvarado St. 
</P>
<P>
"Goswami has virtually ignored his legal responsibilities to maintain this 
hotel for over a year and half, and now the time has come for him to begin 
paying the price for that neglect and indifference," City Atty. James K. Hahn 
said.

BOTHA SLATES SOUTH AFRICA ELECTION IN '89; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER PARTY STRUGGLE, HE ORDERS DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT IN MAY

<TEXT>
<P>
President Pieter W. Botha announced today that general elections will be held 
this year and ordered Parliament dissolved at the end of May, signaling the end 
of his 10-year reign after a power struggle within the ruling National Party. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, issued the announcement in his first address to a joint session of 
Parliament since suffering a stroke Jan. 18 that forced him to surrender 
leadership of the National Party, and ultimately prompted demands that he step 
aside as president to make way for a younger leader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Pick 'Appropriate' Day 
</P>
<P>
He said he will order Parliament dissolved "on an appropriate day" at the end 
of May, setting in motion the process for general elections. 
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, an election must be held within 180 days of the 
dissolution of Parliament -- a tricameral body that has separate houses for the 
white, mixed-race, or colored, and Indian populations but excludes the black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
The life of the present Parliament expires in September, and Botha indicated 
that an election will be held about that time. 
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the newly constituted Parliament, a state president 
will be elected. Assuming that the National Party, which has ruled the country 
for 40 years, wins a majority in the election, the next president is expected 
to be Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, elected National Party leader Feb. 2 after Botha's resignation from 
the post, mounted a strong challenge to his decision to retain the presidency 
and separate the two most powerful positions in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Botha bucked the challenge and last month ruled out an early election. He 
retreated only after a unanimous endorsement of De Klerk's bid by the National 
Party -- the architect of the apartheid laws in South Africa that have denied 
27 million blacks a voice in the affairs of government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Open-Minded 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, 53, has yet to break with any of Botha's major policies, but he is 
widely considered more pragmatic and open-minded than the president and thus 
more likely to initiate negotiations with major black leaders. 
</P>

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects 
ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the Armenian 
earthquake, Gorbachev had "extremely frank exchanges, animated, warm, 
passionate and solemn," said a Thatcher spokesman, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade to shake hands 
with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside 
Westminster Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly anti-Communist 
prime minister "love arguing." 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain with Gorbachev at 
her side, Thatcher told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as 
always we got to grips with the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report from Washington that 
Moscow sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses 
of sponsoring terrorism. Gorbachev did not respond, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two leaders could make no progress on the bomber issue, the 
spokesman said the Soviet and British foreign ministers, meeting separately, 
would most likely discuss the matter at length. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been "not as frank as they 
should be" about their chemical weapons arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
He quoted Gorbachev as replying: "If you aren't fully satisfied, then quite 
clearly we have to have more exchanges. We have got to try better to convince 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
Another area of disagreement was Gorbachev's goal of eliminating all nuclear 
weapons from Europe. Thatcher believes the deterrence of nuclear weapons 
prevents war.

Sikh extremists killed nine people in northern Punjab today, including a Sikh 
priest dragged from his temple and hanged from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve members of the Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan stormed the home of 
Buta Singh in Jaspal and accused him of being a police informer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Buta Singh was among 104 Sikhs freed from jail March 6 under a new government 
policy of placating moderate Sikhs. They had been held four years without trial 
after their capture in a bloody 1984 army assault to oust armed Sikh radicals 
in Amritsar's Golden Temple. 
</P>
<P>
"He begged for mercy and even told them that he was one of the Jodhpur 
detainees who fought the battle for Khalistan," said Buta Singh's widow, 
Balwinder Kaur.

Foreign ownership of agricultural land in the United States rose to 12.5 
million acres at the end of last year, an increase of 99,100 acres from the 
prior year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise, foreign ownership remained at slightly less than 1% of the 
total privately owned agricultural land in the United States, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The department said forest land accounted for 48% of all foreign-owned acreage, 
cropland 17%, pasture and other agricultural land 30%, and non-agricultural 
land 5%. Corporations owned 80% of the foreign-held acreage, partnerships 11% 
and individuals 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens or corporations from Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, the 
Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands and Switzerland own 74% of the 
foreign-held acreage. Japanese citizens own 2% of the total, the department 
said.

American Airlines said today it will hire 600 new employees and expand service 
to Miami and the Caribbean by 44 flights a day beginning June 1, filling gaps 
left by strike-crippled Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
American had said late last year that it would expand in Florida, but the 
strike pushed its planning schedule ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the opportunity that Eastern's problem presented brought us to take 
a look at the timing of that plan," said Robert Baker, American's senior vice 
president for operations. "It was probably a year down the road. The Caribbean 
part was closer than that." 
</P>
<P>
The 600 new employees will be hired in Miami. The airline's expanded presence 
will represent another $100 million a year to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in Florida and the Caribbean will add 3,219 seats a day to the 
market. New routes from Miami will include nonstop flights to Los Angeles, New 
York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
New service to the Caribbean will include stops in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and 
Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica, Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata in the 
Dominican Republic as well as Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

BUSH RENEWS VETO THREAT ON MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE

<P>
President Bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum 
wage beyond $4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill 
raising the wage floor to $4.55. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill.), who met with Bush and relayed his 
comments to reporters, said the President "made it abundantly clear there will 
be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation" from his 
position on the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the Senate opened 
debate on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) would raise the 
hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January, 1992, and contains no provision 
allowing a lower wage for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical 
to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and 
would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a 
sub-minimum "training wage" for six months. The GOP leaders who met with Bush 
said he also reiterated his opposition to shortening that time frame. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad Cochran of 
Mississippi, told reporters afterward that "the message that was given to the 
President by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that we're going to stand with him 
on the minimum wage issue. And we urged him not to back down from his 
commitment to $4.25 and the six-month training wage."

BIG RETAILERS REPORT MIXED MARCH SALES; SEARS POSTS 11.9% INCREASE

<P>
The nation's big retailers today reported mixed March sales, with giant Sears, 
which introduced a new competitive pricing policy during the month, posting an 
11.9% increase from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
March sales suffered somewhat because Easter occurred earlier this year than in 
1988. The holiday meant that doors were closed at general merchandisers and 
clothing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears Merchandise Group, 
said March sales surpassed expectations and benefited from the aggressive 
promotion of the pricing program. Sales totaled $2.97 billion, up from $2.66 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
K mart, the second-largest U.S. retailer, said sales in the five weeks ended 
March 29 totaled $2.42 billion, up 2.5% from $2.36 billion a year earlier. J. 
C. Penney Co. Inc. said sales amounted to $1.233 billion in the five weeks to 
April 1, up 0.7% from $1.225 billion a year earlier.

Jerry Jones, the new majority owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has given Coach 
Jimmy Johnson a 10-year contract, the NFL club announced today. Jones made the 
announcement to potential advertisers for Dallas' KRLD Radio, the Cowboys 
flagship radio station. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year contract is not without precedent. The late Clint Murchison, the 
original owner of the Cowboys, gave Tom Landry such a contract in the mid-1960s 
when Landry was suffering the losing woes of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys announced Johnson's contract from their Valley Ranch headquarters. 
When Jones bought the team in late February, he would not release details of 
the contract of his former Arkansas football teammate.

The federal trial of sports agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom went to a jury 
today. The two are accused of defrauding six universities by signing their 
scholarship football players as clients, and of threatening some players. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement to jurors Wednesday, defense attorney Dan Webb implied 
that the real villains were student athletes who signed contracts that violated 
NCAA rules and the schools themselves. U.S. Atty. Anton Valukas, in his closing 
statement, maligned Webb's tactics and argued that the sports agents knowingly 
cheated six universities out of scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy to commit 
fraud and racketeering. They were accused of luring dozens of college athletes 
with cash and other gifts to sign contracts in violation of NCAA rules, then 
using threats to keep their clients from reneging on the agreements.
