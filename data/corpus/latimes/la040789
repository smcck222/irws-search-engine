HEAT TOPPLES RECORD AGAIN IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>

San Diego County sizzled under record heat for the second straight day Thursday 
as soaring temperatures destroyed 50% of the strawberry crop and East County 
residents were advised to seek respite in the desert, where cooler weather 
prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said the heat wave should continue through the 
weekend, with relief coming on Monday, when a cooling trend is expected to 
bring patches of coastal fog early in the morning. Wilbur Shigehara, forecaster 
for the National Weather Service in San Diego, said there is a possibility that 
more record temperatures will be set today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the temperature hit 98 degrees at 3 p.m. at Lindbergh Field, 
breaking records for April 6 and the month of April. The old record for April 6 
was 89 degrees, set in 1939. The previous high for the month was 96 degrees in 
1910. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara predicted a high of 93 degrees for San Diego today, which would break 
the old record of 85 degrees set for this date in 1962. A high of 85 degrees is 
forecast for Saturday, which would also break the record set for that date, in 
1885. 
</P>
<P>
An SDG&amp;E spokesman said electricity consumption was up again Thursday. By 
3:30 p.m. the utility's customers had used 2,690 megawatts of power. On 
Wednesday, electricity consumption peaked at 2,538 megawatts. The all-time 
SDG&amp;E record for electricity use was set last Sept. 6, when 2,831 megawatts 
of power were used. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperatures were particularly grueling in the East County. Gillespie 
Field in El Cajon reported a high of 110 degrees, prompting Shigehara to issue 
the following advice: 
</P>
<P>
"If residents of Santee and that area want to escape the heat, they might want 
to think about going to the desert, where temperatures were slightly cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Desert readings were reported at 102 to 105 degrees Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Scorching temperatures also destroyed 50% of the county's strawberry crop, said 
Kathleen Thuner, county agriculture commissioner. According to Thuner, a county 
agriculture inspector recorded a pulp temperature reading of 110 degrees from 
one strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
"The strawberries are literally cooking on the vine . . . . The crop that has 
been lost is the fruit on the vine, not the plant. However, there has been some 
concern voiced by growers that they could suffer substantial plant damage if 
the heat continues," said Thuner. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials said it is still too early to estimate the dollar loss of 
the strawberry crop, which totaled about $21 million in 1987. Thuner said the 
Santa Ana winds have also damaged the fragile blossoms on the citrus and 
avocado trees. She said the yield from both crops will probably be smaller this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classes Canceled Again 
</P>
<P>
The record heat forced the cancellation of classes for the second straight day 
at two East County high schools. Students at Mt. Miguel and Granite Hills high 
schools only attended classes for four hours in the morning. A spokeswoman for 
the Grossmont Union High School District said the schools do not have air 
conditioning, making the classrooms "too hot and uncomfortable." Several other 
East County schools also canceled classes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the humidity reached a low of 9% Thursday, California Department of 
Forestry officials reported no fires in the county's outlying areas. Department 
spokesman Jim Van Meter said residents should heed a warning from the unusually 
hot April weather. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like people to take note of the upcoming fire season. Now is the time 
to prepare for the summer months ahead and people should clear a 30-foot 
clearance around their homes to lessen the danger from brush and grass fires," 
said Van Meter. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming fire season will be particularly dangerous unless the county gets 
a sudden surge of rain, said Shigehara. He said the county records about half 
its rainfall from January to March. However, the first three months of the year 
have been the 10th driest on record, going back to 1850, when rainfall records 
were first kept in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought and unusually high demand for water, Otay Water District 
officials said they might be forced to ration water if the heat wave continues. 
</P>
<P>
The current heat wave began Tuesday, when a high pressure developed over the 
West, pushing a blast of warm air into the Southland and blocking the usual sea 
breezes. The high pressure is expected to began weakening substantially by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the record high temperatures, lifeguard Matt Rowland said attendance at 
San Diego beaches was actually down from Wednesday. Rowland said about 40,000 
people went to the beaches Thursday, down from Wednesday's estimate of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said the cool spots in the county were Solana Beach and Mt. Laguna, 
where temperatures of about 80 degrees were recorded. Other hot spots included 
Miramar, 101 degrees; Montgomery Field, 98 degrees; Poway, 102 degrees; 
Coronado, 96 degrees; and San Nicholas Island, 97 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
El Toro Led the Nation 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, it was the third day of record-shattering heat. It hit 106 
degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday, the hottest day so far 
this year and the hottest April day on record. That toppled the old record for 
the date, set in 1962, by 15 degrees. It was the third day in a row that 
downtown readings topped 100. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro in Orange County, where the mercury climbed to 112, was the hottest 
spot in the country. Other Southland readings included 110 in Ontario, 107 in 
Monrovia and Palm Springs, and 105 in Long Beach, Westwood, Pasadena and 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime temperatures remained at record high levels too. Thursday's minimum 
reading at the Civic Center, recorded shortly before dawn, was 73 degrees, 11 
degrees above the 59-year-old record for the date. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was as dry as it was hot, with relative humidity ranging from a 
barely discernible 8% to a merely arid 34%. 
</P>
<P>
"And there really won't be any relief until next week," said Pat Cooper, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more heat Friday, in the low 100s from downtown, out through the 
valleys and into the deserts," she said. "Saturday will still be very warm, 
with more 100s downtown and in the valleys. Sunday will be just a little bit 
cooler, near 100. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't really begin abating until about Monday or Tuesday, when the 
highs will begin easing off into the 90s. And there's no sign of rain at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200,000 at Beaches 
</P>
<P>
Despite the oppressive heat, hospitals reported no noticeable surge in 
heat-related illnesses. But there were other problems -- stalled cars, closed 
schools, seared gardens, record power use and heat-related blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Play it cool," advised Dr. Edwin Newtown, a physician on duty in the emergency 
ward at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine if you went to the beach, where lifeguards said more than 200,000 
flocked to the sand and some of the more courageous tried a swim in the 
61-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
Cars overheated and fizzled out on Los Angeles freeways Thursday in what Sgt. 
Mike Brey of the California Highway Patrol described as a "vicious circle." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when they overheat, they're stuck in the fast lane," he said. "That 
slows traffic and that makes even more people heat up." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was especially acute Thursday in the downtown area, where 
converging freeways were sporadically jammed with stranded, sweating motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Brey offered one piece of advice that might not be popular, but it can keep 
your car from overheating: When stalled in traffic, turn off your air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electricity Use Up 
</P>
<P>
People turning up air conditioners in homes, businesses and public buildings 
pushed electrical consumption to near record levels for the third straight day. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said a peak of 15,101 megawatts was 
being used by 4 p.m., eclipsing the previous high set the day before of 14,282. 
Edison's all-time high is 15,987 megawatts, set Sept. 6 when the temperature 
reached 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also reported a new high for 
April of 4,785 megawatts, beating the mark set Wednesday of 4,541. DWP's 
all-time high of electricity use -- 4,991 -- was also set Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As the temperatures soared, DWP officials asked customers to delay the use of 
heat-producing appliances, such as stoves and dryers, until the evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered power outages were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's Ed Freudenberg said circuits overloaded by air conditioning caused a 
power loss to about 1,000 customers in the Westwood area Wednesday night. The 
power was restored before dawn, but at 9:20 a.m. Thursday about 800 of the same 
customers lost power again. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said none of the other outages were immediately linked to the record 
demands for electricity.

Boom Boxes Make for Bad Vibes in National City 
</P>
<P>
National City has declared war on boom boxes -- those temple-throbbing portable 
stereos that are the latest fad among the mobile and music-obsessed young. 
</P>
<P>
Police are busily writing noise citations for boom-boxers who delight in 
cruising through commercial and residential areas while raucous music blares 
from theater-size speakers in the back of their mini trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen young men pleaded guilty last week in South Bay Municipal Court and 
were fined $71 to $118 each. More cases are pending, and four unrepentant 
boom-boxers are set to begin trial May 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just talking about loud stereos," said Asst. City Atty. Linda 
Harter. "We're talking about speakers that can be heard for blocks and blocks 
and can actually cause hearing damage." 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown, the first in San Diego County, began after residents begged 
National City officials for action. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the word to get out that you can't destroy the tranquility of our city 
and get away with it," Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not carry sound meters but instead use a three-block standard: If the 
stereo can be heard from that far away, it's illegal. "Usually we hear the 
music before we can even see the truck," said Lt. Craig Short. 
</P>
<P>
After police write a citation, the stereos are seized as evidence. Only after 
the court case is resolved are they returned. That, says Judge James Edmunds, 
provides incentive for defendants to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
A second conviction could lead to the stereos being destroyed as a public 
nuisance, much like a rabid dog or a rickety building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Kidding, Folks 
</P>
<P>
No one at San Diego City Hall is surprised that Councilman Ed Struiksma is 
retreating from his previously staunch support for the planned 3,360-home 
Miramar Ranch North subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
A poll done by UC San Diego Professor Sam Popkin found that 68.5% of likely 
voters in Struiksma's district oppose the project, 18.5% support it, and 13% 
are undecided. No wonder Struiksma is not eager to have a referendum on the 
same ballot on which he's seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land of Milk and Honey 
</P>
<P>
More evidence that living in San Diego County can be quite rewarding: 
</P>
<P>
* Local cow makes good: Moo-Moo the Cow, resident of Poway Stables, has been 
selected as the new Cow Leatherton, the lip-syncing "spokes-cow" ("Go see cow, 
go see cow . . . ") for the Leather Factory, a San Marcos and Kearny Mesa 
furniture store. 
</P>
<P>
She succeeds No. 1000. And no, No. 1000 has not been made into a sofa. She has 
returned to the herd at Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
* Local atheists make bad, which is considered good: San Diego atheists Stephen 
Thorne and Howard Kreisner have been named Most Hated Atheists of the Year by 
the 19th annual Convention of American Atheists. 
</P>
<P>
Thorne and Kreisner were given the award for suing the city of San Diego over 
the Christmas displays in Balboa Park and opposing the presence of a cross on 
Mt. Soledad. The award is given annually by the proprietor of an atheist 
cemetery in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How About a Toga Party? 
</P>
<P>
These are tight financial times for higher education, so colleges and 
universities are increasingly looking to their alumni for help. And a little 
pizazz at the alumni gathering can go a long way to keep the alums loyal to 
dear old alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday, the Louisiana State University Alumni Assn. will hold its first 
Crawfish Boil and Cajun Fais-Do-Do at Hospitality Point on Mission Bay. 
Football coach Mike Archer and 2,000 pounds of live crawfish will be flown in 
for the fest. 
</P>
<P>
A week from Saturday, the Stanford Club of San Diego will meet at the La Jolla 
Country Club for a luncheon and a lecture by Dr. Herant Katchadourian, 
professor of psychiatry and behavioral science. 
</P>
<P>
Katchadourian, selected four times as an outstanding professor and Class Day 
speaker by Stanford seniors, will deliver his specialty: "Keeping Sex and Love 
Alive."

LEADING HEART SURGEON TO JOIN STAFF AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Internationally acclaimed heart surgeon Stuart W. Jamieson will join the staff 
at UC San Diego Medical Center, a move that promises to vault the Hillcrest 
hospital to the forefront of heart and lung transplant research and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, 42, has accepted the position of professor of surgery and chief of 
the division of cardiothoracic surgery at the UCSD, Dr. Gerard N. Burrow, the 
dean of UCSD's medical school, announced Thursday. Final academic committee 
approval of Jamieson's appointment is expected within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson has performed about 500 heart transplants and more than 50 heart-lung 
transplants -- a relatively new procedure first attempted only eight years ago. 
Jamieson, who trained with renowned heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, claims a 
higher-than-average survival rate among his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Jamieson is without question one of the leading cardiothoracic surgeons 
practicing today," Burrow said. "Under (his) leadership, the UCSD School of 
</P>
<P>
Medicine's division of cardiothoracic surgery will become one of the premier 
teaching and research programs in the country, and San Diego will become a 
national center for these specialized surgical procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Stringer, director of UCSD's Medical Center, said the recruitment 
of Jamieson "sends one more signal that this region is a biomedical center of 
national importance." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, who is now at the University of Minnesota, plans to move to San Diego 
with his team of transplant surgeons and nurses by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming a Magnet 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two agencies closely connected to the developing body of research 
in heart-lung transplants will relocate to San Diego to follow the 
accomplishments of Jamieson and his team. The International Registry for Heart 
Transplantation, which keeps records on heart and heart-lung transplants 
throughout the world, and the editorial offices of the bimonthly Journal of 
Heart Transplantation will move their offices here, according to officials at 
UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
For all of Jamieson's rave reviews, he has known controversy. A UCSD 
spokeswoman said he recently resigned after two years as the head of the 
University of Minnesota's highly successful cardiothoracic surgery program 
after several months of turmoil over administrative and personnel matters. He 
remained on the medical school faculty. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center officials, however, do not seem to be worried about 
Jamieson's past problems, which were apparently the product of personality 
conflicts with some of the staff at the University of Minnesota, according to 
UCSD Medical Center spokeswoman Leslie Franz. "At no point was there a question 
over his capabilities as a surgeon or the success of his program," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
There was "a great deal of discussion" among the administrators at UCSD Medical 
Center re 
</P>
<P>
garding Jamieson's turmoil-filled tenure at the University of Minnesota, Franz 
said, but no objections were raised to extending an invitation to Jamieson to 
come west. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration felt very comfortable that these were all very 
institutionally specific kinds of agreements and would not really have any 
impact on Dr. Jamieson's ability to do the job here," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
"All surgeons somehow are controversial figures . . . and I think Dr. Jamieson 
is no exception," Burrow said. The academic program for heart surgery in 
Minnesota was "virtually nonexistent" at the time of Jamieson's arrival, he 
said. "Jamieson built the program from nothing, and he did it very quickly. 
It's hard to do that and not step on some people's toes, and I think that he 
simply stepped on too many toes, and I think he's aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked into this very carefully, and everyone we talked to has said he 
really is a brilliant surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked at Jamieson 3 Months Ago 
</P>
<P>
Burrow said the administration decided within the past year to establish a 
major cardiovascular disease program and began specifically looking at the 
possibility of recruiting Jamieson about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center now operates the only kidney transplant center in San Diego 
County and plans to develop a pancreatic transplant program. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our key missions here is teaching and training, and in order to do it 
to our full capability, it's important that our department of surgery have a 
comprehensive transplant program," Franz said. "It's important to not only have 
a program like this so that young surgeons can be trained to do these 
procedures, but also a program where research is being done and the procedures 
can be perfected." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, born in Rhodesia and educated in London, took a fellowship at 
Stanford University in 1978 and helped develop the fledgling field of 
heart-lung transplantation along with pre-eminent heart surgeon Norman Shumway. 
In 1982, he was appointed director of Stanford's Heart-Lung Transplantation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Jamieson took over as head of the University of Minnesota's heart 
surgery program, which quadrupled its surgical activity during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's heart surgery program has been directed for the past few years by Dr. 
Pat Daily, who is also head of the heart surgery program at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital. Daily will continue to work for Sharp Memorial Hospital and will 
remain on the clinical faculty at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp Memorial is the only hospital in San Diego where heart transplants are 
performed. No lung transplants have ever been performed in San Diego County.

MRS. ROGERS REJECTS SCHOOL'S OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
'COMPLETELY INADEQUATE,' TEACHER'S ATTORNEY MAINTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Vincennes skipper Will Rogers III has told administrators of La 
Jolla County Day School that their contract offer seeking her return to the 
classroom is "completely inadequate" and instead is demanding immediate 
reinstatement as a fourth-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-page counter-proposal to the private school's offer, Sharon Rogers 
also insists that she receive five years' pay if she is removed from the school 
beginning next September because administrators cannot assure the safety of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
One source said that, because Mrs. Rogers has been a teacher at La Jolla 
Country Day for 12 years and the faculty salary range goes from $20,000 to 
$40,000 a year, the five-year compensation could go as high as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators have not allowed Mrs. Rogers to teach on the campus since 
March 10, the day her van exploded while she was driving to work. The incident 
is under investigation by federal authorities seeking to determine whether it 
was a terrorist bombing in retaliation for her husband's order aboard his 
guided missile cruiser to shoot down an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband have been removed from their home and are being provided 
protection by the military at an undisclosed location. She could not be reached 
for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Times first learned of the contents of the counterproposal Thursday from a 
source within the school administration. Later in the day, The Times obtained a 
copy of the written counterproposal from a source outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rogers was dismissed from the school shortly after the van explosion. Her 
counterproposal comes in response to two separate contracts recently offered 
her by school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
One contract from the school would allow Mrs. Rogers back on campus if a 
"substantial" assurance of safety could be provided by the FBI, the Naval 
Investigative Service and the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The second contract would permit her to return "at the discretion of the 
headmaster." 
</P>
<P>
"The two alternative teacher agreements . . . are completely inadequate," says 
the counterproposal, which was signed by attorney Patrick Shea, retained by 
Mrs. Rogers to deal with negotiations with the school. "Mrs. Rogers' present 
contract clearly identifies her as a full-time fourth-grade teacher. That is 
also how she sees herself professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed new agreements do not even preserve her for that postion. In 
fact, it is impossible to determine from the agreements what exact position she 
would hold at La Jolla Country Day School. This tortured attempt to define 
around the problem misses the point and is, in itself, somewhat dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
Shea said the counterproposal all but means that Mrs. Rogers has rejected the 
two teaching contracts offered earlier by the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Completely inadequate are her words," Shea said. "And I don't see how you can 
construe that as meaning anything other than a rejection." 
</P>
<P>
However a source at the school said he did not interpret Mrs. Rogers' 
counterproposal as a flat rejection of the school's contract offers. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, they have not been rejected," said the source, who asked not to be 
identified. "She still has them and could sign them whenever she wants to." 
</P>
<P>
The course also indicated that it might be difficult for the school to accept 
Mrs. Rogers counterproposal. The source said the five-year salary plan, 
described as a "buyout," could be seen as unfair to the 66 other teachers at La 
Jolla Country Day who routinely sign one-year contracts and work at the 
pleasure of the headmaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unfair to Everybody' 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair to everybody," the source said. "It doesn't set any parameters. It 
doesn't set any conditions. It doesn't seem 'do-able.' 
</P>
<P>
"The point now is, Who's being fair?" 
</P>
<P>
But Shea denied that Rogers is proposing the five-year compensation plan as a 
way of punishing the school for its treatment of her. "It's not a buyout," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the amount over five years would total $200,000, Shea would only say: 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a substantial amount to her family budget. It's not something she 
could afford to just walk away from." 
</P>
<P>
The counterproposal was given to members of the executive committee of the 
school's board of trustees on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"My client is a fourth-grade teacher," said Shea, who signed the 
counterproposal. "She's one of their best teachers. She was a victim of a 
terrorist, violent act and it's not her fault. 
</P>
<P>
"She now wants to go back and be a fourth-grade teacher. That's that she 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Message to Terrorists 
</P>
<P>
Her second goal, he said, is to send a message to terrorists that the American 
people won't "allow them to destroy her career." 
</P>
<P>
The counterproposal states that the school must "immediately announce" her 
reinstatement as a fourth-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"It will additionally announce that, at her request, she will be on leave of 
absence with pay until the end of the (current) school year," the 
counterproposal says. 
</P>
<P>
"However both Mrs. Rogers and the school expect her to be back in the classroom 
September of next year." 
</P>
<P>
The counterproposal then discusses the five-year salary compensation plan. 
</P>
<P>
That plan would would kick in if "the school, through its management, 
determines that there is a good-faith concern for the health and/or safety of 
the school community as a result of Mrs. Rogers teaching in the classroom 
and/or presence on campus," according to the counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
The document also asks that the school pay for reasonable attorney fees and 
costs, not to exceed $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have been hoping there is some resolution on her job status by 
April 14, the normal deadline for teachers to submit signed contracts for next 
school year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 11 ARRESTED ON BOOKMAKING COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten men and one woman were arrested Thursday when sheriff's vice detectives 
served 16 search warrants at suspected bookmaking operations in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties that investigators believe took in more than $500,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 of the sites were doing business when the detectives, in a joint 
operation with Internal Revenue Service agents, simultaneously raided the homes 
and one business, Deputy Hal Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities seized a 1980 Audi, a 1979 Mercedes 450SL and a 1987 BMW 325i, 
and $60,000 cash, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Also confiscated was bookmaking equipment, such as computers with printers, 
cellular telephones and answering machines, Sheriff's Lt. Curtis Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
Spears said the daily profits from all 10 locations -- in Cerritos, Downey, 
Hermosa Beach, Orange, Paramount, San Gabriel, Sherman Oaks, Whittier and two 
sites in Santa Monica -- was at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged bookmakers operated out of nine private homes and one unmarked 
suite in an office building, placing bets predominantly on baseball and 
basketball games and horse races, Spears said. The suspects were jailed in lieu 
of bail ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, Grant said.

HOBNOBBING IT ON THE HILL; 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT COUPLE HAVE SEEN THEIR SHARE OF HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been 45 years since Midwesterners Harold and Dorothy Hoersch opened a 
14-stool lunch counter at 1st Avenue and Juniper Street, aptly named the 
Juniper Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, San Diego has grown from a smattering of 200,000 mostly military 
folk to a booming metropolitan center of more than a million, and the small 
lunch spot has become what is now known as Hob Nob Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In that time, the restaurant has blossomed into a favorite dining haunt of some 
of city's most powerful people, both past and present. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in among judges, bank presidents, business leaders, attorneys, physicians 
and politicians are regulars and senior citizens who have eaten at the 
restaurant since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steady Stream of Patrons 
</P>
<P>
Once the door opens at 7 a.m., a steady stream of the city's most prominent 
people and just plain diners fill the counter, booths and tables through the 
day, striking business deals as well as the occasional plea bargain and lawsuit 
settlement. Others simply chat. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoersches, both of whom work in the restaurant, have thus witnessed the 
eating habits of generations of San Diegans, some of whom have risen to 
prominence, others who have fallen from grace. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that the former "Mr. San Diego," C. Arnholt Smith, the financier 
who once ruled over a billion-dollar empire, ate his daily breakfast for more 
than 25 years. Smith tumbled from the top of the banking business after he was 
convicted of income tax fraud and embezzlement from his now-defunct U. S. 
National Bank and the companies he owned. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith used to sit right at the counter," the bespectacled Harold Hoersch said. 
"All the girls loved him because he knew what he wanted to order and he was 
always an impeccably perfect gentleman, like the Lord Calvert guy." 
</P>
<P>
It was also here that convicted swindler J. David (Jerry) Dominelli once dined 
during lunch breaks from his trial in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
After Hoersch heard about Dominelli's woes, he was dumbfounded one morning when 
the embattled financier strolled in with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He reached out and shook my hand, but I still couldn't believe it when the 
case first came out," Hoersch recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurant has also served Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, McDonald's founder and Padre owner Ray Kroc and even Los Angeles 
Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda. The Dodgers' skipper still checks in for 
breakfast and dinner when his club is in town. 
</P>
<P>
"He just likes to eat food," Hoersch said. "I once saw him eat two servings of 
smoked pork chops with all the trimmings that I didn't think he could." 
</P>
<P>
Defying all conventional restaurant odds by eschewing trends, decor changes and 
Saturday business hours, the Hoersches follow a simple guiding principle: good 
fare without flair. It's worked. The restaurant is the oldest single-owner 
eatery in San Diego, Hoersch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Despite the sporadic upheaval that might occur among its elite clientele, the 
restaurant remains a mirror of the Midwestern way of life, steeped in 
traditional values to which the Hoersches adhere. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's decor remains barely unchanged, with its wooden rose-colored 
chandeliers, its busboys clad in green, high-collared jackets, and a veteran 
staff of waitresses -- some of whom have worked at the restaurant for more than 
30 years. More than 200 customers have house tabs they pay at the end of the 
month, and Hoersch said he has even had to retire some of his help. 
</P>
<P>
The sturdy Hoersch, who turns 71 next week, left dust-ravaged Kansas in the 
early 1940s when an acre of land could be bought for a dollar if there had been 
any takers. He figured he could come to San Diego and work for Consolidated 
Voltee -- the aircraft company that later became General Dynamics -- during 
World War II emergency efforts. Dorothy, now 71, followed soon after, and the 
two were married in Yuma, Ariz., after she was able to get a ride aboard a 
train full of troops bound for San Diego. The couple, who met in high school, 
have been married 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
She also worked for Consolidated, but later went to work at the counter of the 
original lunch stand while her husband toiled over the grill in back. Hoersch 
quit the aircraft company in 1946 to pursue his dream of expanding the lunch 
counter -- originally a side income project -- into a full-blown restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
With $10,000 cash and a $10,000 loan at 6% interest, the Hoersches bought the 
other end of the building in which the lunch counter began. The 
5,000-square-foot building, kitchen equipment and land are now worth an 
estimated $2.5 million, Hoersch said. 
</P>
<P>
However, given that price tag today, and with the odds that only one in 10 
restaurants survives its first three years in business, Hoersch said he 
probably wouldn't take the same risk he did more than 40 years ago. He admitted 
that the thought makes him uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like that because it sounds negative, and we're not negative people," 
he said. "But you can't be an independent businessman and a pessimist . . . it 
won't work."

HOUSING AID SOUGHT FOR FIELDWORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A farm-worker advocacy group has asked San Diego officials to increase funding 
for a city program to upgrade dozens of dilapidated structures housing 
impoverished field hands in the agriculture-rich San Pasqual Valley and Lake 
Hodges area. 
</P>
<P>
California Rural Legal Assistance has also requested that officials take tough 
steps to increase participation in the program, which offers housing 
rehabilitation loans to farmers leasing city-owned land in the region. 
</P>
<P>
No farmers have taken advantage of $100,000 now available through the month-old 
loan program, and housing conditions for the immigrant field hands remain among 
the worst in the state, said Claudia Smith, regional counsel for the advocacy 
group. 
</P>
<P>
In an April 4 letter to Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Smith described badly 
deteriorated houses, trailers and other dwellings that most of the field hands 
rent from their employers. 
</P>
<P>
One farm worker, his wife and five children pay $200 a month for a trailer with 
a gaping hole in the bathroom floor and walls that have rusted through in 
places. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego housing officials said they have had little time to evaluate Smith's 
requests and argued that the loan program, which was approved by the city 
Housing Commission in early March, needs to be given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've started with this initial step," said Mary Jo Riley, a Housing 
Commission spokeswoman. "The program is a month old. We hope to work with it in 
the next six months and then evaluate it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussed Program 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials have discussed the program with three farmers, with two 
declining to participate. The third is receiving "technical assistance" from 
the city to get permits to perform repairs using his own money, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities plan to approach other growers and discuss the rehabilitation 
effort, she said. The program features loans of up to $50,000 at 5.5% that must 
be matched by private funds. 
</P>
<P>
One housing official suggested some of the farmers may not be able to afford 
the loans. Rehabilitation of just four of the 37 structures being considered 
for upgrading was estimated by city officials at $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, argued that a tougher approach is needed. Although the loan 
program is an important step, the pot of available money is too small and the 
voluntary nature of the effort has proven ineffective, Smith said in her letter 
to O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
"No (farmer) is required to take advantage of the opportunity in order to 
preserve his lease, no matter how substandard the structures in which his 
employee/tenants are housed," Smith wrote. "Simply put, the carrot is there, 
but the stick is missing. . . . To rely on the (farmer's) good-will, as the 
program now does, is to continue postponing real solutions." 
</P>
<P>
With about 97% of the land in the more than 10,000-acre region owned by the 
city and leased to farmers, San Diego officials could wield significant 
leverage over the growers to perform needed housing repairs, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
She suggested the city consider performing the required maintenance to bring 
the trailers and structures up to snuff, then charge the farmers for the 
repairs. Such a step is permitted under the existing lease setup. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative might be to declare that a farmer has forfeited his lease 
on the property if he fails to upgrade the dwellings. A stipulation in the 
leases requires the farmers to comply with all laws, and "clearly, from the 
city's own inspection records, they do not" regarding housing regulations, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the San Pasqual Valley and Lake Hodges area have the highest birth 
rate of any census tract in San Diego, Smith suggested that improving 
conditions for the field hands and their families "would seem a prime project 
for the Year of the Child."

BOARD OKS ESCONDIDO-AREA HALL FOR JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES; APPEAL VOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An emotional audience of proponents and opponents packed the small hearing room 
Thursday as the county Planning and Environmental Review Board voted 2 to 1 to 
approve construction of a 500-seat sanctuary for Jehovah's Witnesses at the 
southern edge of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the rural area have fought the project for two years and announced 
after the decision that they will appeal the approval of a major-use permit for 
the assembly hall, despite concessions made by church officials on use of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Under conditions of the permit, the 10-acre site is to be used only for 
religious purposes, and only on Sundays and two weeknights from 6:30 to 9:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Four Escondido-area Jehovah's Witnesses congregations, which have outgrown 
their meeting hall on South Orange Avenue, have been trying to build a new 
Kingdom Hall at Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The existing building holds people on a site with 35 parking spaces. The 
proposed new building will contain two sanctuaries, each able to accommodate 
250 people, and will have a 189-space parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Chernish, spokesman for the Jehovah Witness congregations, said the search 
for a new site began five years ago and the religious group had been trying to 
obtain county approval for its building since 1987. The Board of Supervisors 
denied the church group a permit last year because of the effect the new church 
would have on a neighborhood already burdened by traffic and congestion from 
another church nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposing the Witnesses' application maintained that the increased 
traffic would make a dangerous intersection at Encino and Bear Valley even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes of the traffic passing the site were presented by both sides, each 
showing varying amounts of traffic from sparse to congested. 
</P>
<P>
Chernish pledged to coordinate services at the new Jehovah's Witnesses church 
with those of the Emmanuel Faith Community Church so that traffic from the two 
congregations does not peak at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chernish protested when review board members set specific hours of use 
on the Kingdom Hall site. 
</P>
<P>
"It has come down to the place that we will have a million-dollar building that 
we can use for only two hours, one day a week," Chernish said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Empy, review board member and county plan implementation chief, said 
the restrictions are necessary because of the "profound impact to the 
residents' quality of life" that the new congregation would have. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection at Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive will be widened and 
improved by the Jehovah's Witnesses as a condition for receiving approval of 
the major-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they will appeal the ruling to the county Planning Commission. 
The panel's decision may be appealed to the Board of Supervisors.

While I agree with the thrust of your editorial, you're too tough on Fay in 
suggesting that he shared the guilt of not honoring the spirit of friendly

</P>
<P>
Fay offered the San Diego Yacht Club more time to build a boat (after members 
wasted three months dithering over his challenge) and an elimination series for 
challengers. Both were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
The point that is being missed is that the San Diego club offered Fay Hobson's

REELECT RICK TUTTLE AND JAMES K. HAHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times recommends the reelection of Rick Tuttle, who is running for a second 
term as controller of the City of Los Angeles, and James K. Hahn, who is 
running for his second term as city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn has lived up to expectations in his tasks as legal counsel to the city 
government and prosecutor of lesser crimes. He also has done a good job of 
chasing down landlords violating housing codes in inner city areas. Hahn has no 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle seems to us the kind of public servant you would like to see in every 
government office. He gets his basic work done, checking expense accounts, 
auditing the city's books and meeting its payroll. Then, in his spare time, he 
quietly finds other ways to make himself useful. 
</P>
<P>
He has modernized the city's payroll operation. His office will soon be able to 
do cost-accounting, an efficiency that could save the city millions of dollars 
in the future. He was out in front in the city's efforts to ban discrimination 
in private clubs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
We urge Los Angeles voters to return both Tuttle and Hahn to public office on 
April 11.

First, you rule prior to the race if a catamaran is not a suitable boat, not 
six months later after it has beaten the competition from here to Sunday.

And second, you don't award the cup to the team that lost. Call the race

STEMMING STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American taxpayers will pay off $2 billion in loan guarantees next fiscal year 
because many college and trade school students cannot or will not do it 
themselves. The federal government must reduce that high default rate and, with 
William J. Bennett no longer trying to dictate terms as education secretary, 
President Bush and Congress have a chance to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
The current education secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, has rejected a Bennett 
approach that would have canceled all federal student aid at colleges where 
default rates were extraordinarily high. Bennett's proposal, which was no 
solution at all, would have punished all needy students at those schools 
because some of their fellow students were deadbeats -- without trying to find 
out if there were some way they could pay back the loan. Bennett's proposals so 
worried some lawmakers that last year they considered preempting the field with 
legislation. The attempt foundered on the question of how stringent the rules 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Senate returned to the problem, unanimously passing a bill that 
would require colleges and trade schools with 25% default rates to get more 
involved in trying to cut the losses. Those schools would have to work more 
intensively with students to produce more precise plans for repayment. If the 
default rate remained high, a state loan guarantee agency would decide whether 
students were willfully withholding payments or were in economic distress 
before a final decision to cut off federal aid could be made. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill incorporates an important principle by giving colleges a bigger 
role in policing their own students' loans. Schools have had a better record of 
holding down defaults in another federal program in which the loans go through 
the colleges rather than directly to students as in the guaranteed loan 
program. In 1987, for example, the Education Department declared that students 
at Pasadena City College had a 28% default rate on the guaranteed federal loan 
program. At the same time, students at Pasadena had only a 6.6% default rate on 
loans processed through the college. 
</P>
<P>
There is another way that the Bush Administration and Secretary Cavazos could 
help. In addition to student loans, there is a program of direct grants, named 
Pell Grants after their sponsor, Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). Over the eight 
years of the Reagan Administration, Congress stood firm against attempts to cut 
these Pell Grant funds, but it never was able to increase them, either, at a 
time when college costs were soaring. Ten years ago, Pell grants covered 
three-fourths of the aid a student required to attend college and student loans 
accounted for the rest. Today, those figures are reversed. The Bush 
Administration might save more money than it now spends on bad loans if it 
invested more in grants. 
</P>
<P>
By passing its bill, the Senate has signaled the direction in which it would 
like to see the government go toward curbing the loss from loans. The next step 
is up to Cavazos. A realistic plan would give colleges a chance to help their 
students understand their obligations and the economic realities they face 
before the federal ax comes down.

CANDOR AT ANY COST

Seconds before the City Council voted Tuesday not to hold a public debate on 
the conflicts of interest created by Mayor Tom Bradley's private business 
dealings, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky leaned over and quipped to his colleague 
Nate Holden that what "the city needs now is a little glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
Holden, of course, is one of Bradley's opponents in next Tuesday's mayoral 
election. Yaroslavsky himself withdrew from the race only after he decided the 
mayor could not be beaten. Nevertheless, while the comment was flippant, it 
also was apt. Openness, which is what glasnost means, is the only thing that 
can redeem this unseemly incident. 
</P>
<P>
As they have unfolded so far, the facts of the case are as straightforward as 
they are disturbing: For more than a decade, Bradley has received $24,000 per 
year for serving as a director of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Two of 
that thrift's subsidiaries have received city approval for zoning changes on 
properties they own, and the parent firm is involved in a $2.7-million tax 
dispute with the city. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether his employment with a private financial institution 
conflicted with his obligations as mayor, Bradley replied, "I am a very unusual 
person and I don't want you comparing me with somebody else in some other city 
in some other circumstance. I bring something to this equation that you won't 
find the run-of-the-mill elected official being able to bring to the table." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the mayor announced he was returning $18,000 in fees he had 
received for serving as a foreign trade adviser to Far East Bank, where some 
city funds are on deposit. Bradley now says he returned the money after he 
learned Far East does business with the city. However, his decision coincided 
with a newspaper investigation into his ties with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
At one point while he was in the bank's employ, Bradley -- after receiving a 
call from Far East's president -- telephoned the city treasurer and discussed 
Los Angeles' policy on bank deposits. Following that conversation, the city 
doubled the amount of its deposit with Far East to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor insists "there was no impropriety" in those calls, just as he defends 
his employment with Valley Federal. But the conflict between Bradley's private 
relationship with these financial institutions and his public responsibilities 
as mayor is so clear that his assertions to the contrary are simply 
insupportable. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should this matter be treated like an ordinary campaign issue, which is 
what Bradley's supporters on the council did when they voted not to discuss the 
question in public. What is at issue here is the mayor's conduct and not what 
his political opponents may make of it. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's business activities already are the object of an investigation by 
City Atty. James K. Hahn. Holden's motions have been referred to the Council's 
Governmental Operations Committee. The result of both inquiries ought to be not 
only a full airing of Bradley's dubious moonlighting, but also reform of the 
city's fragmentary and inadequate regulations on the disclosure of public 
officials' private business activities.

'VISION OF ONE WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garrett Hardin ("Khomeini Discolors Vision of One World," Op-Ed Page, March 22) 
argues that a single world state would inevitably destroy freedom of speech 
anywhere on the planet. He cites as evidence the works by Lawrence and Joyce 
which were first released in foreign countries because "passionate minorities" 
prevented home publication. To Hardin, the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence 
against Salman Rushdie is a similar phenomenon, and in a One World state 
powerful minorities like Khomeini would prevent the worldwide expression of 
views disagreeable to them because the authors would have "nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Hardin's logic fails on two counts. Khomeini is not a "passionate minority" in 
Iran; he is the ruler of a theocratic and authoritarian state where his decree 
is law, and where freedom of speech is not an accepted political norm. And 
despite the success of passionate minorities in preventing the publication of 
the works of Lawrence and Joyce in England and Ireland, no less passionate 
minorities in the United States fail to suppress the expression and publication 
of ideas offensive to them every day. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are numerous groups in America who yearn to prohibit the 
dissemination of such works as textbooks on evolution, "The Last Temptation of 
Christ," and indeed, "The Satanic Verses" itself. They fail not because the 
creators of these works have somewhere else they can go, but because the value 
we place on free and open inquiry outweighs the offense any individual idea may 
render to any particular group's sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin's argument derives from the tired old claim that a single world state 
would "inevitably" become a tyranny, and that the continuation of the 
500-year-old nation-state system, however successful it may have been, is our 
only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing "inevitable" is the continued movement of humankind toward its 
inevitable destiny of a One World state and a One World human community. Such a 
One World will not inevitably be a tyranny or a theocracy or inevitably 
anything else. It will instead be whatever we make of it.

'AMERICA'S CUP DECISION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "The America's Cup Decision," March 30: 
</P>
<P>
To characterize the San Diego Yacht Club's choice of a catamaran in response to 
Michael Fay's maverick challenge as "smart aleck" is ridiculous. If anyone is 
the smart aleck here it's Michael Fay for breaking with tradition and 
challenging between races. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner and crew won the cup in international competition in 1987 and 
deserve to keep it until the next international competition in 1991. That's 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Fay should be a good sport and sit tight until 1991 like everybody else. The 
heck with the small print in the old Deed of Gift! 
</P>
<P>
If the San Diego Yacht Club must hand over the cup to Fay, I'm hoping the club 
challenges him to another race. A maverick challenge. And if we lose, no 
problem, just challenge him again . . . that seems to be in keeping with the 
new spirit of the America's Cup as defined by Fay and New York Supreme Court 
Judge Carmen Ciparick.

.. . BUT BUILD THE ACADEMY ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLIE W. NEUBAUER, Sallie W. Neubauer is president of the Citizens 
Committee to Save Elysian Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department is once again trying to bully its way around 
Elysian Park. Proposition 2, the Police Facilities Bond Measure, is so poorly 
worded that most voters will probably not realize that it includes funds for a 
new police academy. But it does. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not spelled out, the LAPD has made it known that it has 
earmarked $40 million of the $176-million bond issue for a new academy, that 
constructing the academy is the LAPD's top priority and that Elysian Park is 
the preferred site. The LAPD has claimed that it has not determined whether it 
will rebuild on the current police academy site in Elysian Park or elsewhere, 
but it has also admitted that the $40-million figure does not include money for 
land acquisition, should that be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
As a group that has been fighting the expansion of the police academy in 
Elysian Park for 22 years, the Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park is well 
aware that the academy is overcrowded and in need of repair. We do not question 
that new training facilities are needed. We also know that training facilities 
in Elysian Park are disruptive to, and incompatible with, recreational park use 
and that alternative and better-suited sites, especially one at Los Angeles 
Southwest Community College, are available. The Angeles Chapter of the Sierra 
Club supports our position on this matter. 
</P>
<P>
Our position is also supported by a 1972 study by the city's chief 
administrative officer. That extensive 59-page report concluded, first, that 
the "Elysian Park site is now and will always be inadequate for the high 
quality and comprehensive training required for the Los Angeles Police 
Department." It further concluded that increased public use of the parkland 
surrounding the academy site was inevitable and that police activity there 
"will result in constant irritation and is incompatible use of public land." 
</P>
<P>
Those observations remain true in 1989. The plans for the police academy call 
for a threefold increase in the occupant capacity, with more than 224,000 
square feet of buildings. The plans also call for multi-story parking garages 
that would accommodate more than 1,000 cars to replace the surface parking 
area. Clearly, this scale of construction and the activity that goes with it do 
not belong in a park. This is especially true, given how little parkland Los 
Angeles has in relation to its population. 
</P>
<P>
The police assure us that the new expanded police academy would not take more 
parkland, but if that is the case why is there no language to that effect in 
the proposal? Even if the police stay within the 21 acres that are now 
controlled by the Board of Public Works, their presence in such an increased 
capacity would have a drastic negative impact on Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park has raised these and other issues 
with both the LAPD and the City Council subcommittees that reviewed the 
proposition before the council's vote to put it on Tuesday's ballot. However, 
both our arguments and our request to separate the police academy funding from 
the rest of Proposition 2 fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
The construction and expansion of a police academy, whether at its current site 
or elsewhere, is too important an issue to be hidden in such an 
all-encompassing and vaguely worded bond issue. It is unfair to ask the public 
to vote for new facilities for their neighborhoods at the possible expense of 
the loss of their park. The voters should let the LAPD and the City Council 
know that they consider parkland a valuable asset by voting no on Proposition 
2.

WORLD'S ISOLATION OF CAMBODIA ONLY INVITES POL POT'S RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEREMY J. STONE, Jeremy J. Stone is president of the Federation of American 
Scientists.

<TEXT>
<P>
Will the world see a second Khmer Rouge holocaust in Cambodia in the 1990s? The 
Vietnamese have just stepped up their timetable to withdraw the forces that 
saved Cambodia from Pol Pot. Wednesday, they announced that they would withdraw 
their forces by this September whether or not there is sufficient agreement 
among the contending forces to protect against the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
This action was foreshadowed in Hanoi in February when Nguyen Thi Binh, the 
vice chairman of Vietnam's Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that Vietnam did 
not "have the power to force all parties to an agreement" but planned to 
withdraw anyway. Nguyen thought that the Vietnamese-backed government, the 
People's Republic of Kampuchea, would by then be able to "stand firm." She 
recognized, however, that if there was "no settlement and no ending of aid to 
the Khmer Rouge and others, then the danger (of a return of the Khmer Rouge) 
will really be there." 
</P>
<P>
She concluded: "For our part, we have done all in our capacity to help the 
Cambodians recover from the genocide. The international community has a 
responsibility now. Only Vietnam has helped Cambodia so far. Other countries, 
including the U.S., now have to help. We have done what we can. We have to help 
ourselves now." 
</P>
<P>
But what is the United States planning to do to help? If things are left to the 
only congressional subcommittee -- Asian and Pacific affairs -- that holds 
hearings on this subject, we would probably pump more weapons into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Solarz, chairman of the subcommittee, said last month that he was 
seriously considering pressing for lethal aid to Prince Sihanouk because ". . . 
at the end of the day the non-communist resistance may be the last best hope 
the Cambodians have of preventing a fate which could be worse than death." 
</P>
<P>
But all military estimates show that the main bulwark to the return of the 
Khmer Rouge is the Cambodian government itself and its militia. Moreover, David 
Hawk of the Cambodia Documentation Center warned the congressman at the March 1 
hearing, "just last week, Sihanouk was wanting arms to fight (the government of 
Cambodia Premier) Hun Sen." 
</P>
<P>
On March 15 Sihanouk showed up in a Beijing press conference with Khmer Rouge 
leader Khieu Samphan, calling, jointly, for just such lethal aid and for a new 
High Council for National Defense with the Khmer Rouge. So there is not, to put 
it mildly, much certainty that this new lethal aid would be used against the 
Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
George Santayana once defined a fanatic as one who redoubled his efforts as he 
lost sight of his goals. U.S. policy now risks such a characterization. 
</P>
<P>
The main emphasis of U.S. policy should be preventing the return of the Khmer 
Rouge. But in the past, and still today, our real policy has been to join with 
China and the member countries of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations in 
forcing the Vietnamese forces out of Cambodia. Meanwhile our high-flown 
declaratory policy was to engineer a four-way provisional government (including 
the Khmer Rouge as one of the participants) that would bring democracy to 
Cambodia. The first goal is being achieved at considerable risk of a second 
holocaust. The second goal is a dangerous mirage. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Khmer Rouge is trying to obstruct or subvert any agreement. 
Prince Sihanouk is congenitally incapable of compromise so long as there is any 
alternative. And the People's Republic of Kampuchea has invested 10 years in 
building up a government that controls the entire territory and knows full well 
that the population cannot abide injecting the Khmer Rouge, as a group, into 
even a provisional government. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Prince Sihanouk ought now to be encouraged to drop out of the Khmer 
Rouge coalition. His embrace of the Khmer Rouge is destroying his credibility 
in Cambodia and abroad anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international community should press the Chinese and the Thais 
to stop helping the Khmer Rouge with their arms and sanctuaries; the Khmer 
Rouge was, after all, resurrected simply and solely for the purpose of helping 
drive the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The world can have high assurance against the return of the Khmer Rouge. But to 
do so, all concerned would have to work with what already exists, the Hun Sen 
government, by easing pressure on it. 
</P>
<P>
Probably, the world can also have the incorporation of Prince Sihanouk into 
such a government. In Phnom Penh in February, Hun Sen said he had twice offered 
Prince Sihanouk the position of chief of state and was prepared, if Sihanouk 
left the Pol Pot coalition, to try again. But the Khmer Rouge-Sihanouk 
coalition would have to be broken up by giving the imperious and mercurial 
Sihanouk no other choice than to deal with Hun Sen. He has to be told that with 
or without him, the United States and others will simply recognize the People's 
Republic of Kampuchea. 
</P>
<P>
What we don't need are more arms. And what won't help is a policy of isolating 
Cambodia -- as if the present government, rather than the Khmer Rouge, were the 
real problem.

KEROSENE ON JAPAN'S ARMS DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
NATIONALIST VIEWS ON DEFENSE ARE FED BY OUR FSX QUIBBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NATHANIEL B. THAYER and MICHAEL GREEN, Nathaniel B. Thayer is a professor of 
Japanese studies at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns 
Hopkins University in Washington. Michael Green is a SAIS scholar doing 
research in Tokyo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is the FSX issue over except for the congressional shouting? Not at all. The 
Japanese must soon decide what to do about the engine for the proposed military 
jetcraft. A former member of the Japanese Cabinet is willing to consider buying 
it from the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
This view is extreme and receives no support, in part because the Soviets make 
a bad engine. More pertinent are two other questions: Should Japan produce its 
own weapons? Or should Japan rely on its military ally, the United States, for 
its supply? The Japanese defense community has silently fought over these 
questions since the early 1970s. This battle shows two contending camps: the 
nationalists and the internationalists. 
</P>
<P>
The nationalists seek prestige. They are proud that Japan now has its own 
surface-to-ship missile, a trainer aircraft and a new tank. The 
internationalists want Japan's defense to be non-threatening. They point out 
that none of these weapons project Japanese force beyond the home islands and 
coastal waters, nor may they be exported abroad. Informed Japanese observers 
saw the decision to develop the FSX jointly with the United States as an 
internationalists' victory. But the U.S. decision to question this agreement 
will benefit the nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
The nationalists can make good arguments why Japan should have its own arms 
industry. Japan has opted for small, high-tech military forces. The military 
forces' effectiveness relies in part on the potential to produce weapons that 
are not in an adversary's arsenal. As a matter of strategy, an island nation 
like Japan should try to reduce its reliance on imported weapons. And the arms 
industry creates jobs and technological spin-offs that can contribute to 
Japan's competitiveness. The major argument, though, is political and 
emotional: Japan must have the ability to defend itself by itself. That is the 
base line to which the nationalists always return. 
</P>
<P>
There are also good arguments why Japan should not develop an independent 
capacity to produce arms. When developed domestically, weapons take longer to 
produce and cost more to make than buying them off the shelf from the United 
States. The arms may be difficult to integrate into other weapons systems, 
which in Japan's case are usually American-made. Japanese self-defense forces 
are still small and will only need a few weapons -- not enough to provide the 
base of experience to make better weapons. Developing arms domestically does 
nothing to redress the tilting U.S.-Japan balance of trade and invites a 
dangerous confusion of trade and defense issues. These are all arguments that 
the internationalists have made. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the role of the United States as an ally has been the decisive 
factor in Japan's internal debate over weapons development. Japan's Asian 
neighbors and Japanese moderates have seen the rearmament of Japan as tolerable 
only so long as Japan is firmly tied by security treaty to the United States. 
Article III of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty calls on the two nations 
"individually and in cooperation with each other" to develop "their capacities 
to resist armed attack." And Article IV calls on the two nations to "consult 
together" on how to do so. In short, the defense of Japan is a cooperative 
endeavor and this fact has been the unassailable pillar of the 
internationalists' arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Only once have the nationalists have been able to advance their arguments for 
kokusanka (domestic weapons development) to the level of official policy. This 
was in the early 1970s after President Richard M. Nixon's "Guam Doctrine" 
caused a crisis of confidence in Tokyo regarding America's commitment to the 
defense of Japan. Pressure from the United States and China eventually killed 
the kokusanka doctrine. The internationalists then established a long-term 
defense outline to ensure that Japan's future defense debate be defined within 
the context of the security treaty. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the defense debate in Japan has matured. In the 1980s a consensus 
has developed throughout the majority party, the bureaucracy and even the media 
that Japan's self-defense forces can contribute to a more stable world. This 
consensus has allowed the government to break its earlier policy of keeping 
defense spending within 1% of the gross nationalproduct and to refer to Japan 
as a member of the Western Alliance -- actions unthinkable only a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But there still is no consensus over the question of arms development. This 
debate lies smoldering where it was dropped in the early 1970s. And America is 
about to pour kerosene on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is correct to integrate economic and security 
considerations in arms deals such as FSX. But we are coming close to sending 
two dangerous messages to Japan: that Japan's defense is subordinate to a 
larger trade problem and that Japan should not expect access to our most 
advanced technology even for its defense. We should think hard about whether or 
not this is what we really mean.

'MR. MAGOO BANDIT' SOUGHT IN WESTLAKE BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bank robbery in Westlake Village this week was the work of the "Mr. Magoo 
Bandit," who is suspected of robbing a dozen banks in the South Bay and Orange 
County, sheriff's deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit -- nicknamed after the nearsighted cartoon character because he 
wears thick glasses -- robbed the Coast Savings bank in the 32100 block of West 
Agoura Road shortly after it opened at 9 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Frank Woodall 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Robbery Division. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect handed a teller a note demanding money after showing her a handgun 
concealed in a brown leather bag, Woodall said. He escaped a few minutes later 
with $4,400 in cash, authorities said. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The man's description matched that of a robber responsible for 11 holdups in 
the South Bay area and one in Anaheim between March 28 and April 4, FBI 
spokesman Fred Reagan said. Seven of the South Bay-area banks were robbed 
within a 24-hour period, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel fairly strongly " that the same man is responsible for all 13 
robberies, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, believed to be in his early 30s, was described as white, with 
light brown hair, about 6 feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds. His face is 
marked with small scars, probably from acne, authorities said. He was last seen 
wearing a light green T-shirt and brown slacks.

DRIVER IN FATAL ACCIDENT HAD ILLEGAL BLOOD-ALCOHOL LEVEL, CHP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blood-alcohol level of a Ventura County woman was twice the amount needed 
to categorize her as legally drunk when she was involved in an accident that 
killed three young men and injured two others, the California Highway Patrol 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Helen Mannes, 34, of Somis had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.20%, said CHP 
Officer Lisa Sowell. In California, a person with a level of 0.10% is 
considered legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
The results were released sooner than usual because the CHP and the Ventura 
County district attorney's office requested that Mannes' blood test be given 
top priority, Sowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving Friday night after her car 
hit five pedestrians whose car had a flat tire on the Ventura Freeway near 
Camarillo. The men were returning to Camarillo after picking up a friend in 
Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Mannes was arrested in the San Fernando Valley for driving 
with a blood-alcohol content of 0.26%, the CHP said. She was released on her 
own recognizance after eight hours in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was released from a Thousand Oaks hospital on Monday and is at Simi 
Valley Adventist Hospital on the advice of a psychiatrist, Sowell said.

5 CHALLENGERS' FINAL SHOTS AT KORENSTEIN HAVE FAMILIAR THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Challengers, who after weeks of campaigning have finally polished their pitch 
to voters, Thursday seized their last opportunity to criticize Los Angeles 
school board member Julie Korenstein face-to-face before the election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The five challengers, who are seeking to replace Korenstein as the West San 
Fernando Valley representative on the seven-member Los Angeles Board of 
Education, continued to voice criticism of district policies such as bilingual 
education, voluntary busing and a counseling program for gay and lesbian 
students. 
</P>
<P>
And Korenstein, who is seeking a full four-year term after 20 months in office, 
continued to defend those programs. Although she told the 30 people who 
attended the candidates forum at the Germain Street Elementary School in 
Chatsworth that she is "starting to shake things up" at the district, 
Korenstein acknowledged that when she sought the office in 1987, she made 
criticisms similar to those her challengers now voice, attacking the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting wearing," Korenstein said of campaigning as an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
But the often harsh words and criticism are a sharp contrast to the joking and 
small talk that the candidates share among themselves before the forums and 
during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaking Skills Honed 
</P>
<P>
After speaking at panels together over the past weeks, the candidates have 
honed their messages to fit the three minutes given for introductory remarks. 
Once nervous and inexperienced speakers, the challengers now, for example, have 
come to recognize that criticism of Project 10, the gay counseling program, 
will almost always win applause from West Valley voters, and they pause with 
precise timing for the expected reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Barbara Romey and Gerald Horowitz are appealing to conservative 
voters and say they are hopeful that they will force Korenstein into a run-off. 
</P>
<P>
Romey, a former accountant, lost to Korenstein in a 1987 run-off election to 
fill the two years remaining in former school board member David Armor's term. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, formerly principal of Frost Junior High School in Granada Hills, has 
rallied parents there who were angry over his transfer last summer to a school 
in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein has outspent all of her challengers and will likely raise more than 
$100,000 before election day. Much of her support comes from teachers and the 
United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA sponsored an open house at James Monroe High School in Sepulveda Thursday 
night, an event where parents were invited to meet their children's teachers 
and were then asked to vote for Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely want to win over the parents," Monroe math teacher Jenni Marple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also running for the West Valley seat are Cliff Stadig, Dauna Packer and 
Michael Kaliczak.

HIT-RUN KILLS WORKER DOING TRAFFIC STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who had been setting up warning cones for a traffic study on the Ventura 
Freeway was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver near Westlake Village, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Alan Ewing, 27, of Simi Valley apparently was walking to his truck after 
setting up orange cones to close off one of the eastbound lanes of the freeway 
near Westlake Boulevard when he was struck by an eastbound car at 11:30 p.m. 
Wednesday, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, a contract worker for the California Department of Transportation 
studying the weight of vehicles on the freeway, died at the scene, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Jim Utter said investigators questioned a woman who owns a 
Volkswagen, but no arrests were made in the case. "We're pretty sure that is 
the car that was involved," Utter said. The woman's name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen, with front end damage, was found behind a closed gas station at 
Lindero Canyon Road and Agoura Road. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that shortly after the accident but before the car was 
abandoned, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy on patrol saw two people and 
two cars parked behind the closed station. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not aware of our incident, and he went over there to make sure there 
wasn't a burglary in progress," Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy talked to the couple and determined there was no burglary, but he 
filled out a field interview report which included the name of the man and 
woman, who was the registered owner of the Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the deputy heard a police broadcast about the hit and run, 
remembered the damage to the car behind the gas station and immediately 
returned, Utter said. The Volkswagen was still there, but the man, woman and 
the other car were gone. 
</P>
<P>
Though the owner of the damaged car was questioned, CHP officers must complete 
the investigation before deciding whether to arrest anyone, Utter said. 
Investigators have found no witnesses to the accident, he said.

REBOUNDING BRADLEY IN HUNT AT STONERIDGE

<P>
In case there was any doubt, let this be a warning to the rest of the LPGA 
Tour: The old Pat Bradley is back. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year struggle against hyperthyroidism, Bradley, 38, is again 
playing the brand of golf that has made her the tour's leading money-winner of 
all time. She has had two top-10 finishes in a row and headed toward another 
Thursday by shooting a 69 in the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori tournament at 
StoneRidge Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's opening round, two under par, left her on the heels of Deedee Lasker, 
Dale Eggeling and Cindy Rarick, who tied for the lead with 68. Lasker, a 
resident of Rancho Santa Fe, is seeking her first victory in six-plus seasons 
on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
With the temperature soaring to 102 degrees and a stiff breeze kicking up in 
late morning, nobody tore up the 6,042-yard course. As a result, 19 women ended 
the day within two shots of the three leaders, and 11 others were three strokes 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who shot 36 on the front nine and 33 on the back, was matched at 69 by 
Sherri Turner (the top money-winner on the tour last year), Laura Davies, Nancy 
Brown, Sherri Steinhauer, Martha Nause, Kim Williams and Missie Berteotti. 
</P>
<P>
Ayako Okamoto got off to a rocky start in her bid to win here for the third 
year in a row. Her round of 75 relegated her to a tie for 81st place and put 
her in danger of missing the cut, which will take the low 70 golfers plus ties 
after today's second round. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who lives in Marco Island, Fla., has earned $2,471,971 since joining 
the tour in 1974, including a record $492,021 in 1986. But she won only $15,965 
last season and reached low ebb when she finished 73rd and last in this 
tournament a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two years of pure living hell," she said. "I couldn't hit a drive 190 
yards, and usually I go about 240 off the tee. Many of my associates were 
feeling for me. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks after I played here, I finally gave in and saw some doctors. They 
used radioactive iodine to turn off my thyroid. Now I religiously take a 
thyroid pill every day, and I feel better than I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley first noticed that something was wrong late in her record-breaking 1986 
season, in which she won five tournaments, three of them majors. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was having my greatest year, I was having tremendous headaches," 
she said. "I would say this or that was wrong, but little did I know that was 
the start of my thyroid problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors gave me three options -- pills, surgery or the radioactive iodine. 
After I chose the iodine, it was seven or eight months before I was balanced 
and synchronized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to predict how far I'll come back. The competitive fire is 
still burning, but this game was life and death for me, and I don't want to 
lock myself into that mode again." 
</P>
<P>
Of her round Thursday, Bradley said, "I had five birdies and three bogeys. 
Playing in the morning, I had an advantage in that there was virtually no wind 
until the last five or six holes. Also, the greens weren't bumpy yet. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can feel the momentum coming back. After one drive I hit today, Becky 
Pearson, who was playing with me, said, 'Last year it would have taken you two 
shots to get that far.' I'm optimistic and encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Lasker, 29, a native of Chicago and graduate of the University of Tulsa, moved 
to Rancho Santa Fe 1 1/2 years ago. Although she has yet to win a tournament, 
she has finished second twice and earned $206,072. 
</P>
<P>
"I just haven't been able to make the big breakthrough," she said. "People ask 
me why I haven't done better on the tour, and it's frustrating. You always have 
to work on the mental aspect of your game. Attitude is so important, and mine 
hasn't always been just right." 
</P>
<P>
Lasker played the back nine first, shooting a 35, then came with a 33. She had 
four birdies and a bogey, on the 11th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I chipped to within a foot on No. 11 and just missed the putt," she said. "But 
I was real happy with my round. It was consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of relatives and friends here on passes, so I want to make sure 
I make the cut. I like the support they gave me today. It's more fun than being 
out there with nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Eggeling, who will be 35 on April 21, is from Tampa and attended the University 
of South Florida. She has earned $465,219 in 13-plus seasons on the tour, 
including a victory in the Boston Five tournament in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a squeaky voice because of a cold and laryngitis, Eggeling said, "I 
could be doing a lot better, but I can be ripping up a course and then all of a 
sudden it catches me by the throat. I did all right today, but I should have 
had two more birdies than I did." 
</P>
<P>
Rarick, 29, attended the University of Hawaii and lives in Tucson. She has won 
$302,684 in four-plus tour seasons, including $162,073 and two victories in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The good year I had in '87 put pressure on me and snowballed into a bad 
situation," Rarick said. "This year I have a better attitude. I missed two 
possible birdies today, but otherwise I played well."

Surprisingly, the golfers didn't seem to be bothered Thursday by the 102-degree 
heat during the first round of the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori tournament at 
StoneRidge. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Pamela Wright, a native of Scotland who shot a 70, said, "It was 
very nice out there. I like it. It beats the cold and dreary weather back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
There were more complaints about bumpy greens than anything else, those coming 
from the women who had late tee times. The wind that started about 11 a.m. also 
was a factor. Most of the low scores were posted in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Sherri Turner, a diabetic, had been concerned about the heat but said, "I had 
no problems at all. I took less insulin this morning than usual, brought along 
a banana and some crackers and drank a lot of water. I like the heat. It helps 
me stay loose." 
</P>
<P>
Co-leader Deedee Lasker (68) was the only San Diego area entrant who broke par. 
</P>
<P>
Other scores: Meg Mallon, Ramona, 73; Heather Drew, Solana Beach, and Yuka 
Irie, Carlsbad, 74; Kathryn Young, Coronado, 75; Debbie Skinner, Chula Vista, 
78; Sharon Barrett, Spring Valley, 84. Amateur Allison Shapcott, a U.S. 
International student from England, shot an 82. BOB WOLF

Ken Norman scored 34 points and Benoit Benjamin added 29 Thursday night at the 
Sports Arena as the Clippers beat the Portland Trail Blazers for the first time 
in three years, 133-123. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Gary Grant added 17 points and 20 assists for the Clippers, who had lost 
17 in a row to Portland. The Clippers now have 18 victories, one more than they 
had last season. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler scored 36 points for Portland, whose lead over Dallas shrunk to 
one game for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference. The 
defeat was the Blazers' seventh in the past nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey and Terry Porter each scored 20 points for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
After the Clippers took a 113-99 lead on Norman's layup, Drexler keyed a 
Portland rally that cut the deficit to seven points with 3:03 left. But 
Benjamin sealed the victory with a dunk and four free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers led, 65-50, at halftime and took their biggest lead of the game, 
81-58, with 7:46 left in the third quarter.

FISHING / DAN STANTON: WEATHER POOR, BUT ANGLER SETS HALIBUT DERBY MARK WITH 
45-POUNDER

<P>
Freakish weather plagued the Santa Monica Halibut Derby on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was breezy, and swells curtailed full-day angling for most of the 1,800 who 
participated in the charity event. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rogalla of Buena Park, fishing with his brother Wayne from their 22-foot 
boat, caught a halibut that shattered all derby records. 
</P>
<P>
Drifting close to shore off Torrance Beach, Rogalla, using a live anchovy for 
bait, hooked the derby winner that weighed in at 45 pounds, 1 ounce. The catch 
was good for a $1,200 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Goodwin of West Los Angeles finished second with his 29-pound, 8-ounce 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
At the Marina del Rey weight station, 415 of the fish caught in the derby were 
big enough to qualify for the drawing of prizes at an April 15 banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray who qualified with catches longer 
than 23 inches and weighing up to 10 pounds: Mike Baker of Torrance, Rick 
Hawley of Redondo Beach, Hector Banuelos of Culver City, Tom Hopper of Venice 
and Melody Franks of Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Bourget, chairman of the derby, said proceeds will again be donated to the 
Boys' Club of Santa Monica. Proceeds will also benefit the halibut hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
Bourget said 250,000 halibut will soon be released from the King Harbor 
hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing in his sea skiff, Rick Beirold of Avalon was using 20-pound test line 
with a live anchovy at the east end of Catalina Island near the kelp when he 
hooked a white sea bass. Unable to boat the fighting fish, he called on 
companion Bob Lee, who gaffed the 37-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Mo Mo Pac of West Los Angeles, fishing Santa Monica Bay aboard the Happyman, 
caught the whopper of the week when he reeled in a 34-pound halibut. Pac was 
not competing in the Santa Monica Halibut Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Bowman of Santa Monica, at Catalina Island aboard the Pronto, won the 
jackpot with a 25-pound ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
Sonney Mumy of Torrance won the jackpot on the Sea Spray with a 21-pound 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Sung Yu Lee of Torrance, fishing at Twin Roads aboard the Redondo Special, 
caught a 20-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
Fishing slowed over the weekend for party boats. 
</P>
<P>
Catches improved Tuesday with bass and sculpin at local areas. Bonito at 
Catalina rebounded, with anglers averaging three per rod. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Happyman fished Santa Monica Bay and 
anglers caught 33 sculpin, 22 sand bass and five halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Spitfire fished the derby and the two-day count for the flatties was 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar worked the derby and the count was 20 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O's crowd in the derby landed 20 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray tried Rocky Point, and anglers chalked up 
125 sculpin, 18 sand bass and 12 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special on a half-day trip to Twin Roads chalked up 24 halibut, 
eight sand bass and seven barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked Hidden Reef and scored with 160 rock cod and one ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo headed to Horseshoe Kelp on a half-day 
trip and anglers sacked 42 calico bass, five sand bass and four sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom, fishing Catalina, returned with 250 bonito, 10 rockfish and five 
calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Matt Walsh fished the Rockpile and found sculpin, 
with 67 going into the sacks plus one sole. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marlin of San Pedro, fishing Lake Casitas, landed a 13 1/2-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Swann of Long Beach tried Santa Ana Lakes and landed a 11 3/4-pound 
rainbow trout.

Bishop Montgomery figured Thursday night would be a good time to reassert 
itself in Angelus League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights were at home against Bishop Amat, were rested from a week off and 
were looking ahead to a bye in league play later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was Bishop Amat that jumped back into league contention with a 6-2 
victory over Bishop Montgomery at Torrance Park. The Lancers took advantage of 
five Bishop Montgomery errors and five Knight pitchers to improve to 1-2 in 
league and 6-8 overall. The Knights fell to 1-3 and 11-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed because for the second game in a row our defense just 
absolutely collapsed," said Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob Anderson. "We've 
committed 11 errors in the last two games after committing just 15 in our 14 
previous games." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights scored in the first when Curtis Bowman and Dudley Callahan drew 
walks and advanced on a wild pitch. Erik Russell's sacrifice fly scored Bowman 
and Pat Sprengel's bunt plated Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
They maintained the advantage until the third when Bishop Amat sent 11 men to 
the plate and scored five runs on four hits and two errors. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Mota got aboard on shortstop Bowman's error, went to second on Andy 
Branch's wild pitch and scored on Juan Hernandez's double. Brian Harmon reached 
on an error and Hernandez went to third. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Don Batty bobbled a double-play ball, allowing Hernandez to 
score, and Hector Rodriguez tripled in two runs to give Bishop Amat a lead it 
would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
Branch (3-2) suffered the loss while J. D. Romero (1-0) earned the victory in 
relief of Robert Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fairly pleased with the pitching," Anderson said. "It was just a matter 
of making a couple of key errors and their getting key hits." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery had just four hits while Bishop Amat banged out eight, led by 
Rodriguez who had three hits and a sacrifice fly for three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger 7, Rolling Hills 3 -- After spotting Rolling Hills a 3-0 lead through 
two innings, the Olympians took advantage of Titan errors and timely hits to 
post a Bay League victory at Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger loaded the bases with two outs in the third with the help of two 
infield errors. That set the stage for Tyrone Scott, who cleared the bases on a 
triple to right-center, tying the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians benefited from an outfield error in the fourth inning when they 
took the lead for good, 5-3, on run-scoring singles by Armando Rodriguez and 
Earl Cole. Sophomore Marvin Johnson hit a solo homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger evened its league record at 2-2 and improved to 9-5-1 overall, while 
Rolling Hills fell to 3-1 and 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We got fatheaded," said Titan Coach Garry Poe, whose team finished with four 
errors and four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica 15, Palos Verdes 4 -- The Vikings scored 13 runs and sent 17 
batters to the plate in the sixth inning to break up a close game and send 
Palos Verdes to an embarrassing Bay League defeat at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 3-2, the Sea Kings self-destructed in the sixth as Santa Monica turned 
six hits, three errors, four walks and a hit batsman into its biggest inning of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne 8, Torrance 3 -- The Cougars jumped into a first-place tie with 
Rolling Hills in the Bay League with an easy win at Torrance Park. Hawthorne 
improved to 3-1 in league play and 7-5 overall, while the struggling Tartars 
dropped to 1-3 and 2-9.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark College kept three streaks alive with a 9-0 Western State Conference 
softball victory Thursday over Cuesta at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the Lady Raiders' 23rd conference victory in a row, their 38th 
consecutive conference home victory and kept them unscored upon in conference 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark has outscored seven WSC opponents, 51-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore De Dow improved her record to 17-6 by pitching a one-hitter. She 
struck out four and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Missy Cress paced Moorpark's 13-hit attack with a triple and double and two 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Singer hit her third home run of the season and Jamie McDaniel smacked 
her first. 
</P>
<P>
In another softball game: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 10-6, Redlands 2-3 -- Dana Sangster pitched a four-hitter to win 
the first game and Leslie Stevens pitched a three-hitter to win the second game 
for Cal Lutheran in a nonconference doubleheader at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Campos had a three-run triple in the fifth inning of the first game 
for Cal Lutheran (19-12). 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, DeAndra Pilkington was two for four and teammate Teri Rupe 
hit a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Pierce 7, Santa Monica 6 -- With Pierce trailing, 6-4, in the bottom of the 
ninth, pinch-hitter Bobby Weer tripled in Kevin Johnson and Billy Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Jordan then singled home Weer, giving Pierce (13-13, 6-5 in conference 
play) a WSC victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's Louis Birdt pitched eight innings, allowing 12 hits and six earned 
runs while striking out seven. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons 9, Santa Barbara 5 -- Randy Cooper hit a three-run homer 
in the second inning as Canyons (15-12, 8-3) pulled away early in a WSC game at 
Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons' Alan Sedacca (2-0) pitched eight innings, striking out six and 
allowing three earned runs on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' Scott Roth was two for three with an RBI and Gary Morgan was two 
for four as Canyons racked up 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 15, Cuesta 6 -- Moorpark scored four runs in the seventh and six in 
the eighth to snap a 4-4 tie in the WSC game at Cuesta. Craig Pearson was three 
for four for Moorpark (19-9, 8-3), raising his average to .531 (25 for 47) in 
conference play. Steve Sisco was three for five. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gerbovaz (4-2) struck out four and yielded two earned runs through 6 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 13, Valley 10 -- Steve Slattery was rocked for 11 runs in the first 
three innings and the Monarchs never recovered in a nonconference game at El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 13-4, after seven innings, Valley scored two runs in the eighth and 
four in the ninth to make it close. 
</P>
<P>
E. J. Pape had three hits, including his ninth home run of the season -- a 
two-run shot in the fourth -- and three RBIs for Valley (21-6-1) and teammate 
John Stephens added a three-run triple in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Mission 9, Compton 8 -- Albert Torres drove in the winning run in the ninth 
inning with a sacrifice fly to center field, giving Mission (7-16, 5-7) a 
Southern California Athletic Conference victory at home. Mission pitcher Jose 
Garcia (5-5) went the distance, scattering 10 hits and striking out 13. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Orozco was two for five with three RBIs and Robert Bradford, who singled 
to lead off the ninth before being pulled for pinch-runner, also had two hits.

IT TOOK A BROKEN ANKLE TO KEEP BRUIN GYMNAST SHAWN MCGINNIS OUT OF THE OLYMPICS 
-- BY ONLY .05 OF A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn McGinnis may not be the best gymnast on the UCLA women's team, but she is 
probably the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
The best Bruin is probably senior Tanya Service, the Pacific 10 Conference 
gymnast of the year in 1987 and 1989. And Service gets stiff competition from 
junior Kim Hamilton, two-time defending NCAA floor exercise champion, and 
junior Jill Andrews, last year's NCAA vault champion. 
</P>
<P>
But this season McGinnis has been pushing her three teammates. After a UCLA 
career that has been hampered by injuries, the 5-foot, 4-inch junior from 
Anaheim Hills has surpassed personal records in five of UCLA's nine dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Hamilton won the all-around competition and Service finished second 
as UCLA won the team competition at the West Regionals at Cal State Fullerton 
and earned the top seed at the NCAA championships. The nationals will be held 
April 14-15 at the University of Georgia in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's Joy Selig finished third among individuals at Fullerton, but 
close behind her in fourth place was McGinnis, who could be the mainstay of 
next year's team for Coach Jerry Tomlinson. 
</P>
<P>
She could be, that is, if her daring does not lead to more injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Break a leg" may be words of encouragement for actors, but that should never 
even be whispered around a gymnast, especially McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis would have liked to score a few points for the U.S. national team in 
last year's Olympics. But in trials a couple of years ago she missed making the 
team by finishing five-hundredths of a point (0.05) in her score behind the 
last gymnast to earn a spot. 
</P>
<P>
She might have made the team if she hadn't been trying out on a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know it was broken," she said. "I thought it was just sprained and 
sore. But even though it was swollen, I did not want to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
She was injured, she said, during a meet just before the national trials. On 
her first tumbling pass in floor exercise, "I landed really bad." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other unhappy landings for McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 she tore ligaments in a knee, again while tumbling in floor exercise. 
She had surgery to repair the injury and as a UCLA freshman in 1987 didn't see 
much action. 
</P>
<P>
Before her sophomore season, she came down with a kidney ailment that kept her 
out of action until mid-season. "It was a congenital problem," she said. "A 
kidney wasn't functioning and it almost burst." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-season of last year, however, she had recovered and came back to finish 
as one of UCLA's better all-around gymnasts. She also placed third on the bars 
at last year's Pac-10 championships and was named all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
Her strong performances this season might have been stronger were it not for 
painful shinsplints. 
</P>
<P>
She thought at first that the inflammations in her lower legs, brought on by 
the constant pounding from landings, might have been stress fractures. But she 
had a few weeks to recover after UCLA won its third consecutive Pac-10 
championship on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Service dislocated an elbow in the West Regionals and could not 
compete in the NCAA meet. Senior Gigi Zosa missed all of last year after knee 
surgery, and she is competing on a limited basis this year with a fractured 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA gymnastics press guide is a litany of painful injuries: a ruptured 
Achilles' tendon here, chronic elbow pain there, ankle and wrist ailments 
everywhere. All gymnasts are familiar with pain. 
</P>
<P>
But trying out for the U.S. team with a broken ankle, even if it was heavily 
taped? C'mon, McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tomlinson said that he could not personally testify about the broken 
ankle, but he added, "I wouldn't doubt that at all." 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis, he said, turned out for this season's first practice with no doubt 
that she would have a good year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the strongest year of her life," he said. "She came (to UCLA) 
"a very talented gymnast and was extremely strong all the time in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"She just really hadn't mastered the art of competing as well as she works out, 
which is common. And then she's had injuries almost every year of her career 
which have kept her from doing everything she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"But Shawn McGinnis walked into the gym last September a different Shawn. You 
could see it in her and feel it from her. She had an extremely confident and 
aggressive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell she had made a change over the summer. She had set goals and 
made a commitment that nothing was going to stand in her way." 
</P>
<P>
Not a painful kidney ailment, not torn knee ligaments, not shinsplints, not 
even a broken ankle could have stayed her from her determined rounds with the 
UCLA team this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said McGinnis was the first woman gymnast with the courage to do a 
trick in floor exercise called a full twisting doubleback. The stunt is two 
backward somersaults with a full twist on the first somersault. 
</P>
<P>
He said she has performed the twisting doubleback -- and done well -- five 
times in meets and that he thinks only one other college woman gymnast has 
tried the trick in a meet. His best gymnast, Service, has done it in practice, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis thinks her main asset as a gymnast is strength. "I've always been 
big-boned and strong, and that has always benefited me because strength is 
needed in gymnastics." 
</P>
<P>
And anyone who doubts that she was once strong enough to do tumbling, 
somersaults and jarring landings on a busted ankle had better be prepared to 
take more than a little guff from McGinnis. She is of Irish descent, you know. 
</P>
<P>
Still, didn't she ever consider quitting gymnastics after the sport had done 
such a good job of roughing her up? She replied with an emphatic no. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to give it up; I wanted to do it partly for the college and 
partly for me. I like it, or else I wouldn't still be doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the sport, and I guess the injuries made me want to do better," she 
said, adding that when she returned from an injury she always worked harder.

<P>
GRANADA HILLS WELL-STOCKED AT QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Jamerson lives across the street from Granada Hills High. Sometimes when 
Jamerson, an assistant football coach at Cleveland, looks out his apartment 
window, he can't help but feel a tad jealous. 
</P>
<P>
There, tossing the football around on the Highlander practice field, is 
sophomore Bryan Martin, a quarterback who earlier this year transferred to 
Granada Hills from Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
At Cleveland, where converted defensive back Lee Gatewood filled the position 
last year, Jamerson and Coach Steve Landress are again searching for a 
quarterback. Granada Hills, on the other hand, just keeps reeling them in. 
</P>
<P>
"He always looks pretty good out there to me," Jamerson said of Martin. "And it 
seems like he's out there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, in the first passing-league scrimmage of the spring, Jamerson 
and Landress got a closer look when Martin and junior quarterback Chris 
Gadomski split time against Cleveland in a non-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
"They kicked our butts," said Landress, who apparently did not need a 
scoreboard to tell him which team dominated play. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills Coach Darryl Stroh said that he thinks Martin could challenge 
Gadomski next season. Gadomski, a junior, passed for 1,158 yards and four 
touchdowns last fall but threw 11 interceptions and completed 48.6% of his 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they both looked pretty good," Stroh said. "I think it should create 
a healthy competition for the two of them." 
</P>
<P>
Landress said that the performances of Gadomski and Martin evoked memories of 
Granada Hills' most famous football alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"Gadomski and the new kid definitely looked sharp," Landress said. "But the way 
we played defense, we would have made Pee-wee Herman look like John Elway." 
</P>
<P>
Split personality: How can one team be so successful on the mound while 
slumping so badly at the plate? 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Saugus Centurions, who have pitched their way to a 10-2-2 record and a 
share of first place (4-0) atop the Golden League standings despite a team 
batting average of just .269. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to pitchers, the Centurions have more good arms than you can 
shake a Louisville Slugger at. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus' team earned-run average is 2.78, but it drops to 1.42 for starters 
Roger Salkeld and Scott Warr and reliever Glenn Terry, who have worked 78 2/3 
of the team's 94 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, a senior right-hander and the No. 3 high school prospect nationwide, 
according to Baseball America, is 4-0 with 75 strikeouts, 13 walks and an 0.52 
ERA in 40 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Warr, a senior left-hander, is 2-0 with a 2.13 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 19 1/3 
innings. Terry, a senior right-hander, is 3-1 with a 3.75 ERA and 21 strikeouts 
in 18 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions, however, have had trouble swinging the Louisville Slugger. 
Coach Doug Worley's team is just beginning to hit after its average hovered 
around the .230 mark most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus, which hit a school-record 20 home runs last year, has hit just three 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Only two starters -- Matt Tull (.429) and J. B. Johnson (.353) -- are hitting 
better than .300. But Tom Burges (.258), Salkeld (.268), George Lopata (.282) 
and Trevor Rice (.185) continue to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Gives them the shakes: At Kennedy, what once seemed a shaky proposition now 
appears to be a much tastier offer. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Manny Alvarado told the team before the season that any player 
reaching base after getting hit by a pitch would receive a malt. Eleven games 
into the season, Kennedy batters have been plunked 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
The leader? It isn't even close. Senior outfielder Bruce Carreau had been hit 
nine times before he was sidelined after he sprained an ankle playing 
basketball last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought we'd have this many," said Alvarado, who questions the sanity 
of any player who would be similarly assaulted for a mere malt. "All I know is 
I wouldn't take that trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
Out of their league: Chaminade and St. Genevieve, San Fernando Valley League 
rivals, were scheduled to meet in the consolation bracket of the St. Paul 
tournament last week but mutually agreed to cancel the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chaminade Coach Steve Costley, "We open league play against each other 
next week so I didn't see the point in playing each other in a consolation game 
of a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Win a few, lose a few: Cleveland, which has bolstered its basketball roster 
through the years by attracting top-quality players from throughout Southern 
California, lost one of its brightest young players last month when Randy 
Coleman moved to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a 6-foot-5, 190-pound forward, made the varsity this season as a 
15-year-old freshman and was viewed as a potential starter next season. 
</P>
<P>
Hard times: When Van Nuys defeated Reseda, 83-44, in a Mid-Valley League track 
meet last Friday, it was the Regents' first dual-meet loss in the past three 
seasons, snapping a 20-meet victory string. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Steve Caminiti refused to make excuses for the loss, however, 
even though Reseda has lost several key athletes to transfers and academic 
ineligibility this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that you have to go to battle with the soldiers you have," 
Caminiti said. "And I'm not going to change that now. We may not be as strong 
as we hoped to be, but we're not going to roll over for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda (4-1), the two-time defending West Valley League champion, has lost 
Aaron Whitehurst, William Childs and Keith Canty this season. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehurst, the City Section champion in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles 
(personal best of 40.34 seconds) as a junior, transferred to Dorsey because of 
disciplinary reasons two weeks ago, and Childs, a City semifinalist in the 
varsity 110-meter high hurdles (15.34) last season, was ruled academically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Canty, who clocked 2 minutes, 0.9 seconds in the 800 meters, moved out of 
Reseda's district recently.

DIGEST: HART'S SMYTH AGREES TO PLAY AT UC DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cameron Smyth of Hart High, a second-team Times All-Valley wide receiver, has 
made an oral commitment to attend UC Davis in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth (6-foot-2, 180 pounds) had 46 catches last season to finish sixth among 
Valley receivers. Smyth scored six touchdowns and totaled 818 yards in 
receptions, despite being overshadowed by teammate Brian Allen, the leading 
receiver in the Valley with 62 catches. Allen has committed to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth also will play volleyball at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
When you're one of 902 participants in anything, it's easy to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're Tom Leonard. Or Gordon Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, of Glendale, and Davis, of Encino, figure to be the top Valley-area 
performers when the 55th Southern California Sectional Championships -- the 
largest senior tennis event in the country -- begins today at the Racquet 
Centre in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who has played on the Grand Prix tour, is considered the man to beat 
in the division for men aged 35 to 40. Davis, ranked No. 1 nationally by the 
United States Tennis Assn. among men 50-55, is the favorite in that division. 
</P>
<P>
Other top players include Shannon Gordon of Van Nuys (women's 30); Gabriel 
Harmat of Woodland Hills (men's 35); Rae Murbach of Glendale (women's 35); Art 
Santilli of Ventura (men's 40); Niesi Sie of Van Nuys, Allan Drazen of Woodland 
Hills and Ed Rosa of Calabasas (men's 45); Tom Springer of Canoga Park (men's 
55); Sam Plancia of Canoga Park (men's 65); and Eleanor Harbula of Sylmar 
(women's 65). 
</P>
<P>
Trophies will be awarded in 40 singles and doubles divisions by the 
competition's end April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team, ranked 14th in the NCAA Division II 
rankings, will begin a three-game California Collegiate Athletic Assn. series 
with eighth-ranked Cal Poly San Luis Obispo today at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (16-10-1, 6-6-1 in conference play) will try to rebound from 
nonconference losses to United States International University and the 
University of San Diego earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's 24-5 loss to USIU on Monday included a record-setting performance 
by Matador pitchers, who allowed 25 hits to eclipse the mark for most hits by 
an opponent, set by Arizona State in 1972. The team also tied the record for 
most runs allowed, set in 1984 against Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo (18-16, 8-5) is coming off two nonconference losses to Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge Invitational track and field meet, originally scheduled to start 
today with the decathlon and heptathlon, will not begin until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The change was made because of a lack of entrants in the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't receive enough entries to justify having a decathlon," Cal State 
Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. "So we decided to move the heptathlon back 
a day." 
</P>
<P>
All of the women's events -- except the second day of the heptathlon -- will be 
contested Saturday. The men's events and the second day of the heptathlon are 
scheduled for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meet starts with the heptathlon 100-meter hurdles at 10 a.m. The 
men's long jump kicks off proceedings Sunday at 11:30 a.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was just after dinner on a school night sandwiched between the first round 
and semifinals of the Southern California Regional Division II boys' basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Miller slid to the edge of the couch in her Del Mar condominium and 
enthusiastically opened a scrapbook filled with memories of son Courtie's 
basketball career at Torrey Pines High School. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie sat quietly in the easy chair, watching her show a visitor some clips 
and pictures she had collected. 
</P>
<P>
One night later, Courtie's game-high 31 points would not be enough to advance 
the Falcons to the Southern California Regional championship game. The Falcons 
were eliminated by Dominguez, a snappy, well-disciplined team from Compton. So 
ended a season and, temporarily, Karen's quest to get her hands on every 
newspaper in the county. She had been buying three daily papers each day and 
two local papers twice a week. She will add to her clips, which include two 
Times player of the year awards, after Courtie plays in the San Diego County 
2-A vs. 3-A All-Star Game Saturday night at Serra High School. 
</P>
<P>
The wall behind the television is covered with plaques, earned by Courtie for a 
variety of basketball achievements. Karen jumps up at one point and explains 
what each represents. Courtie watches. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, the newspaper clips and the pictures mean the world to Karen. Last 
Labor Day weekend, a fire started by a spark from a neighbor's barbecue 
destroyed Karen and Courtie's condominium in Solana Beach. Karen was home. 
Courtie wasn't. Karen grabbed the trophies and the baby pictures and took them 
outside. Then she ran back inside and upstairs for the scrapbook. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty stupid," she said. "I felt the wall, and it was warm, but it 
wasn't hot. (The scrapbook) really was irreplaceable. I got the stuff I really 
cared about. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so darned proud of this," she said, pointing to the wall. "This is what 
it's all about. Honest to God, it feels better than anything I've ever 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, the memorabilia means a lot more to Karen than it does to 
Courtie. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie just plays. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up has been enlightening for Courtie Miller, if not always simple. 
Karen and his father, William, were divorced when he was 5. William rarely kept 
in touch, Karen said, and Courtie hasn't seen or spoken to him in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Karen says it hurt Courtie but didn't scar him. Courtie brushes it aside, 
saying he isn't affected. He has had other father figures. Coaches. Family 
friends. And he insists he doesn't think about his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not bitter," Courtie says. "If he comes up to me, I'm not going to be 
rude. He is my father, after all. But if I never see him again, it wouldn't 
break my heart." 
</P>
<P>
When Courtie was midway through fourth grade, Karen made the decision to move 
from Pasadena in search of a change and a better environment for Courtie. The 
schools in the area had barbed wire on the fences. The Millers lived in a 
middle-class neighborhood, but drug dealing and crime weren't far around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, by comparison, was paradise, though Courtie says drugs never tempted 
him anyway. He has seen the effect they have on people he has grown up with. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie says he stays away from parties and doesn't drink beer because it's 
just not for him. He prefers to spend time with his girlfriend or stay home and 
watch basketball on television. But, he says, he doesn't judge people who do 
drink. It's a choice. Each person makes his own. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie took a drink once. He had a swallow of champagne, or at least that's 
what he thinks it was, at his grandmother's house when he was 13. That was 
plenty. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just awful," he says. "It did not go down well. Alcohol, to me, doesn't 
taste very good. If I'm going to drink something, I'll drink soda or juice." 
</P>
<P>
There's another reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to not have control of myself physically," he says. "I like to 
have my senses." 
</P>
<P>
And not just for athletics. Basketball might be important to Courtie, but it's 
not all-consuming. He likes to be aware of what's going on in the world. Dinner 
at the Millers' home is often eaten in front of the television, watching CNN 
newscasts. Karen and Courtie discuss the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Take Oliver North. At first, Karen says, Courtie supported North. Karen didn't. 
Courtie says it just took time for him to understand the issue. As he watched 
more newscasts, read newspapers and talked to people about it, he changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
He expresses it this way: "Anytime you circumvent the Constitution of the 
United States, there's definitely something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
How does this tie in to his basketball career? Easy. It's all relative. Making 
a jump shot, layup or free throw is cake and ice cream compared to what he sees 
people dealing with in the news each day. 
</P>
<P>
"For me," he says, "pressure is seeing kids on CNN in Afghanistan that don't 
have any food. People are starving. People are dying every day for drugs and 
money. Living in Del Mar is a blessing for me." 
</P>
<P>
So he doesn't put too much pressure on himself when playing. He doesn't worry 
if his car isn't the nicest in the Torrey Pines High School parking lot. An '82 
Citation is fine; it gets him where he wants to go. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids would kill to have a car," he says, then pauses. "And a lot of 
kids do kill to have a car." 
</P>
<P>
Perceptive? Yes. Maybe impatient at times. He finds himself wishing he didn't 
have to deal with the stereotype of the dumb athlete. Reporters, even teachers, 
sometimes slow their speech when talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the ones who don't know he spends hours in his room reading about the 
Vietnam War. Or who were never told that when he went to natural history 
museums as a kid, he would read every caption in the dinosaur section. Or who 
haven't heard him describe his basketball relationship with Torrey Pines center 
Kevin Flanagan as "symbiotic." 
</P>
<P>
Until they find out, conversations are slow. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wait for (reporters) to get going because I have to take a shower and 
get home," he says. "They start off at what seems to me to be a kindergarten 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are also those who assume Miller is cocky because of all the 
recognition he has received. Classmates sometimes come up to him and say 
something like, "Another award. You must think you're so cool." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you react?," Miller says. "There's not much you can say. It kind of 
gets to me." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's girlfriend, Ashli Carpi, a senior at Torrey Pines, has never 
understood why people think Miller is stuck on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they get that," she says. "He's real humble." 
</P>
<P>
The thing with basketball recruiting is it's a far bigger game than the one on 
the court. Miller found that out during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
He finally got to see the origin of all those letters he has been receiving on 
his recruiting trip to UCLA. It was on campus, in the middle of the tour, that 
he noticed the machine. There's one in the football office. One in the 
basketball office. And they turn out these beautiful letters with nice type 
resting under a letterhead. And they're all the same. The only difference is 
the kid's name at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure there must be 15,000 guys across the country with the same letter," 
Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the phone calls. Every night after dinner, Miller would talk to 
coaches. Some were fairly sincere, talked a little basketball, told a bit about 
their program and let it go at that. Others, essentially, didn't know when to 
quit. Or even where to start. 
</P>
<P>
Sample questions. What did you eat for dinner? How's your mom doing? How's your 
girlfriend? 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell schools like that are just trying to butter you up," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the school year, Miller was "99.9%" sure he would attend 
UCLA to play basketball. The winning tradition was attractive. But when Karen 
and Courtie visited UCLA, they both began to have second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie remembers standing in the UCLA trophy room, looking at all the 
reminders of past championships. Courtie recalled when UCLA Coach Jim Harrick 
came up to him, put his arm around him and said, "Courtie, you're a Bruin, 
aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Then came the pitch. Harrick, Courtie says, told him he could take him back to 
the office and sign him right away. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started to turn off to him," Karen said. "He was real pushy. It 
really was kind of car salesman rhetoric. I just get (acting like) mother bear 
real fast." 
</P>
<P>
That alone did not sway Courtie away from UCLA. Jim Brandenburg did. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Millers planned to have the SDSU coach over as a courtesy. But 
Brandenburg said the right things. He was sincere. Courtie was sold. Karen too. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no BS," Karen said. "He gave me goose bumps, and I'm a hard sell. I 
felt Coach Brandenburg was going to take care of Courtie." 
</P>
<P>
So Courtie signed to be an Aztec before the high school season even began. 
There was some speculation as to why he didn't take the other trips. Stanford 
wanted him. So did USC and California. But Courtie was certain. He still is. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive I made the best decision for myself." 
</P>
<P>
What's the big deal? Why was Courtie Miller chosen a preseason honorable 
mention All-American by Street and Smith? Why did college coaches from all over 
the country try to get him to attend their schools? Why was he selected to 
Cal-Hi Sports all-state high school basketball team? What will this slender, 
6-foot-8 forward have to offer the fans Saturday night in the all-star game? 
</P>
<P>
Take a look back. Early in grade school, a coach recognized Miller's potential. 
Renell Nailon, Miller's close friend to this day, taught him the fundamentals 
when Miller played at the Solana Beach Boys Club. Nailon, the club's athletic 
supervisor, saw something a little special. So he pushed Miller harder than 
anybody else. Sometimes too hard. Courtie would come home and tell Karen that 
Nailon hated him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely hard on Courtie," Nailon says, "because he needed to develop 
an inner toughness. He needed a strong male role model." 
</P>
<P>
And basketball? Well, Miller was taller than the other kids. He was quicker, 
smoother and had softer hands. The tools were there. The polish wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
When Miller first came to Torrey Pines, Coach John Farrell saw he had an oil 
field that, if drilled deep enough, would pay off richly. Before Miller's 
junior season, Farrell said Miller could be the best player in the county if he 
would just play up to his potential all the time. The year before, Miller had 
shown what he could do in sprinkles and splashes. But never consistently. 
</P>
<P>
Miller admits he was a little lazy. Not willing to assert himself the way he 
needed to to take charge and lead the team. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed last year. In one tournament game against highly regarded El 
Camino, Miller scored 34 points, many after he had dragged himself off the 
court for a few minutes in the third quarter with a turned ankle. He came back, 
took over the game and Torrey Pines won. He was the tournament's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he did what it took to win the San Diego Section Division II 
championship. A little bit of everything. There are still a few whispers from 
those who see he didn't finish in the top five in the county in scoring and say 
he's overrated. But the ones who count, such as Brandenburg, Farrell and 
Miller's teammates, like what they see. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg: "I think he has very good quickness and speed for a kid his age 
and size. He can accelerate and put it into gear in the open court. He's a very 
instinctive passer." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Kyle Armstrong: "The quality I like about Courtie's game is he sees 
the floor like a point guard. You don't usually see that in a guy his size." 
</P>
<P>
If Miller doesn't succeed in college basketball, so be it. He isn't counting on 
basketball exclusively. He has seen players at camps he has attended who could 
barely read or write. It makes him sad to think that basketball is their only 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, Farrell says, has many options. 
</P>
<P>
"Courtie's the kind of guy that comes around once in a lifetime," Farrell said. 
"Courtie Miller will be a success in life. I'm not worried about him. I think 
he knows what's really important."

PADRE NOTEBOOK / BILL PLASCHKE; 
</P>
<P>
HARRIS FEELS BETTER BUT WILL KNOW MORE AFTER TODAY

<P>
Greg Harris' left rib cage area was feeling better Thursday, but the big test 
will come today when the Padres' rookie reliever throws for the first time 
since walking off the mound with a sharp pain Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a torn cartilage or anything, because it feels pretty good, 
and I can move around pretty good," Harris said late Thursday. "I'll just have 
to wait and see what happens when I throw, but I think it won't be anything 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres hope not. Harris was removed from Wednesday's 4-3 victory over San 
Francisco in the eighth inning after striking out Tracy Jones with the bases 
loaded in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
He was on the verge of another strikeout in the eighth, with a one-and-two 
count on Kirt Manwaring, when his side "felt like a knife was sticking in it." 
</P>
<P>
Harris was replaced by reliever Mark Davis, who threw one pitch to Manwaring -- 
a strike -- and had his first strikeout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The rules state that when a pitcher leaves during the middle of the count, it 
becomes a no-lose situation for the man relieving him. The injured player gets 
burdened with the walk or hit if one is given up, while the reliever gets 
credited if the hitter makes an out, even if it is a one-strike strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' August move to accommodate the Chargers will actually work in the 
Padres' favor. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have agreed to switch their Aug. 13 home game with Atlanta to Aug. 
12, already an off day, so the Chargers can play the Cowboys on national 
television on the 13th. This will give the Padres consecutive off days Aug. 
13-14. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a good time for the players to relax. After the "vacation," they end 
the season with a 44-game stretch that will include six games with the New York 
Mets and six each with Cincinnati, San Francisco and the Dodgers, over a 48-day 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly half of those games -- 22 -- are at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.

FOR THE RECORD

A story in Friday's edition of The Times incorrectly stated the rules involving 
a relief pitcher coming into the game with a batter already in the midst of a 
count. When the count is in favor of the pitcher, such as one ball and two 
strikes, the relief pitcher is accountable for whatever happens to that batter.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MT. CARMEL'S LEE STILL HARASSING POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a day like Thursday with inland temperatures nearing or exceeding 100 
degrees, it seemed appropriate that the Sundevils of Mt. Carmel High School 
defeated Poway, 6-1, in a Palomar League baseball game at Poway. 
</P>
<P>
It was even more appropriate that Sundevil left fielder Marcus Lee delivered 
the big hit, a three-run homer in the fourth that broke open a 2-1 game. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lee hit two homers as Mt. Carmel defeated the Titans at Poway. One 
is still discussed; it easily cleared the 365-foot sign in right-center field, 
a grass area and embankment on the other side of the fence and finally landed 
on the far end of an adjacent parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's was in the same direction but with considerably less distance. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just a ho-hummer compared to (last year's)," said Rudy Casciato, 
Poway coach. "He always seems to hit one or two every time he plays here. Maybe 
he should transfer here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lee, a senior, of his fourth home run of the season, "I knew it was gone. 
It was a good feeling. There are some you aren't sure about. But I knew this 
one was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lee missed the first part of the season with a broken wrist but hit 
four home runs in 12 games. This season, he was hitting .360 before Thursday's 
game, in which he went two for four. Possibly his hardest hit ball was right at 
Poway first baseman Alon Banks, who turned the line drive into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
His home run would have been a grand slam, but one pitch earlier, Brad Scott 
was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
After Lee's homer, starter Doug Hill (5-0) had more than enough cushion. He 
allowed just four hits and was aided by three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
"He struggled early in the year," said Sam Blalock, Mt. Carmel coach. "But he's 
been very sharp his last three or four games." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel (13-2, 2-0 in league) have been sharp all season. "We're playing 
real steady," Blalock said. 
</P>
<P>
And that is bad news for the rest of the Palomar League. Mt. Carmel has won or 
shared eight league titles since 1979, including last year, when the Sundevils 
tied Poway at 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel played like a champion again Thursday with a run in the second, 
third and sixth innings to go with Lee's three-run homer in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Poway (7-6, 1-1) got only one run in the third on a triple by Chris McDermott 
(two for two) and a ground ball by Doug Schwenke. Hill, in control throughout, 
did not pitch to more than four batters in any inning and faced just two more 
than the maximum 21 batters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very mature group," Blalock said. "Our kids have played in a drizzle 
this year, in the cold, with a 50 mile-an-hour wind in our face and in the 
early morning after traveling." 
</P>
<P>
And in heat. JIM LINDGREN

UEBERROTH AND LORENZO AGREE ON EASTERN SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investment group headed by former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth 
said Thursday that it would buy strikebound and bankrupt Eastern Airlines in a 
deal valued at $463.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Ueberroth and Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern, was 
reached in a week of negotiations that almost collapsed several times. The deal 
was not concluded until 45 minutes before a hastily called press conference at 
which Ueberroth appeared with the embattled chairman of Texas Air, Frank 
Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth said the sale still faces two major hurdles: approval by Eastern's 
three labor unions and the approval of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern filed on March 9 for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code, just five days after its machinists went on strike. 
Virtually all of its pilots and flight attendants honored the picket lines, 
bringing the airline's operations to a near halt. 
</P>
<P>
"Under this agreement, Eastern can be back flying in very short order," Lorenzo 
said Thursday. The airline is prepared to fly a significant number of routes 
after agreement is reached with the unions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has No Specific Plan 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth said he does not have a specific plan to return Eastern, which has 
lost more than $500 million in the last two years, to profitability. "Together 
with the Eastern employees, we will come up with a plan to make ourselves 
competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement -- under which Ueberroth's investment group and the unions would 
each own 30% of Eastern -- reportedly hinges on the workers granting an annual 
$210 million in wage and work-rule concessions. A Ueberroth-controlled Eastern 
may also end up receiving $365 million from the sale of the airline's Northeast 
shuttle to real estate mogul Donald Trump, if that deal is completed as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was a lusty celebration by hundreds of Eastern's union members 
in Miami when they heard that Lorenzo would no longer be their boss, union 
leaders responded publicly with guarded optimism. The pilots, who have 
supported the Ueberroth bid, were the most enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with Peter Ueberroth and his team over the coming 
days to put together all the pieces necessary to get Eastern Airlines back into 
the air," said John Bavis, chairman of Eastern's 3,600-member pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have expressed the view that Eastern, standing alone, cannot 
survive in the rapaciously competitive airline industry. There is speculation 
that Ueberroth might eventually try to merge Eastern with another carrier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viability of Airline an Issue 
</P>
<P>
Farrell Kupersmith, a Miami-based financial adviser to the pilots' union, said 
the key issue for the unions in deciding whether to go along with the Ueberroth 
deal will be whether the newly configured Eastern will be a competitive 
carrier. "Firming up the employee groups' support for this transaction requires 
a positive determination of the viability of the proposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Peterpaul, vice president of the striking International Assn. of 
Machinists, was more reserved than the pilots' Bavis. He said he was "guardedly 
optimistic" but added that, until the union "has seen, studied and evaluated 
the impact of these proposals on the IAM work force, we cannot issue a 
statement as to our intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Two key union sources said the unions were concerned that the sale to Ueberroth 
might fall through after they had made concessions and returned to work, 
leaving them to work for Lorenzo under more adverse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Under its new ownership, Eastern would officially be called the Eastern 
Airlines Employees &amp; Service Corp. In addition to the 30% stake held by new 
management and 30% held by the employees, other investors would own 40% of 
Eastern. The workers' share is in exchange for wage and work rule concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The New York investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has told the 
Ueberroth group that it "will commit to provide $300 million of debt financing 
to complete the transaction," according to a statement released Thursday at the 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable source noted that the wording of the official statement about 
Drexel's participation was quite significant. "Drexel is committing itself as a 
bridge (to provide short-term financing) if it is unable" to quickly complete a 
sale of bonds, the source said. "It's like a bank commitment," the source 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Stock in the new company will be sold by Ardshiel Inc., a New York investment 
banking firm with long ties to Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new concept in aviation, in which over 60% of the company will be 
owned by people who work for this company," Ueberroth said. "We think that is 
what it needs to bring Eastern to where it was and to move forward. The very 
best service you can get is if someone (who works for a company) owns the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although he has no specific plan of operation so far, he intends 
to bring Eastern back to its pre-strike operations of more than 1,000 daily 
flights. Since March 4, the airline has been able to operate only about 100 
flights a day. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, who acknowledged that initial discussions had already been held with 
the unions, refused to say specifically what concessions would be sought from 
the labor groups. He said he and J. Thomas Talbot, the former head of Jet 
America and AirCal, who is his partner in the transaction, would begin 
immediate talks with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for an agreement with the unions by midnight next Tuesday -- a 
very short time for such a monumental decision by the labor groups. Sources 
said the unions will be asked to make the $210-million-a-year worth of wage and 
work rules concessions for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask them -- but not through you (the media)," Ueberroth said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledges to Pay Creditors 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said it is Texas Air's intention to file a reorganization plan with the 
bankruptcy court and that the airline's creditors will be paid "100 cents on 
the dollar." Lorenzo's Texas Air purchased Eastern in February, 1986, and he 
and the airline's unions have been antagonistic ever since then as he tried to 
cut costs at the money-losing carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a day of mixed feelings," he said when asked how he felt about selling 
Eastern. "Clearly, selling the company is not our preferred course," Lorenzo 
said. However, he looked considerably more relaxed Thursday than he did a month 
ago, when he took Eastern into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
He said that liquidating Eastern would have produced a greater return for Texas 
Air's shareholders but added that the sale and resumption of operations are 
consistent with the company's obligations to creditors and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the news conference, Lorenzo was asked if Texas Air had 
profited or lost from its three-year ownership of the Miami-based carrier. "We 
would have done better investing in government bonds," he asserted. "We barely 
made back our initial investment." Union sources scoffed when that statement 
was reported to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Self Scapegoat 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo contended that he had been unable to come to any terms with the unions 
because he had become a scapegoat for their troubles. "Labor has found a 
convenient person out of whom to make a symbol," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that the unions did not realize that the new owners will demand 
wage concessions as great or even greater than the $150 million a year that 
Eastern's management had sought in negotiations before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
But sources at all three unions have been saying for weeks that they understood 
fully that substantial concessions would have to be granted to a new owner. 
They have said for some time that there was no point to giving further 
concessions to Lorenzo because he wanted to run Eastern into the ground with 
the goal of helping non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth said he would put more than than $2 million of his own money into the 
purchase of Eastern, but he refused to say precisely how much. His group will 
provide $200 million in cash to Texas Air, according to the letter of intention 
to purchase that was signed Thursday. The letter was signed only after 
Ueberroth and Lorenzo met together for two hours at the Board Room, a private 
luncheon club on top of the Bankers Trust building on Park Avenue here. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Eastern's new owners will forgive debts of about $185 million owed 
to Eastern by its parent company, and Texas Air will receive about $79 million 
worth of the airline's assets. Those include Eastern's New York-to-Montreal 
route, one gate at New York's La Guardia Airport and eight landing slots there. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Eastern will regain the Miami-London route it surrendered to 
Continental after Texas Air purchased Eastern in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the deal, the Ueberroth group will get a 19.9% ownership of 
SystemOne, the Texas Air computer reservations system. It had been Eastern's 
reservations system and was purchased by Texas Air for $100 million, 
considerably less than it was worth, according to independent analysts. The 
unions cited that transaction as a prime example of their charge that Lorenzo 
was stripping Eastern of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the news conference, Talbot, who lives in Newport Beach, 
Calif., said that, after purchasing the system for $100 million, Texas Air had 
made $140-million worth of improvements. Thus, he said, the replacement value 
of SystemOne would be $250 million. "You could arguably say that our portion 
would be worth $50 million." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's new owners will pay a monthly service fee to Texas Air to use the 
reservations system, according to a knowledgeable source. Talbot said the new 
investment group would also attempt to retain other relationships with Texas 
Air, including some kitchens, ticket counters, gates and other joint space. 
</P>
<P>
He said Continental and Eastern will continue to jointly operate OnePass, their 
frequent flyer program. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group will receive the proceeds of a sale of Eastern's Northeast 
shuttle to Donald Trump for $365 million if that deal is consummated, or it 
will obtain ownership of the shuttle, according to a source close to Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
Some financial analysts praised the sale. "It is a very good deal for everybody 
concerned," said Julius Maldutis, airline analyst for Salomon Bros., a New York 
investment firm. "It is good for the employees, the majority of whom will have 
their jobs back, and it is good for the traveling public . . . . And the 
stockholders of Texas Air will benefit, also." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with the financial firm 
of Janney, Montgomery, Scott in Philadelphia, said Ueberroth faces a 
considerable challenge in trying to cure Eastern, which he called "a sick cow." 
</P>
<P>
But Amy Quinn, who worked with Ueberroth when he ran the 1984 Olympic Games in 
Los Angeles, said that is just the kind of challenge her former boss relishes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you tell Peter Ueberroth something can't be done, that's when you really 
get his interest," she said. "He's always wanted to run an airline." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Weinstein reported from Los Angeles and Robert E. Dallos from New York.

106! IT'S THE HOTTEST APRIL DAY EVER RECORDED IN L.A. 
</P>

Sweltering residents coped as best they could Thursday -- heading for the 
beach, escaping to air conditioning, seeking out shade and squirting each other 
with hoses -- as Southern California wilted under the third day of a 
persistent, record-shattering heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
It was 106 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday, the hottest day 
so far this year and the hottest April day on record. That toppled the old 
record for the date, set in 1962, by 15 degrees. It was the third day in a row 
that downtown readings topped the 100-degree mark. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro in Orange County, where the mercury climbed to 112, was the hottest 
spot in the country. Other Southland area readings included 110 in Ontario, 107 
in Monrovia and Palm Springs, and 105 in Long Beach, Westwood, Pasadena and 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime temperatures remained at record high levels too. Thursday's minimum 
reading at the Civic Center, recorded shortly before dawn, was 73 degrees, 11 
degrees above the 59-year-old record for the date. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was as dry as it was hot, with relative humidity ranging from a 
barely discernible 8% to a merely arid 34%. 
</P>
<P>
"And there really won't be any relief until next week," said Pat Cooper, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more heat Friday, in the low 100s from downtown, out through the 
valleys and into the deserts," she said. "Saturday will still be very warm, 
with more 100s downtown and in the valleys. Sunday will be just a little bit 
cooler, near 100. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't really begin abating until about Monday or Tuesday, when the 
highs will begin easing off into the 90s. And there's no sign of rain at all." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the oppressive heat, hospitals reported no noticeable surge in 
heat-related illnesses. But there were other problems -- stalled cars, closed 
schools, seared gardens, record power use and heat-related blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
And medical experts warned of potentially serious consequences for those who 
must go out in the heat and the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Play it cool," advised Dr. Edwin Newtown, a physician on duty in the emergency 
ward at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine if you went to the beach, where lifeguards said more than 200,000 
flocked to the sand and some of the more courageous tried a swim in the 
61-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
But if you wanted to take a dip in one of Los Angeles County's 38 public pools, 
you were pretty much out of luck. All but one were closed Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not open right now, because they're not year-around pools," explained 
Frank Tamayo, a pool supervisor for the county. Most of the county-run pools 
will open only after the school year ends in June, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, a long line of people, mostly young children, formed at the 
only county-run pool open to the public, the Roosevelt Park Pool in Florence, 
near Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Ray Sandoval, 20, said it was so crowded in the early afternoon that 
he had to empty the pool of swimmers at 2:30 p.m. so he could give the people 
waiting outside a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait to get out of school," said a relieved Jaime Perez, 11, after 
he jumped into the water at 3 p.m. "The air conditioner didn't work and the fan 
wouldn't work either." 
</P>
<P>
Three concrete-truck drivers at the downtown construction site of the new State 
Building sprinkled each other with water from the trucks' 100-gallon water 
tanks while waiting in the sun to unload. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting here an hour," said 37-year-old Dale Johnson as he stood 
beside his truck at 3rd and Main streets, squinting into the glaring sun. 
"You've got to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Half a block down Main Street, Elton Thomas, 56, took what refuge he could 
under the narrow awning of his shoeshine stand as he continued to buff a 
customer's boots. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it sure is hot," Thomas said, mopping his brow. "But you've got to keep 
working, no matter what happens. You can't let the weather keep you from 
eating." 
</P>
<P>
Cars overheated and fizzled out on Los Angeles freeways Thursday in what Sgt. 
Mike Brey of the California Highway Patrol described as a "vicious circle." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when they overheat, they're stuck in the fast lane," he said. "That 
slows traffic and that makes even more people heat up." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was especially acute Thursday in the downtown area, where 
converging freeways were sporadically jammed with stranded, sweating motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Brey offered one piece of advice that might not be popular, but it can keep 
your car from overheating: When stalled in traffic, turn off your air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
People turning up air conditioners in homes, businesses and public buildings 
pushed electrical consumption to near record levels for the third straight day. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said a peak of 15,101 megawatts was 
being used by 4 p.m., eclipsing the previous high set the day before of 14,282. 
Edison's all-time high is 15,987 megawatts, set Sept. 6 when the temperature 
reached 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also reported a new high for 
April of 4,785 megawatts, beating the mark set Wednesday of 4,541. DWP's 
all-time high of electricity use -- 4,991 -- was also set Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As the temperatures soared, DWP officials asked customers to delay the use of 
heat-producing appliances, such as stoves and dryers, until the evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Their use reduces the ability of air conditioning to cool a house during the 
day," DWP spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered power outages were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's Ed Freudenberg said circuits overloaded by air conditioning caused a 
power loss to about 1,000 customers in the Westwood area Wednesday night. The 
power was restored before dawn, but at 9:20 a.m. Thursday about 800 of the same 
customers lost power again. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said none of the other outages were immediately linked to the record 
demands for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The heat hampered city firefighters battling two small brush fires of unknown 
origin near the interchange of the San Bernardino and Golden State freeways in 
Boyle Heights. Several freeway transition roads were closed for about an hour 
while firefighters extinguished the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District let students out of 
classes early Thursday because of the heat, and others said they planned 
shortened schedules for today. 
</P>
<P>
"The rooms are boiling, they're cooking," said third-grade teacher Fay 
Rosenthal, whose classroom at the San Jose Street Elementary School in Woodland 
Hills reached 99 degrees Thursday. Like most campuses in the district, the 
school is not air-conditioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent home three children with stomach aches, which I presume comes from 
(drinking too much) water," Rosenthal said. "All the teachers have that 
problem. They're sending children home because they can't cope." 
</P>
<P>
An official at the San Jose Street school said students would be taking notes 
home notifying parents that class will be dismissed today at 1:55 p.m. instead 
of the usual 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Newton advised those who have to go out in the sun simply to "use common 
sense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Limit your exposure to the sun," he said. "Don't fall asleep out there, or you 
can get into a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Drink lots of cool liquids. Use plenty of sun-block tanning lotion. If you 
feel headache or nausea, get into the shade and cool down." 
</P>
<P>
Newton said that in addition to sunburn, which can be serious enough to require 
hospitalization, there are three types of problems that can result from the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
The first, he said, involves heat cramps, which can usually be remedied by 
drinking water or an electrolyte, like Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
"More serious," he said, "is heat exhaustion, where the body is significantly 
dehydrated. You feel exhausted. If that happens, start drinking water, get out 
of the sun and wet yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The most serious, he said, is a heat stroke, which can cause the victim to 
collapse and often results in permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, call 911," he said. "You need help right away." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners throughout the basin fretted over their sun-parched gardens 
Thursday. Cliff Comstock, an executive at the huge Monrovia Nursery in Azusa, 
advised frequent, rather than heavy, watering, preferably done in the evening 
or early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"If you water in the middle of the day, you can scorch the foliage," he said.

TAX BOARD SAYS NO TO AGNEW'S BID FOR REFUND

<P>
Former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew is not entitled to California income tax 
deductions for the $142,500 he paid the state of Maryland as restitution for 
bribes he collected while in public office, a tax appeals board ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The California Board of Equalization voted unanimously to deny the former vice 
president's request for a $24,197 tax refund after one member asserted that it 
would be ridiculous to construe the repayment of bribes to be deductible 
business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very hard to be sympathetic," said board member Conway Collis, "to 
someone who had to pay over $140,000 back to the state of Maryland as part of 
restitution for bribes taken, but now wants California to allow him a deduction 
for that payback just because he is now a California resident." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Agnew, who lives in Rancho Mirage, nor his attorney attended the brief 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew had paid the tax under protest after the Franchise Tax Board disallowed 
the deduction in a 1986 audit of his 1982 state income tax return. He appealed 
the decision to the five-member Board of Equalization, where it automatically 
became a public matter. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew was accused by federal prosecutors in 1973 of collecting illegal cash 
kickbacks on highway contracts beginning in the early 1960s when he was 
Baltimore County executive and continuing while he was governor and vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew resigned as vice president on Oct. 10, 1973, and pleaded no contest to a 
single charge that he had evaded federal income taxes on the bribes. He was 
ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and handed a three-year suspended prison term. 
</P>
<P>
He was subsequently directed to pay back taxes on the kickbacks, along with 
interest and penalties amounting to $148,000 to the federal government and 
$14,105 to the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved to California 
</P>
<P>
Later, as a result of a civil lawsuit, he was ordered to make restitution 
payments totaling $268,482 to the state of Maryland to cover the amount of the 
bribes plus interest. By the time the court issued its order, Agnew had become 
a California resident. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew could have filed for a refund on his Maryland taxes but his attorney 
maintains that by that time the statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
In a short appeal, Agnew argued that he was entitled to deduct the restitution 
payments from his state income tax because he made them to satisfy a court 
order. He also contended that, since he had already been taxed on the bribes by 
the state of Maryland, it would be unfair for California to prevent him from 
deducting the restitution payment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Board of Equalization recommended that his request for a 
refund be denied, arguing that the question of double taxation was something 
Agnew needed to resolve with the state of Maryland and not the state of 
California. Under California law, they said, payment of the court judgment is 
not a deductible expense. 
</P>
<P>
"It would hardly be equitable for the taxpayers of California essentially to 
foot the bill for part of (Agnew's) liability to the taxpayers of Maryland for 
bribes received while he was a resident and elected official of that state," 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their unanimity on the issue, the Agnew case illustrated anew the 
animosity that exists among the five Board of Equalization members, who 
regularly accuse each other of grandstanding for the press. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank Mr. Agnew for bringing this to our attention because . . . we 
all have political ambitions and there's nothing more delightful than this 
publicity feast upon which we can all indulge," said board member William 
Bennett with tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Retorted Chairman Paul Carpenter: "I think I've heard the pot calling the 
kettle black." 
</P>
<P>
Although he voted to deny the refund, Bennett wondered afterward whether cases 
such as Agnew's, which generate tremendous publicity, ever get a fair hearing 
from elected public officials. 
</P>
<P>
"People such as Agnew and others are in a very difficult position when it comes 
to getting a fair and objective hearing, and that's wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in Maryland, former lawyers and prosecutors involved in his court cases 
told the Associated Press they could not sympathize with Agnew for his tax 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that Mr. Agnew will try to do surprises me," said John F. Banzhaf III, 
a law professor who helped develop the civil case against the former vice 
president. "It takes a tremendous amount of chutzpah to try to take a tax 
deduction for bribe money." 
</P>
<P>
"Do I feel sorry for Agnew? Absolutely not. He is one of the luckiest men of 
his generation," said Stephen H. Sachs, who was Maryland's attorney general 
when Agnew made the restitution payment. "Agnew's plea bargain was the greatest 
deal since the Lord spared Isaac on the mountaintop." 
</P>
<P>
Agnew can now either ask the board for another hearing or appeal its ruling to 
the courts.

ALEUT HUNTING GROUNDS FOULED; 
</P>
<P>
CENTURIES-OLD WAY OF LIFE MAY DROWN IN BLACK TIDE

EVANS ISLAND, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many of the Aleut villagers on this isolated island, fate has been cruelly 
instructive. On a March Good Friday 25 years ago their village on nearby 
Chenega Island was wiped off the map by a massive tidal wave. On Good Friday of 
this year, the Exxon Valdez ran aground 85 miles northeast of here and began 
bleeding millions of gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those villagers, relocated to this island, wait again for the worst that 
lies just offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the salmon hatchery two miles away threatened by the oil spill, but 
so is virtually everything the villagers eat. They depend on fishing and 
hunting for up to 80% of their food, resources that are being fouled by 
America's biggest oil disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the deer are eating the kelp. The otters are dying. We've already 
stopped getting seals and sea lions . . . how many years down the line do we 
have to wait before our subsistence comes back?" demanded Chenega Bay village 
President John Totemoff on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 residents are working frantically with local officials and fishermen to 
fend off the slick, which flows steadily toward the island as it moves to the 
open sea. But their battle is a lonely one. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon dispatched a tank barge to the scene, but it lies in the bay out of 
commission. Its pumps can't remove the heavy crude that has polluted Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the incident is a metaphor for the response of the oil industry in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a matter of economics. It's our culture," said John 
Christensen, a member of the village council. 
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years the Chenega villagers and their predecessors killed and 
ate seal, sea lion, bear and black-tail deer. 
</P>
<P>
While subsistence living is declining, as recently as 1986 the average village 
household harvested 1,286 pounds of so-called wild resources and used 866 
pounds. Some families meet upwards of 80% of their annual food requirements 
from sea mammals, deer, salmon and halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Marine mammals constituted 39% of the harvest, salmon another 21% and game 20%, 
according to a report prepared by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The average Chenega household annually consumes 91 pounds of seal, 75 pounds of 
sea lion, 330 pounds of salmon, 80 pounds of halibut, 165 pounds of deer and 11 
pounds of shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many of those resources are either dying or contaminated. The oil is 
killing fish and birds, and fouling the low-tide kelp beds on which deer feed. 
Several deer have been found dead. 
</P>
<P>
Many more sea otters have been killed. They died of hypothermia because their 
oil-encrusted coats could no longer protect them from frigid arctic water 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lean Season 
</P>
<P>
The spill comes at a particularly bad time for the Aleuts here. Spring is a 
lean season in the village. It is just before the commercial fishing season 
begins and family budgets are low. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, families borrow from canneries against future catches to buy 
equipment and meet other needs. But now the fishing catch is in serious 
jeopardy because of the oil spill. The herring season, which brings in $12 
million around the sound for its caviar alone (known as sac roe), has been 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The distress is not lost on Alaska officials. Alaska Environmental and 
Conservation Commissioner Dennis D. Kelso urged villagers not "to let the food 
situation go too far," meaning that food supplies on the island should be 
monitored carefully. He urged them to keep the state informed. 
</P>
<P>
The villagers met Wednesday with California Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), 
chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the House Interior Committee, 
who stopped on the island as he toured the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
They asked for help fighting the spill. A mother held a young child in her lap 
and watched Miller and Alaska state officials intently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar's Worth 
</P>
<P>
"How many groceries can we get for a dollar? What kind of food can we get?" one 
villager asked. 
</P>
<P>
"They've absolutely stopped getting seals and sea lions," Totemoff said. "We're 
just using canned stuff right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather eat subsistence than beef and pork. That's been our life style," he 
said 
</P>
<P>
Subsistence living is as much a practical necessity as a cultural imperative. 
"It is essential to being here. This is rural Alaska and a lot different from 
the Lower 48 states," Christensen said. There are no corner supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to starve to death, but it's a way of life for them. They 
depend on subsistence living. It's like saying to ranchers you can't eat cattle 
but you can have fish. It's going to hit them bad," Totemoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood here is apprehensive. There is anxiety about everything being 
unknown. This is not the quiet, nice, relaxed Alaskan native village it usually 
is," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BATTLE FOR PORT SAN JUAN 
</P>
<P>
Evans Island -- Fishemen and state officials have struggled for a week to 
protect the Port San Juan salmon hatchery at Sawmill Bay on Evans Island from 
the massive Alaskan oil spill. Meanwhile, a small Aleut village on the same 
island faces calamity as the oil ruins fishing and hunting, which provides the 
village much of its food.

CRITICS SEE VOTER REVOLT GROUP GOING 'POLITICAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who knows, maybe it's a hard habit to break. But after withstanding the brute 
force of the insurance titans, after outmaneuvering California's savvy trial 
lawyers, after winning the $100-million insurance initiative war with their 
upstart Proposition 103 -- after all that, leaders of Voter Revolt are still 
ruffling fur and making enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Now the charge is that the consumer populists behind Voter Revolt are becoming 
what they used to denounce, they are becoming "political." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the worst thing you can call me, being political," moaned Harvey 
Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt and spark plug of the landmark Proposition 
103 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Despite success in the November election, Voter Revolt is in debt, in court, in 
need of friends and in the fight of its life these days to save Proposition 
103's insurance rate rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is also trying to prevent its reputation from being smudged by a small but 
persistent band of behind-the-scenes critics, including politicians and fellow 
consumer-interest activists, who say Voter Revolt has stooped to old-fashioned, 
cash-register politics. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, critics say Voter Revolt has dangled the promise of a political 
endorsement in front of politicians at the same time it is pressuring them for 
financial and political help -- the kind of deal-making that purists are 
presumed to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have a so-called citizens group, and already they are out selling 
their masthead, their banner," said one disenchanted Democratic political 
consultant who is close to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, objects Voter Revolt. 
</P>
<P>
"After 2 1/2 years of proving ourselves, crawling and scraping for this cause 
without any help from special interests, we now have unnamed assailants 
striking at the heart of this organization's credibility. That's outrageous," 
Rosenfield said. "A consumer advocate has nothing but his reputation." 
</P>
<P>
The basics are these: 
</P>
<P>
* Voter Revolt is saddled with a $1-million-plus campaign debt and needs even 
more money and political backing to wage its legal and legislative struggle to 
save Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
* The group has appealed to political leaders for help, in particular, those 
eyeing the new elective office of state insurance commissioner created by 
Proposition 103. At the same time, the organization tantalizingly promises that 
its endorsement is up for grabs by the man or woman who does the most for the 
cause of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
* Voter Revolt has stood in the path of Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica), fearing that he could be a formidable candidate for insurance 
commissioner but persuaded that he was not a good friend to Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Among primary provisions, Proposition 103 calls for a 20% rollback in auto and 
other liability insurance rates and establishes the elective office of 
insurance commissioner to supervise government insurance regulation. The 
constitutionality of the proposition is being tested in the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
During the long campaign for insurance reform, Voter Revolt and its leaders 
survived relentless attacks by insurance companies and trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But this latest round of criticism is the first time since the election that 
Voter Revolt has come under sustained fire from those who normally side with 
pro-consumer activists. 
</P>
<P>
At least two Democrats who are considering running for insurance commissioner 
are privately sending word that they believe Voter Revolt has been too hasty 
and too overt in aligning itself with would-be insurance commissioner candidate 
and State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Skill 
</P>
<P>
Collis is a politician of growing skill, quick to hit any hole in the line of 
scrimmage. He is considered an accomplished fund-raiser and is implacably 
determined to separate himself from his fellow work-a-day officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in conjunction with Voter Revolt, Collis announced formation of his 
own unofficial committee to support and defend Proposition 103. This was widely 
reported as a move that gave Collis the inside track for Voter Revolt's 
endorsement in the likely event that he later announces his candidacy for 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"What we know is there is a group with a big debt, more than $1 million. Conway 
Collis is a known fund-raiser. . . . We have a group that needs money and a guy 
who can get it. I can't help but see the mutual self-interest," said one 
Democrat who is exploring whether to run for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat, like many of those interviewed, declined to be identified for 
fear of angering Voter Revolt officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They wrote this proposition, put it on the ballot and got it passed. Their 
endorsement is going to be very important," the Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
Another would-be candidate has found Voter Revolt officials have been blunt, to 
say the least, in seeking financial help from politicians, according to a close 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for funds to continue to operate. They want someone to help 
fund the operation of the 103 committee, with the obvious implication that you 
are much more likely to get their endorsement for insurance commissioner if you 
help," this source recounted. "We told them basically to jump off a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Voter Revolt's political director, Bill Zimmerman, a well-known 
Santa Monica Democratic campaign consultant, acknowledge that their need for 
money and political support has played an important part in their relationship 
with elected officials, including the angry dispute with Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
But this is far short of putting the good name of Voter Revolt up for sale, 
they insist. 
</P>
<P>
"Insulting," Collis snapped. "That's insulting to me; that's insulting to them. 
I'm sure if they wanted to sell out, State Farm would have bought them Hawaii. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that really moves people, and I want to help bring about 
long-term reform." 
</P>
<P>
Said Zimmerman: "It's not our style to extort money from people in exchange for 
political support. And to those who would make the charge, I suggest to them 
they should get involved, help defend 103 in the courts and Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We need support, not just financially, but politically," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said that more than any other would-be candidate, Collis "has taken 
positive steps to help. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"One thing he has done is open some doors for us in the business community. If 
others had taken positive steps, they wouldn't be complaining," Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Is Voter Revolt being held by its critics to unusually high standards? 
</P>
<P>
"The average person may think, politics, so what else is new?" said one 
consumer-interest activist. "But if you have a political organization that says 
it represents the people, a consumer's advocacy group, they should be beyond 
reproach with money and endorsements." 
</P>
<P>
At least two other Democrats mentioned as possible contenders have pitched in 
to support the cause of Voter Revolt. 
</P>
<P>
KABC news commentator Bill Press said he "did the best I could do for 103 -- I 
endorsed it on television and radio and urged people to vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
"I did several commentaries that the insurance companies were trying to buy 
this election," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) has given the group $25,000 in recent 
weeks, even though Voter Revolt has attacked his record as chairman of the 
Senate Insurance Committee as anti-consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"My donations were to help keep 103 alive, to help keep reform alive, not 
conditioned that they say nice things about me," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Still another potential contender, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, was 
one of just a very few politicians active on behalf of Proposition 103 before 
it passed and became a celebrated cause. 
</P>
<P>
Voter Revolt says its endorsement is still by no means decided and will not 
even be considered until after court tests of the initiative are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who supports 103 is a friend of ours," Rosenfield said. "We want more 
people clamoring to be part of this fight." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone can be a friend, that is, except Hayden. So far, the only nonpartisan 
public opinion poll on the race put Hayden ahead of all Democratic candidates 
as of February. Hayden has said only that he is considering the race. 
</P>
<P>
Once friends and business associates, Zimmerman and Hayden have drifted apart 
-- far apart by most accounts. But the relationship became truly unpleasant 
when the wealthy and influential assemblyman gave only $1,000 to the campaign 
for 103 and offered nothing since to help with the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody should have been there, it should have been Tom. It was 
disgusting," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden says he was preoccupied with helping the presidential campaign of Gov. 
Michael S. Dukakis and yet another state ballot initiative -- Proposition 99, 
the cigarette tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all self-serving nonsense," Hayden said. "I gave money to 103. 
Zimmerman seemed upset that I gave it at the end (of the campaign). But he 
didn't send it back. I assume he used it to help get the measure passed." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's backers argue that officials of Voter Revolt "are merely the 
technicians" behind Proposition 103. The most important political endorsement 
for any would-be insurance commissioner, they say, is that of consumer leader 
Ralph Nader, who assisted with the ballot proposition campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nader says his actions will be independent from Voter Revolt's. 
</P>
<P>
"I may support their choice, I may not," he said. "I may speak out, I don't 
know, but only as an individual."

THE FORECASTERS SHRUG, SWEAT IT OUT TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN and BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writers

<TEXT>
<P>
The first hint that Southern California was in for a week of hot weather came 
last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
High over the rocky plateau of the Great Basin region of the western United 
States, the sky was clearing, a vast expanse of blue marred only by faint wisps 
of cirrus clouds. On the ground in Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon, National 
Weather Service barometers began registering a buildup of high pressure. 
</P>
<P>
It was the start of a familiar pattern that ends with hot, dry Santa Ana winds 
blowing through Southern California and temperatures popping up past the 
100-degree mark. 
</P>
<P>
But what has made the ongoing heat wave even more unbearable is a stubborn 
high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere; it has clamped like a glass dome 
over the Los Angeles region, dispersing clouds and smog and magnifying the 
effects of the sun's heat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite all the knowledge at the disposal of weather experts, they were 
able to predict the heat wave's coming only after the process that set it in 
motion had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start asking about an exact cause, there's not much we can give you," 
said Arthur Lessard, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service's 
Los Angeles office. "We still have a lot to learn about why weather systems 
work the way they do." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Namias, former head of the National Weather Service's climate analysis 
center -- and now a researcher at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla 
-- described the heat wave as nothing more than a statistical aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"True, this is a record-breaking heat in some places, but records are meant to 
be broken," Namias said. "That's the name of the game in meteorology. . . . The 
probability is that records will always be broken at some place at some time." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to offer causes for the heat wave, which Thursday produced a high of 106 
in downtown Los Angeles, meteorologists could only describe and trace the path 
that led to this week's weather, a stagnant spell that is not expected to budge 
until atmospheric changes in other parts of the world allow it to dissolve or 
move eastward. 
</P>
<P>
Weather Service meteorologists, stationed on the 11th floor of the Federal 
Building in Westwood, began receiving information last Sunday that tipped them 
to the coming misery. 
</P>
<P>
"We had readings from barometers in the Great Basin that showed increased 
pressure," Lessard said. "At the same time, we had relatively lower pressures 
down here." 
</P>
<P>
The Great Basin is a stretch of semi-desert terrain and sparsely populated 
scrubland 4,000 to 5,000 feet above sea level. It extends through Utah, most of 
Nevada and parts of Idaho, Arizona and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The growing strength of the high-pressure system over the Great Basin was part 
of a larger ridge of high pressure that had formed over the entire western 
United States, five to six miles up in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Major high-pressure systems like the one covering the Western Basin are shunted 
around by the jet stream, a vast river of air that moves at speeds up to 200 
m.p.h. miles above the Earth's surface. Last Sunday, weather experts said, the 
jet stream began curling around the ridge of high pressure over the western 
states, preventing it from moving. 
</P>
<P>
But at lower altitudes over the Great Basin area, the high-pressure system's 
warm air moved naturally toward a region where the atmospheric pressure was 
lower and the air was cooler. That region was the Pacific Ocean, off the coast 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"In a high-pressure system, the air sinks," said Mike Smith, a meteorologist 
and president of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
"When air sinks, it heats up at a rate of 5 1/2 degrees for every thousand feet 
it drops. It heats because it is compressing down into the lower atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Growing hotter as it sinks, the air from the Great Basin moves southwest toward 
cooler air, crossing into California and through the Panamint and Amargosa 
mountain ranges just east of Death Valley, then swooping down through the 
mountain passes. The winds were first dubbed "Santa Anas" by the early settlers 
of Orange County, who gave them the name because they came gusting down Santa 
Ana Canyon from the higher inland deserts. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Santa Anas have reached wind speeds of up to 70 and 80 m.p.h. 
Smith said that a few weeks ago "we had one night where the winds whipped in 
around Barstow and Edwards Air Force Base up around 70 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several days, though, the Santa Anas have been fairly mild, 
gusting only to 30 to 40 m.p.h. and staying mostly in the 15-to-20 m.p.h. 
range. 
</P>
<P>
The steady, hot breeze has been enough to blow the smog that normally hangs 
over Los Angeles and the inland region out toward the coast and into the 
Pacific. From their Westwood vantage point, Lessard said Thursday that the 
federal meteorologists could "see all that mustard-colored air rolling out over 
Catalina." 
</P>
<P>
Even without the Santa Anas, weather experts said that the Los Angeles region 
would still experience brutal temperatures this week. The reason, they said, is 
that the high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere over the western United 
States is now centered directly over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Acting like a glass dome, the high-pressure system warms up the air and 
prevents moisture from gathering, clearing the sky of clouds, WeatherData's 
Smith said. Without a cloud cover, he said, "more sunlight than usual reaches 
the ground and that heats things up even further -- even without the roaring 
winds." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discomfort caused by the 100-degree-plus temperatures, they do have 
at least one advantage, weather experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The heat disrupts the "inversion layer" that normally traps pollutants over the 
Los Angeles Basin. Normally, a layer of cold air sits atop the layer of warm 
air over the basin, preventing the warm air from escaping and acting like a lid 
that holds in pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the air has been so hot that it interfered with that process. As the 
superheated air rises, it pushes the inversion layer high enough so that 
smog-forming pollutants are able to escape -- a process similar to taking the 
lid off a pot. This, in combination with the Santa Anas, has served to keep the 
skies remarkably smog-free during the heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he does not foresee any changes in the high-pressure system stalled 
over Los Angeles until similar high-pressure systems over China, Korea and the 
eastern Soviet Union begin to show signs of movement. 
</P>
<P>
When they do, Smith said, the "weather pattern over the Pacific would become 
imbalanced and cause your high-pressure system to scoot to the west, toward 
Hawaii. But we don't see any large-scale movement like that until middle of 
next week." 
</P>
<P>
Times science writer Thomas H. Maugh II contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HEAT AND SMOG 
</P>
<P>
What has made the Los Angeles area so hot are unusually warm winds from a 
high-pressure area over Utah and Oregon. Normally, high temperatures bring 
increased smog, but the unusual atmospheric conditions have actually reduced 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Santa Ana winds blowing from inland high desert areas toward the coast are 
compressed, heated,and sped up as they make their way through mountain passes. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Winds blowing in from the ocean tend to trap the smog against the 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The winds have pushed most smog toward coastal areas, rather than inland, 
the normal pattern. The weather is thus smoggy at the beach and clear inland. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Furthermore, the high temperatures are disrupting the inversion layer that 
normally traps pollutants in the Los Angeles Basin. Normally, a layer of cold 
air sits on top of a layer of warm air over the basin, preventing the warm air 
from escaping and acting like a lid that holds pollutants in. This week, the 
air has been so hot that it has interfered with that process. As the super hot 
air rose, it pushed the inversion layer high enough that smog-forming 
pollutants can escape the basin -- like taking the lid off a pot.

STATE SUPREME COURT WIDENS DEFINITION OF LYING-IN-WAIT MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Widening the scope of capital punishment, the state Supreme Court ruled 
Thursday that the death penalty can be imposed for murder while "lying in 
wait," even if the killer does not physically conceal himself from his 
unknowing victim. 
</P>
<P>
The court, affirming by a 5-2 vote the death sentence of a Stockton man, gave 
prosecutors another victory by also limiting the ability of defendants to 
challenge county jury systems as discriminatory. The justices said minority 
under-representation in juror pools in itself does not constitute bias if 
selection procedures are racially neutral. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling on lying in wait allows broader application of the death penalty 
under a centuries-old legal doctrine that permits harsher punishment for crimes 
found to involve unusual cowardice or stealth. 
</P>
<P>
The court held that a death sentence was constitutionally permissible when the 
killer, although in open view, hides his intent from the victim, waits for an 
opportune moment and then makes a sudden attack. 
</P>
<P>
"If a period of watchful waiting is shown which immediately precedes the 
assault, a concealment of purpose, coupled with a surprise attack from a 
position of advantage, will satisfy the concealment element in lying-in-wait 
murder," Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk argued that it was impermissible to base 
capital charges solely on lying in wait and that the court's ruling was so 
broad it would open the way for such charges for "virtually all intentional 
killings." Almost always, he said, killers conceal their true purpose before 
attacking their victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No More Worthy' 
</P>
<P>
The law also fails to provide a "meaningful basis" for separating capital and 
non-capital murders, Mosk said. "To my mind, the killer who waits, watches and 
conceals is no more worthy of blame or sensitive to deterrence than the killer 
who attacks immediately and openly," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
John R. Duree Jr., a Sacramento attorney representing the defendant in the 
case, assailed the ruling, saying it was "virtually unlimited" in its potential 
application. 
</P>
<P>
"A person will be subject to the death penalty on the lying-in-wait theory 
anytime he fails to give advance notice of his intent to kill," Duree said. "In 
my view there is a substantial question of whether a criminal defendant will 
ever get a fair hearing in this court." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jennifer S. Cady welcomed the ruling, saying it 
resolved an important legal issue that has arisen in several pending cases. 
</P>
<P>
Cady noted, however, that lying in wait has not been charged often in the past 
and said it is doubtful that prosecutors will file "a mass" of such charges in 
wake of the ruling. "This will be carefully applied on a case-by-case basis," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The court has upheld 51 death sentences in the 73 capital cases decided since a 
new conservative majority emerged after the defeat of Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird and two other court members in the 1986 general election. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the justices affirmed the conviction and capital sentence 
of Michael Angelo Morales, 29, convicted in a 1981 knife-and-hammer torture 
murder of Terri Winchell, a young woman who he believed had an affair with the 
male lover of Morales' cousin, Ricky Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, Morales conspired with Ortega to lure Winchell 
into a car and drive to an isolated area. Morales, sitting in the back seat, 
suddenly attempted to strangle the woman with a belt until it broke and then 
beat her into unconsciousness with a hammer. Then, prosecutors said, Morales 
dragged the woman to a field, performed sexual intercourse and stabbed her four 
times in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was transferred from San Joaquin County to Ventura County to avoid 
prejudicial publicity. In 1983 Morales was found guilty and sentenced to death 
for murder while lying in wait and while inflicting torture, both of which 
constitute a "special circumstance" that permits capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ortega was tried separately, convicted of murder and sentenced to 
life in prison without parole, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the justices rejected a series of challenges by Morales to his 
conviction and sentence in an opinion by Lucas that was joined by Justices 
Edward A. Panelli, David N. Eagleson and Marcus M. Kaufman and retired Justice 
John A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the special circumstances charged were valid, the court said. The 
judges also ruled that Morales had not shown that he was entitled to a new 
trial on the ground that Latinos were under-represented in Ventura County jury 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, three of the 12 jurors in Morales' trial were Latinos, but he 
argued he still had been denied the right to a jury selected from a fair 
cross-section of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Two sample surveys conducted in a two-week period in 1983 showed that only 
about 10% of the people appearing for jury duty were Latino, while Latinos made 
up about 18% of the county population, he said. The county, Morales contended, 
was too lax in permitting prospective jurors to be excused from serving, 
resulting in a racial disparity in the juror pool. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court found that the statistical samples were too small in size 
and too brief in duration to show systematic exclusion by race. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard said he believed that Morales had made 
an adequate showing of bias in the Ventura County system and that he was 
entitled to a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Our nation's history is shadowed by too many examples of racially neutral 
rules which operated to exclude minority groups from their fundamental rights 
for us to be confident that a neutral law necessarily operates fairly," 
Broussard wrote.

ASSEMBLY REJECTS MOVE TO KEEP CAR INSURERS IN STATE

Legislative efforts to strengthen enforcement of the insurance initiative, 
Proposition 103, suffered a major setback Thursday as the Assembly rejected a 
bill aimed at preventing auto insurers from pulling out of the California 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would have severely penalized companies that arbitrarily cancel 
auto policies, fell seven votes short of the two-thirds needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat, on a vote of 47 to 23, came after the legislation had already 
passed the Senate. It was the only one of several strong enforcement measures 
introduced in the wake of the ballot measure's narrow approval that had been 
considered likely to reach the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort Sidetracked 
</P>
<P>
Like those earlier efforts, this one was sidetracked by a nearly solid bloc of 
Republicans amid intense lobbying by the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, the bill's author, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), and other 
supporters vowed to have the measure reconsidered. But they conceded that it 
would take a massive lobbying effort by voters and business groups to gather 
the additional votes needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to wave the white flag today," said Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, who 
carried the bill on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the legislation is backed by local chambers of commerce, retailers 
and independent insurance agents, Robbins added: "We will rally our support. . 
. . We will go to those business constituents and get them to lobby a few of 
the Republicans and ask them if they want to stand with the insurance companies 
or every other business in California." 
</P>
<P>
The Ralph Nader-backed initiative seeks to roll back insurance rates and impose 
stringent controls on future premium increases. As passed by the voters, it 
prohibits insurers from arbitrarily canceling policies or refusing to write new 
ones. But the proposition's $250,000 maximum penalty for "willful violations" 
has been criticized as far too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins bill, by contrast, would assess companies that violate the 
provision up to 50% of the premiums collected on all the affected policies. 
That could run into millions of dollars for the largest insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the measure was aimed at Travelers Insurance and several other firms 
that began canceling policies after the Nov. 8 election. But these firms 
relented under pressure from Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. Now, 
supporters say they are convinced that without the bill, insurers may attempt 
to leave California if the Supreme Court upholds substantial portions of the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties imposed under Proposition 103 amount to no more than "traffic 
tickets," said Johnston, who predicted that many insurers will simply "pay the 
fine and skip. . . . Our constituents will be left high and dry with the legal 
responsibility to purchase insurance and no ability to do so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Argument 
</P>
<P>
The bill's Republican opponents, however, argued that legislation cannot change 
the laws of economics and if there is no profit to be made under Proposition 
103, companies will simply go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"If we look at this bill alone we can come up with logical arguments to support 
it," said Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona), who argued that Robbins' bill 
would drive insurance companies out of business, leaving the state to fill the 
void with a government-run insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
Bader predicted that passage of the Robbins bill would result in a system like 
that in New Jersey, where premiums are among the highest in the nation and the 
state-run system faces huge deficits. 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins bill was one of several introduced with great fanfare shortly after 
the passage of Proposition 103 and amid predictions that even lawmakers who 
opposed the initiative would push for strong enforcement. Supporters likened 
the success of the insurance measure to the landmark Proposition 13 of 1978, 
which cut property taxes and spawned an anti-tax fervor within the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected or Moribund 
</P>
<P>
However, all of these bills have either been rejected or are considered 
moribund. Among them is a major bill by Johnston to freeze insurance premiums 
until the Supreme Court acts or the initiative's rate regulation provisions 
take effect in November. The Johnston bill was rejected on the Assembly floor 
last month, falling eight votes short of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who was among those who predicted early on that there would be strong 
support for these bills, conceded after Thursday's vote that the political 
dynamics of the Legislature have changed very little. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is that many members actively opposed Proposition 103 or didn't 
support it," Johnston said. "It sounds like their logic was that if 103 doesn't 
make sense, I don't want to do anything to enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins placed the blame for rejection of his bill and the others squarely 
on the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance companies are looking for legislative friends and have found on 
the floor of this house a group of legislators to defend them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Resurrect 
</P>
<P>
Although it may be difficult to resurrect his bill, Robbins has a track record 
of reviving measures once considered politically doomed. The same bill rejected 
by the Assembly on Thursday was once defeated in the Senate as well. But 
Robbins was able to bring sufficient pressure to reverse the votes of several 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins was supported Thursday by a solid majority of Democrats but received 
only two Republican votes. The two came from Curt Pringle, newly elected 
assemblyman from Garden Grove, and Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he called for the vote when it was clear that his bill lacked 
sufficient support, Robbins supplied a glimpse of his political strategy: 
"You've got to pin down the votes that you have by putting them on the record 
and pin down the (opposing) votes so you can go after them as well."

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday that he wants to visit Moscow to 
reassure the Soviet Union about historic reforms that reinstate his banned 
union and allow Poland's first free elections since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go there to agitate or irritate but to seek understanding for 
the Polish reforms . . . in a way that will not be suggestive or stir things 
up," Walesa told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The reform package signed Wednesday by Walesa and Minister of Internal Affairs 
Czeslaw Kiszczak will make Solidarity legal again, permit independent political 
clubs and bring the opposition into Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It will also create a democratically elected Senate with a limited veto right 
over legislation -- the first free legislature in Eastern Europe since the 
Communist takeover after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Walesa aide said the Solidarity leader will probably visit Moscow but 
that Soviet officials have asked for assurances that he will not cause problems 
before extending an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa told the news conference he wants to assure Moscow that the 
Solidarity-led opposition in Poland does not want to cause a disturbance in 
Eastern Europe or upset the perestroika (reform) process of Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to resolve our problems and not disturb anyone, . . . above all, 
don't disturb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This amounts to a pledge that a reborn Solidarity will not repeat the turbulent 
challenge to Communist rule that it mounted in 1980-81, alarming the Kremlin 
and bringing about the imposition of martial law.

THATCHER HEARS GORBACHEV COMPLAINT: NO U.S. ACTION ON ARMS 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Britain's Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher here Thursday that he is worried that the favorable momentum in 
East-West relations will be broken unless the Bush Administration responds more 
positively to Moscow's disarmament initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin leader apparently was reflecting growing Soviet impatience with 
what it sees as foot-dragging in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, who confirmed 
Gorbachev's statements, also accused U. S. officials of trying to sabotage the 
Anglo-Soviet summit by planting exaggerated news reports about Moscow's sale of 
advanced jet bombers to Libya. He said Moscow has supplied Libya with six 
Sukhoi-24 bombers under a three-year-old agreement -- not the 12 to 15 
warplanes claimed by Bush Administration officials on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the principal summit meeting between Thatcher and 
Gorbachev, Gerasimov commented: "The timing of this so-called news is very 
suspicious. I read about these sales months ago somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
His interpretation, he said, is that someone in Washington "doesn't want the 
Soviet-British summit to go as smoothly as it is going." 
</P>
<P>
The Libyan jet sale and other arms control issues were said to have generated 
the most disagreement during nearly six hours of intense discussions Thursday 
between two political leaders who have developed an extraordinary affinity 
despite standing on opposite sides of the ideological divide. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top Communist and the British Conservative his predecessors once 
dubbed "the Iron Lady" were sometimes "solemn," sometimes "passionate," as they 
defended their respective views forcefully, but without rancor, said a Thatcher 
spokesman who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called the talks "very deep, very wide-ranging, and very 
friendly," while Gorbachev said the discussions "reached a very high level." 
</P>
<P>
While the British side played down Gorbachev's frustration with the Bush 
Administration, Gerasimov returned to the theme repeatedly during his meeting 
with correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we are not happy with the West's response to our initiatives," he 
said. And he made it clear that Moscow blames Washington, as the leader of the 
Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the new Administration needs time to study foreign policy," 
Gerasimov commented icily. "There are new faces there, and some of them don't 
know what foreign policy is about." 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers have made important strides in arms control in the last two or 
three years, and the atmosphere for disarmament negotiations remains good, he 
said. However, "continuity is the name of the game. . . . The main point is not 
to lose this momentum with prolonged reviews of foreign policy or with other 
obstacles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His own analysis, Gerasimov said, is that "the new Administration tries to 
please everybody and it's not easy. Also, we can feel a certain influence of 
some familiar names -- (former Secretary of State Henry A.) Kissinger and 
(former National Security Adviser Zbigniew) Brzezinski -- who tend to interpret 
Soviet-American relations in terms of confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
"The new Administration is not yet decided which position to take -- how to 
interpret the international scene," Gerasimov charged. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Gorbachev wanted the British prime minister to intercede in 
Washington, Gerasimov said: "It's up to Mrs. Thatcher to follow up, to talk to 
the Americans. . . . We just expressed our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about his Soviet counterpart's characterization, Thatcher's 
spokesman commented: "I suppose what they are reflecting is this transitional 
period" in Washington. As for anyone in the Bush Administration using the 
Libyan bomber issue to harm the Anglo-Soviet summit, he added, "I'm notoriously 
not in favor of conspiracy theories." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, the spokesman said, made passing reference to the Libyan bomber sale 
in her talks with Gorbachev, pointing out the danger of supplying weaponry to 
nations that support terrorism. Gorbachev reportedly made no response. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government expressed "deep concern" about 
the bomber deal and urged the Soviets to reconsider it, wire services said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Sharp Exchange' 
</P>
<P>
The issue also caused what British sources called a "sharp exchange" in 
parallel talks Thursday between British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and his 
Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who defended the deal as no 
different than British arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast clients. 
</P>
<P>
Given Thatcher's own views on arms control, meanwhile, it is debatable whether 
she would prod Bush into bolder action despite Soviet warnings about the danger 
of delay. 
</P>
<P>
Countering Gorbachev's calls for a nuclear-free Europe, Thatcher argued in an 
after-dinner toast that "both our countries know from bitter experience that 
conventional weapons do not deter war in Europe, whereas nuclear weapons have 
done so for over 40 years. As a deterrent, there is no substitute for them." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov recounted that more than half the discussion in the two leaders' 
principal meeting Thursday was devoted to the Soviet domestic reform program, 
known as perestroika. He said Gorbachev "was extremely frank and talked not 
only about achievements, but also about all kinds of difficulties which we 
encounter." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their other differences, on this score, the prime minister was totally 
supportive. "In barely more than four years since your first visit, we have 
seen changes in the Soviet Union which can only be described as a peaceful 
revolution," she said in her toast. "We admire -- very much admire -- the 
vision and the boldness which have inspired those changes." 
</P>
<P>
Human rights played little role in the day's discussions, although Thatcher did 
say at dinner that while Britain is pleased to see the emigration of those who 
want to leave the Soviet Union, "we also look forward to the changes in the law 
which you have promised, which will make these the rights of every person, so 
that they can be claimed and enforced and not given as privileges which can one 
day be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a few dozen supporters of Soviet Jews refused exit visas or Armenian 
activists demonstrated across Whitehall street from the prime minister's 
residence where the two leaders met. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining the special relationship between them, Thatcher hosted the Soviet 
leader in a study of her official residence at 10 Downing St., normally off 
limits for such meetings. The rapport between them is such that Gorbachev 
kidded her good-naturedly about the capacious handbag that some have dubbed 
Thatcher's secret weapon. "Ah! That's the handbag!" the Soviet leader said with 
a laugh when she reached into the bag for her index card at the start of 
Thursday's main meeting. 
</P>
<P>
To have more time with the Soviet leader, who heads back to Moscow today after 
only 40 hours in Britain, Thatcher has been riding with him in his armor-plated 
Zil limousine. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Thursday, after he paid a visit to Westminster Abbey, Gorbachev 
ordered his car to stop so he could get out and cross the street to shake hands 
with British well-wishers. "I would like to thank you all for this reception," 
he told them. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to make a major speech here this morning before lunching with 
Queen Elizabeth II and returning to Moscow.

'OUR REFERENDUM IS THE INTIFADA,' ARABS SAY IN REJECTING VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Palestinian activists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Thursday rejected 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's tentative proposals for elections, 
saying that the plans failed to address the basic question of the future 
independence of the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
They were also disappointed that President Bush appeared to support the plan, 
although they took heart in Bush's call for an eventual end to Israeli 
occupation of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources insist that there are many Palestinians who welcome an election 
to choose Palestinian representatives to peace talks with Israel but who remain 
publicly opposed because of intimidation by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegiance to PLO 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have stressed their allegiance to the PLO 
and have designated it as the sole group authorized to talk peace with Israel. 
The uprising, known as the intifada in Arabic, will soon begin its 17th month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our referendum and it is the intifada," declared Mamdouh Aker, a 
physician in the West Bank town of Hebron. "Why call for elections now? We will 
have elections as soon as Israel withdraws." 
</P>
<P>
Added Saeb Erakat, an editor at Jerusalem's Arabic-language newspaper Al Quds: 
"There was not a sentence about the objectives of the Palestinian people. What 
are these elections for? Shamir does not say. We want an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
"If Shamir wants to use the word 'election' only because it is a beautiful 
word, then it is not worth discussing." 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians left the door open for an eventual vote, but only under 
several conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We want all prisoners released -- all the deportees returned. We want to 
nominate our own leaders and organize our own parties. We need an overall 
scheme for peace, not peace by installments," said Halad Ashawwi, a professor 
at Birzeit University on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Ashawwi and others scoffed at Shamir's assertion that Arabs are kept in line by 
PLO terror. 
</P>
<P>
"Are people dying in order to mechanically say yes to the PLO?" she asked 
angrily, referring to the more than 400 Arabs killed during the uprising. "We 
are fighting the Israelis and suffering at their hands, and then Shamir comes 
along and says it is the PLO that is terrorizing us. Ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's call for Israel to end its occupation only partly satisfied the 
Palestinians. "The good thing about Bush is, he knows what he does not want. 
But does he know what he does want?" Ashawwi asked. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs here contend that without the PLO, no solution is feasible. They say that 
if the PLO is excluded, its followers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will 
revolt and millions of Palestinian refugees who live outside the borders of 
Israel and the occupied lands will continue to feed attacks on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"If Shamir wants us all to go into the 21st Century with bloodshed, then he 
should keep the PLO out," Erakat said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have been mulling over the idea of elections for months. They 
recall that in 1976, when Israel permitted municipal elections to be held, 
several pro-PLO mayors were elected. They also recall with trepidation that 
Israel forced the most nationalist among the mayors to resign and deported 
several, while others were targets of assassination attempts by Jewish 
underground terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, intifada leaders placed municipal elections among a list 
of demands for ending the violence. Some felt that in any election, pro-PLO 
candidates would win and thus ratify the group's dominance in the territories. 
There were suggestions that the winners could automatically become members of 
the Palestine National Council, the PLO's so-called parliament in exile. 
</P>
<P>
These ideas were tacitly dropped last fall once the PLO declared an independent 
state at the urging of Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. "We became citizens of 
occupied Palestine. We need Palestinian laws and Palestinian supervision," 
observed Mahdi Abdel Hadi, a Palestinian scholar in East Jerusalem. "Whoever 
wants to talk about elections must do it with our leadership -- the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, scores of Palestinians have been summoned by the 
military government of the West Bank and Gaza to give their opinion regarding 
elections. Sources in the military government Thursday said that, on an 
individual basis, "many" Arabs have shown quiet interest in holding such a 
vote. Israel has declined to name any of the interested parties, asserting that 
to do so would put their lives in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has been debating the idea of Arab elections since early 
this year when Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin laid out a peace plan that placed 
area-wide elections on the West Bank and Gaza as its centerpiece. Rabin 
proposed the vote as a means of choosing Arab partners for peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir came around slowly to the idea of elections after seeing that there was 
no way that Israel could hand-pick Arab peace delegates or get Egypt and Jordan 
to select a Palestinian team, Foreign Ministry officials here say. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the debate now centers on the type of election that should be held: 
either municipal elections for mayors or "political," area-wide elections. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, when he has spoken of elections at all, has usually called for 
municipal elections. He contends that Rabin's plan presupposes an eventual 
concession of territory to peace delegates who would emerge from area-wide 
elections. The prime minister opposes giving up any of the land, and municipal 
elections suggest submission to Israeli rule over the land as a whole even if 
peace talks occur, an aide to Shamir explained. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin opposes municipal elections because he worries that the results would 
bring a rebellious leadership to power, however nominally, in cities and towns 
-- much like in 1976, when elected mayors became the nucleus for a nationalist 
movement. Leaders elected for talks would control nothing and only come into 
play if Israel opened negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Shamir nor Rabin intend to extend the vote to Arab-dominated East 
Jerusalem. Jerusalem was annexed by Israel in 1967 at the same time the West 
Bank and Gaza were occupied following the Six-Day War. Palestinians demand that 
any election include East Jerusalem and that a solution to the Israeli-Arab

Concern for Local Issues 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the military government of the West Bank and Gaza Strip say that 
Israel would tolerate a victory of PLO supporters in either type of voting. 
They predict that the PLO's power would be diluted by the victories of some 
non-PLO candidates as well as by the concern of local pro-PLO leaders for local 
issues, such as the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met skillful, sophisticated people in the territories. These people 
could reach an agreement with or without the PLO and the PLO knows that," said 
a source in the Civil Administration, the official name of the military 
government in the West Bank and Gaza.

DRAWBACKS AND MERITS OF HOME AIDS TEST TOLD

Public health officials said Thursday that proposed home testing for AIDS could 
do more harm than good because users would not be psychologically prepared to 
deal with the knowledge that they had contracted the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents, however, argued that telephone counseling would be adequate to help 
AIDS victims cope with the trauma of a positive test result, rejecting claims 
that intensive face-to-face counseling is required. 
</P>
<P>
With a typical home test, a user would draw blood from a finger with a lancet. 
The blood would be transferred to a piece of absorbent paper, which would be 
mailed to a laboratory. The user would later telephone the laboratory to 
receive the test results and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Food and Drug Administration has refused to allow manufacturers to 
market home tests for the AIDS antibody. 
</P>
<P>
During a daylong hearing sponsored by the agency, a number of health officials 
contended that face-to-face counseling is superior to telephone counseling 
because it allows the observation of body and facial gestures and is more 
comprehensive in scope.

Naturalist and author Jack Rudloe on Thursday started a protest campaign 
against the oil spill in Alaska, urging Exxon customers to send the company 
credit cards sealed in oil. 
</P>
<P>
Rudloe said he hopes that angry Exxon customers will inundate the company with 
the oil-coated symbols of lost profits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm utterly disgusted with the irresponsible attitude Exxon has taken and what 
they have done to the Gulf of Alaska, which is probably one of the richest 
wildlife areas in the world," Rudloe said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil in 
Prince William Sound after striking a reef on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Rudloe started his crusade with a handful of Exxon cards contributed by friends 
and employees at his Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory. He said he will prepare 
and send cards from anyone who brings them by his office and hopes that other 
people will prepare similar packages in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
He said he puts each card in a 3-by-5-inch heavy-duty plastic bag. He adds 
about 2 ounces of motor oil, heat-seals the bag and sends it to Exxon.

ALASKA GOVERNOR THREATENS OIL SHUTDOWN OVER CLEANUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster, Gov. 
Steve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline 
unless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the 
possibility that Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it 
ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil 
companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week, Cowper 
asked them to respond by noon Thursday to his six-point safety plan. 
</P>
<P>
As the deadline approached, the three companies -- ARCO Alaska, BP America and 
Exxon USA -- responded with a six-page list of ideas. An aide to the governor 
described the companies' response as "generally OK" but said that Cowper may 
issue an order putting his plan into effect anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the 
Alyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating "a 
substantial potential risk of additional oil spill" because the consortium has 
failed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the risk, the order, which could be issued as soon as today, would 
require: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A written description, due within 72 hours of the order's being signed, of 
the location of all oil-spill gear at the consortium's disposal. Equipment must 
be dedicated to oil-spill cleanup only. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond 
to oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Installation of Booms 
</P>
<P>
 -- The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup 
equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup 
equipment is not ready. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 
10-million-gallon spill. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to comply with the emergency order would carry penalties that range 
from fines to criminal prosecution and jailing of company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the oil industry to be ready for a spill of this magnitude if it 
happens tomorrow," Cowper said. "There is going to have to be a plan that 
satisfies us, our people, and it will be tough. If it isn't complied with, we 
don't have any remedy available to us except shut down the terminal. And we'll 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
State law gives the governor the authority to close the terminal if it does not 
meet state oil-cleanup plan requirements. Such a move would swiftly halt oil 
production in the state, and worsen supply problems in the lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
It also would badly pinch the state treasury, which relies on oil taxes and 
royalties for 85% of its income. Cowper said he would seek special legislation 
to tap Alaska's $10-billion Permanent Fund, a kind of super budget reserve, 
should any terminal shutdown last long enough to cause short-term funding woes 
for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Cowper's shutdown were found to illegally interfere with interstate 
commerce and be overturned in court, it could last long enough to drive home a 
point about improving cleanup response plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Alyeska companies' offer included the immediate start of random drug and 
alcohol testing on board ships and the continued use of two-tugboat escorts 
beyond Bligh Reef, the shallows into which the Exxon Valdez crashed March 24 
before leaking 240,000 barrels of oil into ecologically sensitive Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska also suggested expanding the Coast Guard's radar system, which had been 
scaled down as a cost-saving measure in the early 1980s, and offered to keep on 
hand additional equipment to contain, skim and disperse spills. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of Exxon Corp. told Congress Thursday that the third 
mate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground has told 
company lawyers that he turned off the ship's automatic pilot in an effort to 
avoid the reef. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that he turned that computer off and it was not as if it 
hit the rocks on automatic pilot," Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in 
testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard spokesman Bruce Pimental in Valdez said investigators still are 
trying to determine if the autopilot actually was used the night of the 
accident and if it was, when it was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kilpatrick of the California Maritime Academy, a former captain himself, 
said autopilots take full control of a ship once they are switched on. 
</P>
<P>
"The helm will not respond if it's in autopilot," he said. "That should be the 
first clue to people on the bridge that the autopilot is on." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard official in Anchorage said the third mate in charge of the tanker 
shortly before it went aground did complain of being unable to get the vessel 
to respond to the helm. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's worst oil spill penetrated a national park Thursday, with an 
airborne spotter "seeing an oil sheen up on some of the rocks and seeing 
staining on the rocks" at Kenai Fjords National Park, park spokesman John 
Quinley said. However, favorable winds were still keeping most of the crude 
offshore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the former captain of the Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, 
left jail in New York after a judge slashed his bail from $500,000 to $25,000. 
Justice Thomas Starke said the earlier bail amount was "unconstitutionally 
excessive." 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, who lives with his wife and daughter in the Long Island community of 
Huntington, was ordered to return to court May 5 for extradition proceedings to 
Alaska, where he is wanted on three misdemeanor charges in the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The judge who had imposed the earlier bail is an environmentalist and former 
commercial fisherman. He called the spill "the worst man-made disaster since 
Hiroshima."

OFFICIALS WEIGH WAIVER FOR DUTCH MAN WITH AIDS

A Dutch citizen with AIDS spent his fifth day in a Minnesota lockup Thursday as 
U.S. immigration authorities remained undecided on whether to waive a law and 
let him attend an AIDS health conference in San Francisco that ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An immigration official in St. Paul, Minn., said he had recommended Hans Paul 
Verhoef's release but that a higher-up in Washington would not complete his 
review of the decision until today. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoef, a 31-year-old resident of Delft in the Netherlands, was arrested by 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service Sunday night under a 1987 law 
barring AIDS patients from entering the United States. He admitted that he has 
the deadly disease after the drug AZT was found in his luggage at the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, where he had stopped en route to the AIDS 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Being Treated 'Fairly Well' 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview from the state maximum-security prison where he is being 
held, Verhoef told The Times Thursday night that he is being treated "fairly 
well" and that sympathetic prison officials had taken him out to breakfast at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"The INS people are the bad guys," he said. "I told them they should put their 
energy into a worldwide program to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus and not 
into laws that don't work." 
</P>
<P>
He also told INS officials that "this law is like trying to stop water with a 
fishing net. There are thousands of people traveling across the water with the 
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection." 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 statute added AIDS to a list of seven communicable and infectious 
diseases that are grounds for barring a foreigner's entry into the United 
States. INS maintains the law applies to all those arriving here, but others 
claim it was not meant to cover tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoef's detention sparked protests that it violated a World Health 
Organization agreement on travel by AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Schiltgen, INS district director in St. Paul, said he recommended 
approval of a waiver because Verhoef had met three tests: "the danger to the 
public health is minimal, the possibility of spreading the disease is minimal 
and no costs are to be incurred by the government." 
</P>
<P>
An appeals hearing was set for this afternoon in St. Paul in the event the 
waiver is rejected in Washington.

AMID THE CONCRETE OF MODERN BOLIVIA, ANCIENT AYMARA CULTURE BLOOMS

LA PAZ, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As La Paz has grown into a bustling city of more than 1 million people, with 
shining skyscrapers and noisy traffic jams, an urban Indian subculture has 
flourished amid the concrete and brick, preserving its folk customs, 
traditional beliefs and ancient language against the pressure of the dominant 
culture and the modern metropolitan environment. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of La Paz belong to the cholitas, Indian women in bowler hats, full 
skirts and brightly colored shawls who come and go with babies and bundles on 
their backs, or sit on sidewalks peddling food, trinkets and gadgets. 
Aymara-speaking Indians also own uncounted shops and other businesses in the 
city, and their children are moving up in the mainstream educational system. 
</P>
<P>
Some eventually assimilate into the Spanish-speaking mainstream, but the urban 
Indian masses, now a majority in the La Paz metropolitan area, are continually 
augmented by migrants from rural areas. And a growing elite of educated Aymaras 
is working to strengthen their subculture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Water and Oil' 
</P>
<P>
Aymara anthropologist Mauricio Mamani said that after centuries of 
discrimination against Indians by the city's Spanish-speaking elite, La Paz's 
two separate societies will never unify. 
</P>
<P>
"Impossible," he said in an interview, "because they are like water and oil. It 
is not possible for them to come together." 
</P>
<P>
Aymara Indians once lived in a proliferation of independent rural kingdoms 
spread over the Andean highlands. They were linked by their common language and 
similar cultural patterns. In the 1400s, the Quechua-speaking Incas conquered 
the kingdoms, but the Aymara language and culture endured. In the 1500s, 
Spanish domination began. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, the Aymaras have learned Spanish, accepted Catholicism and 
adopted many of the cultural trappings of the conquerors and their descendants. 
The bowler hats and full skirts worn by Aymara women came from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longtime Duality 
</P>
<P>
There have been urban Indians since La Paz was founded. Built in rectangles 
around a central square, the colonial city was flanked by Indian huts huddled 
along irregular lanes. The Indians called La Paz by an Aymara name, Chukiyawu. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a duality in the city since its foundation," said Jose Mesa, 
director of the Museum of Customs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1781, Aymara Indians led by Tupac Katari laid siege to La Paz for several 
months as part of a failed Andean rebellion against Spanish domination. After 
Bolivia's independence in 1825, the country's white and mixed-race ruling 
classes intensified efforts to suppress Indian culture and customs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a reaction against things indigenous," Mesa said. "But the Indians 
did not abandon what was theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Official discrimination waned slowly. A 1925 decree by the municipal government 
of La Paz, barring Indians from the areas near the city's main square, was not 
revoked until 1944. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Migration Pattern 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian revolution of 1952 further reduced official discrimination against 
Indians. After the revolution, when La Paz had a population of less than 
150,000, a rapid flow of migration from rural Indian villages began. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who arrived from the countryside found a kind of urban Aymara culture," 
said Father Xavier Albo, a priest who has studied the urban Indians. A solid 
community of Aymaras who know the ways of the city yet retain many rural 
customs has eased the transition of new migrants into urban life. 
</P>
<P>
Several La Paz radio stations broadcast throughout the day in Aymara, with 
music, news and commentary attuned to the Indian culture. "This fact 
consolidates a kind of Aymara culture, but urban Aymara," said Albo. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Aymara music is heavier on brass than the rural music, which is played on 
various pipe instruments. Likewise, urban Indians are brassier in their quest 
for social status and economic gain, while rural Aymaras "underline more 
equality, sharing, generosity," Albo said. 
</P>
<P>
Among urban Indian women, coveted status symbols include expensive vicuna 
shawls with gold brooches and bowler hats imported from Italy. City styles for 
skirts and shawls eventually become popular among those who can afford them in 
rural villages. 
</P>
<P>
Rural religious rituals, often mixing ancient Indian beliefs with Catholicism, 
have been adapted to the city. The rural deity Pacha Mama, or Mother Earth, is 
a major figure in urban Indian life, requiring ceremonial offerings called 
ch'allas. But the purpose of the urban ceremony is altered. 
</P>
<P>
"They no longer do it for the fertility of the Earth but for the multiplication 
of money," Albo said. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular deity, called Ekeko, is represented by a stubby doll with a 
round, smiling face, carrying a bag loaded with miniaturized material goods 
such as food, furniture, appliances and money, cars and even houses. For a 
religious fiesta in January called Alasitas, La Paz's Aymaras and non-Aymaras 
alike buy the miniatures representing things they hope to acquire during the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Busy Streets 
</P>
<P>
Although most urban Indians are poor, as indicated by large numbers of Aymara 
street vendors and housemaids, some are increasingly prosperous. Aymara areas 
are known for their teeming markets and busy business streets. One of the most 
important streets, Avenida Buenos Aires, is lined with Aymara-owned buildings 
several stories high and often congested with bumper-to-bumper traffic. It is 
not uncommon to see Indian women in bowler hats driving cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Aymaras have monopolized all small commerce," said historian Luis Oporto. 
Many Indian merchants have become wealthy, he said, and "their children can 
study in the most expensive schools." 
</P>
<P>
Oporto said that a friend of his is going to marry an Aymara truck owner and 
that they are planning a lavish wedding that will last three days. "They have 
invited 500 people," he said. "There will be three orchestras in a giant 
locale." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how much money an Aymara has, he will continue to be considered 
an Indian by the Bolivian middle and upper class, according to Oporto. 
</P>
<P>
"In the fiestas of the petit bourgeoisie, the Bolivian bourgeoisie, Aymaras 
aren't present," he said. "It is impossible. . . . In reality, there continues 
to be discrimination, notable discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Only when the Indians become Westernized does the discrimination end, Oporto 
said. And little by little, from generation to generation, the urban Indians 
"slowly are becoming Western citizens." 
</P>
<P>
To counter the process of cultural assimilation, educated Aymaras have begun 
organizing a movement to promote Aymara pride. Aymara broadcasters, historians, 
teachers and others have formed ethnic guilds and associations. Aymara 
university students who once had rejected their cultural heritage have joined 
the movement, Oporto said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has been understood, even at the government level, that it would 
not be right to lose the culture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Jorge Quisque, 40, there has never been any question about that. He and his 
wife came to La Paz 20 years ago from a highland village. They have four 
children, ages 8 to 19. All have learned Aymara as well as Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughters Study 
</P>
<P>
"They speak both perfectly," the father said proudly. One of his sons is a bus 
driver, the other works in an auto body shop, and his two daughters are 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Quisque sells electric sockets, plugs, switches and tape on La Paz's main 
avenue, called the Prado. Wearing a light jacket and a red Coca-Cola cap, he 
sat on a step behind a display of his wares, spread over a square of blue 
plastic on the sidewalk. 
</P>

At home, the family observes "the customs that we learned from our 
grandparents," he said. For example, they make ch'allas for the new year and 
before Lent, usually using beer instead of liquor for the offerings because 
"there isn't money for much."

They maintain their ties to their native village, in the province of Sorate, 
and save money to take their turn contributing to fiestas there. "The town 
requires it, so you have to do it," he said.

UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO NAMES LAW SCHOOL DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kristine Strachan, a University of Utah law professor, has been named dean of 
the University of San Diego School of Law, making her the first woman in the 
school's history to hold the post and one of just a handful of female law 
school deans in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Strachan succeeds Sheldon Krantz, who resigned the post at the end of the 
1987-88 academic term to complete a book on the future of the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
Active in national legal education groups and a leading advocate of curriculum 
reform for law schools, Strachan, 45, was selected after a yearlong search by a 
14-member committee, which included faculty, students and alumni. The law 
school at the University of San Diego, a private Catholic institution, is 
considered the top law school in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
The school's new dean is married to Salt Lake City lawyer Gordon C. Strachan, 
who was indicted in the Watergate scandal in 1974 but was granted immunity for 
his testimony before a Senate committee. Charges against him were dismissed in 
March, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Professor Lester Snyder, chairman of the search committee, called Kristine 
Strachan "an outstanding teacher," whose extensive national connections will 
enhance the university's reputation outside the West and attract prestigious 
faculty, particularly women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"She has practiced law, she has written, she has taught, she is extraordinarily 
well-liked by her colleagues in Utah," Snyder said. "We think all of those add 
up to an exceptional candidate for dean." 
</P>
<P>
Strachan, who has two teen-age children, said in a telephone interview Thursday 
from Salt Lake City that she was "thrilled" with her new job, which she will 
begin in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rare and outstanding opportunity to take what is a very good school 
and make it one that will rival the very best," said Strachan, who grew up in 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
She attended The Bishop's School in La Jolla before going on to USC and Boalt 
Hall, the law school at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Strachan's selection brings to 11 the number of women who occupy the top post 
at law schools accredited by the American Bar Assn. There are 175 such schools.

$250,000 IN STOLEN TRUCKS, AUTO PARTS SEIZED IN REDLANDS RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three San Bernardino County men suspected of running a lucrative auto theft 
racket were in custody Thursday after investigators raided an old barn in 
Redlands and discovered nearly $250,000 in allegedly stolen trucks and auto 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Mezzano said Kenneth Levi Little, 36, 
Anthony Fontenot, 42, and Kenneth Wyatt, 26, were arrested on suspicion of 
stealing Toyota and Nissan trucks, taking them to the barn, stripping them and 
selling the parts to junkyards and automobile dealers throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have been operating for at least a year. They were real organized 
and had set up a good network for selling their goods," Mezzano said, adding 
that more arrests may be made. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8 p.m. Wednesday, eight CHP officers and six Ontario police 
officers raided the barn and discovered the allegedly stolen goods, which 
included 15 stripped trucks, a new 18-foot boat and hundreds of car parts and 
accessories, Mezzano said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the barn had been converted into a "chop shop" -- equipped with 
acetylene torches and saws used to tear the vehicles apart. 
</P>
<P>
The barn, which is owned by Little, was separated into different storage areas, 
each of which was cluttered with engines, mufflers, car stereos, plushly 
upholstered car seats, power tools and tires, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we raided the place (Little) was taking one of the trucks apart," Mezzano 
said. "He was a bit surprised, to say the least. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The other two suspects had been arrested earlier, Mezzano said. 
</P>
<P>
Fontenot, of Colton, was arrested by CHP officers at his home Monday, Mezzano 
said, adding that the officers discovered five stripped trucks and dozens of 
parts in the suspect's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Information from that arrest led CHP officers to Wyatt, who was arrested at 
noon on Wednesday at a junkyard in Ontario, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After that arrest, Mezzano said, the CHP and Ontario police collaborated to get 
a search warrant for the barn and raided it that evening. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 officers spent seven hours clearing the goods from the property 
Wednesday night. They were busy taking inventory on Thursday and trying to 
locate the legitimate owners, Mezzano said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the boat and one of the trucks are owned by a sheriff's deputy in 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"(The suspects) even took the deputy's emergency rescue equipment," Mezzano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the suspects were being held in San Bernardino County Jail, pending 
their expected arraignments Monday.

ROBERTI WILL SPONSOR CITIZEN ACTIVIST'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ralph Morrell, the self-styled citizen activist who for a decade has pestered 
the Legislature to correct abuses and excesses, on Thursday recruited Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti for his crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing a bit self-conscious at a press conference where he sat shoulder to 
shoulder with Morrell, Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced that he has agreed to 
sponsor legislation to more fully disclose how much of the taxpayers' money the 
lawmakers spend on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti acknowledged the single-minded "tenacity" of Morrell and said he and 
his erstwhile adversary had reached a "consensus" that provided "some 
concessions to citizen concerns about openness." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty . . . to recognize that the Legislature is not the legislators' 
thing but the citizens' thing," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure on Legislature 
</P>
<P>
Although Roberti did not mention it, his authorship of the Morrell bill comes 
as the Legislature is under pressure to take substantive steps to improve its 
image and credibility in the wake of a 3-year-old FBI investigation into 
alleged political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Morrell, 71, is a retired U.S. Navy warrant officer turned citizen activist who 
patrols the hallways of the Capitol, striking out at what he sees as abuses. He 
has sued the Legislature on occasion and has even launched some quixotic ballot 
initiative efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not won every fight, he has scored some impressive victories. 
It was Morrell in the early 1980s who pressured the Assembly to abolish its 
practice of "ghost" voting and vote switching. 
</P>
<P>
In ghost voting, an Assembly member would activate the electronic voting button 
of an absent colleague. Vote switching allowed an Assembly member to switch his 
vote in the official Assembly minutes to "yes" or "no" after the outcome was 
announced, provided the switch did not change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Morrell pressured the Assembly to quit providing free ice 
cream bars and other treats to its members. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Legislature's own expenditures and the lack of specifics 
provided to the public on how the money was spent that angered Morrell the 
most. He has deplored the Legislature's budget as a "slush fund" and denounced 
the lawmakers as "scoundrels." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the Legislature has jealously guarded its own expenditures, which 
this year total $160 million and are expected to reach $171.7 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate and Assembly make the spending reports public, they are 
usually generalized in broad categories without breaking out individual items, 
such as meals or first-class travel. Also, there is no deadline for disclosing 
the audits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informal Audits 
</P>
<P>
Legislative spending is not required to be audited by the state controller, the 
keeper of the state's checkbook and the official who is authorized to reject 
payment of expenses he believes to be unnecessary or improper. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti indicated that the state controller already conducts informal audits of 
the Legislature's spending. Under the bill, the controller will be required to 
make an official audit of legislative spending and make a public report no 
later than Nov. 30 of the next year. When reporters noted that the spending 
reports would be about 2 years old when released, Roberti said he would 
"consider" making them more timely. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the reports would detail many of the issues Morrell has complained 
about for so long -- taxpayer-financed meals, expenses incurred in attending 
ceremonies, first-class travel and the costs of frequent office remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Morrell congratulated Roberti on his "statesmanship and leadership," saying the 
Senate leader has the "ability to say no as well as the ability to say yes." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti conceded to reporters that some features of the bill will face 
opposition from some legislators, if for no other reason than that Morrell 
wrote them.

WEEKENDER: 'YOU DO THIS FOR THE LOVE OF THEATER,' SAYS A HOMEMAKER PLAYING A 
GANGSTER'S GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After working all day at a variety of jobs, members of the Manhattan Beach 
Community Church spend their nights having fun with theater. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye on tonight's opening of the '30s musical "Anything Goes," the 40 
cast members began rehearsing five nights a week in March to polish the 
singing, tap-dancing and acting that goes into the shipboard comedy sparkling 
with classic Cole Porter tunes. 
</P>
<P>
And if that weren't enough, some of them scoured secondhand stores for costumes 
or joined in building the handsome ocean liner set in which the orchestra 
occupies the top deck. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet poison" is how the musical's director, Lyn Coulter, describes the 
church's venture into community theater, where folks with professional 
experience mingle with the likes of teachers, homemakers and aerospace 
engineers in putting on at least two shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The creative instinct of all of us is involved," said Coulter, an insurance 
agent who calls herself an "old song-and-dance girl" because of stage 
appearances she made as a teen-ager. "It's a chance to get away from everyday 
life and put on some sequins." 
</P>
<P>
The church, which is affiliated with the United Church of Christ, began doing 
theater 41 years ago when two church members, one a writer and the other a 
musician, started staging original plays. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the home-grown works were replaced by shows with Broadway 
pedigrees that are presented in the 300-seat Community Hall Theater. They have 
included musicals such as "The Sound of Music" and "Guys and Dolls," as well as 
"You Can't Take It With You" and other plays. The church quaintly labels these 
non-musicals "talkies." 
</P>
<P>
While casting for the shows is open, leading roles go only to church members. 
And judging by the varying demands of "Anything Goes," the church has more than 
enough professionals and other able people to draw on. 
</P>
<P>
Kriss Light, who plays Reno Sweeney, the evangelist turned nightclub owner, 
works professionally as a country-Western singer. 
</P>
<P>
Her real-life husband is Tom Killam, who several years ago performed with the 
Los Angeles Free Shakespeare Festival and did TV comedies. In "Anything Goes," 
he's Billy Crocker, who finds himself in trouble after being mistaken for 
public enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Edwards, who plays the girl Billy is in love with, has sung with the Roger 
Wagner Chorale and is a member of the Jane Hardester Singers at El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, I tried to make living as an actor," said Killam, who is a general 
contractor. "But then I got married, had children and needed a regular 
paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Killam said it was the church production of "No Time for Sergeants" that got 
him back into theater two years ago. "I had a ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You do this for the love of theater," said Lois Bourgon, a homemaker and 
one-time nightclub singer and dancer who has the showy role of a gangster's 
girlfriend in "Anything Goes." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone comes with a resume that includes professional work. A chorus 
of sailors includes two engineers, an astronomer and a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
Killam said: "It's amazing how many talented people there are around this 
church." 
</P>
<P>
What: "Anything Goes." 
</P>
<P>
Where: Manhattan Beach Community Church, 303 S. Peck Ave., Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When: Today, Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7:30 p.m.; Thursday, 7:30 p.m.; next 
April 14 and April 15, 8 p.m.

LIMITED PERMIT MAY RESOLVE CHURCH DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An expansion plan that appears to resolve eight years of disagreement between 
the Neighborhood Church and its neighbors has won approval from the Palos 
Verdes Estates Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The panel this week recommended that the City Council give the Malaga Cove-area 
church a permit to build a new social hall by replacing a former garage and 
servants quarters and adding 1,775 square feet of new space. The church 
building was once an ornate private villa. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials and the Malaga Cove Homeowners Assn. appeared jointly before 
the commission after signing an agreement permitting the social hall but 
limiting some church functions that caused increased traffic and noise -- 
particularly the large number of weddings that had prompted critics to label 
the bluff-top ocean view church a "wedding chapel." 
</P>
<P>
Residents near the church launched a vigorous fight in 1981 against the 
church's original proposal for a free-standing, 4,150-square-foot social hall. 
The city turned it down in April, 1987, and the church and the neighbors began 
working on a new proposal more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will be a part of the city permit for church expansion, 
limits the number of weddings to 114 a year, prohibits Sunday weddings, and 
allows no more than 18 wedding receptions annually. Those events may not 
include a sit-down dinner or live music. Limits also will be placed on the 
number of social events not directly related to church activities. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contended that the church has had more than 285 weddings a year, but 
the church said the number never exceeded 190.

Franco Zeffirelli said Thursday that he hopes to "reconquer a lost paradise" 
when he directs Mel Gibson in a new screen version of William Shakespeare's 
"Hamlet." "It's very seldom that (Shakespearean) plays are done in a way that 
kids can identify with . . . and I think I've found a way to accomplish that," 
said Zeffirelli, who achieved success with his movie version of "Romeo and 
Juliet" in 1970. Gibson, who once starred in "Romeo and Juliet" on the 
Australian stage, said he has always been "excited, exhilarated and 
half-frightened by the possibility of having to some day play (Hamlet)." The 
actor added that he believes Shakespeare's "soap opera of the day" remains 
contemporary in that it deals with human emotions and conflicts, but merely 
sets them to beautiful poetry. Production on "Hamlet," which will be produced 
by Dyson Lovell ("Lonesome Dove," "The Champ"), is scheduled to begin next 
spring. ALEENE MacMINN

From Overseas: West German film director Wim Wenders will replace American 
Francis Coppola as president of the Cannes Film Festival jury May 11-23. 
Coppola changed his plans because of "professional commitments." Wenders won 
the festival's Golden Palm Award for best film in 1984 for "Paris, Texas." . . 
. In Rome, Gina Lollobrigida, Nino Manfredi, Raf Vallone and other Italian 
screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the growing number of foreign 
actors used in Italian films. "We have to defend ourselves, they do it in other 
countries, why not here?" Lollobrigida said at a meeting of the Union of 
Italian Actors. Italian directors often dub actors' voices after the film is 
shot, making it easy to use foreign actors. "The difference between a foreign 
actor who comes to Italy and the Italian actor who goes abroad is that the 
Italian must speak the language of that country," Vallone said. ALEENE MacMINN

Memorabilia from the Goldwyn era of Hollywood is going on display -- in 
Hollywood. "The Goldwyn Age of Hollywood" exhibit will open Monday at the 
Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Library, 1623 Ivar Ave., showing a wide range 
of items that span the life of legendary film-maker Samuel Goldwyn. On Sunday, 
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. will host an invitation-only party that not only will kick 
off the exhibit but also mark the publishing of a book about his father, 
"Goldwyn: A Biography," and note the re-release of his father's favorite film, 
"Wuthering Heights" on its 50th anniversary (the film opens locally Wednesday). 
Sunday night's celebrity guest list includes Bette Davis, Sally Field, Charlton 
Heston, Dorothy Lamour and several original Goldwyn Girls, including Virginia 
Mayo. The exhibit continues through July 8. ALEENE MacMINN

Expecting to hear the opening of Brahms' Violin Concerto, Music Director Andre 
Previn raised his arms Thursday to begin his morning rehearsal with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. What did he hear? The familiar strains of "Happy Birthday 
to You," as played by 100-plus members of the orchestra. Thursday was Previn's 
60th birthday -- he was born in Berlin, April 6, 1929 -- and the date was not 
overlooked by his Philharmonic colleagues. At the break following the Brahms 
rehearsal, Previn, violin soloist Joshua Bell and the orchestra enjoyed 
birthday cake. ALEENE MacMINN

'MAJOR LEAGUE' IN A LEAGUE BY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Major League" (citywide), an amiable and amusing hot weather diversion, trusts 
mightily that the Cleveland Indians and their fans are blessed with a good 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Taking note of the fact that the Indians haven't won a pennant since 1954, 
writer-director David Ward imagines that the team has been inherited by a 
hard-hearted ex-Vegas show girl (Margaret Whitton). Her notion is to hire such 
a bunch of losers that attendance will plummet and she'll be able to move the 
franchise to Miami, a city with a climate much more to her liking. (There will 
also be a Palm Beach mansion for her as part of the deal). 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to deduce that the recruits won't turn out 
to be the deadbeats Whitton expects them to be. Ward, who won an Oscar for his 
script for "The Sting" and more recently adapted "The Milagro Beanfield War," 
deflects predictability with admirable deftness. He does this with generous 
doses of humor and affection, a clear love and extensive knowledge of baseball 
and the Indians -- who he says he's rooted for since he was 5 years old -- and 
a starry cast that gets into the good ol' boy spirit of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Berenger's Jake Taylor is a playboy now in his 30s with such bad knees he 
hopes for just "one more season in the sun." Charlie Sheen's Rickie Vaughn is a 
punker, just finishing doing time for car theft, a kid with a fast ball but no 
control. Corbin Bernsen's Roger Dorn is a talented third baseman whose mind is 
more on money than baseball; he's more interested in preserving his profile for 
TV commercials than with exerting himself. Burly, seen-it-all manager Lou Brown 
(James Gammon, always a pleasure), recruited reluctantly from his tire business 
-- and unaware of his employer's true intentions -- has his work cut out for 
him in shaping up a team that also includes Wesley Snipes as a rookie with the 
wonderful name of Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a voodoo-practicing 
Cuban emigre. Bob Uecker, a canny, witty standout, is the Indians' jaded but 
game radio announcer, and elegant newcomer Rene Russo is the beauty that Jake 
let get away and is determined to win back. 
</P>
<P>
Ward directs his actors as adroitly as he has written for them, and the 
vulnerability that he allows his three stars to reveal is really what makes the 
movie work. No one, not even baseball fans, should go to "Major League" hoping 
for "Bull Durham's" sex, raunch and sophistication. But "Major League" (R-rated 
for language) has its own ingratiating charm. KEVIN THOMAS

'DREAM TEAM' WAKES UP TO AN OLD RUNNING GAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Zieff's new comedy "The Dream Team" (citywide) is so clearly derived 
from the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" that you might begin to wonder 
when Jack Nicholson will show up. This mechanically funny, amiably slick farce 
seems to expand, perhaps unconsciously, on the "Cuckoo" scene where Nicholson's 
McMurphy took his fellow inmates on an unauthorized field trip -- jazzed up 
with another "fish out of water" comic thriller plot. 
</P>
<P>
These "loonies" don't mean to be unauthorized. They're stranded in Manhattan 
when their psychiatrist (Dennis Boutsikaris), driving them to a Yankee game, is 
beaten into a coma after witnessing a murder. The only witness is the one 
member of the quartet who can't communicate (Stephen Furst, as Iannuzzi, 
babbling out catch-phrases from TV commercials and Phil Rizzutto's Yankee 
broadcasts). The foursome is left on the streets with everyone pitted against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
You'd like to see Nicholson pop up here, perhaps in a restaurant scene, 
ordering some toast, but his part -- the rebellious, wisecracking hothead -- 
has already been taken by Michael Keaton. Is it just an illusion, or is Keaton 
consciously pushing Nicholson mannerisms in this performance? They've always 
had a certain kindred attitude: black, sarcastic, sexually opportunistic, 
defiantly flaky and quick. But here, the screenwriters have Keaton's Billy 
Caulfield doing Jersey drawls and throwing a tantrum every 10 minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
The other three also resemble "Cuckoo's Nest" characters. Christopher Lloyd's 
anal-compulsive play-doctor suggests William Redfield's Harding; Stephen 
Furst's Iannuzzi recalls Danny DeVito's Martini, and Peter Boyle's religious 
fanatic McDermott, going full circle, suggests Lloyd's old "Cuckoo" part, 
howling Taber. Boutsikaris' Dr. Weitzman -- who's always kidding everybody and 
advising them to cheer up -- bears an eerie resemblance to Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
All this may suggest that "Dream Team" is a weak, derivative, somehow 
disreputable movie, which is somewhat true. If you compare it to its obvious 
source, it has a coy, flip attitude toward illness, skating over the surface of 
tragedy, dementia and pain without breaking the ice. The union of four oddballs 
-- rebel-writer, obsessive noodge, religious fanatic and couch potato -- is 
almost too schematic, as if the writers were somehow trying to define '80s 
dissidence. But even though you can predict virtually everything that happens 
from the first five minutes on, the director and actors manage to hook you in. 
</P>
<P>
Keaton, Lloyd and Boyle are carnivorously funny: three scene-stealers whose 
specialty has always been offbeat intensity, quirky, flamboyant energy. And 
though Furst ("Animal House's" Flounder) is playing the weakest role, he has a 
great comic waddle, running along helplessly behind them like a chafed turtle. 
</P>
<P>
Zieff's outstanding comedy merit is the way he seems to let his casts open out 
and take over. Here, the fugitives get to do insane upstaging exhibitions -- at 
the beginning, they rarely even seem to be looking at each other -- followed by 
sentiment, guns and car chases, romps with Lorraine Bracco and cutesy 
camaraderie. All three of them respond. Boyle, as an ad executive with a 
messiah complex, an F.D.R. grin and a compulsion to undress in public, hasn't 
been this funny in years. (If it were better written and more convulsively 
developed, the scene where Boyle gives his testimony and strips in a black 
store-front church might have been a little classic on the scale of Red 
Skelton's "Guzzler's Gin.") 
</P>
<P>
"The Dream Team" (MPAA rated PG-13, for violence and language) isn't unusual, 
but it's funnier than, say, "Twins" or "Fletch Lives." It can't really hit any 
classic highs, perhaps because it regards rebellion as cute and paranoia as a 
running gag. The jokes, to stick, need grittier, sawtooth edges. Life may be a 
madhouse, but if we were all patients in asylums where the doctors looked and 
acted like Steven Spielberg, none of us might want to call home. MICHAEL 
WILMINGTON

THERE'S BLOOD BUT NO GUTS IN 'CYBORG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I like scars -- really," says a girlish, love-starved refugee in "Cyborg" 
(citywide), trying to woo the bloodied beefcake hero with a little idle 
flattery about his battle blemishes. This movie too, jam-packed with clockwork 
bits of the old ultraviolence, is mostly for people who like scars -- really. 
</P>
<P>
It imagines a nasty future in which the survivors of an overwhelming plague 
slice and dice each other at length, often for no reason other than that 
they're bad, they're bad, they're really, really bad. If you experience a 
little deja vu over this future, it's because we've seen it dozens of times 
before, most notably in the "Mad Max" trilogy. There's no vehicular 
manslaughter in this one, though; everyone just walks, all the better to engage 
in sudden sword and knife fights along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The lead villain, a predictably leather-clad young hunk named Fender Tremolo, 
is the sort of unsavory fellow who will, as they used to say, kill a man just 
to watch him die. (Women and children too. Barbed-wire torture and crucifixion 
are a couple of his favorite time-killers.) As played by Vincent Klyn, this 
indestructible behemoth bellows homicidal instructions to his followers with 
the sweet voice and good will of a professional wrestler -- or like the very 
similar sadist-in-chief of "The Road Warrior" 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, there will of course be a sullen, silent type who turned 
mercenary after losing his wife and children to the savage pirates. He will of 
course be prodded back into righteous activism by the nagging of a new woman in 
his life. He is not Mel Gibson, but rather Gibson Rickenbacker, a.k.a. muscly 
Jean-Claude Van Damme -- you know, "the first hero of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians among us may have sussed by now that virtually all the characters 
are named after guitars or amplifiers. That little in-joke is the beginning and 
end of the wit to be found in "Cyborg," which has as humorless and stupefyingly 
awful a screenplay as you'll see playing on a screen this year. Script credit 
goes to a mysterious Kitty Chalmers -- which, if it isn't a pseudonym, probably 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
But how much script can there be in a movie that almost never lets five minutes 
pass without unleashing another bone-snapping, blood-spilling epic fight scene? 
And although director Albert Pyun ("Sword and the Sorceror") brings out nothing 
but the worst in the mercifully brief recitations of dialogue, he does know how 
to stage and pile up effectively brutal action sequences till you feel as 
though you've been through four world wars in under 85 minutes. It's 
desensitizing violence in all its glory: You may cheer during the rousing 
slugfests, then hate yourself afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for the dumb fun must also go to cinematographer Philip Alan Waters and 
editors Rozanne Zingale and Scott Stevenson, who keep the carnage-filled 
proceedings as pretty as they are fast -- and to sound effects editor Bill Van 
Daalen, who may have been the busiest man in post-production, given hundreds of 
loud jaw-socks and jugular-slashes to juggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyborg" (MPAA-rated R for every manner of unpleasantness) doesn't offer much 
hope for man's civilized nature in the wake of disaster, but viewers may find 
one glimmer of light in its future: the seeming absence of firearms. These 
gangs were able to stockpile sharp kitchenware, but apparently the 
semiautomatic weapon ban had some effect in the 1990s after all. CHRIS WILLMAN

'MUSICAL CHAIRS' GROUP USES THE HOME AS CONCERT HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Armentrout was filled with a new sense of conviction as she soaked up the 
sunshine one recent Sunday afternoon in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the cultural wasteland people have been saying," she pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
Armentrout and about 40 others had just gathered in a designer home tucked in 
the hills south of Ventura Boulevard to hear the Shostakovich Trio in E Minor, 
opus 57. 
</P>
<P>
After the performance, the audience lounged by an impressive spread of wine and 
hors d'oeuvres to critique another in a series of "home concert events" staged 
by an organization called Musical Chairs, named for the changing locale of its 
monthly performances. 
</P>
<P>
Armentrout learned of the concerts through a music appreciation class she takes 
from Greg Hettmansberger at his Woodland Hills home. Hettmansberger is an 
associate of Musical Chairs and concert reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to try the intimacy of listening and having the performers right 
there," Armentrout said. "Now, I'll come back for more. I think it's really a 
good thing. We're finally getting more performances and interest and music in 
the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Musical Chairs is the brainchild of Beverly Gladstone, who began organizing the 
chamber music concerts under the auspices of the Valley Arts Council three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hettmansberger was teaching "classes in the classics" at the time, and 
recommended that his students attend the home concerts to hear live 
performances of the music they studied. 
</P>
<P>
"What he was doing and what I was doing fit like a hand to a glove," Gladstone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gladstone decided to leave the Valley Arts Council and joined forces 
with Hettmansberger. In January, the two presented their first independent 
concert, keeping the name Musical Chairs, which Gladstone's husband had coined 
years before. 
</P>
<P>
The concerts are intended to give musicians a forum in which to play and 
listeners a place to hear chamber music performed by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mozart and Bach wrote chamber music, it was not with the idea that it 
would be performed in concert halls," said violinist Alan Grunfeld, who 
performs with the Long Beach Symphony and was featured at the March home 
concert. "Their music was performed in rooms in palaces or mansions where the 
elite would gather. In that sense, Musical Chairs is carrying on an age-old 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "And it is nice to play for a smaller audience in an intimate 
setting." 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the concerts is $10 for listeners. Musicians attend free. 
Performers split 50% of the proceeds; the rest covers the cost of printing and 
mailing Musical Chairs newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
The concert usually lasts about 45 minutes and is preceded by introductory 
remarks and commentary by Hettmansberger. He discusses composers and the 
circumstances in which they lived, the history of the music about to be played 
and the circumstances under which it was written. The performance is followed 
by refreshments, potluck style. 
</P>
<P>
Then members of the audience -- many of whom are amateurs -- are encouraged to 
bring along their instruments, break into small groups to improvise with each 
other, and in some cases, with the professional performers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of musicians are not associated with any formal musical group," said 
Cheryl Leah, a musician who attended last month's concert. "They love to play, 
but they're not in an orchestra. This gives them a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Hseuh, who has been playing violin for 16 of her 22 years, said the 
concerts, which she regularly attends, are just plain fun -- "sort of a 
relaxed, Sunday musical thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like going to an evening concert and going home afterward, and that's 
it," Hseuh said. "Here you get to meet people." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, two of the musicians who performed at the March event, Grunfeld and 
pianist Ronna Binn, met at a previous home concert. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to socializing with fellow musicians, Hseuh said, home concerts 
lead to other work, since listeners are occasionally interested in hiring 
musicians to play at private events. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians need more opportunity to be involved with the public, for people to 
listen to them and meet them," said flutist Anna Lawrence. "This is a nice way 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers pride themselves on being elegant but not elite. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just as easy to bring a nice wedge of cheese and crackers as Ding Dongs," 
Gladstone said. "We want people to walk away saying they've had a full 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the audience conform to the savory standards, although a 
sampling of Mounds bars made their way beside the pastries and other finger 
foods at one recent event. 
</P>
<P>
Every concert is taped, then later broadcast on Cal State Northridge's campus 
radio station, KCSN 88.5 FM, from 6 to 7 p.m. the first Sunday of each month. 
</P>
<P>
Most concerts are held at San Fernando Valley homes, and the next performance 
is scheduled for 2 p.m. April 23 in Encino. The concert will feature music from 
around the world, including "Spanish Suite" by DeFalla, "Csardas" by V. Monti, 
works by Chopin and Bartok and a contemporary piece by the Yugoslav composer 
Boris Panandopulo. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations can be made by calling Gladstone at (818) 784-8105.

When I go to an Indian restaurant, I like to go in a big group, and, to my 
mind, that group should always include my childhood friend Michele. With a lot 
of people, we get to taste a lot of dishes, and with Michele along, we know 
what we're eating. 
</P>
<P>
She and I grew up in that era when it was not uncommon to spend a few years at 
an Indian ashram between high school and college, and she did exactly that. For 
years after she returned, she put on huge Indian feasts with the ease and calm 
with which most people order take-out. It made all her friends very fond of her 
and the food she served. 
</P>
<P>
These days, like the rest of us, she no longer has the time to soak beans, much 
less prepare 10 or 12 courses, but we can occasionally corral her to come along 
as an expert guide in our eternal search for a new source of that wonderful 
subcontinental cuisine. And sometimes, as in the case of our visit to Canoga 
Park's India Garden Tandoor Restaurant, our search is rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
India Garden is a small neighborhood restaurant on Saticoy Street, next to a 
music store and a little international grocery. Inside, the pink and white 
walls are sculpted into Moorish arches, the windows are hung with lace, and the 
smells from the kitchen are particularly enticing. On a weeknight, there's a 
slow but steady stream of business. 
</P>
<P>
There are a mind-boggling 61 items on the menu, not counting desserts, 
condiments, and beverages, so we let Michele do the ordering. 
</P>
<P>
She starts us out with onion pakoras: deep-fried balls of onion and batter, 
crispy like the best onion rings on the outside, soft and chewy like a dumpling 
on the inside. Michele also insists on trying the vegetable samosas, fried 
packets of dough and ground vegetables; these, unfortunately, are bland, a bit 
sandy in texture and generally disappointing, although a particularly pungent 
tamarind chutney does much to perk them up. 
</P>
<P>
Michele knows that, in addition to entrees, we need the basic side dishes of 
tarka dal (lentils), bread, and basmati rice to serve as the sturdy backbone of 
the meal, a sort of bass-line against which the spices of the entrees can sing. 
</P>
<P>
The dal is rich with ghee and fried onions and garlic, and the huge flaps of 
naan baked in the tandoori oven are soft and bubbly. Michele also remembers to 
order raita (cucumbers and yogurt), which is handy for extinguishing fires in 
the mouth. And, for extra shots of intense flavors, she requests mango chutney 
and lime pickle. 
</P>
<P>
With the basics covered, Michele ranges far and wide through the menu. We have 
wonderful chicken tandoori, a succulent, yogurt-marinated chicken cooked in the 
tandoor oven at 800 degrees; it comes sizzling and spitting to the table. 
</P>
<P>
When we order, the waiter asks if we want our entrees mild, medium, or hot. I, 
who am happiest in life when I'm weeping from chili-heat, compromise and agree 
with the others to go "medium" with all dishes except one. . . . My obvious 
sulkiness concerning this arrangement vanishes when the waiter assures me he 
could bring a deadly hot sauce should I require it. 
</P>
<P>
The dish we order hot is the lamb vindaloo, which turns out to be gloriously 
tasty and quite searing. I never get that hot sauce. Just forget to ask for it, 
I guess. I'm too busy emptying the raita bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The only entree we virtually ignore is the shrimp bhuna -- a small number of 
small shrimp in a bland sauce with some crisp peppers and tomatoes, like a 
generic Chinese take-out dish. But overall, we agree that the food is freshly 
prepared and of very good quality, and the portions generally are quite 
generous, and the prices are right. 
</P>
<P>
The rice pudding is sprinkled with fresh pistachios and not too sweet, which 
makes it the best rice pudding I've had in an Indian restaurant. The homemade 
mango ice cream is also refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
As we're leaving, we grab a take-out menu and see they've been stamped in red: 
Free Delivery Around Six Miles. So armed, we deliver Michele an ultimatum: 
either she starts cooking again, or we're all moving to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: onion pakora, $3.50; chicken tandoori, $5.95; vindaloo, 
$5.50-$5.95; bindi bhajee, $4.25; tarka dal, $2.95; naan, $1.50; kheer rice 
pudding, $1.25.

SOLITARY MOMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRI TRAN CAME HERE FROM VIETNAM WITH A CAMERA -- AND A PASSION FOR PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a Chatsworth free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a young boy with a plastic camera in his native Vietnam, Tri Quang Tran 
didn't know how to crop the photos he took of his family, but he knew the 
images he wanted. So he took a pair of scissors and cut the negatives the way 
he thought the prints should look. The lab refused to print them. It was 1974. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Tran still sees images his own way, which has earned him his third 
area exhibit of black-and-white photos in two years. It started Saturday at the 
McGroarty Arts Center in Tujunga. And no, he doesn't use scissors anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a passion," said the self-taught photographer, whose day job is as a 
failure-analysis engineer for a Burbank semiconductor company. "I want to do 
photography 24 hours a day, the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
"You usually see happy scenes of children smiling and ice cream cones, and his 
wasn't like that at all," said Alice Asmar, McGroarty Arts Center curator. 
"There is kind of a solitary quality with the people. His work was more like 
the Oriental woodcuts." 
</P>
<P>
Tran, 27, whose father was a senator in South Vietnam, arrived with his family 
in Los Angeles two days before the fall of Saigon in April, 1975. He started 
taking pictures the moment he arrived, and got a bachelor's degree in chemistry 
from UCLA in 1983 "because it was a practical thing to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has taken a single photography class, in darkroom techniques, at Santa 
Monica College because he is always trying to improve his skills in 
black-and-white printing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say the same thing with color," Tran said. "In color you try to mimic 
reality. You take the photo and then try and reproduce it the way it was. But 
in black and white, there is a craft, an art in everything involved, from 
taking of the picture to processing and the printing, and the presentation that 
you can do to express your art." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not looking for anything in particular," said his friend and adviser, 
Mark Schulte, "but he's always looking. We were driving back from one of the 
galleries one day and Tran asked me to go around the block again. He spotted a 
multicolored, beat-up Volkswagen in front of this oddly colored building." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Tran noticed the reflection of parked cars in the mirrored 
walls of a building in North Hollywood and stopped to photograph that, too. 
"That's beauty for him," Schulte said. 
</P>
<P>
Those two pictures are part of the 40-photograph exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Tran said he would like to return to Saigon, to photograph "the people of my 
neighborhood and the place I grew up in." He worries about being at risk if he 
returns because his father was in politics. "The one thing I regret is not 
being able to bring any of the photos I left behind in Vietnam. I'm sure 
they're all gone." 
</P>
<P>
He lists noted photographers Henri Cartier Bresson and the late Andre Kertesz 
as his favorites because "they have the ability to capture the moment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the Vietnamese I know do photography," Tran said. He has a difficult 
time making his parents and grandmother understand his own appreciation. "We 
tend to be very practical, career-oriented people. My grandmother feels you 
need an office or a shop to have a career." 
</P>
<P>
He wants his photographs to have movement, atmosphere and mood, Tran said, and 
he always tries to capture an image as a permanent impression of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tri Tran: Photographs," to April 28, McGroarty Arts Center, 7570 McGroarty 
Terrace, Tujunga. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, closed 
Sundays. (818) 352-5285.

KCSN RADIO STRENGTHENS ROOTS PROGRAMMING WITH 'MOUNTAIN STAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that will bolster its standing as an outlet for seminal American 
music, radio station KCSN-FM (88.5) has added the nationally syndicated show 
"Mountain Stage" to its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly program, produced by West Virginia Public Radio, made its local 
debut Thursday night and will continue each Thursday from 9 to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The name "Mountain Stage" is something of a misnomer. While Appalachian music 
is offered occasionally, the fare is much more diverse. Next week's show, for 
example, features New Orleans pianist and singer Dr. John and three performers 
from the jazz world: guitarist Larry Coryell, pianist Bob Thompson and singer 
Ann Baker. 
</P>
<P>
The show records the performers before a live audience and has gained a sizable 
following, airing on 135 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to call us eclectic because that doesn't tell you anything," said 
host and music director Larry Groce. "We bring you the roots of the world's 
music in live performance. We do things that are very primitive and things that 
are very avant-garde." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Andy Ridenour said "Mountain Stage" has been in national distribution 
since July, 1986, and first aired in West Virginia in 1984. The show's $275,000 
annual budget is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, National Public 
Radio, and corporate and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Guests in the coming weeks will include contemporary folk artist Jesse 
Winchester, Los Angeles singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, blues man Clarence 
(Gatemouth) Brown and a Celtic band, Metamora. 
</P>
<P>
"It's diverse. We'll have someone who's not well-known, or someone who hasn't 
performed in 10 years, or someone who is well-known," said Groce, a singer 
himself who had a hit with "Junk Food Junkie" in 1976. "If it's someone famous, 
we don't insist on them doing their hits. When Maria Muldaur was on, we didn't 
mention 'Midnight at the Oasis' and she thanked us." 
</P>
<P>
Groce performs on each show, as does a house band and a two-woman group called 
the Twister Sisters. The regulars accompany guests and do a few numbers of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the one thread that runs through all the shows, but the show doesn't 
depend on us the way that 'Prairie Home Companion' depended on Garrison 
Keillor," Groce said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is staged at a 76-year-old vaudeville hall in Charleston, W.Va. 
Eight stations in the state present it live. Others, including KCSN, air a 
digitally recorded version. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best of these kind of shows and we're glad to be carrying it," said 
Mark Humphrey, KCSN music director. "What we're trying to do that's exciting is 
to have performance shows on in the evening at 9 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
The lineup at the station, which originates at Cal State Northridge, includes: 
Mondays, "Pot Luck," a folk music show produced by Seattle Public Radio; 
Tuesdays, "Barn Dance," broadcast live by KCSN from the Palomino nightclub in 
North Hollywood; Thursdays, "Mountain Stage," and Fridays, "Lonesome Pine 
Special," produced by WPLN-FM in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The station is looking for a performance show to air Wednesday nights, Humphrey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mountain Stage" may prove a valuable addition to KCSN. The station adopted a 
"traditional country" format in June, 1987, prompting many on campus to say the 
programming was too narrow. At the same time, financial problems forced the 
station to drop its membership in National Public Radio and to lose the 
prestigious news shows "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered." 
</P>
<P>
"Mountain Stage" may help, as it presents a broad range of music while staying 
within the notion of roots programming, and it has a national reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The show is carried by six other stations in California, the closest of them in 
San Bernardino. KCSN pays a nominal fee to air it: "just a few hundred dollars, 
enough to pay for the legal paper work," Ridenour said.

Brazil's President Jose Sarney announced a plan to protect the Amazon rain 
forest and castigated those who accuse Brazil of destroying the world's largest 
wilderness. Features of the plan include the creation of a national fund for 
environmental protection, suspension of subsidies for cattle ranchers in the 
Amazon Basin and new controls on pesticides. The government said the program, 
called "Our Nature," will have a budget of $178 million in its first year. "We 
are accused of something we cannot accept -- of destroying our own territory," 
Sarney said. "Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage."

Syrian and Christian gunners dueled with mortars and rockets across Beirut, 
shattering a short-lived cease-fire and forcing panicked civilians back to 
basements and bunkers. Police said 15 people were wounded. Officers said Syrian 
gunners fired 50 rocket and mortar rounds against the Christian enclave east 
and northwest of Beirut, about 11 hours after the cease-fire was called. Maj. 
Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army said that its troops were holding their fire. 
But a police spokesman said a dozen mortar rounds from Christian East Beirut 
slammed into Muslim West Beirut and that a rocket hit a Greek Orthodox church.

A San Francisco man sought in the pickax slaying of his elderly mother was 
arrested without incident by police and FBI agents. James Richard Garrett, 49, 
was taken into custody on an Oakland street corner by uniformed officers, FBI 
spokesman Chuck Latting said. "We're sure we've got the right guy," Latting 
said. "We've got his driver's license." Authorities in York, Pa., allege that 
Garrett killed his mother, Grace Reever Garrett, 79, with a pickax on March 23 
in the basement of her home in a bid to inherit her $600,000 estate.

U.S. CANAL CHIEF RESIGNS

The Panama Canal Commission's American chairman, William Gianelli, announced 
his resignation effective May 1. Commission sources said that he was 
discouraged by the continuing conflict between Washington and the regime of 
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, saying it has hurt the morale of canal 
employees. Last week, Gianelli accused Panama of "interfering with the 
operation" of the canal by harassing commission employees. The commission, made 
up of five Americans and four Panamanians, is a U.S. agency that has operated 
the canal since sovereignty over the waterway was turned over to Panama on Oct. 
1, 1979, under the Panama Canal Treaties.

Senate sponsors of legislation to raise the minimum wage ignored President 
Bush's veto threat and pressed ahead with a plan to boost the hourly base wage 
to $4.55 -- 30 cents more than Bush has said he would agree to. The bill's 
sponsor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), won vital Southern Democratic 
support by agreeing to cut the final target of his bill from $4.65 an hour to 
$4.55 and add a provision allowing workers to be paid a sub-minimum wage for 
their first two months in the job market. Those changes are likely to be 
offered by Southern Democratic senators today. The agreement appears to give 
Kennedy more than enough votes to win passage of his plan, although a final 
vote likely will not come until next week.

EVANGELISTS SELL HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criticism of a lavish life style by Oklahoma-based evangelists Oral and Richard 
Roberts has prompted the sale of their two Southern California vacation homes, 
valued at more than $1 million, Richard Roberts said. The younger Roberts said 
the criticism resurfaced since his father asked followers to sell unneeded 
valuables to help raise $11 million by May 6 to keep his 41-year-old ministry 
afloat. Richard Roberts said he and his father sold their homes in Rancho 
Mirage in the last year. "There was a perception that just having the house was 
bad," the younger Roberts said. "I didn't want to do anything that would 
reflect negatively on the ministry."

Sri Lankan rebels blew up an Indian army truck and ambushed a group of soldiers 
in two separate incidents, killing 24 soldiers and seriously wounding four in 
the worst attacks on the Indian peacekeeping force in 10 months, officials 
said. Military officials said the Indian vehicle was passing through the jungle 
village of Olumadu, 210 miles northeast of the capital of Colombo, when a 
buried bomb exploded, killing 18 soldiers and seriously wounding four. 
Officials blamed the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for planting 
the bomb. Six more Indian soldiers were killed by the rebels near Vavuniya in 
the north of the Indian Ocean island, they said.

SLUM OWNER SENTENCED TO 100 DAYS IN HIS HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a rat-infested residential hotel near MacArthur Park was ordered 
Thursday to live in his own decaying building for 100 days, the longest such 
sentence ever imposed on a Los Angeles slumlord. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she was shocked by what she had seen at the Palms Wilshire Hotel 
during an inspection last month, Municipal Judge Suzanne Person instructed 
Amiya K. Goswami, 54, to stay inside the four-story Alvarado Street building 24 
hours a day beginning next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered Goswami to follow up his hotel stay with four months in 
the County Jail if substantial repairs to the building are not completed by 
July 25. 
</P>

'It's Deplorable' 
</P>
<P>
"I am really pleased about this case because of the length of time the house 
arrest involves," said Deputy City Atty. Diane Stepheson. "This is sending such 
a clear message that this kind of thing is not going to be tolerated. . . . 
This building is a slum. You have so many tenants who are affected. It's 
deplorable." 
</P>
<P>
Holes are punched in the walls of many of the hotel's 197 units, paint is 
chipped and peeling and plumbing fixtures leak, she said. The elevator does not 
work, rats and roaches run freely through the building and there is no hot 
water. Doors are defective and smoke detectors don't work. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Goswami, who lives in Long Beach, nor his attorney could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Stepheson said the building was relatively free of problems before Goswami 
assumed ownership in October, 1986. "It has deteriorated substantially since," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Goswami repeatedly pledged to fix the problems, Stepheson said, but "absolutely 
nothing was done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Convicted March 1 
</P>
<P>
"He kept maintaining he had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. . . . I'd 
send inspectors out. . . . You would have thought he would have done 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's sentencing followed Goswami's conviction March 1 on 32 criminal 
violations of various health, fire, building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
Under Person's court order, Goswami will be fitted with an electronic 
monitoring device to track his movements once he arrives at the hotel. Unlike 
other slumlords who have been sentenced to spend time in their own buildings, 
he will not be permitted to leave his unit even to attend religious services. 
</P>
<P>
"Goswami has virtually ignored his legal responsibilities for over a year and a 
half and now the time has come for him to begin paying the price for that 
neglect and indifference," City Atty. James K. Hahn said of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Before Goswami, convicted slumlord Aaron G. Kempe of Beverly Hills had held the 
record for the longest house arrest in a slum case. Kempe, 63, ended a 45-day 
stay in his 8th Street hotel on March 13.

SCIENCE SCHOOL FOR MINORITIES CALLED PERILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California State University Chancellor Ann Reynolds on Thursday said a 
university-sponsored math and science high school intended primarily for 
minority students is in jeopardy because of opposition from the Los Angeles and 
Compton school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The university has been working with the Los Angeles Unified School District 
since 1986 on plans to open a school concentrating on math and science on the 
Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. The proposed school would be open to students 
from throughout Los Angeles County with special emphasis on recruiting minority 
youngsters who, university officials say, need extra encouragement and 
preparation to enter science professions. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Reynolds this week, however, Compton school district officials 
challenged the legality of opening the special school within its boundaries and 
said the Cal State program would "cause irreparable damage to the 
infrastructure of Compton's educational system" by draining away many of its 
brightest students. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board, which had co-sponsored the project with the 
university, temporarily withdrew its support on Tuesday, a little more than a 
week before an April 13 deadline to apply for state funds to plan the school, 
university and district sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement released Thursday, Reynolds expressed her alarm about 
the school boards' opposition, saying that it could hinder badly needed efforts 
to train students in science, mathematics and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to note that by the year 2010 the United States could 
experience a shortfall of about 560,000 bachelor's degree holders in the 
natural sciences and engineering," Reynolds said. "If this nation is to have 
any chance of maintaining its leadership role throughout the world, 
universities will have to respond to this critical shortage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Scientists 
</P>
<P>
"Given the shortage of scientists confronting this nation and the approach 
integrated within our plan, it is impossible to accept the premise, as alleged 
by the Compton board, that our efforts would have caused 'irreparable damage' " 
to the district, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials said they hope to meet with Compton board members to 
resolve the conflict before the April 13 deadline. Compton officials could not 
be reached for comment Thursday. However, according to a board resolution, a 
copy of which was provided by university officials, Compton opposes the school 
because it would be "in direct competition" with its new science and math high 
school. Compton's program opened last September at Dominguez High School, which 
is near the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Compton school board resolution, "The establishment of the 
high school on the CSUDH campus may cause the removal of our more able students 
from the three high school campuses, which would cause a detrimental drain on 
the vitality of the secondary program in the district." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution also states that the university needs Compton's permission to 
open a school within the Compton district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angles District Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson said the Los Angeles board's 
decision to withdraw its support is temporary and does not mean that it opposes 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Action Told 
</P>
<P>
"When our board members heard of Compton's board members' concerns, they said 
we don't think we want to move forward until this is resolved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Yolanda Moses, Cal State Dominguez Hills vice president for 
academic affairs, guidelines drafted by the university stipulate that no more 
than two or three students per high school would be accepted into the special 
school. Students who have demonstrated a special ability in math and science or 
who have shown potential would be targeted for admission. 
</P>
<P>
"Their fear is that we would take away the cream of their students, which would 
not happen," Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
The university is trying to meet an April 13 state deadline to apply for 
$400,000 in development money. According to Moses, the university had 
envisioned opening the school in the fall of 1990 with 100 to 150 students and 
eventually enroll up to 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to all of the courses required for high school graduation, students 
would be offered extra instruction in math and science. They would also have an 
opportunity to collaborate with university professors on research projects and 
work during the summer in science-related industries, Moses said.

MAHONY BATTLES UNION CRITICISM; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL TO STUDY VALIDITY OF GRAVEDIGGERS' ORGANIZING VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special three-member panel will meet in late April in Los Angeles to consider 
charges by the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese that could invalidate an 
election in which the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union won the 
right to represent the archdiocese's gravediggers, the archdiocese announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will be headed by Fred Alvarez, a San Francisco attorney who often 
represents management in labor relations matters. Both parties agreed to 
Alvarez' selection to head the panel. The hearing is scheduled for April 24 to 
26. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, meanwhile, issued his first formal statement on the 
issue, in response to criticism from numerous labor leaders, including William 
R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation of 
Labor. The labor critics have accused Mahony of taking an anti-union stance. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not the labor movement," Mahony said in the statement. "Rather 
the dispute concerns the tactics and behavior of one very small unit involved 
in one specific recognition election." 
</P>
<P>
As to the archdiocese's overall relations with organized labor, he said: "I 
hasten to point out that the relationship of the Los Angeles Archdiocese with 
the Southern California labor leadership has been -- and continues to be -- 
sound, positive and constructive." 
</P>
<P>
But he sharply attacked the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, 
known as the ACTWU. "I am dismayed at the hostile, strident and confrontational 
methods employed from the start by field representatives" of the union, Mahony 
said. "Their approach has reflected conflict, deception and their inability to 
follow agreed-upon procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony expressed dismay about "personal attacks on my integrity." He also 
accused the union of utilizing "anti-Catholic rhetoric" and spreading 
"misinformation," although he provided no specifics. He said that immediately 
after the election, workers complained to him about "an atmosphere of threats 
and intimidation" during the election campaign, but offered no specifics on 
this point either. 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Vasquez, the union's chief organizer in the campaign, took exception 
to Mahony's statement. She reiterated the union's position that it did nothing 
wrong during the election campaign and that the union had bent over backward to 
reach an amicable settlement with Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Friendly Manner' 
</P>
<P>
"We have treated this campaign different than with a regular employer because 
we were dealing with Archbishop Mahony, who was well known as a pro-labor 
archbishop," Vasquez said. "The first thing I did when I started organizing was 
to try to resolve this in a friendly manner." She said the union only decided 
to hold public demonstrations starting last July after Mahony "refused to meet 
with the workers." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, who is Catholic, as are virtually all of the Latino cemetery workers, 
said, "We have not at any moment made an anti-Catholic statement. We are not 
fighting against the church. The workers came here for help and we help them 
because that's our job." 
</P>
<P>
Until this dispute erupted last summer, Mahony had had a long history of good 
relations with unions, dating from his days as a priest in the San Joaquin 
Valley, where he helped mediate farm labor disputes. He was one of the first 
members of the state's Agricultural Labor Relations Board in 1975, and in 
recent years played a prominent role in supporting an increase in the state's 
minimum wage and advocating organizational activities among low-paid domestic 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
But Mahony has consistently told the 140 gravediggers at the archdiocese's 10 
cemeteries that he would prefer to deal with them individually rather than 
through a labor union. The workers started organizing last year, saying that 
they wanted higher pay, better medical benefits and an end to oppressive 
treatment from supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, pay has been raised, medical benefits improved and a supervisor was 
fired, according to officials of the archdiocese. However, the organizing 
campaign continued and in February the workers voted 66 to 62 in favor of union 
representation.

6 MEASURES FACE IGNORANCE, APATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While facing no organized opposition, proponents of the six propositions on 
Tuesday's Los Angeles primary ballot say they still have to face two serious 
obstacles: ignorance and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
In this low-key election season with few close contests, the ballot 
propositions -- four bond issues and two City Charter amendments -- are 
acknowledged as "real yawners," even by some of the campaign consultants paid 
to navigate their passage. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there is no opposition," said Bob Lavoie, campaign manager for 
Proposition 2, a bond issue to improve police facilities, only half in jest. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Romeo is co-manager of the campaigns for Propositions 1 and 3, bond 
measures that would repair and expand libraries and make old, low-cost 
apartments safe from earthquakes. She said that some opposition would at least 
have brought the issues to the public's attention and would have given voters a 
chance to decide on the merits. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make news, but they are very important issues," Lavoie said. 
</P>
<P>
The two charter amendments would change procedures for transferring city funds 
and for approving employee pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
If the voters approve all four bond measures with the required two-thirds 
majority, the total amount added to the average annual property tax bill would 
be $34, according to the city administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Bond measure proponents are also worried about the expected low voter turnout, 
which traditionally means that more conservative voters dominate the outcome. 
That could spell doom for spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bode well," Romeo said. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout in the municipal primaries has been dropping steadily in recent 
elections -- from 42.4% of the registered voters in 1977 to 34.7% in 1985. Some 
political observers say the turnout on Tuesday could drop to 20% or less of 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
With little public debate on the six measures, many voters are expected to 
depend on editorial endorsements and so-called "slate cards" of recommended 
votes. The slate cards are paid for by candidates who like to send out voting 
recommendations on all or most of the ballot. Sometimes other candidates or 
proponents of measures will pay to be included; sometimes they are added free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slate Card Opposition 
</P>
<P>
One bond issue that has picked up some unexpected opposition on a slate card is 
the $176-million police facilities bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Non-Partisan Candidate Election Council, which sends out 180,000 slate 
cards to conservative voters, is recommending a "no" on Proposition 2. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Hoffenblum, campaign consultant to the group, said the conservative 
alliance generally opposes all bond issues, but agreed to support Propositions 
1 and 3. "We didn't want to go 'yes' on all the bonds," he said, so Proposition 
2 got the ax. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 2 proponents say they picked up the "no" recommendation when they 
could not afford to buy their way on the the card. Hoffenblum denied the 
accusation and added that no propositions paid to get on the slate card. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 2, nonetheless, is expected to pick up other slate card 
endorsements in addition to the strong backing it has already received from 
newspaper editorials, Mayor Tom Bradley, other elected officials and Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
No one submitted ballot arguments against any of the six measures to the city 
clerk's office to accompany the sample ballot sent to all city voters. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a rundown on the six measures. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 1 -- A $53.4-million bond issue to finance building of three 
branch libraries in the San Fernando Valley and improve 26 branch libraries 
throughout the city, including some damaged in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a $90-million library bond narrowly defeated in the November election, 
Proposition 1 would not provide money for building of the downtown Central 
Library, a feature that attracted the intense opposition of Councilman Nate 
Holden, who went on a successful campaign to beat the bond proposal last year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 1 is supported by Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 2 -- A $176-million bond issue to build two new police stations 
at yet-to-be-determined locations in the San Fernando Valley and mid-Wilshire 
area, a new police training facility and modernization or replacement of all of 
the existing stations to relieve crowding or to accommodate increased staffing. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 3 -- A $100-million bond issue to provide loans to bring 15,000 
privately owned, low-cost apartments up to earthquake safety standards. Up to 
$10 million of the bond money would be used to establish homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the financing is needed to protect the city's dwindling supply 
of affordable housing. A city law requires an estimated 44,000 unsafe rental 
units to be brought up to earthquake standards. However, it is difficult for 
some owners to obtain financing to make repairs, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is supported by the mayor, most members of the City Council and 
housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 4 -- A $60-million bond issue to finance installation of fire 
sprinklers and removal of asbestos in City Hall and five other tall municipal 
buildings. The measure was prompted by last May's fire at the 62-story First 
Interstate Bank building. 
</P>
<P>
Charter Amendment 5 -- Would reduce the number of votes required on the 
15-member council for approval of city employee pay raises, from 10 to eight. 
</P>
<P>
Charter Amendment 6 -- Would raise the limit on funds that can be transferred 
within the same city department, without approval of the mayor and City 
Council, from $5,000 to $25,000. Adjusted for inflation, the $5,000 limit set 
in 1951 would now be about $25,000, according to a city administrative 
officer's report. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, voters rejected a similar charter amendment by a wide margin.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT FILED OVER GRIFFITH PARK NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Feliz resident filed a $500-million claim against the city of Los Angeles 
Thursday as a prelude to a class-action suit that he said would seek damages 
for noise, traffic and community disruption caused by commercial programming at 
the Greek Theatre and Griffith Park Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Barney Feldman, who is not represented by a lawyer, said the 
claimed amount would compensate a class of 25,000 residents of the Los Feliz 
area for 25 years of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the city could avoid a lawsuit by pledging to enforce municipal 
laws, such as those regulating noise and prohibiting the consumption of alcohol 
in parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't say in the law, 'except the Greek Theatre,' " Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Feldman was successful in forcing the city to put up a fence to keep 
golf balls from the Roosevelt Golf Course in Griffith Park out of his yard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'MR. MAGOO BANDIT' HITS ANOTHER BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bank robbery in Westlake Village this week was the work of the "Mr. Magoo 
Bandit," who is suspected of robbing a dozen banks in the South Bay and Orange 
County, sheriff's deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit -- nicknamed after the nearsighted cartoon character because he 
wears thick glasses -- robbed the Coast Savings bank in the 32100 block of West 
Agoura Road shortly after it opened at 9 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Frank Woodall 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect handed a teller a note demanding money after showing her a handgun 
concealed in a brown leather bag, Woodall said. He escaped a few minutes later 
with $4,400 in cash, authorities said. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The man's description matched that of a robber responsible for 11 holdups in 
the South Bay area and one in Anaheim between March 28 and April 4, FBI 
spokesman Fred Reagan said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SECOND PUBLISHER OF STUDENT PAPER FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Haefele on Thursday became the second publisher of Cal State Los Angeles' 
student newspaper to be fired in less than a year after squabbles with 
administrators over negative articles about campus activities. 
</P>
<P>
Haefele replaced former University Times publisher and journalism teacher Joan 
Zyda on April 20, a day after she was dismissed over issues of press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"I've encouraged reporters to initiate stories, some of them harsh, on the 
administration," said Haefele, 46, who worked as a journalism teacher at CSLA 
when he assumed Zyda's position. "I don't think they want an independent, 
credible newspaper here." 
</P>
<P>
Haefele, whose dismissal takes effect April 18, added, "But I lasted twice as 
long as Joan, I'm proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
In March, Zyda filed a federal lawsuit against the university and five 
officials, alleging that her First Amendment rights of free expression were 
violated when she was fired. Zyda said she filed the U.S. District Court suit 
"to put a strong light on the First Amendment house of horrors" at the Los 
Angeles campus. 
</P>
<P>
She alleges that she was fired because of the paper's investigative articles in 
the aftermath of the October, 1987, earthquake in which a student was crushed 
to death on the campus. Zyda is now teaching journalism at the UCLA Extension 
program.

MCENROE OPENS TONIGHT AGAINST NOAH IN DAVIS CUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the slip of paper with his name written on it was drawn Thursday, John 
McEnroe stepped forward with his hands over his head, like a boxer being 
introduced in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Just a splash away from the watery home of Shamu, the killer whale at Sea 
World, the draw was made for the Davis Cup quarterfinal round between the 
United States and France, which begins tonight with two singles matches at the 
Sports Arena here. 
</P>
<P>
The two heavyweights go first. McEnroe and Yannick Noah will play a 
best-of-five-set match, to be followed by Andre Agassi against France's Henri 
Leconte. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who is 3-0 lifetime against Noah, said he was just relieved to know 
what time he would play so he would not have to wait around. Instead, Agassi is 
going to have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully I can get a good start and help out Andre," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi may need some help. Although U.S. Captain Tom Gorman said it didn't 
matter who played first, he almost certainly was relieved that it was his No. 1 
player, which should take some pressure off his other struggling singles 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, whose ranking has dropped from No. 3 to No. 5 since January, insists 
his confidence level is not flagging, even though his results say it probably 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
"But I definitely don't think I've been playing close to par," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Leconte's record against Agassi is 2-1, although Agassi won the last meeting, 
7-5, 7-5, in the semifinals at Stuttgart, West Germany, last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Leconte has had as much trouble finding his game this year as Agassi. 
Leconte has lost in the first round in three of the four Grand Prix tournaments 
he has played, so he isn't exactly riding a swell into his match with Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Leconte is unshaken in his belief that France will upset the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I am not as confident as before," he said. "I am more confident." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of this quarterfinal competition will play either West Germany, the 
defending Davis Cup champion, or Czechoslovakia in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
Each singles match and the doubles match are worth one point. As Noah said, 
there are few other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"The only key is to win three points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the United States will send its doubles team of Ken Flach and Robert 
Seguso against an announced team of Noah and Leconte, although France captain 
Eric Debliker can change the team up until an hour before the match. Flach said 
he expects to see a different team across the net. 
</P>
<P>
"If John and Yannick have a real long match, I think they'll substitute Yannick 
with (Guy) Forget," Flach said. 
</P>
<P>
Forget, who has been bothered by tendinitis in his knee, was limping slightly 
Thursday, but he said he is feeling better and will be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what doubles team the French field, the outcome is far from settled. 
Flach and Seguso have not won more than one match in any of the five 
tournaments they have played this year. 
</P>
<P>
Flach said that he and Seguso have made a lot of progress in practice this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, we're just better prepared because we have been able to play this one 
week far from distractions." 
</P>
<P>
New this year to Davis Cup is the use of tiebreakers in all but the fifth set. 
Noah, who has played five sets with regularity recently, acknowledged the 
importance of his first match with McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to win this, I am going to have to beat John in the first 
match," he said. "I have nothing to lose. I'm going to play my game and give 
him hell." 
</P>
<P>
Given his choice, McEnroe would like the U.S. fans to make the Sports Arena a 
little hot for the French team, and chances are no one can put them in that 
frame of mind better than McEnroe, with his particularly incendiary brand of 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
After taking four weeks off, McEnroe is rested and well. He also said he is 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced I do more damage if I'm doing my own thing and have people react 
to me," he said. "It's obvious to me, the style of play is upsetting to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe pledged to try to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
The surface for the Davis Cup matches is a rubberized carpet called Supreme 
Court. It is the same surface on which John McEnroe defeated Ivan Lendl in the 
championship match of the World Championship of Tennis finals and was brought 
here from Dallas. The surface will be placed directly on the concrete floor. It 
is said to be neither fast nor slow, but instead can be be characterized as 
producing true bounces. 
</P>
<P>
If Robert Seguso and Ken Flach do play Henri Leconte and Yannick Noah in 
doubles, it will be a rematch of their famous 1985 U.S. Open meeting in which 
the Americans won in four sets. It was the famous "hair ball" incident, in 
which a ball was hit at Flach's head in a critical point of the third-set 
tiebreaker. The French claimed that the ball brushed Flach's hair and was thus 
touched as it went long. Flach claimed he had ducked out of the way and that 
the ball had sailed over the baseline. Flach and Seguso got the decision, won 
the tiebreaker and then won the match by taking the fourth set, 6-0, as Noah 
and Leconte played listlessly in protest. 
</P>
<P>
No computer points are awarded in Davis Cup play, so Andre Agassi's No. 5 
ranking and McEnroe's No. 6 will be unchanged. Noah is No. 12 and Leconte No. 
13. . . . The last time McEnroe played Noah, he won, 7-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, in the 
1987 WCT tournament.

WITH RAY SIDELINED, ANGELS FALL TO CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All spring long, Angels Johnny Ray and Mark McLemore waged a gallant 
competition for the right to be first at second base. Ray, the incumbent, won 
the job in a photo finish, but for lack of a sound left wrist, he wasn't able 
to hold it for long. 
</P>
<P>
To the victor, the spoils were spoiled after just two days. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, as the Angels were losing to the Chicago White Sox, 3-2, before 
20,667 fans at Anaheim Stadium, Ray was placed on the 15-day disabled list and 
McLemore was recalled from triple-A Edmonton in a rapid reversal of last 
season's plot twist at second base. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, it was McLemore who relinquished the starting position to Ray after 
undergoing surgery to remove a clotted vein from his right arm. But first, 
McLemore had been able to retain the job for a month. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Ray didn't last a three-game series, begging out of the lineup after 
a pair of painful starts against the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tendinitis, to a degree," Angel Manager Doug Rader reported. "It started 
up in spring training, but as we went along, it kept getting better. Then, once 
we got here, it really started bothering him." 
</P>
<P>
Ray went 0 for 9 at the plate and committed two errors in the field as he 
attempted to play with a tightly bandaged wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"After every at-bat (Wednesday night), he'd come back with a heavier and 
heavier wrap on it," Rader said. "You could see he was in a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Ray had the wrist examined by Angel team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum, 
who diagnosed the injury as a sprain and placed Ray's left arm in a splint. Ray 
will wear the splint for three to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, McLemore will be back tonight, a lot sooner than he had expected after he 
received word of his demotion during last weekend's Freeway Series. He will be 
given a second chance at the position he thought he had earned all along. 
</P>
<P>
"I did well enough to start for anybody, except for maybe the Cubs," McLemore 
said before departing. Ryne Sandberg, perennial National League All-Star, 
starts at second base for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, with Ray unavailable and McLemore in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
where Edmonton opens its season tonight, Rader had to field a patchwork lineup. 
He started utilityman Glenn Hoffman at second base and had third baseman Jack 
Howell hit second in the batting order, Ray's customary slot. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman fared well in his Angel debut, doubling, walking and scoring a run in 
three at-bats, but Howell went 1 for 5 and flied out with Dick Schofield on 
second base with one out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
When Devon White followed with a strikeout against Chicago reliever Donn Pall, 
the Angels had lost for the second time in three games, and another Angel 
debut, this by Bert Blyleven, had been spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first Angel start on his 38th birthday, Blyleven labored to a 
five-inning no-decision, leaving after throwing 91 pitches in a 2-2 tie. 
Blyleven allowed six hits and two walks -- and, not surprisingly, two home 
runs. The man who made major league history by serving up 50 home runs with 
Minnesota in 1986 opened his Angel career by yielding solo shots to Carlton 
Fisk in the second inning and Ivan Calderon in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel reliever Willie Fraser kept the game tied, 2-2, through seven innings and 
might have proceeded further, had it not been for a wide throw by Schofield, 
the Angels' shortstop, in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and Chicago's Greg Walker on first base after being hit by a 
Fraser pitch, Ron Kittle doubled to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, trying to score on the play, got a break when Schofield caught left 
fielder Chili Davis' relay on the grass fringe behind third base and fired a 
wide throw to catcher Lance Parrish. The ball beat Walker to the plate, but 
because it was off line, Walker was able to beat Parrish's lunging tag to score 
the decisive run. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to be out," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
So did Schofield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should've had him," Schofield said. "I just turned around and threw 
it. If it had been on line, he would've been out." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, on his way to his first defeat of the season, tried to shrug off 
Schofield's misfire. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked to me like we had a good chance," Fraser said, "but you can't blame 
Schoey. I shouldn't have given up the double. We're all human." 
</P>
<P>
Humans make mistakes. Humans also get hurt. When both occurrences happened to 
the Angels Thursday night, Rader tried to be as optimistic as humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
His reaction to the Ray prognosis? 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is: I'm glad we have Mark McLemore," Rader said. "That was (Angel 
Vice President Mike Port's) stance all along -- having two good second basemen 
beats the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"And he sure was right." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels held a press conference for Jim Abbott Thursday and then cut off 
interviews until Saturday, when he makes his first major league start against 
the Seattle Mariners. The most interesting quote came when Abbott was asked if 
his presence in the rotation could be considered a publicity stunt. "I don't 
think it is," Abbott replied. "I hope I have a vote in it. There are people in 
the Angel organization who are a little bit leery of criticism, and if my 
pitching at this level would be seen as a publicity stunt, they'd be wide open 
to criticism. I don't think there are people here who would want to subject 
themselves to that so quickly. I might agree if I was 0-5 in the minors 
somewhere and the Angels were in dead last come July. But I really feel like I 
earned a spot on this team. . . . If you haven't been around our spring 
training, you might feel like it was a publicity stunt. And if you have, and 
you still feel that way, I think you're wrong, and you're entitled to your own 
opinion."

HATS OFF TO KONTOS AS HIS 3 GOALS GET KINGS EVEN, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey was back in goal, Wayne Gretzky scored a goal against the team he 
was leading to a Stanley Cup this time last season, and the Kings beat the 
Edmonton Oilers, 5-2, Thursday night at the Forum to even their National Hockey 
League playoff series at one game each. 
</P>
<P>
Things seemed to be getting back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who had hats raining down onto the ice was a most unlikely hero: 
No. 15. Check your program. 
</P>
<P>
It says there that Chris Kontos is a 25-year-old center whose hometown is 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos had three goals for the Kings Thursday, the first hat trick of his 
career. Added to a goal in the opener that the Kings lost to the Oilers 
Wednesday night, that makes four goals for the playoff series, topping his 
season total of three. 
</P>
<P>
So, where has he been all season? Well, he started the season in Switzerland. 
If the name is at all familiar, it's because he did play sparingly for the 
Kings in the playoffs last year. He was acquired last season and played enough 
to get one assist in four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
But at the start of this season he was back in Europe. The Kings signed him 
March 7 as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos hadn't been back from Europe long enough to have a phone installed, so 
the Kings placed a call to his father's house. Then, when they wanted to FAX 
him a contract, the only FAX machine he could find in the small town of Midland 
(near Toronto), was at the local lumber company. Kontos went there, signed the 
contract and had the lumber company FAX it back to the Kings in time to FAX it 
to the NHL offices. 
</P>
<P>
What about getting a hat trick in a key playoff game just a few weeks later? 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," Kontos said. "I really can't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
As the final minutes of the game were ticking away Thursday night and another 
sellout crowd of 16,005 was roaring its approval, King executives were asked: 
"OK, whose idea was it to sign Chris Kontos?" 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Rogie Vachon's hand shot into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"His agent called and said he was available, and we knew what he could do," 
Vachon said. "We signed him because we needed some depth at his position." 
</P>
<P>
Good call. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Kevin Lowe had to admit: "It was one of those nights when things were 
going well for him. He was Johnny-on-the-spot. He should have had a 
high-sticking penalty and he winds up scoring a goal. So, obviously, it was his 
evening." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe was referring to Kontos' first goal, when he had to get his stick high to 
knock down a rebound and he accidentally hit Esa Tikkanen in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Coach Glen Sather said: "If Kontos had been kicked out of the game for 
high-sticking Tikkanen, the game would have changed. It would have nullified 
the goal that was scored -- he did knock down the puck with his stick over his 
shoulders and he knocked Tikkanen out. If that had been called the way it 
should have been, we wouldn't have gotten into the problems we did. But the 
momentum shifted and cost us the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen didn't like it at all when the referee skated over to where he was 
lying on the ice "a little bit out" and told him, "That's a fake. Get up." 
</P>
<P>
The goal stood, Kontos stayed and the Kings are going to Edmonton tied, 1-1, in 
the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos would have been playing Thursday night even if the Kings had a full 
roster. But he played more than usual because John Tonelli, one of the 
strengths of the Kings' team this season, is out with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli probably would have been on the power play with Gretzky, Bernie 
Nicholls, Mike Krushelnyski and Steve Duchesne if he hadn't been in the 
hospital. But Kontos took that spot Thursday night and scored his first goal on 
the power play. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had an assist on that goal, as Kontos gave the Kings a 1-0 lead at 
11:01, beating Fuhr between the pads on his second rebound shot. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-0 lead held up until 7:36 of the second period, when Mark Messier led a 
three-on-two Oiler attack to score from the right wing, with Hrudey getting his 
stick on the shot but deflecting it back into the net. Messier's shot was the 
Oilers' second of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Just 24 seconds later, the Kings took the lead for good on Bernie Nicholls' 
slap shot from the right circle. Kontos' second goal, a shot flipped into the 
top of the net, made it 3-1 at 13:12 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the first game, when the Kings started thinking defense after they 
took the lead at 2:55 of the third period (taking only two shots on goal after 
that), the Kings continued to attack. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky made it 4-1 at 15:52 when he waded through Oiler defenders to take the 
puck at the front of the net and beat Fuhr from point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
Before the period was out, Oiler defenseman Tomas Johnsson made it 4-2 when his 
long, low shot glanced off Duchesne's skate and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings dominated the second period, taking 18 shots to six for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos' third goal, at 1:20 of the third period, gave the Kings a 5-2 lead. 
Fuhr went to the ice to stop a shot by Nicholls, leaving the puck sitting in 
front of the goal. Kontos took a swing at it and missed, then took another 
swing and lifted it over Fuhr's leg for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos is getting his career back on track. It had a pretty good start when he 
was made a first-round draft pick by the New York Rangers six years ago. But it 
took a wrong turn when the Rangers tried to send him down and he was in no mood 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos said: "I made some mistakes, but that was a long time ago. I let my 
pride get in the way. I've matured since then. That kind of stuff is all behind 
me now." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey said of Kontos: "He was tremendous. Some of the things he did were 
uplifting for all the guys. He stuck with the puck, took some hits. It proves 
that he's a capable player, which we already knew." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Smythe Division semifinal playoff series between the Kings and the Oilers 
moves to Edmonton for games Saturday and Sunday nights. . . . Kelly Hrudey, who 
missed the opener because of the flu, played the entire game Thursday night 
while Glenn Healy stood by on the bench. Hrudey had to stand in for Healy when 
Healy had the flu last Sunday. Neither is 100%. Healy reportedly lost 14 pounds 
during the game Wednesday. Asked how much weight he lost Thursday, Hrudey said: 
"I don't know, but I'm in no danger of becoming anorexic.". . . Chris Kontos 
has given the Kings 1-0 leads against Edmonton in both playoff games. . . . 
Hrudey is 6-0-1 at the Forum, 11-4-2 overall with the Kings . . . The Kings had 
twice as many shots on goal as the Oilers Thursday, 44-22. . . . The Kings' 
Doug Crossman, who has been scratched from the last several games, is bothered 
by a shoulder injury.

TREVINO RIPS AUGUSTA COURSE AGAIN -- THIS TIME WITH HIS CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guess who's coming to dinner? 
</P>
<P>
Why it's Lee Trevino, who smiled as he walked into the interview room Thursday 
at the Masters golf tournament and said: "I'm the last guy you expected to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who has been frustrated here for 20 years and has ripped the Augusta 
National course as not suited for his game, was on the top of that game in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a 67, five under par, and was all alone at the top of the leader board, 
a strange place for him here. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, 49, who has never finished higher than a tie for 10th in the Masters, 
in 1975 and again in 1985, said that he had gone into the tournament with a 
notion that he would play a good round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Tom Watson on the practice range that I wanted to come back here next 
year," Trevino said. "I said I was going to finish in the top 24 (guaranteeing 
his return) because this was my last exemption year for the Masters." 
</P>
<P>
He is well on his way to that goal and it was a wisecracking, talkative Trevino 
who bantered with reporters -- not the Trevino who on several occasions vowed 
he would never play here again. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino had five birdies in his round and one-putted the first five holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it under difficult conditions with the wind blowing," said Trevino of 
his round of 32-35. "If I got anything out of this round it proves to me there 
is still a spark in the fireplace. All I have to do is throw the right wood on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who has limited his participation on the PGA Tour the last eight years 
because of television commitments and a sore back, will become eligible for the 
seniors tour when he turns 50 Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his 67 on a course that has rebuffed him has provided him with 
"tremendous confidence" for the seniors tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go next week (on the seniors tour) if they'll let me," he said, adding, 
"If I find my birth certificate I'll be 50 already." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Trevino is the oldest first-day leader in the history of the 
prestigious tournament. That distinction had belonged to one Emmett French, who 
was 47 when he shared the first-round lead in the first Masters in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
However, French didn't finish among the top 24 that year. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino was closely pursued by Britain's Nick Faldo, who shot a 68. Scott Hoch 
held third with a 69. Don Pooley and Andy Bean were three strokes behind, each 
with 70. 
</P>
<P>
Five players -- Tom Purtzer, T. C. Chen, Ben Crenshaw, Seve Ballesteros and 
Jumbo Ozaki -- were grouped at 71. 
</P>
<P>
An upbeat Trevino was asked whether he was emotional about his accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an emotional individual," he said. "When it comes to my family, yes, 
but to golf, no. I'm just looking for a beer." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said he hadn't played a full practice round here in preparation for the 
tournament. "But I hit about 2,000 balls on the practice range," he said. "I 
didn't try to overpower the course today and that was the secret for me. I 
placed the ball in spots I've never been before." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino played in the Independent Insurance Agent Open last week at Houston, 
where he finished in a tie for 61st. Before that, he hadn't played in a 
tournament in six months. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he had not been mentally prepared for Augusta in the past. He 
did shoot a 68 in the first round in 1984, and in 1978, he shared the 36-hole 
lead with Rod Funseth at 139. However, he faded from contention. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, it wasn't my swing that got me through today, it was my mental 
attitude," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino has won each of the other major tournaments -- the U.S. Open, British 
Open and PGA Championship -- twice. But the Masters title and the green jacket 
that goes with it have eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has won only one major tournament, the 1984 PGA, in the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said his putting was a key factor Thursday. He got two of his five 
birdies on putts of 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking the putter too far back and I was de-accelerating," he said. "I 
saw an old picture of myself where I was keeping my right elbow close to my 
body. And Seve (Ballesteros) told me that I was taking the putter too far 
back." 
</P>
<P>
However, regardless of the refinements in his putting, he seemed to have a 
mental block about the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
He is a left to right, relatively low hitter on a course that supposedly favors 
high, right to left shots by players who are longer off than tee than he. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack (Nicklaus) has always told me that I could play this course," Trevino 
said. "I told him I'd play him for a $1,000 Nassau if he played my tee ball and 
I played his. He didn't say another word." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who shot a one-over-par 73, said the Augusta National course has 
psyched out Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps saying, 'I can't play here' and I said, 'Yes, you can. You can play 
anywhere. You can hit the ball right to left just as easily as you do left to 
right. You hit the ball up in the air as easily as you do down. There's no 
reason in the world you can't play that course.' 
</P>
<P>
"He has it in his own mind. I'd like to win, but it would be fabulous to see 
him play well." 
</P>
<P>
Said Watson, who shot a 72: "We're good friends and I'm pulling for him. 
(Trevino) can play anywhere. His attitude here has hurt him and he'd be the 
first to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the great players ever to play the game and all he needs is the 
Masters to complete the Grand Slam." 
</P>
<P>
Watson added that since the wind was a factor, the longer hitters had to lay up 
on the par-five holes, evening the odds for shorter hitters such as Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, the tour's leading money winner, who shot a 72, said he's only 
surprised that Trevino hasn't won the Masters previously. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think there are similarities between my game and his," Kite 
said. "We both hit a lot of fairways and greens. But he probably moves the ball 
more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino carded four of his five birdies on the front nine of a course that the 
players said was in excellent condition and the greens, as usual, lightning 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
He made perhaps his most spectacular shot on the par-four, 405-yard 18th hole, 
where his second shot went into the scorers' tent. He got a drop outside of it 
and his chip shot hit the flag stick. So he saved par on the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said that if his chip shot hadn't hit the stick, he could have easily 
wound up with a bogey, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any regrets about knocking the Masters course in other years, 
Trevino smiled and said: "I always regret what I say. Anyone who talks as much 
as I do has to say something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gay Brewer, who won the Masters in 1967, was hospitalized after his round with 
a heart rhythm problem. He is under observation at University Hospital here. 
Brewer and Bob Goalby withdrew from the tournament. . . . Sandy Lyle, the 
defending champion, shot a 77. Some other favorites also faltered. Mark 
Calcavecchia, Greg Norman, Curtis Strange and Craig Stadler, the 1982 Masters 
winner, each shot 74. Strange made a triple bogey on the par-three, 155-yard 
12th hole at Amen Corner. . . . Jack Nicklaus said of his round of 73: "I was a 
little tentative at first because I didn't know how hard I was going to be able 
to hit it." Nicklaus suffered a back spasm last Friday. He had three bogeys on 
the front nine, but recovered for three birdies and a bogey on the back nine. . 
. . Eric Meeks, the U.S. Amateur champion from Walnut, shot an 83.

Jim Booros shot a six-under-par 64 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the 
first round of the $200,000 PGA Deposit Guaranty golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Booros, 37, finished with six birdies and a dozen pars over the 6,280-yard 
Hattiesburg Country Club Course for a one-shot edge over Robert Thompson, Rocco 
Mediate, and Barry Cheesman. 
</P>
<P>
Booros, who was using a new putter, said the key to his round was the ninth 
hole, where he put his tee shot into the woods but scrambled to save par. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth hole also made the difference for Mediate. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two good shots there that really turned me around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mediate had one more birdie than Booros, but also had a pair of bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogrin, the 1987 winner, was in a group of six at 67. Defending champion 
Frank Conner shot a 73.

MIKE DOWNEY: LIKE IT OR NOT, LEE TREVINO IS MASTER OF THE MASTERS FOR A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You were expecting maybe Arnold Palmer? 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino! Gimme a break (left to right). On second thought, gimme a gimme. 
Make my day. 
</P>
<P>
This is as goofy as golf gets. I mean, Lee Trevino leading the Masters! That's 
like Leon Spinks leading the Daytona 500. The man often feels he doesn't belong 
here. The man often says he doesn't want to be here. Lee Trevino's opinion of 
playing golf at Augusta National is something approximating Brigitte Bardot's 
opinion of killing seals to make fur coats. 
</P>
<P>
So, when I see Lee Trevino, eight months from his 50th birthday, shooting a 
first-day 67 at the Masters, stop the tournament, I want to get off. Jack 
Nicklaus was enough. Larry Mize was more than enough. Trevino wins this thing, 
anything goes. Next year's will be won by Dow Finsterwald. Elvis will carry his 
bag. Roberto de Vicenzo will keep score. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, come on. Trevino, five under? You're pulling my flag. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, who has raked in $1,680 in winnings this year? Lee Trevino, who 
shot 81 and 83 last year here? Lee Trevino, who in 1969 and 1986 and 1988 asked 
them never to invite him back here? Lee Trevino, who hasn't won anything in 
five years and has never placed higher than 10th here? 
</P>
<P>
That Lee Trevino? 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, who loathes this club so much that he changes his shoes in the 
parking lot? Lee Trevino, who in 1974 decided to go fishing rather than play 
here? Lee Trevino, who in 1987 claimed this tournament wasn't even one of the 
four majors? 
</P>
<P>
That Lee Trevino? 
</P>
<P>
Si, that Lee Trevino, the testy, zesty Tex-Mex, who changes his mind the way 
other golfers change tees. This same Trevino once called his 1970, '71 and '74 
boycotts of the Masters "the greatest mistake I've made in my career." This 
same Trevino once called Augusta National "the eighth wonder of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino is one of those people who not only talks a good game, he talks a 
bad game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk as much as I do, you're gonna put a shoe in there once in a 
while," he said Thursday. "If you never say anything, you never say anything 
bad. But, hey. You never say anything good, either." 
</P>
<P>
The guy gets up and down in regulation. One year he's up. Next year he's down. 
</P>
<P>
On happy occasions like this one, nobody is more self-deprecating. Trevino 
teases himself about becoming a bogeying old fogy who has to wear his 
eyeglasses on a strap around his neck so he won't misplace them, an 
absent-minded professional who can't even find his own house. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone to old addresses before," Trevino said. "Forgot that I moved." 
</P>
<P>
As for his golf, it had gotten to be so god-awful, Trevino confessed, that he 
would have given anything on the eve of this Masters merely to be able to hit 
three practice shots exactly the same, make the same swing three times in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"A man walked up to me and said, 'I'll bet you won't break 76,' and I wouldn't 
take one quarter of it," Trevino said. "And I'm a gamblin' man." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, he rated his chances of winning the Masters somewhere between Not 
Very Likely and That'll Be the Day. He didn't even try a practice round, 
figuring they would just go out and change the layout on him later that night. 
Just when you get used to slow greens on Wednesday afternoons, Trevino said, 
you show up on Thursday mornings to find that "they'd put STP on those things." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Jack Nicklaus tried to convince him that he could win this thing, 
Trevino scoffed. "If Jack had had to play my itty-bitty tee shots," Lee said, 
"he'd have quit golf and opened a pharmacy in Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, Trevino's nimble mind could never conquer this matter. He gave 
up on the Masters early, even though on his first visit, 21 years ago, he was 
tied atop the leader board with nine holes to play. A year later, he already 
was saying: "I'll never go play there again. They can invite me all they want, 
but I'm not going back." 
</P>
<P>
The course never suited him, nor did the snobby club itself. Had he not 
qualified as a player, Trevino once complained, they would not have let him 
onto the grounds except through the kitchen. In 1972, after boycotting twice, 
he stored his shoes and gear in the trunk of his car, rather than use the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament boss Clifford Roberts sent an invitation to have coffee. "I don't 
drink coffee," Trevino messaged back. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, after officials had demanded $90 for credentials for the 
golfer's son, Trevino told the new chairman he would play Augusta no more. 
</P>
<P>
Hord Hardin replied: "We'll miss you, but we'll try to go on without you." 
</P>
<P>
Such a love-hate relationship this has become. Uphill, downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Trevino claims nothing would please him more than to return regularly. 
Since his five-year Masters exemption from winning the 1984 PGA is about to 
expire, Trevino needs to place among the top 24 Sunday to guarantee his 
continued presence. On whimsy more than evidence, he bet Tom Watson he would do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
This is the one he has never won. Each of the other majors, Trevino has won at 
least twice. He figures maybe this is his year, what with a new baby daughter, 
his aching back finally feeling OK, a 22-pound weight drop, and his exemption 
at stake. Also, this year's U.S. Open will be played at Oak Hill, where Trevino 
took the 1968 Open, his first major. 
</P>
<P>
He is loose. 
</P>
<P>
"I may come back with three 80s, I don't know. And it won't bother me a bit if 
I do." 
</P>
<P>
He is tight. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm leading Saturday night, I might not even show up Sunday, man. I might 
have a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
He is sane. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bounce in my step there hasn't been before. I'm a happy man." 
</P>
<P>
He is nuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to the tee markers. I'm out of it, man." 
</P>
<P>
He loves it here. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a lot, this tournament. It means everything to me." 
</P>
<P>
He hates it here. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed (shoes) in my van. I don't have a trunk anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask me, what Lee Trevino would like to do most at Augusta is play great, 
but not replace any of his divots.

CLIPPERS, CASEY WIN BATTLE OF INTERIM COACHES; 
</P>
<P>
A FAST START HELPS L.A. TURN BACK ADELMAN AND HIS TRAIL BLAZERS, 133-123 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were hot seats all over Thursday, and not just outside under the sun. Two 
were inside the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Battle of the Interims, after all. Don Casey of the Clippers and 
Rick Adelman of the Portland Trail Blazers, both officially temporary coaches 
hoping, often struggling, to land permanent spots when the season ends in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what each other is going through," Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Especially after the game. The Clippers, the third-losingest team in the 
National Basketball Assn., beat Portland, 133-123, for their first victory over 
the Trail Blazers in five tries this season, with a meeting next Tuesday in 
Oregon still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the seventh loss in nine games for the Trail Blazers, while the 
Clippers have won seven of their last 13. 
</P>
<P>
As for the coaches: Adelman is 9-17 since replacing the fired Mike Schuler Feb. 
18. Casey is 8-27 since Gene Shue was dismissed Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Adelman, a graduate of Pius X High School in Downey, came to the 
Sports Arena, about 20 family members and friends were on hand for support. 
That was March 2, and the Trail Blazers beat the Clippers, 119-113. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different," he said of his role as head coach. "When you're a player, it 
is a lot harder because people want to see you. Being an assistant, it's not 
that big of a deal. But when you then become a head coach, it's like when you 
were a player again. The last time being here was like a happening for our 
family." 
</P>
<P>
One family happening Adelman would like to avoid is having to move from 
Portland. The Trail Blazers, while going through a tough road schedule and 
injuries, have responded to him, especially after the heavy-handed Schuler, he 
of the Thanksgiving Day practice. 
</P>
<P>
With all the problems, Portland still has a good chance to make the playoffs 
and a probable first-round matchup against the Lakers. The Trail Blazers 
(34-39) hold a one-game lead over Dallas for the eighth and final berth in the 
Western Conference. That, among other reasons, makes the 42-year-old Adelman 
think he deserves a shot at the job permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I do," he said. "I've spent 5 1/2 years as an assistant here and 
tried to do everything the head man asked. I took over the situation knowing it 
would be tough, but I'd love the chance to start fresh next season and see what 
I can do with the team from the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you always think about the interim status. I'm living in Portland with 
my wife and four kids and we would like to stay there. I try not to worry too 
much about it, even if I do think about it, because it can consume you if you 
let it. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been difficult, but not any tougher than I expected. This is my sixth 
year with the organization, so I knew what was going on. I sort of anticipated 
what could happen. It has, in a lot of ways, been more frustrating than 
difficult, because, despite the record since I've taken over, we haven't been 
playing real bad. But we just did not win all the games." 
</P>
<P>
They certainly didn't Thursday night, when the Clippers made 12 of 15 shots in 
the first quarter to take a 31-26 advantage and then pushed the lead to 17 with 
8:47 left in the first half, 44-27. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (18-55) shot an impressive 61.9% in the first two quarters and 
finished the game at 63%. It's their highest mark of the season, and the 133 
points are also their most in a regular game in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman scored a team-high 34 points for the Clippers, while Benoit Benjamin 
added 29 points and 11 rebounds. Portland's Clyde Drexler led all scorers with 
36 points. 
</P>
<P>
In beating the Trail Blazers for the first time since Feb. 13, 1986, a span of 
18 games, the Clippers made their final 12 free throws of the game and 13 of 14 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a plus whoever we beat," said Gary Grant, who had a career-high 20 
assists to go with 17 points. "We've got that spiritual thing no matter who we 
beat because it shows we can win. It feels good inside." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's sellout crowd of 15,352 pushed the Clippers' attendance to 
388,260 for the season, breaking the team's previous Los Angeles record of 
384,119 set in 1984-85, their first after moving north from San Diego. Thursday 
night's crowd of 9,636 made it 397,896, an average of 11,053 a game, with five 
home games remaining. Phoenix is in Saturday. . . . Quintin Dailey did not 
dress after undergoing dental surgery earlier in the day. . . . Joe Wolf, out 
the last three games with strained ligaments in his right elbow, has his arm 
out of a sling ahead of schedule but remains day to day. . . . Tests to 
determine if Charles Smith needs arthroscopic surgery on his left knee have 
been delayed until sometime next week. . . . The assists-to-turnover ratio for 
Gary Grant in the last six games: 20-3, 10-7, 17-2, 5-6, 14-3, 17-5. . . . This 
was the Clippers' 200th game in Los Angeles since moving from San Diego.

A longtime friend and adviser of Ben Johnson in Toronto said that the sprinter 
was capable of handling most of his own business affairs without assistance, 
countering suggestions by Johnson's attorney that the sprinter did not have the 
intelligence to know whether he was using anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Earl, president of the track and field club of which Johnson was a member 
for 12 years, told the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug 
use by athletes that Johnson chose his own architect for the house he was 
having built outside Toronto, negotiated mortgage agreements and dealt with a 
real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the hearings, Johnson's attorney, Ed Futerman, suggested that 
Johnson was a slow-witted and uneducated young man who was duped into taking 
steroids by his coach, Charlie Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, a former Canadian sprinter, Cheryl Thibedeau, disputed testimony 
by her former boyfriend, sprinter and bobsledder Andrew Mowatt, that he was not 
aware he was injected with steroids by Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who also treated 
Johnson and other Canadian athletes. Thibedeau said, "He knew what he was 
getting."

Jerry Jones, new majority owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has given Coach Jimmy 
Johnson a 10-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Jones made the announcement to potential advertisers for Dallas' KRLD, the 
Cowboys' flagship radio station. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year contract is not without precedent. The late Clint Murchison, 
original owner of the Cowboys, gave Tom Landry such a contract in the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys announced the length of Johnson's contract at their Valley Ranch 
headquarters.

Jones had said in late February that he would not release details of the 
contract of his former Arkansas football teammate.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE-BASED TAGEL, NOT HOUSTON, IS REAL DERBY MYSTERY HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Houston has been called the mystery horse, and Santa Anita is billing 
Saturday's Santa Anita Derby as the mystery race, but the real mystery among 
the candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby is a 3-year-old colt who is in 
training more than 4,000 miles away from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel is his name, and although the France-based, Kentucky-bred horse has yet 
to race this year, a consensus of future books in Las Vegas lists him as a 
respectable 12-1 to win the Kentucky Derby, which will be run four weeks from 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The trend this year is for many horses to go into the Derby lightly raced, but 
Tagel's campaign borders on the non-existent. He will run only once, in a mile 
race on the grass at Longchamps in Paris on April 16. If he does well, trainer 
Francois Boutin will wait until the first week of May to ship him to the United 
States, just a few days before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The race later this month will be only Tagel's fourth start but he's already 
familiar with Churchill Downs. Last November, in his only race on dirt, Tagel 
lost for the first time, running third behind Is It True and Easy Goer, in the 
1 1/16-mile Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel broke slowly and was beaten by 9 1/4 lengths, but he still ran better 
than seven other 2-year-olds used to racing on dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Boutin, who has been exposing Tagel to a dirt training track in France, is 
known for shipping horses to America and having them win right off the plane. 
He won the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes twice that way with the brilliant filly 
Miesque and he won the Turf Classic with April Run twice in New York, each time 
just a few weeks after she ran in the Arc de Triomphe at Longchamps. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel's Kentucky Derby prep race is the same one that Blushing John won a year 
ago. Blushing John, owned by Allen Paulson, as is Tagel, won the Razorback 
Handicap at Oaklawn Park last month. 
</P>
<P>
The real mystery in the 52nd Santa Anita Derby is why Mr. Bolg will run and try 
to beat undefeated Houston, Sunday Silence and three other horses -- Hawkster, 
Music Merci and Flying Continental -- who have won stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg has early speed -- he ran a half-mile in 44 seconds at Santa Anita in 
January -- but he has never run beyond seven furlongs and his only two 
victories in eight starts have been in races restricted to California-breds. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg is a son of Bolger, who is a speed sire. His dam, Brew Mistress, won 
at 1 1/4 miles and there are other indications of stamina on the female side of 
Mr. Bolg's bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
"He won that last race (at seven furlongs by five lengths in 1:22 3/5 on March 
10) very impressively," said Yves Seguin, who trains Mr. Bolg. "In the race 
before that (the Bolsa Chica Stakes), he was a close fourth despite a rough 
trip. He has been training specifically for Saturday since his last start." 
</P>
<P>
The longest-priced winner of the Santa Anita Derby was Destroyer, who paid 
$89.80 when he upset Agitate in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Win, the horse who finished second to Zoffany in the Hollywood Turf 
Cup in December 1985? 
</P>
<P>
Tendon problems have kept the 9-year-old gelding away from the races ever 
since, but Win has popped up in the entries at Aqueduct and will run in a 
seven-furlong race there today. 
</P>
<P>
Win actually injured his tendon twice, the second time in a comeback attempt 
nine months after the Hollywood Park race. He underwent surgery last year and 
returned to training in October. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Win would have won the male grass title, but Cozzene won the Breeders' 
Cup Mile at Aqueduct at the end of the year and beat him out in a close vote. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been doing great since the surgery," said Sally Bailie, Win's trainer. 
"We've never looked back." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bramlage, the veterinarian from Ohio State who performed the surgery on 
Win, may want to move on to Kerosene, the highly regarded 3-year-old whose 
racing career was ended by a tendon injury in Florida this week. 
</P>
<P>
Kerosene, who had two wins and two seconds in four starts, would have been one 
of the favorites at Hialeah Saturday in the Flamingo, which, along with the 
Santa Anita Derby, is one of four remaining major preps for the Kentucky Derby. 
The others are the Blue Grass at Keeneland on April 15 and the Wood Memorial at 
Aqueduct on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
With Kerosene out of the Flamingo, the 9-5 favorite in a nine-horse field is 
Awe Inspiring, trained by Shug McGaughey. McGaughey will be at Aqueduct 
Saturday, to saddle Easy Goer, the future-book favorite for the Kentucky Derby, 
in the Gotham Mile. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is a 1-2 favorite in a field of four. Trainer Wayne Lukas, who is 
starting Texian, says openly that he's running for second-place money. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela was examined by a Santa Anita track doctor Monday and 
given permission to resume riding this week by the stewards. Valenzuela, who is 
ranked among the nation's top 10 riders with $1.5 million in purses, rode three 
winners Wednesday his first day back. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, for the second time in recent weeks, Valenzuela canceled his 
mounts because of illness. Laffit Pincay, who replaced him on Ruhlmann, won the 
San Bernardino Handicap. Valenzuela is scheduled to ride Sunday Silence in the 
Santa Anita Derby Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his history of drug problems, any absence by Valenzuela causes 
suspicion. The stewards ordered Valenzuela to be tested for drugs this week. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Joe Manzi, who has taken a course on cardiac-pulmonary resuscitation, 
put it to use last week on Bruce Ferguson, a horse owner who collapsed at Santa 
Anita. Manzi had left the winner's circle after a win by his 3-year-old filly, 
Formidable Lady, and was on his way back to watch a television rerun when he 
noticed a commotion. "The man was gasping for air and his eyes were going back 
in his head," Manzi said. "Everybody was running around and didn't know what to 
do. I kept pressing on his heart and pretty soon he started breathing and his 
color came back. Then they took him on a stretcher to an ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
It was incorrectly written here that Jerry Moss, who owns Ruhlmann, had also 
switched from trainer Bobby Frankel to Charlie Whittingham with the 
stakes-winning Pay the Butler. Pay the Butler isn't owned by Moss, and Frankel 
continues to train the horse. . . . Chris McCarron, back in action after a 
five-day suspension, will ride Pranke in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap April 
23. . . . Walter Guerra, who has been riding for five years in Florida, returns 
to Santa Anita next week. . . . Tenacious Tom, who wasn't nominated for the 
Triple Crown races, is the only 3-year-old colt with two stakes wins at the 
Santa Anita meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers were surprised that John Brunetti, the owner of Hialeah, made a 
strong showing in battling the incumbent Del Mar Thoroughbred Club for the 
20-year renewal to conduct racing at the seaside track. Brunetti received two 
of the six votes from the State Race Track Leasing Commission. Apparently, 
though, the votes were cast by commissioners who were not necessarily in favor 
of Brunetti, but who were generally opposed to the Thoroughbred Club, which has 
operated Del Mar since 1970.

AQUATIC ATTRACTION; 
</P>
<P>
POETS, PRAGMATISTS AND SCHOLARS PONDER THE INEXPLICABLE APPEAL OF BEING NEAR 
WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Tom Rusk, a San Diego psychiatrist and author of self-help books, has never 
met Billy Al Bengston, the acclaimed Venice painter whose work is identified 
with the "L.A. Look" or "Cool School" that established Los Angeles as a major 
art center in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But Rusk, a clinical associate professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who 
deals in the logic of science, and Bengston, a motorcycle aficionado and 
renounced surfer whose major frame of reference is presumably visual and 
unstructured, both find themselves drawn to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In describing this aspect of their personalities, the psychiatrist and the 
artist speak different languages. But they are talking about the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
From somewhere within the psyches of Bengston, Rusk and an undetermined -- but, 
some researchers agree, very large -- number of other people emanates a need to 
live near water. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between an attraction and a compulsion, the feeling of being drawn to 
water has been noted by observers of the human condition down through the ages. 
Surprisingly, the phenomenon seems not to have inspired so much as a shred of 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a problem with all of these assumptions, Rusk conceded, is that there 
has never been a research study that explored the attraction -- primal or not 
-- of water or bodies of water to the human psyche. Neither a database search 
of the literature of mental health research, conducted by Claremont Graduate 
School psychology professor Robert Gable, nor three such searches conducted by 
The Times could find evidence of any study ever appearing in a scientific 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
"The most ignored area of human psychology is the study of human feelings," 
Rusk said. "It is so ignored that the bastions of science in our country almost 
totally ignore the study of feelings. So feelings are left to psychoanalytic 
theory, which everyone decries as non-scientific -- and I'm not arguing to the 
contrary. Science doesn't tend to study things having to do with feelings 
because feelings are, by definition, subjective." 
</P>
<P>
To get at the innate feelings humans have about water, he concludes, "you're 
going to have a lot more interesting and edifying conversations with poets than 
you're going to have with scientists." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of hard data, then, there is disagreement over whether oceans 
alone fill this need. Many observers believe that other large bodies of water, 
like the Great Lakes, and even major rivers suffice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Evolutionary Throwback? 
</P>
<P>
There are other disagreements. One of them is over whether this is a primal 
attraction somehow organically imprinted in people -- perhaps a throwback to 
the evolutionary origins of human beings as water creatures or even, in a more 
Freudian sense, a latent effect of being snugly afloat in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
Observers who agree that many humans share an inner need to be near water, but 
who don't accept such primal explanations, suggest that it is an acquired 
taste, motivated by economic and other pragmatic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Graham, manager of two Jon Douglas Co. realty offices in Malibu, for 
instance, said that in the economic climate there, the price of property more 
than doubles on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway compared to the inland 
exposure yards away. But whether this is because of the primal draw of the 
water, or the urge to cash in on it, is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
To Bengston, 54, the first clues to his own primal attraction to the sea came 
when he was 15 and his parents decided to leave the home of Bengston's birth in 
Dodge City, Kan., and head west. They didn't stop until they got to California. 
The son they raised says now that he cannot imagine ever existing more than a 
short distance from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting of Land and Sea 
</P>
<P>
The ocean has been a consistent subject in Bengston's work for 20 years. 
Starting in about 1970, he began treating underwater subjects after he became 
fascinated by skin diving. Beginning in 1974, he turned his attention to the 
surface and, specifically, to the meeting of land, sea and air -- an artistic 
direction that appears to emanate from preoccupation with what Rusk calls 
interfaces. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Hawaii, where Bengston maintains a second 
residence, the artist reflected on the necessity he feels to live near the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I've always thought about it is of the ocean being a terminal 
situation," he said. "You go as far as you can go on land and the ocean is the 
end of it, a stopping point . . . usually with a clear vista. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something that's comforting about it. I have been inland on various 
occasions. I never feel very comfortable. Palm Springs gives me the hives. I 
like the desert, but I never feel comfortable with that unless (the desert) is 
right up against the ocean, like in Baja California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Expert's Theory 
</P>
<P>
Bengston isn't familiar with psychiatric jargon. But, to Rusk, Bengston's words 
perfectly illustrate the psychiatrist's basic explanation of why the ocean in 
particular, and large bodies of water in general, seem inwardly important. His 
theory is that human life at many levels, starting at the edges of a single 
cell, focuses on what Rusk calls "interfaces" -- places where one key element 
butts up against another. 
</P>
<P>
He concedes the terminology borrows from contemporary computerspeak, but he 
says the word makes its own point. "You can look at it sort of in a cosmic or 
even a biological sense," said Rusk, "that everything that's important occurs 
at interfaces -- the interface between two entities or things that we have in 
our mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the center of the sun that is most critical, it is what happens (in 
the sun) at its outer edges. (The same is true of) the surfaces of cells." 
</P>
<P>
Rusk thinks mountaintops are interfaces, too, but he contends that the 
interface of land with water has a quintessentially primal attraction. This may 
be, he said, for more Freudian reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Fundamental Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"Next to air, water is the most fundamental thing we need," he said. "Think 
about flotation tanks and what that feels like. There is something very primal 
about that particular experience that is tremendously powerful. It touches on 
our memories of being suspended in water -- or, more accurately, amniotic 
fluid." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is something extremely basic, or primitive, about water (the 
understanding of which) doesn't require you to be scientific. 
</P>
<P>
"Overlaying all that, there are very few people who can look at a magnificent 
sunset over the sea and not be moved. There is something universally moving 
about those vistas." 
</P>
<P>
To Edward Krupat, a visiting lecturer in psychology at Boston University, the 
interface concept makes a great deal of sense. "The manifest destiny was to get 
not to California, but to the ocean," he said. "It served as fulfillment. I 
think the issue of interfaces is inherently there. The end of land and the 
beginning of water are a port. It is an entry and an exit." 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of people who explore, sighting land is the form of 
discovery or the end of a voyage. So I guess reaching water and reaching land 
can be major landmarks in some actual or symbolic form of journey." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Poet's View 
</P>
<P>
One poet who has pondered the need to inhabit the shoreline is Charles Wright, 
a widely published practitioner of his craft who teaches at the University of 
Virginia in Charlottesville. But for 17 years Wright lived in Laguna Beach, 
while he was on the faculty at UC Irvine. While the sea and its influence 
cannot be said to permeate his work, the ocean's voice is clearly heard in 
poems like "Laguna Blues" and "Laguna Dantesca," both of which are contained in 
an anthology first published in 1977 and titled "Southern Cross." 
</P>
<P>
"I moved to the sea because I got the job at Irvine, to be honest," said 
Wright. "But once I got there, I had that attraction for the sea. That's what I 
liked best about Laguna. I never once went into the ocean but I think there was 
something primal about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am attracted to large bodies of water. I was born on a lake (in Tennessee). 
I never really got to the big stuff until I went to Monterey, Calif., in the 
Army (for language school). 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I kept somehow wanting to go back toward it since I came out of it. I 
don't know. It was rather comforting to think that it was there. I liked to 
look at it. I liked the wind off of it. I didn't like the people around it. 
That's one of the problems about Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Historical Perspective 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Brian Fagan, a UC Santa Barbara anthropologist who is also 
an experienced sailor, believes that the practical role played by bodies of 
water in human civilization may have more to do with why people gravitated 
there than more subjective considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"Archeologically, there was evidence of people fishing and living by the ocean 
in Africa at least 115,000 years ago," he said. "That's a long time ago. Water 
has been an element in human life for that long. Humans have tended to live in 
places where there have been abundant and predictable resources, like fish. The 
very rich marine environment has always attracted human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Fagan believes this historical record of human behavior explains the sense of 
rapture for the sea. It's a sense he shares. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't envisage not living by the sea," he said. "I like to smell it and 
see it and sail on it. I lived for a while in Africa 600 miles from the nearest 
ocean. It drove me crazy. I feel a very strong pull. I think this pull is very 
common among human beings. (But) I think it's an adaptive mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Womb With a View 
</P>
<P>
Alan Dundes, a professor of anthropology and folklore at UC Berkeley, said a 
host of explanations may be appropriate for water love. 
</P>
<P>
"One theory along Freudian lines is that bodies of water are female," he said. 
"We are all born from a flood of fluid. There is the security of being drawn 
back to the womb and the womb includes water." 
</P>
<P>
The subject has, off and on, occupied the mind of Roger Revelle, a professor of 
science and public policy at UC San Diego and director emeritus of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. Revelle said a whole complex of pragmatic 
characteristics -- the ocean's tendency to produce more equitable temperature 
ranges than inland areas, primarily -- and softer, more aesthetic 
considerations explain the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an object of beauty that people never tire of looking at," Revelle said. 
"One reason is that it's always changing. Summerset Maugham pointed out that 
you can't look at a beautiful object for more than a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can look at the ocean almost indefinitely because it isn't always the 
same. The atmosphere over the sea and the froth on the surface are always 
different. It's an object of beauty that is not tiring." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, some scientists throw cold water on the concept. Claremont's Gable 
is one of them. For two years, Gable lived in Malibu, in prime real estate 
between Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of liberated, the situation made Gable feel hemmed in. "I was trapped 
between the waves and the stream of traffic," he said. "I felt I was in a 
prison. It was a beautiful prison, but it was house arrest."

coordinator, says: "We want to deliver a message to all three branches of 
government that ain't nobody gonna get away with making abortion illegal 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, which follows a series of increasingly militant protests by 
anti-abortion forces, represents an escalation of political warfare as both 
sides try to influence the Supreme Court's pending review of its 1973 Roe vs. 
Wade decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the intensity of the struggle, an anti-abortion group got a jump on 
the planned abortion rights event by setting up a symbolic cemetery Wednesday 
on the Washington Mall, within view of Sunday's rally site on the Capitol 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen, president of the American Coalition for Life, said that 4,400 white 
wooden crosses planted in the "Cemetery of the Innocents" represent "one day's 
abortion death toll in America." After speeches by Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) and other congressmen, the group began a prayer vigil 
projected to continue through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women is sponsoring Sunday's demonstration, with 
the endorsement of more than 470 national groups, "to show that we who support 
keeping abortion safe and legal are the overwhelming majority," according to an 
advertising flyer. 
</P>
<P>
"People are coming here to say with their feet and their voices that if the 
court tries to overturn Roe vs. Wade," O'Dell said, "they're going to invite 
massive civil disobedience and open defiance of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, acknowledged that advocates of giving women a choice between abortion 
and delivery have been slow to respond to the aggressiveness of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she said, Sunday's demonstration is but the first of many planned 
over the next several months "to give the pro-choice majority the ability to 
stand up and refuse to be bullied and silent any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Among the hordes streaming into Washington this weekend will be 36 members of 
the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, an organization of "the 
entertainment industry's most powerful women celebrities and executives," 
according to a press release. 
</P>
<P>
Actresses Glenn Close, Susan Sarandon, Kelly McGillis, Cybill Shepherd and 
others will appear at a news conference Saturday with top leaders of the 
abortion rights community, including NARAL's Michelman, NOW President Molly 
Yard, Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton and Voters for Choice board 
member Gloria Steinem. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the Hollywood delegation will be well represented at a NARAL 
benefit featuring performances by singers Judy Collins and Melissa Manchester, 
a reading by novelist Alice Walker, and what Michelman called "an uplifting, 
powerhouse film in celebration of women and the reproductive rights movement." 
</P>
<P>
Among others expected to join the delegation are Polly Bergen, Morgan 
Fairchild, Whoopi Goldberg, Valerie Harper, Leonard Nimoy, Phil Donahue, Marlo 
Thomas and folk-singers Peter, Paul and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
So many people are headed for the capital this weekend -- the annual Cherry 
Blossom Festival also will be in swing -- that all hotels are sold out and 
numerous churches and private homes are being pressed into service. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got over 1,500 buses coming from as far away as Washington state," NOW's 
Sue Mottinger said. "We've got chartered planes because the regular airlines 
are filled. A train from Atlanta is picking up people along the way. About 350 
colleges are sending formal delegations. We have delegations from France, West 
Germany, Canada, Japan, Iceland and Norway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Braced for Violence 
</P>
<P>
Police forces of the District of Columbia, the National Park Service and 
Congress said they are prepared for possible violent confrontations Sunday. But 
an official of Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group that has 
tried to shut down abortion clinics in Los Angeles, Washington and other 
cities, said that no disruptions ("rescues") are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be holding some signs along the parade route and we'll go out to the 
cemetery (on the Mall) for a memorial service Sunday. But we are not having any 
rescue in the D.C. area," said Jim Backlin, the group's director of 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the National Right to Life Committee is "not planning any type of 
counter-activity," said spokesman Leonard Dinegar. "We had our annual march in 
January," a reference to the 16th annual March for Life on Jan. 23, which drew 
more than 65,000 participants. 
</P>
<P>
During that demonstration, President Bush assailed abortion as a "tragedy" and 
called for reversal of Roe vs. Wade. The Supreme Court, with its new 
conservative majority, will hear oral arguments April 26 on a Missouri case 
that could be used to roll back the landmark decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Many abortion rights activists plan to stay past Sunday and lobby members of 
Congress on the stalled equal rights amendment and other women's issues. Among 
other things, they seek to liberalize the nearly total ban on federal funding 
of abortions for poor women and to restore cuts in family planning aid to 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt they'll influence the court, but they could have some impact on 
Congress," said a source close to Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), author of the 
amendment that bans federal abortion aid except in cases where the mother's 
life is endangered. "They may carve out an exception for rape and incest. . . . 
Ultimately, the pivotal player will be Bush and his willingness to use the 
veto." 
</P>
<P>
NOW's O'Dell said the marchers' major goal is to get in a loud word before the 
Supreme Court begins hearing the Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the lawyers take over, the court closes the door and then nine people in 
the smallest precinct in America sit down and vote," she said. "It affects 
everybody, especially the half that can get pregnant, and we feel this is our 
one shot in the debate."

TAPER WORKSHOP DEVELOPS 'OTHER VOICES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disabled people come in many different shapes, sizes, colors. They also come 
with a variety of voices. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line of 'Other Voices' is developing a disabled culture -- in Los 
Angeles, all over the world," said actress Victoria Ann-Lewis, project director 
of the Other Voices Writing Workshop. The group will present a scene reading, 
open to the public, Monday at the Music Center Annex. 
</P>
<P>
"The disabled minority is not geographical, yet it's very repressed," she said. 
"It's not about one-upsmanship -- 'Who's the most ashamed?' -- but it is an 
experience one is loath to accept: to say, 'I'm disabled and I'm proud.' Ten 
years ago, nobody would've thought of saying that. Now it's changing." 
</P>
<P>
Although her own disability -- a limp -- appears slight, Ann-Lewis (who plays 
Kevin Dobson's secretary on TV's "Knots Landing") notes that a day doesn't go 
by that someone doesn't stare at her leg. 
</P>
<P>
"The roles are limited," the actress said bluntly. "Twenty-eight is considered 
old. I don't get to play hookers, because I don't have (good) legs and I can't 
wear high heels. I'm in a netherworld -- difficult to cast because I'm not 
dramatically disabled." 
</P>
<P>
Exclusion began early. "I was so isolated growing up," she recalled. "I didn't 
want to know anybody who was disabled -- I wasn't like them! I mainstreamed, 
went to regular schools. I basically denied the experience, though it got 
tremendously in the way of my career, and in terms of my being a woman. I 
wasn't expected to marry; I got a good education because I was going to have to 
take care of myself. I was refused admission to drama school. They said, 
'You'll never work, so why should we teach you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ann-Lewis credits the film "Coming Home" (in which Jon Voight, as a paraplegic 
veteran, was the romantic lead) and the women's movement for inspiring a surer 
sense of herself. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started working here, (the wheelchair-bound) couldn't get from the 
Music Center to City Hall," she said. "There were no curb cuts. Now, that's a 
concrete, material issue: it's what it means to be disabled, to be excluded 
from life -- from decent jobs, decent training. Socially, you're really in the 
margin. For me, those issues are very important. But the bottom line is that 
I'm an artist, and I want to be able to translate those experiences into art, 
into myth." 
</P>
<P>
Ann-Lewis began developing her own autobiographical material while touring 
Europe with an experimental theater group -- then followed up with a book, "No 
More Stares," which included interviews with hundreds of disabled women. A 
grant from the California Arts Council to teach acting to people with 
disabilities brought her to the Taper, and Puzzles and Solutions (now renamed 
Other Voices) was formed. Out of that came two televised ensemble pieces "Tell 
Them I'm a Mermaid" and "Who Parks in Those Spaces?" 
</P>
<P>
"A whole group of people are expressing themselves for the first time," she 
said. "We've been talked about and explained by medical people and artists and 
religious people for centuries. Now we're saying, 'This is what it's like from 
our point of view.' In the Middle Ages, they burned people who gave birth to 
disabled children. We don't like to think about that now, because everyone 
likes to be nice to the handicapped. But there are deep fears and prejudices 
connected with the issue." 
</P>
<P>
As Ann-Lewis expanded the workshops, developing work with teen-agers and labor 
groups (the common denominator being "disenfranchisement -- the experience of 
being other in this culture") she began to sense an interest in writing as well 
as performing. "The material I had was person-specific," she noted. "The real 
person had to do it. But there's only so far you can go with that -- then you 
want replicable work. You want other people to be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Ann-Lewis invited a group of writers to the workshop; of 
those, playwright Irene Oppenheim emerged as the writing instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give people the freedom to create characters who don't have 
disabilities," she said. At first, they want to ignore it, write 
science-fiction things. It was so freeing for them to be able to do that. But 
after a while, they began to realize that one of the most valuable creative 
assets was their perspective; it made them unique." 
</P>
<P>
Oppenheim believes the workshops are empowering psychologically as well as 
artistically. 
</P>
<P>
"We focus the workshop around the creation and completion of a scene. People 
have interrupted educations or are frightened of failure; creativity isn't 
something that's taught to people with disabilities. But when they're taken 
seriously -- or they hear people laughing or being moved -- it gives them a 
great sense of accomplishment, which I think carries over to the other part of 
their lives."

JEAN STAPLETON'S HOT ROLE A HIT WITH JULIA CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Jean Stapleton's performance in the West Coast premiere of Lee Hoiby's 
"Bon Appetit!," Julia Child stood up from her aisle seat in the audience and 
acknowledged the applause. It isn't often that a chef/television personality 
becomes an overnight poet/librettist. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a modest blue skirt with a colorful print blouse, Child, 76, had 
come to Long Beach from her home in Santa Barbara with her husband, Paul, to 
see the performance for the first time. When asked if she liked the way she was 
portrayed on the stage, Child was quick to point out that she thought 
Stapleton's performance had really cooked. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish I could have sung it like that when I originally did it," laughed 
Child, referring to the 1961 telecast upon which the text of the piece was 
based. "Wasn't it just wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
A long line of admirers seeking Child's autograph formed during intermission. 
Although the task of greeting each and every one of them seemed impossible, not 
to mention a bit nerve-racking, Child spoke with them all, exuberant and happy. 
</P>
<P>
A small reception followed honoring Child, Stapleton and Hoiby. The caterers 
even baked a chocolate cake following the recipe from "Bon Appetit!" 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate creation proved a bit lopsided and small for a two-pan cake. But 
after a bit of effort from Child and Stapleton to cut the first piece, the 
fudgy cake was quickly cut up into bite-size pieces and devoured. 
</P>
<P>
Television personalities Larry Storch and Marion Ross, who worked with 
Stapleton in a recent production of "Arsenic and Old Lace," were also there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really an opera singer. I prefer to call this musical monologue," 
insisted Stapleton, who seemed to shy away from the thought of changing 
careers. " 'Candide' is the only real opera I've ever done, not to mention all 
the musicals I've been in. For the past few years I've been doing lots of 
theater and hope to start a new television series soon. I don't know where all 
of this will lead." GREGG WAGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Austrian artist Hundertwasser is a visionary jack-of-all-trades afflicted with 
a slight case of megalomania. A driven man who designs stamps, national flags 
and entire societies, the 61-year-old artist also writes manifestoes and makes 
his own clothes. "I sew my own clothes," he says, "to show that life is 
possible without money; trousers with stitches on the outside, rabbit skin 
shoes, everything found in garbage bins." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hundertwasser had extensive schooling and his work has much in common 
with that of Paul Klee, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, its strongest ties are 
to outsider art. There is a manic intensity, a barely contained hysteria to 
these images which, while espousing various utopian theories, churn with an 
undercurrent of eroticism and madness. Hundert-wasser's vivid colors, obsessive 
patterning and primitive motifs -- matched with his ideological naivete -- 
place him squarely in the folk art camp. 
</P>
<P>
This survey of graphic work doubles as a seminar on Hundert-wasser's humanist 
ideas on ecology and global harmony. Attempting to convey the universality of 
man in portraiture, his images basically serve as illustrations for his 
charmingly simple solutions to the ills of the world. (Planting gardens on the 
roofs of buildings is a typical scheme.) However, despite the optimism of 
Hundertwasser's ideas, his work hums with a strange vibe. Like illustrations 
for frightening fairy tales, his work resonates with the same vaguely menacing 
air that colors much European animation. Other pieces have the insipid 
sweetness of work by Sister Corita Kent, and look like the kind of stuff you'd 
find on the walls of a Montessori school.(Jack Rutberg Fine Arts Inc., 357 N. 
La Brea Ave., to May 13.)KRISTINE McKENNA

Ruben Kocharian's paintings are dense, detail-packed still lifes and pictures 
of everyday life. Rich with the descriptive texture of blistered paint, papery 
onion skins and crisply folded cloth, these genre scenes have a closely 
observed intensity. Yet the way the paint thickens up to mimic the subject's 
texture frequently knocks the images back into unreality as the artifice of the 
illusion is blatantly underscored. 
</P>
<P>
Kocharian further emphasizes painting's illusionistic tricks by cramming as 
much into a shallow picture plane as possible. Scenes like the verdant "Lily 
Pond" seem about to pour from the surface of the canvas as leaves, water and 
vegetation expand into every square inch of pictorial space. Less congested 
still life images have an equally compressed vitality despite the torpidity of 
the carefully arranged fruits and vegetables. Frequently, as in "Pomegranate," 
the background color is so strong it seems to bump against the fruit in a mad 
rush to be out front. In "Against the Wall," the texture of the background vies 
with the potted plant hung from it for primacy in the picture's shallow space. 
</P>
<P>
Kocharian's paintings are so quiet about the way they deconstruct elements of 
representational painting it's easy to overlook some of the painterly 
commentary. But in "Buddha" we get some help. The flattened space and the way 
the picture traditionally functions as a window is deftly summed up by the 
silent statue sitting on a window ledge. And of course the painting is being 
displayed inside the gallery's front window. (Heritage Gallery, 718 N. La 
Cienega Blvd., to April 22.)SUVAN GEER

BEAUX ARTS TRIO ENDS MUSIC GUILD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wilshire Ebell Theatre was packed -- and very hot -- on Wednesday for the 
Music Guild's season-ending presentation of the Beaux Arts Trio. The playing of 
a super-familiar program, however, took some time to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
Interest centered on a presumed new Beaux Arts sound, dependent on cellist 
Peter Wiley, recently arrived to replace founding member Bernard Greenhouse. 
The change has been effective, particularly for the revitalization of violinist 
Isidore Cohen, who often seemed in recent years to be inhabiting the same 
remote planet on which Greenhouse dwelled. 
</P>
<P>
So, what had come in some quarters to be regarded as Menahem Pressler and 
Companions -- the fiery pianist always being up to and involved in the task -- 
once more is an ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that things always went smoothly Wednesday. To begin with, 
Mozart's bracingly forthright Trio in E, K. 542, was subjected to romantic 
overinterpretation of the most blatant sort, with Pressler's extravagant 
rubatos and Cohen's "expressive" fade-out dynamics proving particularly inapt. 
</P>
<P>
The same approach may have been better suited to the Ravel Trio in A minor, 
which followed. But it remained for the listener to endure two movements of 
taffy-pulling before Ravel's creation took perceptible shape with the Beaux 
Arts' exquisitely balanced, ecstatically tense reading of the Pasacaille and 
their uninhibited dispatching of the flamboyant finale. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schubert's Trio in E flat, D. 929, was accorded an uncommonly swift, 
energetic reading -- enlivened particularly by the light-toned, bantering 
interplay between violinist and cellist in the first and third movements, 
poignantly reminding us that at the end of his life, when this for the most 
part deep and grand work was written, Schubert was still a very young 
man.HERBERT GLASS

STAGE BEAT : 'EDEN COURT' AT TAMARIND; 'ABSURDIST PLAYS' AT THEATRE OF

The Humana Festival of New American Plays at Louisville's Actors Theatre has 
gained a reputation as a consistent showcase for literate but safe plays. A 
"Humana" kind of play is often set in the South, with one or more women as 
central characters, naturalistic, funny but serious. On its way to the Tamarind 
Theatre, Murphy Guyer's "Eden Court" hit Louisville (and, in 1986, Long Beach's 
International City Theatre). It fits the Humana formula like a snug glove. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie and Schroeder (Deborah Scott and Scott Allan Campbell) are a young 
couple who already seem to be in marriage's middle age of quiet disgust. She 
has decked out their trailer home with Elvis bric-a-brac, and he views the 
arrival of his 30th birthday with dread. At first, our sympathies are all with 
Bonnie, as Schroeder appears to be a merciless bully. 
</P>
<P>
The play's nice touch is how those sympathies shift when Schroeder comes home 
from work. His reluctance to have a baby isn't stubbornness; it's based on 
reason born of forward-looking ambition. That ambition is as silly as Bonnie's 
taste in home decor, and a certain golden mean is finally struck between the 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
Nice, but it makes for a very clean play of very sloppy lives. Just when it's 
starting to get interesting with Schroeder, Guyer flees to a facile resolution 
rather than making tough dramaturgical choices. 
</P>
<P>
Director Robert Spera accents domestic moments with a comic touch that's never 
insistent, and his cast is the same way. Scott avoids turning Bonnie into the 
cliched flubbing housewife, just as Campbell magnifies a portrait in 
frustration. Dave Florek's Carl nicely embodies a stupid self-confidence, and 
Stephanie Shroyer's Barb hints of a woman who's lost track of her innate 
wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Killen's sound design is full of very appropriate Elvis tunes, but 
Barry Frost's trailer design requires the audience in the left rows -- whose 
stage side is a trailer wall -- to look to their right for the stage action. 
</P>

'Absurdist Plays and Children's Stories' 
</P>
<P>
It was Jean Tardieu, not Eugene Ionesco, who produced the first consciously 
absurdist theater work -- "Courtesy Doesn't Pay," in 1947. He later wrote "The 
Information Office," and both of them come out of a postwar European 
sensibility that saw the world as going to the dogs with totalitarianism 
waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
At Theatre of N.O.T.E. (now sharing the Friends and Artists Theatre space), 
these Tardieu pieces have been grouped with four Ionesco playlets about a 
curious nuclear family under the title, "Absurdist Plays and Children's 
Stories." There's a certain historical interest in seeing them staged, but the 
program only justifies why we've forgotten Tardieu and remembered Ionesco. 
</P>
<P>
In "Courtesy," a professorial pervert is put in his place by a sinister 
"visitor," whose last gesture is to wave goodby to us with the fascist salute. 
In "Information," a man tries to get some help with train schedules, but he 
really needs help scheduling his life. The existential symbolism in both 
becomes a very hard cross to bear for the actors, who have been directed to 
overact by R.S. Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Although the final resolution of the four "Children's Stories" (interspersed 
through the evening) is predictably nightmarish and crudely Freudian, the 
stories are enriched with the light and dark tones of a fairy tale. Ionesco's 
joke is on himself: he speculates on how an imaginative, story-telling father 
might make his little daughter go mad. Director Joseph Megel makes the stage a 
kind of dream state, but with a child's sense of make-believe. The entire cast 
deserves mention: Linda Quiroz as the little girl, Joyce Mancini, Debora 
Roventini, Jim Pirri, and Robert Rigamonti as the parents and narrators, and 
Lamar Aguilar as the maid. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., through May 11. 
Tickets: $12.50; (213) 664-0689. 
</P>
<P>
'Gravity' 
</P>
<P>
Don't lend much weight to "Gravity," an urban revue at the performance space, 
City Dance. Writer/director/composer Stuart K Robinson's message is that city 
life gets you down, but at least we're in it together. 
</P>
<P>
That's about the level at which his own songs work -- as self-knowing cliches 
(Rickie Lee Jones' tunes, used extensively, save the show). He uses the gravity 
metaphor for relationships, but what's really meant is magnetism. In a show 
that has homeless women (sounding suspiciously like Lily Tomlin) dancing with 
sleek hipsters, anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, "Gravity" is a grab-bag of comedy skits and dance routines, full of 
morsels on female frustrations, drugs, show-biz snakes and bad dating. It works 
best as a showcase for its young performers, who can play for laughs and dance 
in a slick commercial style. "Gravity" is full of pop terpsichorean heat that's 
ultimately vaporous. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2855 S. Robertson Blvd., Saturday and Sunday, 8 p.m. Ends Sunday. Tickets: 
$10; (213) 558-0917. 
</P>
<P>
'Pepper Street' 
</P>
<P>
"Pepper Street," a truly poor musical drowning in greeting-card sentiments, is 
the most inexplicable success in local theater. Filling seats at the Venture 
Theatre for more than four years (with a brief detour to the Backlot Cabaret), 
this show by Toni Bull Bua (lyrics and book) and Gene Bua (music) has fans 
ranging from Mayor Tom Bradley -- he recently declared a "Pepper Street Day" in 
Los Angeles -- to a young woman who sat next to me last weekend. She claimed to 
have seen it seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing it once (at three hours, no less) was quite enough, thank you. The only 
interest was in seeing how the new actress fared in the lead role of Spirit, 
the teen suicide victim. She is rising pop star Martika, who has a good throaty 
voice for the music but confuses posing with acting -- as the show confuses 
pamphleteering with entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3435 W. Magnolia Ave., Burbank, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
indefinitely. Tickets: $15; (818) 842-8384. 
</P>
<P>
'The Sound of Soul' 
</P>
<P>
The age-old theatrical values of giving human meaning to sound were thick in 
the air while listening to "The Sound of Soul," a solemn production by South 
Korea's Chung-Eum Theater of the Deaf. At the company's one-night performance 
at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre last Saturday (part of a six-city American 
premiere tour), modern stage conventions strained to keep up with the old 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the play itself, adapted by Kim Wan from a Buddhist tale, sometimes 
paled next to the extraordinary theatrics of the evening's first half of dance 
performances. In these pieces, led by music directors Cho Sae-Il and Yoon 
Hee-Sun on drums, pure choreography was less important than the blending of 
percussive dynamics with group patterns (such as in the "Fan Dance") or the 
concept of a collective drum sound. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of "Drum Dance" was mesmerizing, the aural equivalent of 
metaphysics. You were so mesmerized that you forgot that the performers were 
deaf -- which was precisely the point. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sound of Soul" was not so hypnotic. The tale hinges on a sacrifice: Only 
an innocent child, dropped into the molten metal for a bell casting, can make 
the bell ring with a sound so pure that it will compel the villagers to pray 
for peace. The path to peace, then, is a tortuous one; Kim Chung-Ill's priest 
and Kim Young-Min's mother, with few spoken words, physically emoted in a high 
tragic style. 
</P>
<P>
To the Western viewer, the instant connection was with Sophocles and the Greek 
tragedies -- the conflict between religion and the heart, the marriage of 
ritual and storytelling, the death of youth. 
</P>
<P>
But the Western viewer was also at a disadvantage. For instance, the show's 
program, with explanatory information, is in Korean (a helpful production 
assistant provided this reviewer with a synopsis). 
</P>
<P>
Other problems, not lost in translation, emerged. Lee Kwang Seub's set design 
is made for long-distance transport, but not for visual elegance. Kim Jong 
Hyun's lights cast some striking color patterns, but his sound recording 
utterly lacked the power of the on-stage acoustic instruments.

EUBANKS QUARTET AT VINE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood has such a splendid track record, 
bringing in some of the jazz world's outstanding singers as well as an 
occasional high-caliber instrumental group, that a lapse from grace once in a 
while can be understood. The Wednesday night opening of Kevin Eubanks' quartet 
was a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Music has always been said to consist of three primary elements: melody, 
harmony and rhythm. To these a fourth has been added in the last decade: 
energy. Eubanks, a guitarist who works the funky side of the street, has it in 
abundance, as do his sidemen. 
</P>
<P>
With Edward Simon on acoustic and electric keyboards, Kenny Davis on electric 
and upright bass, and the explosive Gene Jackson on drums, Eubanks launched his 
set with a number that seemed to last forever (somebody clocked it at 25 
minutes), with an endlessly repeated riff underlined (or undermined) by a slow 
crescendo on drums. Hypnotic or chaotic? Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
The second number found Jackson hitting a resounding DHWACK! on the third beat 
of every bar from here to eternity. Eubanks, as is his wont, displayed chops to 
spare; in fact, his technique sometimes tends to get the better of him. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may seem unfair to make a comparative judgment, it is true that his 
current album, using various groupings from solo to trio to quintet, and with 
sometimes valuable vocal effects, makes the same material sound quite appealing 
at times. The closing tune, "Cookin'," done at the club simply as a guitar and 
drums duet, seemed particularly barren. 
</P>
<P>
Eubanks will continue to draw his fans (and they are numerous) through 
Saturday. LEONARD FEATHER

CD CORNER: THE EXPERIMENTAL YEARS IN BROWN'S 'ROOTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to measure James Brown's commercial dominance in soul music. 
</P>
<P>
In a rating system that gives 100 points to every No. 1 soul single, 99 points 
to every No. 2 soul single, etc., Brown leads his nearest rival by more than 
3,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the point system detailed in researcher Joel Whitburn's book "Top R&amp;B 
Singles," Brown -- on the basis of 114 singles on the R&amp;B charts through 
last June -- amassed 11,872 points. That's 3,000 points more than runner-up 
Aretha Franklin's 8,731. Close behind: Ray Charles, the Temptations, Louis 
Jordan, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's creative influence can't be measured as neatly by statistics. His stamp 
as a singer, record-maker and performer, however, can be found in the work of 
countless artists -- all the way through Michael Jackson, Prince and the latest 
rap artists. 
</P>
<P>
Though Brown -- who is serving a six-year prison sentence in South Carolina for 
failing to stop for a police car -- didn't break into the pop Top 10 until 
"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" in the summer of 1965, he had been gaining an 
audience on the soul-music scene since "Please, Please, Please" was released in 
1956. 
</P>
<P>
Those early, pre-"Brand New Bag" years are spotlighted in "Roots of a 
Revolution," a 40-song, 110-minute, two-disc set just released in CD only by 
PolyGram Records. The album, on the Polydor label, adds eight bonus tracks to a 
collection previously available in Britain on vinyl and cassette. It also comes 
with an illustrated 28-page booklet that details Brown's early years on the 
King and Federal record labels. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Elvis Presley's essential "Sun Sessions" album that demonstrates how 
Presley's style evolved in the young singer's pre-"Heartbreak Hotel" days in 
Memphis, "Roots of a Revolution" shows how Brown -- who was born in 1933 -- 
experimented with various musical styles of the day in his early recording 
years. 
</P>
<P>
From 1956 to 1958, Brown moved from the conventional rhythm and blues of "No, 
No, No, No" and straight-ahead blues of "Why Does Everything Happen to Me?" to 
the Little Richard-like vitality of "Chonnie-On-Chon" to the Coasters/Robins 
novelty of "That Dood It." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, however, there was a greater confidence in Brown's 
recordings as he began showing the individual vision that would eventually earn 
him the title Godfather of Soul. Several of these tracks made the soul charts 
in the early '60s, and a few (including "I Don't Mind" and "Prisoner of Love") 
spilled over into the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The CD is part of PolyGram's Sound Savers budget line, which means it should be 
available in most stores for $20 to $23. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PolyGram has some other historical collections on the way in CD. 
Five Chuck Berry albums from his Mercury Records years, including "Live at the 
Fillmore" (where Berry was backed by the Steve Miller Band), are due April 18. 
A retrospective featuring Roy Orbison singles recorded for MGM Records between 
1965 and 1973 is also due that day, while a 40-song Brook Benton "greatest 
hits" package is planned for May 9. 
</P>
<P>
CULT FAVES: Alice Cooper's first two albums, "Pretties for You" and "Easy 
Action," are the first releases in Enigma Records' new Enigma Retro CD and 
cassette series. Steve Levesque, manager of press and artist relations for 
Enigma, said the series aims to present out-of-print albums or previously 
unreleased recordings by "superstar or cult" artists. 
</P>
<P>
Due April 19 on Enigma Retro: Captain Beefheart's "Lick My Decals Off, Baby," 
the GTO's "Permanent Damage" and Ted Nugent's "Call of the Wild" and "Tooth, 
Fang and Claw." Coming in May: CDs spotlighting Lenny Bruce and Lord Buckley. 
All these albums are from Bizarre/Straight/Discreet Records catalogue.

'NEW MOON' CASTS DIFFERENT LIGHT TONIGHT ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even 61 years ago, when it was really new, "New Moon" was a nostalgia musical. 
</P>
<P>
Though overstuffed with romantic platitudes and comic relief, this Sigmund 
Romberg Broadway operetta held faithfully to a vision of the individual courage 
and social reform of an earlier era -- the sense of a corrupt (European) order 
challenged by new (American) ideals. 
</P>
<P>
This dimension of belief is exactly what's missing in the lively, opulent New 
York City Opera production tonight on PBS (9 p.m. on Channels 28, 15 and 24; 
Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 50). 
</P>
<P>
Robert Johanson's adaptation and staging have no use for heroism or class 
solidarity except as campy diversions -- so "Stout-Hearted Men" is sung here as 
a jaunty anthem of self-promotion, 1980s to the max. It has never been less 
stirring. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want nothing more from "New Moon" than its ballads -- "Softly, As in 
a Morning Sunrise," "One Kiss," "Wanting You" and "Lover, Come Back to Me" -- 
should be warned that nearly a third of the 2 1/2-hour telecast goes by before 
one of these lush classics is sung. Even then, vocal strain and (again) lack of 
conviction minimize many of them. ("New Moon" film clips of Jeanette 
MacDonald/Nelson Eddy from 1940 and Grace Moore/Lawrence Tibbett from 10 years 
earlier are highly enlightening in comparison.) 
</P>
<P>
Richard White is handsome and likable as the lovelorn nobleman-in-disguise, but 
the music lies too high for him and his tone thins alarmingly in ascent. As the 
heart-throb of all New Orleans, Leigh Munro tries incessantly to 
glitter-glitter-glitter, but the role is more complex than she imagines and the 
task of pausing-to-think is clearly beyond her acting range. Her singing of 
"Lover, Come Back to Me" is utterly without feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cousins keeps forcing his high notes as the hero's Best Friend, and 
David Rae Smith substitutes a collection of mannerisms for a sense of character 
as his Worst Enemy. Perhaps because the telecast is a transcription of a stage 
performance (at Wolf Trap), the comic roles often seem pushed beyond the 
tiresome into the acutely painful. Gerald Isaac, Muriel Costa-Greenspon, 
Kenneth Kantor and Joyce Campara are the principal victims. Jim Coleman 
conducts briskly. LEWIS SEGAL

'SESAME STREET' HAS 20TH BIRTHDAY PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom does a network spend an hour of prime time saluting a television program 
that isn't one of its own. But that's what NBC does tonight on "Sesame Street . 
. . 20 and Still Counting" (8 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
</P>
<P>
While it's a nice gesture on NBC's part, the presence of the program on NBC 
unwittingly points out how much better "Sesame Street" is than anything that 
NBC or the other networks offer preschool children. We won't soon see PBS 
broadcasting a tribute to any of NBC's kidvid efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Bill Cosby and produced by Jim Henson of Muppets fame, "20 and Still 
Counting" is a loosely organized grab bag of new material and old, of 
entertainment and information. 
</P>
<P>
Some now grown-up fans of the program, and three who appeared on it as 
children, talk about what it meant to them. One of them became a "celebrity in 
kindergarten" because he could recite the alphabet backward; another says 
"Sesame Street" taught him English. 
</P>
<P>
We see how "Sesame Street" teaches kids about love and babies and death too. 
Ray Charles and Placido Domingo sing two of the late Joe Raposo's songs written 
for the program. We sample the foreign versions of "Sesame Street." The Muppets 
do their shtick. 
</P>
<P>
The material shot for this program and some of the more recent clips aren't as 
entertaining as the choice material from the earlier clips. Also, no one 
mentions any of the objections to "Sesame Street" -- the theories that it hooks 
kids on TV and spoils them for more sedate forms of learning. 
</P>
<P>
But then this is no documentary. It's a pleasantly puffy birthday party for a 
remarkably influential American institution. DON SHIRLEY

PARTNER IN DEAL HELPED START 3 OTHER AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Thomas Talbot -- Tom to his friends -- made a fortune building 
nondescript factories and warehouses around Southern California. But his first 
love is airlines. 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising, considering that he has helped start three: AirCal, Jet 
America and Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Now Talbot has returned to the airline business, this time in the big leagues. 
The Newport Beach developer is a partner of Peter V. Ueberroth in the former 
baseball commissioner's successful effort to buy troubled Eastern Airlines. The 
two have been friends for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said in a telephone interview from his lawyer's offices in New York 
before the final agreement to buy Eastern was reached that he will play an 
active role in the transition period and may take an active role in the 
airline's management. 
</P>
<P>
However, one airline executive said he would be surprised if Talbot became a 
hands-on manager at Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never really run an airline before," said J. Ray Vingo, chief financial 
officer at Seattle's Alaska Air Group, which bought Jet America in 1986. "While 
he was chairman of Jet America, he was not active in day-to-day operations." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot acknowledged that while he has not handled day-to-day activities at any 
of his airlines, he was chairman of Jet America and very active in its 
operations. His role at AirCal and Southwest was as a lawyer, consultant and 
shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
The airline connection runs in Talbot's family. In 1925, his grandfather 
started the nation's first air carrier, Western Air Express, which shuttled 
passengers and mail between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. The airline, later 
known as Western Airlines, was merged into Delta Air Lines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started Law Firm 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, 53, was born in Los Angeles, but his parents moved to Newport Beach 
when he was a child and his roots are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in the Air Force, Talbot graduated from Hastings College of Law 
in San Francisco in 1963 and worked for a large Los Angeles law firm. Two years 
later, he formed his own firm so he could spend more time starting AirCal, 
which was first called Air California. It began flying out of Orange County 
Airport in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot and the other founders soon sold most of the struggling airline to San 
Diego financier C. Arnholt Smith, whose financial empire later crumbled. AirCal 
was later sold to Orange County home builder William Lyon and apartment builder 
George Argyros and is now part of American Airlines. Talbot was on its board 
from 1973 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, he was helping start Jet America Airlines, a tiny Long Beach carrier 
that also struggled when it ran up against the big airlines on many of its 
routes to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Talbot, as chairman, did not handle the nuts and bolts of the 
operation, Fred Davis, who Talbot hired as executive vice president of 
marketing at AirCal and who held the same post at Jet America, is confident 
that his old boss can run an airline. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody in the industry can (make a go of Eastern), it would be Tom Talbot 
and Peter Ueberroth," said Davis, now vice president of marketing at Air 
America, a small Los Angeles airline. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said in the telephone interview that he and Ueberroth met more than 10 
years ago as neighbors in Laguna Beach. They have often played golf together, 
usually at the Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, and have become good 
friends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They have also been business associates at times. Both served, for instance, as 
directors of E. F. Hutton Group, the investment banking firm sold to Shearson 
Lehman Bros. in late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experience in Travel 
</P>
<P>
Another affluent executive with a crowded resume, Ueberroth came to national 
prominence as president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee for the 
1984 Olympic Games. Soon after the games, he was named commissioner of major 
league baseball. His five-year term ended last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's business experience is in the travel industry. In 1963, he founded 
First Travel Corp. in Southern California and built it into the second-largest 
business of its kind in North America. He sold it in 1979 for $10.6 million, 
earning $4.4 million personally. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's airlines have had few or no union workers, but he said he is not 
worried about a possible clash between management and unions like the one that 
has dominated the tenure of Frank Lorenzo as head of Eastern. There is no 
reason for labor and management to be adversaries, Talbot said, especially when 
both sides have ownership stakes in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's agreement to buy Eastern involves wage and work rules concessions 
from the airline's employees but, in return, grants them 30% ownership of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot is at home in the clubby atmosphere of the Pacific Club -- a Newport 
Beach dining club he helped start while running Jet America -- and the posh Big 
Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, the place to be seen playing golf in 
Orange County, where he is known as a pretty fair golfer. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances describe him as cordial and low-key. He plays golf fairly 
frequently and is "definitely not a workaholic," said Don Shaw, a business 
partner of Talbot's. 
</P>
<P>
"When we needed to work 14 hours straight, he was there; but he was not usually 
at the office at 7 p.m. yelling at people," Shaw said. "He was very low-key. 
Crises just rolled off his back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Industrial Buildings 
</P>
<P>
Talbot had known Shaw socially for several years before Talbot left his job as 
chairman of developer Dunn Properties Corp. in Santa Ana in 1975 to start Shaw 
&amp; Talbot. Dunn Properties was a subsidiary of Pacific Lighting, the parent 
company of Southern California Gas, and is now called Pacific Enterprsies. 
Talbot joined it as executive vice president in 1970 after selling AirCal 
because, he said a few years ago, all his friends were getting rich in real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
The new company built one-story industrial buildings around Southern 
California, most of them in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from a construction background -- I've still got cement on my shoes -- and 
Tom had a lot of financial savvy and a lot of capacity for negotiating," Shaw 
said. "We learned a hell of a lot from each other." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, Shaw &amp; Talbot had stopped developing properties but they 
remain partners and still own numerous buildings together, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he and Ueberroth wanted to buy Eastern, Talbot said: "Pete has an 
abiding interest in the travel business, and so do I. The business has a 
variety of different lures. There's instant gratification; everything is so 
visible."

S&amp;LS' DEPOSIT DRAIN REACHES NEAR-RECORD $9.4 BILLION IN MONTH 
</P>

<P>
The heavy drain of funds from the nation's savings and loan associations 
persisted during February, with total withdrawals of $9.4 billion, federal 
regulators announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The month's outflow was only a slight improvement from the record withdrawal of 
$10.6 billion during January, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said. 
</P>
<P>
The discouraging news came as a congressional subcommittee moved to strengthen 
the federal government's powers to override state regulators, who have been 
blamed for costly S&amp;L failures in California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will become the principal regulator for 
state-chartered S&amp;Ls under an amendment adopted Thursday by the financial 
institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee. The panel is working 
on a bill proposed by President Bush for the multibillion-dollar rescue of the 
federal fund that insures deposits at S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC, already a key regulator for banks, will assume the same role for S&amp;Ls 
as part of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the California Legislature gave S&amp;Ls virtually unlimited authority 
to make investments outside their normal business of home mortgage lending. 
Some S&amp;Ls suffered big financial losses on such diverse ventures as 
restaurants, horse breeding farms, apartments, condominiums and shopping 
centers, and windmills to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"We destroyed our financial institutions during a boom," said Rep. Richard H. 
Lehman (D-Sanger), a Banking Committee member. The S&amp;L industry was given 
total investment freedom through passage of a bill in the waning days of the 
1982 Legislature, Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of California was completely derelict and to date has not changed 
one law," he added. He expressed hope that the Legislature will act to limit 
outside investment powers given to thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment approved Thursday, if included in the final legislation, would 
give FDIC a free hand as a regulator, able to deny federal deposit insurance if 
a state allows its S&amp;Ls to engage in relatively risky practices. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, approved by a 27 to 12 vote, was sponsored by Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa), a vociferous critic of California's action in removing limits on 
S&amp;L activities. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee disposed of 47 amendments Thursday but has not yet grappled 
with the most controversial issues unresolved between Congress and the Bush 
Administration. The legislators still must decide whether to give the S&amp;Ls 
additional time to meet tough new capital standards proposed by the 
Administration and whether to include the full cost in the federal budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Under an ambitious schedule, the subcommittee hopes to dispose of more than 150 
amendments and complete work next week on the complex bill to rescue the 
savings and loan insurance fund, which protects deposits up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has proposed a plan to spend $157 billion over 10 years for 
closing or selling more than 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls. The money would be used to 
pay off depositors, whose accounts are insured, or to provide financial 
incentives to outside investors to buy ailing thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Banking Committee will begin work on the S&amp;L legislation next 
week. The steady erosion of S&amp;L deposits gives a special impetus to 
Congress' hopes to deal quickly with the legislation. Withdrawals during the 
first two months of the year, totaling $20 billion, are dramatically larger 
than the outflow of $8.6 billion for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates offered by money market funds, combined with some 
nervousness over the financial health of thrift institutions, are the major 
reasons for the steady loss of funds. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Thursday, the financial institutions subcommittee rejected an 
amendment proposed by Lehman to allow 31 financial institutions, including some 
of California's biggest S&amp;Ls, to leave the S&amp;L regulatory system and 
obtain bank charters. Under the Bush Administration plan, the S&amp;Ls would be 
blocked from becoming banks for five years.

Time-Warner Deal Cleared: The Justice Department cleared the proposed 
$18-billion merger of media giants Time and Warner Communications. Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Charles Rule said the proposed merger was determined unlikely to 
reduce competition substantially in any market even though it would create the 
world's largest media and entertainment firm. Analysts had expected the deal to 
be cleared because it did not change the concentration of the cable-TV 
industry, the one market where both Time and Warner hold big shares. Out of 42 
million households served by cable systems, Time has 4 million and Warner 1.5 
million.

Golden Nugget Inc.: Citing interest costs on its new $550-million Las Vegas 
resort, the company said it lost $7.6 million in 1988, contrasted with earnings 
of $137.5 million in 1987, when it benefited from the sale of its Atlantic 
City, N.J., hotel-casino. Revenue was $175 million, down 10% from in 1987. The 
Las Vegas company said $36.7 million in non-operating expenses, and losing a 
lawsuit that cost it $8.5 million, more than offset operating income of $33.9 
million for the year.

Truth in Pasta: Traditional Italian pasta will get a special quality-control 
mark from the Italian government under a measure aimed at helping consumers 
distinguish it from cheaper imported mixed-wheat pasta. The measure, approved 
by the nation's Cabinet and expected to take effect this year, will force 
foreign pasta makers to list their ingredients on packages they want to sell in 
Italy. Even diners in restaurants will have to be notified of the type of pasta 
they are eating. In July, the European Community Court of Justice overturned an 
Italian law that barred the sale of pasta not made entirely with durum wheat.

News Corp. may sell its business publications that serve the travel and hotel 
industry in its effort to reduce its nearly $7-billion debt but won't sell its 
consumer magazines, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of the Australian-based media giant, said 
through a spokesman that the company has "had approaches" about its nine 
business publications and that it intends to "entertain them." 
</P>
<P>
But Murdoch said: "We will not sell any consumer publications here or anywhere 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch's comments came in response to a report in the Wall Street Journal on 
Thursday that quoted unidentified publishing industry executives as saying News 
Corp. is "actively shopping" the business publications and "might be willing to 
entertain offers for some of its consumer magazines, such as New Woman and 
Star, and for some of its publications in Europe and the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
But in his statement, Murdoch said he "won't even entertain any offers . . . 
about the other publishing properties." 
</P>
<P>
News Corp., which publishes newspapers, magazines and books and owns television 
stations, a television network and a film company, has spent heavily on 
acquisitions in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. said last year in connection with its $3-billion purchase of the 
company that publishes TV Guide that it planned to sell $1 billion in assets by 
June of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Asset sales to date have amounted to about $800 million, including the sales of 
the 20th Century Fox Film building in Los Angeles for $320 million and News 
Corp.'s 50% interest in Elle magazine for $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s business publications include Fast Facts, Meetings &amp; 
Conventions, Official Meeting Facilities Guide, Official Hotel &amp; Resort 
Guide, OHRG Cruise Directory, On Deck, Travel Weekly and World Travel 
Directory.

Kraft Ordered to Halt Cheese Ads: A Federal Trade Commission judge ordered 
Kraft Inc. to stop misrepresenting the nutrient content of its cheese slices, 
ruling the company "falsely advertised" that they contain as much calcium as 5 
ounces of milk and more calcium than most imitation slices. The judge said a 
3/4 ounce slice of Kraft Singles has 70% of the calcium of 5 ounces of whole 
milk and less than 68.2% of the calcium of 5 ounces of low-fat or skim milk. 
Parker also ruled that virtually all imitation cheese slices contain the same 
amount of calcium as Kraft Singles.

RETAIL SALES SLUMP REPORTED FOR MARCH

Sales at the nation's major retailers softened in March as inflation fears and 
higher interest rates took their toll on discretionary spending by consumers, 
who chose to save their money, analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Inclement weather in parts of the country and the loss of a selling day due to 
store closures for the Easter holiday were cited as reasons for the mediocre 
results at the cash registers of several big general merchandisers. 
</P>
<P>
Weaker sales could mean reduced corporate profits among merchants in the first 
quarter. On average, comparable or same-store sales rose 3% to 5% in March, 
unadjusted for inflation, analysts said. In February, same-store sales gained 
6% to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there is a slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers have decided to 
save more, and a good guess for the reason is fear of inflation and higher 
interest rates," said retail analyst Monroe Greenstein of Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
There were exceptions, however. The biggest U.S. retailer, Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co., said sales were even better than it hoped they would be in the month in 
which the company introduced a new competitive pricing policy. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc., said the chain store sales 
were consistent with recent statistics pointing to a moderation in economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts, however, declined to attach too much significance to the March 
numbers, preferring to defer judgment on the retail outlook until April's sales 
are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Johnson, a retail specialist at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, said: "We 
think that sales will be back up once we get some warm spring weather." 
</P>
<P>
K mart, the second-largest U.S. retailer, said sales in the five weeks ended 
March 29 were $2.42 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at K mart stores open for at least a year slid 0.8% from the year-ago 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. again exceeded the average of its peers with an increase 
in comparable store sales of 12%, while overall sales rose 26%, to $1.92 
billion from $1.53 billion in the year-ago period.

company said. The conglomerate, which has interests in drug and oil 
distribution and metals, said its board accepted Farley's resignation because 
of "irreconcilable differences concerning senior management responsibilities." 
The board named James S. Pasman Jr., 58, of San Francisco, as Farley's 
successor. Pasman is former vice chairman of Aluminum Corp. of America and 
former chairman and chief executive of KaiserTech Ltd. and Kaiser Aluminum 
&amp; Chemical Corp.

GROUPS TO ASK FOR SALES TAX ON OUT-OF-STATE MAIL PURCHASES

Five groups representing state and local governments said Thursday that they 
have agreed to ask Congress to pass legislation allowing states, counties and 
cities to collect taxes on out-of-state mail order businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The groups -- the National League of Cities, the U.S. Mayors Conference, the 
National Assn. of Counties, the National Governors' Assn. and the National 
Conference of State Legislatures -- said the current ban on collecting such 
taxes costs them $3 billion in lost revenue annually. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the Supreme Court struck down an Illinois law requiring out-of-state 
retailers, or mail order businesses, to collect a use tax on sales made to 
Illinois residents, arguing that "Congress alone has the power of regulation 
and control." 
</P>
<P>
"By establishing a mechanism for the collection of state and local sales taxes 
on sales by out-of-state retailers, the Congress would be enacting neither a 
new tax nor a tax increase," the groups said in a statement calling for the new 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Assn., an organization of direct mail 
businesses, said the local government groups had been mislead, that the $3 
billion in lost taxes is an exaggeration and that the elderly and those in 
rural areas would be hurt by the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
"Those hurt most by this proposed legislation," said Robert Levering, "are 
those who don't have the convenience of many of the major shopping malls one 
would find around the state's capitals. These include the elderly, the disabled 
and rural Americans." 
</P>
<P>
He said the bill is opposed by groups such as the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons and Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
But the government groups argued that the final purchaser of merchandise 
already has a legal obligation to pay sales or use taxes levied by state and 
local governments whether the purchase is made from local merchants or by mail 
order from out-of-state vendors. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is the lack of a workable enforcement mechanism," they said. "The 
existence of a workable enforcement mechanism would simply enable state and 
local governments to collect taxes due and provide a $3-billion infusion of 
revenues that could be used to address a whole range of needs in American 
communities," the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Bolen of Ft. Worth called the current situation "an expensive and 
unfair tax loophole used by the big-time mail order sales industry" and a 
gimmick that puts local merchants at an unfair competitive disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
Bolen said mail order buying represents more than 15% of total sales volumes 
nationally and such purchases are climbing at a rapid rate.

AMERICAN WILL ADD CARIBBEAN, MIAMI FLIGHTS

American Airlines said Thursday that it will expand service to Miami and the 
Caribbean by 44 flights a day beginning June 1, filling gaps left by 
strike-crippled Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
American had said last year that it would expand in Florida, but the strike 
pushed its planning schedule ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the opportunity that Eastern's problem presented brought us to take 
a look at the timing of that plan," said Robert Baker, American's senior vice 
president for operations. "It was probably a year down the road. The Caribbean 
part was closer than that." 
</P>
<P>
American will add 600 employees in Miami. The growth in Florida and the 
Caribbean will add 3,219 seats a day to the market. New routes from Miami will 
include nonstop flights to Los Angeles, New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
New service to the Caribbean will include stops in San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica; Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata in the 
Dominican Republic, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean additions will link 14 cities served by American with the 
Caribbean hub in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, American is expanding its daily service to 31 flights a day from 20. 
In San Juan, the number of daily flights will rise to 52 from 45. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern service represented about a quarter of the seats from the United States 
to Jamaica and about a third of the seats to the U.S. Virgin Islands before the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
"None of what we have announced today will rise and fall on what happens to 
Eastern Airlines or anyone else," Baker said. "The likelihood is that Eastern 
will still be the largest carrier" in the region, he added. 
</P>
<P>
American is upgrading its fleet, switching to larger aircraft on 12 flights to 
the Caribbean to increase its capacity. Direct service from other U.S. cities 
to the Caribbean is part of the airline's plan.

Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong announced Tuesday that it has placed a firm 
order with Airbus Industrie for 10 A330-300 aircraft and has taken options on 
another 10 of the wide-body planes. 
</P>
<P>
The firm order is worth about $1.1 billion, and if all the options are 
exercised, the order would total about $2.2 billion, the Hong Kong airline 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the planes will be delivered in January, 1995, with delivery 
scheduled to be completed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is the largest single Airbus order by a Far Eastern airline, 
Cathay Pacific said. Airbus Industrie is a European aircraft-making consortium 
sponsored by the governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"This huge investment demonstrates Cathay Pacific's commitment to Hong Kong and 
our confidence in the territory up to and beyond 1997," Cathay Pacific Chairman 
David Gledhill said, referring to the year when Hong Kong is scheduled to 
change from a British colony to part of mainland China.

38 MORE SAVINGS AND LOANS SEIZED; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATORS TAKE CONTROL OF 12 CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS

<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized control of 38 more troubled savings 
and loan institutions Thursday, including 12 in California and 11 in Texas, 
under President Bush's plan to shore up the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
The government takeovers brought to 215 the number of savings and loans, 
located in 31 states, enrolled in the so-called joint regulatory oversight 
program, which Bush launched in February. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's plan, the FDIC would take over many of the oversight 
responsibilities now performed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its 
insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is broke. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which now insures deposits at banks, said the 38 thrifts brought 
under its control Thursday would maintain normal operations and depositors 
would continue to be protected up to the $100,000 insurance level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Net Worth 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38, six are in Southern California. Four of the six had already been 
seized by S&amp;L regulators, who hired management teams to operate them while 
seeking buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California thrifts are all relatively small. The figures that 
follow are all as of Dec. 31. The institutions are: 
</P>
<P>
First California Savings, Orange -- $168 million in assets, $204 million in 
deposits and a negative net worth of $75.1 million, which means that its 
liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Founded 19 years ago as Camino Real Savings, the S&amp;L had a history of bad 
loans and foreclosed real estate. Its foreclosed commercial properties -- 
office buildings and apartments mainly in California -- continue to plague the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
It was sold in 1985 to developer Mervyn Phelan of Orange, who claims in a 
lawsuit against regulators that they misrepresented the institution's financial 
health. S&amp;L regulators seized it in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, it had $167.9 million in assets and a negative net 
worth of $75.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Founders Savings &amp; Loan, Los Angeles -- $132.6 million in assets, $160 
million in deposits and negative net worth of $37.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Founders suffered losses from bad commercial and construction loans. In 
addition, much of the books and records were in disarray when S&amp;L 
regulators seized it in September, 1986, threw out top management and hired new 
operators. At the end of 1988, Founders had $132.6 million in assets and a 
negative net worth of $37.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead Pacific Savings Bank, San Bernardino -- $57 million in assets, $81 
million in deposits and negative net worth of $26.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Under Supervision 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead Pacific had not been seized by thrift regulators previously, but 
regulators did force the institution to replace a number of top managers nearly 
three years ago. The ousted managers were held accountable substantial losses 
from loans in which Arrowhead participated with other S&amp;Ls. Many of those 
loans were poorly underwritten and eventually went sour. 
</P>
<P>
Unified Savings, Northridge -- $37 million in assets, $53 million in deposits 
and a negative net worth of $18.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unified already had been under regulatory supervision since October, 1986, when 
it was declared insolvent and seized by federal thrift officials. Organized in 
1982, the S&amp;L had been beset by bad loans, costly deposits and fraud by 
certain customers. 
</P>
<P>
City Savings &amp; Loan, Westlake Village -- $32 million in assets and $31 
million in deposits. It had negative regulatory capital of $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Perpetual Savings, Santa Ana -- $23.7 million in assets, $34 million in 
deposits and a negative net worth of $10.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Perpetual's insolvency was the result of losses from the purchases of 
over-valued stock in a metal mining company and overvalued commercial property 
in Los Angeles. The deals were financed with high-cost jumbo certificates of 
deposit brought in from money brokers. Perpetual was seized March 18, 1987, and 
regulators sued its founders three months later alleging that they were trying 
to profit personally from the two deals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest S&amp;L in Texas 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action should not have any effect on the operations of the S&amp;Ls, 
except that interest rates on new deposits and on certificates of deposits that 
are renewed will likely be reduced, said David Barr, a spokesman for the FSLIC. 
</P>
<P>
"The institutions will be competitive, but they won't be known as the rate 
leader in their communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest thrift of the 38 seized Thursday is Murray Savings Assn., Dallas, 
which had assets of $1.45 billion. Also involved were 10 other thrifts in 
Texas, five in Mississippi, three in Missouri, two in Colorado, two in Indiana, 
two in Illinois and one in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC heads the joint regulatory oversight teams, which also include staff 
from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC, the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.

2 RESCUE DRIVER AFTER TRUCK HITS POWER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A garbage truck driver was in critical condition Thursday after he was shocked 
by a high-voltage wire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Garcia, 51, of Santa Ana was outside the truck using a hydraulic arm to 
lift a dumpster when it touched the live wire, sending 14,000 volts surging 
through the truck and into Garcia's body. 
</P>
<P>
The electricity knocked Garcia to the ground and blew out one of the vehicles 
front tires, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Patti Range said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's head hit the ground beneath a metal, electrified step on the truck, 
she said, and the vehicle began to sink toward him as the tire deflated. 
</P>
<P>
"Two workers ran to him and pulled him away from the truck," Range said. "They 
were lucky the dumpster sunk away from the power line" or they would have been 
shocked, too, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who works for the Dewey Disposal Co., suffered third-degree burns on 
his shoulder where the electricity left his body, and second-degree burns 
elsewhere on his body. He was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where 
he was listed in critical condition Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who saved him, Eric Rosauer, 19, of San Clemente, and Mark Grosse, 
26, of Lake Elsinore, were working nearby at the California Silica Sand Co. on 
Ortega Highway when the accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Range said that Rosauer and Grosse would be recommended for a special heroism 
award.

About a dozen students from the Capistrano Valley Christian School received 
minor injuries when a pickup truck collided with the van transporting them from 
school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident in San Juan Capistrano occurred about 3:15 p.m. when the driver of 
a silver Nissan pickup trying to make a left turn from Camino del Avion onto 
Del Obispo Street cut off the van, which was traveling straight on Camino del 
Avion, said California Highway Patrol Officer Greg Moorehead. 
</P>
<P>
None of the students were seriously injured although several students received 
minor cuts and bruises, said Ronald Blaul, battalion chief with the Orange 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Taken to Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Four students were taken toMission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo, where they were treated and released, hospital officials said. The rest 
were treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The students in the van ranged in age from about 8 to 13, said Pam Cleveland, 
dispatch supervisor for the buses. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, David Barry, 17, of Laguna Niguel, was not cited in 
the incident. Michelle Sommers, 19, of San Juan Capistrano, a passenger in the 
truck, was taken to Mission Hospital for observation and later released. And 
passenger Michael Muscarella, 18, of San Juan Capistrano, was treated at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Muscarella said he, Sommers and Barry were coming from the beach when the 
accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We're OK though, just a little shook up. It just happened really fast," he 
said at the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Yorba, who was driving the van, was taken to San Clemente Hospital for 
X-rays and later released. 
</P>
<P>
"I was about 100-feet behind him when I saw the bus swerve," said Shawn Kumar, 
who was carrying another busload of children. "My window was rolled up and I 
just heard a muffled sound. . . . The next thing I know I just saw him (Yorba) 
hit something and saw a truck coming this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident slowed down traffic along the southbound side of Del Obispo Street 
for about half a mile while traffic was detoured long Camino del Avion, CHP 
officers said.

BORDER PATROL FINDS 249 KILOS OF COCAINE IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents at the San Onofre checkpoint south of San Clemente 
opened the trunk of 1982 Oldsmobile on Thursday and found it filled to the brim 
with nearly pure cocaine -- 249 kilograms of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It filled the trunk. The lid was down, but there was no cover over it at all," 
said Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Ezell said the value of the cocaine was estimated at $4 
million, with an estimated street value of up to $35 million. The cocaine is 
cut before street sale to increase its value. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified as Felipe Santiago Moran-Pallan, 22, of Huntington Park, 
was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to distribute illegal 
drugs. Ezell said the suspect was being held at Metropolitan Correction Center 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Cozart, chief patrol agent of San Diego sector of U.S. Border Patrol, said 
three agents were involved in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hot day at this checkpoint, almost 100 degrees," Cozart said. 
"We're very pleased these agents were able to put the heat on this narcotics 
smuggler. They did an excellent job."

TOLLWAY OFFICIALS, IN EFFORT TO CUT LEGAL BILLS, ORDER STUDY OF A STAFF 
ATTORNEY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to quiet controversy over seven-figure legal bills, officials of Orange 
County's tollway agencies Thursday ordered a study of the potential benefits of 
hiring a staff attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after a partner in the politically influential law firm that 
has charged the agency $1.2 million in the last 2 1/2 years defended the 
quality and cost of its work. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm, Nossaman, Guthner, Knox &amp; Elliott, currently handles both 
general legal work and lobbying in Sacramento for the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency and the Eastern/Foothill Transportation Corridor 
Agency. The agencies are planning tollways in eastern and southern Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
A joint five-member agency finance committee Thursday ordered Executive 
Director John Meyer to study and resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Proposals Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The committee earlier rejected two separate proposals -- one to hire a 
consultant to study the question, and another to split the agency's legal 
business into separate categories for general representation and lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying work of the Nossaman firm is praised as "superlative" in a report 
submitted to the committee by members Thomas Daly, an Anaheim councilman, and 
Robert A. Curtis, a Mission Viejo councilman. However, the report recommends 
that the corridor agencies explore ways to use friendly legislators and the 
legislative counsel's office in Sacramento for some of the work now done by 
Nossaman, Guthner. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of Daly and Curtis echoed concerns raised by former tollway 
board member and former county Supervisor Bruce Nestande. Nestande, a memer of 
the California Transportation Commission, said Thursday that Nossaman, Guthner 
was never supposed to handle both general legal work and lobbying in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande was a member of both corridor agency boards in 1986 when Nossaman, 
Guthner was first hired. Nestande said board members at that time agreed to 
seek separate contracts for general legal services and lobbying. But agency 
board members said they cannot recall such an agreement and that the work was 
never divided. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes from discussions at agency meetings in 1986 show concerns on the part 
of some board members about problems that might arise by using a single law 
firm to research, draft and lobby for the same legislation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Some slow-growth advocates had also criticized the Nossaman firm's representing 
at that time both the tollway agency and an organization representing many of 
the developers who paid fees that went into the agency's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande, citing his position with the state Transportation Commission, which 
has approved some state funding for the tollways, said Thursday that he still 
has concerns about the same law firm's researching and drafting legislation, 
and then working to secure its passage. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to establish a comfort factor with the public at large that 
every single piece of work being done is essential if the same firm is 
researching, drafting and advocating the same legislation," Nestande said.

IDENTITY CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE ME NOT TO BE THAT EX-HUSBAND, SILLS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's not sure why, but Orange County Superior Court Judge David G. Sills seems 
to have a habit of falling prey to mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
A former Irvine mayor, Sills said that even today he is sometimes confused with 
a mayoral successor who shot his wife a few years back. When introduced as a 
one-time mayor of Irvine, Sills makes a point of stressing to inquisitive 
strangers that he is not "that mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sills finds himself immersed in another mini-controversy of confusion, 
this one carrying the potential for national notoriety and centering on his 
marriage two decades ago to Maureen Reagan, the ex-President's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the current issue of People magazine, Reagan reveals how she was frequently 
battered by an unidentified former husband in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The first-person article makes passing reference to Sills as her second 
husband, a reference that the judge said has sparked several calls around the 
country from confused friends who heard he had been accused of being a 
wife-beater. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to laugh about it," Sills said in an interview. But the judge is so 
distressed about the potential for confusion that on Tuesday he sent a memo to 
his colleagues making clear that he was not in fact the battering husband. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with People magazine, told of Sills' concerns, stood by the reference 
to Sills. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there's no possibility for confusion," magazine spokeswoman Betsy 
Wagner said. "It never entered our minds that he could be confused" with 
Maureen Reagan's earlier husband, who she said beat her. 
</P>
<P>
The preface to Reagan's article -- which is an excerpt from her new book, 
"First Father, First Daughter" -- refers to the beatings taking place during "a 
traumatic early marriage" at the hands of a man "she prefers not to refer to by 
name." That marriage ended in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
On the second page of the article, a caption below a photo of Reagan reads: 
"Shortly before her divorce from her second husband David Sills in 1968, Reagan 
posed for a New York fashion spread." 
</P>
<P>
Directly below that, in large print, is a quotation taken out of the article 
that says: "His voice kept getting louder and uglier. . . . All of a sudden he 
started punching me and slapping me across the face." 
</P>
<P>
Sills argued that, in the context of an article on Reagan's early-marriage 
troubles, the article can and has left some casual readers with the impression 
that he is the man who beat her up repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the high profile of the judiciary, I am particularly sensitive to this 
confusion," Sills wrote in his memo to fellow Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
He added in the interview: "Maybe I'm being oversensitive, but I just think 
that People took an awful cheap shot. I thought what they did was really 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Sills questioned why an article on wife-beating had to refer to him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Since the issue hit the stands earlier this week, Sills, who is now single, 
said he has received about a dozen calls from friends who had seen or heard 
about the article, with many mentioning possible confusion. "Look what she's 
saying about you," one friend told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Sills said he will try to forget about the incident and plans no 
legal action against People. He tried to write it off with a touch of humor, 
shaking his head in bewilderment at the events that have caused him to be 
mistaken first with Art Anthony, who resigned as mayor of Irvine in 1981 after 
shooting his wife, and now with the man who beat Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In his note to fellow judges, Sills lamented: "Alas . . . nobody seems to 
confuse my play on the links with golf pro Tony Sills."

SADDLEBACK GAME SUSPENDED AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback College's baseball game against Riverside was suspended in the ninth 
inning Thursday after a bench-clearing brawl that lasted approximately five 
minutes, according to Saddleback assistant coach Charley Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
The fight started with two outs in the top of the ninth inning and Saddleback 
leading, 8-3, at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl began after Saddleback outfielder Justin Pysar was pushed to the 
ground after being tagged out in a rundown between first and second, Saddleback 
Coach Rich Rommel said. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches cleared and Saddleback's Larry Maddox punched Jackie Jempson, 
Phillips said.

<P>
Maddox, Jempson and a second Riverside player were ejected and the umpires 
suspended the game. All three players will be suspended for one game, Rommel

Housing construction is getting off to a rather anemic start in the county this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments in February issued building permits for only 452 
single-family houses. A year ago it was 530, and that was down from 591 in 
February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments and condos were down, too, but not as much. February's permits 
totalled 401, compared to 429 last year and 504 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Land in the county is getting more scarce and more expensive, and housing 
consultants suggest that builders are more cautious this year because a 
slowdown in sales is expected. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest number of permits -- 490, for all types of housing -- was 
issued during the month in the unincorporated southern half of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat surprisingly, the small city of Garden Grove was second with 76 
multifamily units approved. MIKE FLAGG

RADICAL COMPUTER DESIGN SPEEDS UP CALCULATIONS AND COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Rodney Hornstein to explain what he means by a "massively parallel 
computer," and he is ready with a very non-technical reply. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit like a chorus line," explained Hornstein, president of Active 
Memory Technology, an Irvine computer company. "The different parts all do the 
same thing at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Active Memory Technology is one of a handful of small U.S. companies that are 
developing super-fast computers with a radically new design. This new 
generation of machines promises to speed up many complex computing tasks, such 
as simulating the airflow around an aircraft wing. At the same time, these 
machines will cost far less than the largest computers now in use. 
</P>
<P>
Known in industry jargon as "parallel processors," these computers link 
anywhere from dozens to thousands of different processors within the computer 
to simultaneously tackle a computing problem. The purpose of having many parts 
of the computer work on the same problem at once is simple: a faster solution. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional computer designs use a "serial" approach in which a single 
processor works out the problem one piece at a time. Serial, or sequential, 
technology has been the basis for most computer designs for the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
AMT calls its computer "massively parallel" because of the unusually large 
number of separate processors it uses. The company's first computer uses 1,024 
processors packed into a box about the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. And 
AMT introduced a new model last September that uses 4,096 processors. 
</P>
<P>
AMT says its parallel machines, which cost $120,000 and up, can exceed the 
performance of supercomputers, today's most powerful machines. Supercomputers, 
which utilize a small number of very powerful processors, carry price tags in 
the millions. 
</P>
<P>
Hornstein concedes that parallel architecture won't be better than 
supercomputers in all situations. While parallel processors are well-suited for 
certain types of computing tasks, such as processing radar signals, modeling 
complex scientific experiments and detecting potential flaws in sophisticated 
computer microchips, supercomputers are particularly good in applications such 
as weather forecasting and automobile design. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis are using an AMT computer in 
a federally funded project to develop a faster method for processing images 
from sophisticated medical devices known as PETT, for positron emission 
transaxial tomography scanners. The devices are primarily used for brain scans. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Morley, an associate professor in the university's engineering 
department, said the purpose of the project is to sharply reduce the processing 
time and improve the quality of PETT images. 
</P>
<P>
"The computations for producing these pictures are very complex and require 
lots of computing time on a conventional computer," Morley said. "With a 
parallel processor, we can get the pictures back in a couple of minutes rather 
than days." 
</P>
<P>
Privately held AMT was formed in 1986 when a group of venture capitalists 
bought the business from ICL Ltd., a large British computer maker. ICL spent 
$50 million over 12 years developing the technology used in AMT's machines 
before deciding that the operation didn't fit into its business plans. 
</P>
<P>
ICL still owns 17% of AMT's stock. About 13% of the stock is owned by AMT 
employees, including co-founders Hornstein and Geoffrey Manning, a British 
nuclear physicist, and various venture capital firms own the rest. 
</P>
<P>
AMT sold $6.5 million worth of its machines in 1988 and is hoping to triple 
sales in 1989. The firm was unprofitable last year, but managed to post 
"break-even" results in the final quarter, Hornstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs 45 people at its Irvine headquarters, which also is the 
site of its engineering and manufacturing operations. It also has a 45-person 
software development staff in England. 
</P>
<P>
AMT's Hornstein said the company's goals are to reach $50 million in sales by 
1991, make a "reasonable" profit and sell its stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Achieving those goals won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
The parallel-processing field has become very competitive, and the market has 
not grown as quickly as some forecasters predicted several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts projected the market would hit $500 million in 1988 and $1 
billion by 1990. But only $330 million worth of parallel machines were sold in 
1988, according to Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm. Dataquest 
projects that sales could reach $1 billion by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Willard, a Dataquest analyst, said that although sales of parallel 
computers have been growing steadily, revenue has not grown as quickly because 
the cost of the machines has been dropping. 
</P>
<P>
"That can be interpreted as a good sign to the extent that people are buying 
these systems, which will provide a future customer base," Willard said. "The 
downside is that there is a lot of price competition as a result of too many 
companies going after the same market. A lot of these companies are hurting, 
and there may be a fair shakeout in the market." 
</P>
<P>
AMT sold 36 computers in 1988, mostly in the United States and Europe. About 
half of those sales were to universities, with defense contractors and research 
institutions accounting for most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges for parallel computer makers is overcoming customers' 
reluctance to adopt what for many of them is an unfamiliar technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The market studies say we must show customers that we can improve the price 
and performance by a factor of 10 times before they are willing to consider a 
new technology," said Bill Hogan, vice president of marketing at Maspar 
Computer, a Silicon Valley company that plans to introduce a massively parallel 
computer later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan gives AMT high marks for its products and its efforts to carve out a 
place in the emerging market. "We want them to be very successful," he said. 
"All of us in this business believe the future of computing lies in parallel 
processing." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but Hornstein concedes that AMT needs to land a major order soon to 
get its business into the black and keep its investors happy. The defense 
business offers the best prospect for a big order. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is the length of time that these defense program 
deployments take," Hornstein said. "We're going to have to depend on sales to 
academic institutions in the early years in order to have the income to wait 
for the bigger defense orders." 
</P>
<P>
AMT has several orders from defense contractors, but company officials won't 
say much about them, explaining that the programs are classified. 
</P>
<P>
Hornstein said the company hopes to hear by late 1990 whether one of its 
defense customers will use AMT equipment in a large weapons system. The sale 
would provide a major financial boost for the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're either going to be very successful, or we're going to just die," 
Hornstein said. "We don't have the luxury of being in the middle."

AMERICAN HEALTH SAYS RESEARCH UNIT CAUSED $4.7-MILLION LOSS IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Health Services Corp., a medical diagnostics-imaging firm in Newport 
Beach, reported a net loss of $4.7 million for 1988, even while revenues 
climbed 158% to $14.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, the company, which operates imaging centers in hospitals and 
health centers, had a net loss of $4.6 million on revenues of $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 losses came from a subsidiary's research division, according to the 
company. The imaging centers, while amassing hefty losses in their start-up 
phases, were profitable for 1988, contributing to earnings of $736,000 from 
continuing operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discontinued Operations 
</P>
<P>
TCET -- the research division of American's subsidiary, Neuromedical 
Technologies -- was responsible for a $5.4-million loss from discontinued 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Neuromedical Technologies, which also operates the profitable Stop Smoking 
Clinics chain, is considered a discontinued operation because American Health 
expects to spin off ownership of the subsidiary next week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, American Health plans to turn over to its stockholders one share in 
the new Neuromedical Technologies company for every 10 shares of American 
Health stock they own. In addition, shareholders will have a right to buy an 
equal number of shares in the new company at $2 per share. The offering is 
expected to raise $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The TCET division -- which is developing an advanced medical treatment that 
uses an electrical stimulation brain therapy to treat nicotine, alcohol and 
drug addiction -- has been a drain on American Health because the division has 
not received federal approval to market its product. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help Continue Research 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Donald Reynolds said the money raised from the spinoff will help the 
company continue research until it begins selling its treatment. 
</P>
<P>
American Health expects TCET to receive Food and Drug Administration approval 
by the end of this year to market its "electro-stimulation" therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, director of research for Cruttenden &amp; Co., an investment 
banking firm in Newport Beach, said prospects for approval are promising. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that FDA approval might not come as soon as expected and that other 
financing sources may be needed. "The FDA is swamped with applications right 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Selwitz described Neuromedical's prospects of sales success after approval as 
similar to "a dice roll. The odds aren't great, but if they have what the tests 
say they do have, it's incredibly exciting."

CLARK, PACIFIC ILLUMINATE MAHLER, ACCOMPANY LEILA JOSEFOWICZ, 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Clark, soon-to-be ex-music director of the Pacific Symphony, gave a 
first-rate interpretation of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 Wednesday night at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The music of Mahler has always been one of Clark's strong suits, and those who 
left at intermission -- after hearing 11-year-old violinist Leila Josefowicz -- 
missed an impassioned, informed and informing reading of the composer's work. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's vision of Mahler appears to be a post-war one -- strong on design and 
structure, indifferent to the temptation to wallow in neurosis or indulge in 
schmaltz. Details consistently fell into place, with no slackening of tension 
and shape. Clark directed the musical flow, as appropriate, into little 
chamber-music eddies and grand statements. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the orchestra responded with alertness and commitment, but there was 
more than a fair share of glitches, the most glaring being premature entrances 
by back-desk violinists before the final big statement. 
</P>
<P>
What Leila can offer an adult audience is open to question. As the soloist in 
Wieniawski's Violin Concerto No. 2., she certainly commanded interest and 
respect, and she probably plays better than most, if not all, 11-year-olds. 
(For all one knows, she may play better than all 12, 13, 14 and 15-year-olds.) 
At this stage of her very young career, she shows strong technique and 
virtuosity, pitch accuracy, variety in sound and lots of promise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she did not present a fully formed vision of the music, nor did she seem 
to understand what she was playing. One can only wonder if it is to the benefit 
of her growth as a musician to present her to the public so early. 
</P>
<P>
The audience seemed enthusiastic, although not everyone participated in the 
standing ovation that brought her back -- with Clark -- for Rimsky-Korsakov's 
"The Flight of the Bumblebee" as an encore. Clark accompanied both works 
attentively. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with a lackluster reading of the Suite from Stravinsky's 
"Firebird." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, incidentally, was presented after the intermission with a resolution by 
the Orange County Board of Supervisors declaring Wednesday and Thursday "Keith 
Clark Days" in Orange County.

NEVER A 'RUNAWAY'; 
</P>
<P>
ROCKER DEL SHANNON'S STILL WRITING, RECORDING, PERFORMING WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While touring in Canada a couple of months ago, Del Shannon recalls getting a 
phone call from a booking agent in England, who berated him with, "Gene 
Pitney's No. 1 over here and (Roy) Orbison's No. 2. What are you doing? Are you 
sleeping?" 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old singer of "Runaway," "Keep Searchin'," "Hats Off to Larry" and 
other early '60s classics has yet to match the recent re-emergence of his 
ante-Beatles contemporaries, but he most certainly hasn't been hibernating. 
Shannon has been playing about 100 dates a year, spread among Europe, Japan, 
Australia and the states. (He performs in Disneyland's "Blast to the Past" 
series this weekend.) Reached by phone in Reno where he had just finished a 
benefit show for the Special Olympics, Shannon said he has also been busy 
writing songs and recording. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, around the time he got the call from England, Shannon had 
started work on a song, "Walk Away," that could propel him back into the 
mainstream. Due out in Australia next week, and still pending an American deal, 
"Walk Away" boasts an authoring and production assist from old friends Tom 
Petty and Jeff Lynne, who helped the late Roy Orbison to his final success. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an understandable amount of speculation that Shannon might be 
tapped to fill the vacancy left in the Traveling Wilburys by Orbison's lamented 
death last December. Along with Shannon's friendship with Lynne and Petty, he 
also shared certain qualities with Orbison: a distinctive, wide-ranging voice, 
and melancholy, driven songs that spoke from the vantage of an unwilling loner. 
</P>
<P>
But Shannon said rumors of his joining the Wilburys are no more than that. 
"It's a nice rumor, and I do know Jeff, Tom and George quite well, but it 
hasn't been mentioned to me at all, not even hinted. And it's certainly not my 
business to bring it up with them. But it seems the more I deny it, the more 
people think I'm going to be in it." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said he thinks that the Wilburys are one of the best things going of 
late. "I loved the album. I called Jeff as soon as I heard it and told him it 
knocked me out. Today I can hear six songs in a row on certain stations and 
they all sound the same, same production, same drum machine. It's boring, and I 
don't hear any voices. I think that's what the Wilburys did well; you hear 
voices, guitars and drums again. People have to be turned on to basic rock 'n' 
roll again." 
</P>
<P>
Where some performers can grow resentful of their oft-repeated oldies, Shannon 
said he doesn't have any trouble warming up to his old songs. "If the band is 
hot and the sound system is OK, I just automatically get into doing them. It's 
my job, and I feel great doing it. If it's a whole show of my own, I'll do more 
of what I think Del Shannon is. But for shows like Disneyland, I'll just do 
mainly hits. That's what they want to hear. I don't want to bore people. If I 
wanted that much to play nothing but 12 new songs, then I should go do it in a 
bar somewhere for peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon's most requested song was also his first record, 1961's "Runaway," 
which had originated during an on-stage jam in a Battle Creek, Mich., 
nightclub. He composed the lyrics the following day, while working at a carpet 
store. At that point Shannon was Charles Westover, the name he had been born 
with in Coopersville, Mich., in 1939. "Shannon" had been the name of a wrestler 
he had met. His boss at the carpet store had bought a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, 
and the "Del" was a contraction of that. 
</P>
<P>
Following an early interest in music sparked by country singers Hank Williams, 
Lefty Frizzell and Carl Smith, Shannon grew serious about playing music after 
winning a talent contest when he was in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with "Runaway," which spent 17 weeks at the top of the charts, he 
released a series of hits that may have been matched only by Orbison in adding 
a sense of foreboding and shadow to the pop charts. In his songs, Shannon was 
always walking alone, being deceived, going to pieces, searching for a place to 
hide and looking over his shoulder for the stranger in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody thinks mystery writers go around killing people," Shannon said, "but 
they always seem to assume singers are singing about themselves, especially if 
you write melancholy songs like me. Actually lots of those feelings were true, 
though maybe not when I wrote them. I think some came from a well of 
experiences, like being rejected when I asked a girl out when I was 13. And 
then, I wrote a lot of songs in those days which came true later in life." 
</P>
<P>
Though Shannon was better prepared to face the British invasion than many of 
his contemporaries -- he had starred in shows with the up-and-coming Beatles in 
England, and was the first American artist to cover one of their songs with 
"From Me to You" in 1963 -- he faced other troubles in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Like many artists of the time, he was receiving the less-desirable end of the 
stick from his managers. But unlike most artists, Shannon did something about 
it, taking them to court in a battle that lasted 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in their hearts, managers then really felt they weren't screwing their 
artists. They just thought the artist was nothing without them because they did 
have the power, they made the deals, so they felt you didn't deserve too much. 
Of course, I didn't believe that, and I fought it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I took them to court, even though I'd just come off 'Little Town 
Flirt,' which was a Top 20 record, I couldn't get signed by anybody. They were 
writing letters to every record company in America, saying, 'If you sign this 
artist, you could get sued.' No one would touch me. I'd had this string of 
hits, and I couldn't record. I was so frustrated, I'd go out and play golf in 
the snow." 
</P>
<P>
But as a result of his action then, Shannon owns all his song publishing and 
master recordings, which is better than most seminal rockers have fared. "I 
work with artists all the time who don't have anything. One, Paul Robi of the 
Platters, recently got a $3-million settlement after 20 years of suing and died 
the next week. That's sad. And there are still thieving people out there." 
</P>
<P>
Though the hits dwindled after 1965, Shannon became a successful record 
producer and remained a popular performer in England. He had some minor success 
there with records produced by Lynne, then with the Move and Dave Edmunds. But 
Shannon also was struggling with an increasingly hard-to-handle alcohol 
problem. 
</P>

"I was getting drunk every day, and it kept getting worse. When I was 20 I was 
drinking, and when I was 30 I was drinking more, and at 40 way too much. I 
finally started getting sober 10 years ago. Now I don't touch a drop. I eat ice 
cream. It's better than booze." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 he met longtime admirer Tom Petty, who produced the subsequent "Drop 
Down and Get Me" album, which led to a Top-40 hit with a cover of "Sea of Love" 
(the same song more recently revived by Robert Plant). 
</P>
<P>
"Tom and I met, and he said he'd like to produce me, but I explained that I was 
getting ready then to go to Nashville to record some country things. And Tom 
said, 'Hell, you can do country stuff when you're 60. You're a rocker man.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Shannon most definitely wouldn't mind a resurgence in his career similar 
to that of some other veteran rockers, he says life has been good to him as is. 
</P>
<P>
"You're forgotten by some people, but not all, and with those that don't 
forget, you're all right. That will give you work forever. But it's nice to get 
in the studio and do something new, though it is coming back to me how much 
work it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do now is easy. I get to travel over the world, work an hour a night 
and get paid well. Now I'm in the studio again, and I'm finding it's like the 
old days. I can't walk by my guitar at home; I have to pick it up. I'm picking 
and writing songs all the time. Something is driving me inside. I couldn't 
possibly stop now. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I was going to cut down this year, and I'm twice as busy. I laughed at 
Willie Nelson, wondering why he spends all his life on that tour bus. And I 
look at myself, and I'm sitting in airplanes half the time." 
</P>

TRATTORIA PUTS OUT GOOD FARE, AND THERE'S NARY A SIDEWALK IN SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hold everything. A trattoria without a sidewalk? The Italian government has 
dissolved over less. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's is a Costa Mesa trattoria struggling to be an Italian sidewalk cafe. 
The problem? It's attached to a supermarket complex,and graded asphalt 
surrounds the entire building. There isn't an outdoor table or a strolling 
musician in sight. 
</P>
<P>
But don't fret. The heart of a good trattoria is behind the kitchen stove. And 
Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple who opened the restaurant 13 
months ago, know that. The modest, home-cooked fare they serve has plenty of 
richly flavored sauces, finely minced herbs, and occasional surprises. Their 
food may not exactly remind you of Mama, but it doesn't remind you of Mama 
Celeste, either. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tiny place, really, with about 10 tables covered in 
red-and-white-checked cloth and squeezed around a large deli counter. A dark, 
terra cotta floor makes the room look even smaller. The long, glass deli case 
is filled with marinated salads, imported salami and gooey desserts. Behind it, 
Mark and his assistant keep busy in the open kitchen, while Julie takes the 
orders and brings the food. 
</P>
<P>
The nice thing about a mom-and-pop restaurant like Garduno's is that the 
cooking can be free-form. Instead of matching pastas with sauces like so many 
restaurants do, the Garduno's just list all the possibilities of pastas and 
sauces and leave the choice to you. 
</P>
<P>
Mark will also custom-make a sauce for you with any combination of things he 
has on hand, and, if it strikes his fancy, name it after you. Just think. 
Dinner and immortality for one low price. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Mark did for me was customize his garlic bread. It's listed on the 
menu as bruschetta, but it's more like a baked loaf with garlic, cheese, 
tarragon and a few spices. I asked him to make me one by rubbing the bread with 
garlic and pouring olive oil over it. He did, and it was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm not implying that you should get too fancy with the guy -- most of his 
pastas are already too good to pass up. Each pasta dish is made to order with 
sauces such as pesto, arrabbiata and vongole, and they are worth the wait. I 
adored a chewy linguine with a creamy carbonara, loaded with fresh peas, bits 
of pancetta (Italian bacon) and sauteed mushrooms. Fusilli (twirly spirals of 
pasta) is terrific paired in the chunky, tomato-based sauce listed as salsiccia 
-- it's made with big pieces of meaty Italian sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Al forno pastas (oven-baked) are the opposite of lite beer: more filling. And 
they don't taste great. Maybe it's because some -- the cannelloni, for instance 
-- are kept in a steam table. My cannelloni came stuffed with minced veal and 
spinach that had seen better days by the time I tasted it. Maybe it simply had 
been sitting too long. The steam-table lasagna looked better -- it must have 
been a foot high, and people at the next table were talking it up with vigor. 
Next time. 
</P>
<P>
Besides pasta, a full Italian menu is served, including creations from the chef 
that change daily. Appetizers such as mussels and clams in a cioppino-style 
stew are excellent, as is the insalata caprese, fresh tomato and basil with 
bufala mozzarella. A thick three-bean soup served with most entrees is full of 
oregano, thyme and other intoxicating spices. And Julie is pretty proud of the 
restaurant's scarola, a hot vegetable dish of escarole, spinach and romaine 
sauteed together with garlic and served hot. It is so light and fragrant that 
it is almost like a Chinese vegetable dish. It makes a good complement to veal 
or other heavily sauced dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Even better is the group of dishes Garduno calls secondo piatto (or second 
dish), usually listed on the blackboard above the counter. On any given day, 
there will be sun-dried tomatoes, fresh artichoke, porcini mushrooms and other 
Italian delicacies incorporated into original dishes using pork, sea bass or 
whatever the chef has on hand. I had a puff pastry with layers of meats and 
vegetables called torta Siciliana -- in homage to the Garduno Sicilian 
background. The dish is heavier than torta rustica of Northern Italy, with more 
lingering tastes. I wouldn't say it works. 
</P>
<P>
Best from the regular menu might be the vitello al limone, tender, white veal 
in a slightly thick sauce made from lemon, butter and capers. Pass on the 
involtini di pollo, or stuffed chicken breast. Mine was mostly stuffing (in 
fact the same stuffing in the cannelloni), and it too had come from the steam 
table. If you insist on chicken, order the pollo paesana, a saute with fresh 
peppers, onion and peas. Think of this dish as Italian-style fajitas. 
</P>
<P>
Because Southern Italian cooking can be substantial, one would expect the 
desserts to be light. Not here. Julie's sister makes the cheesecakes, and they 
are terrific. I liked the caramel pecan variation best. There is a fine, rummy 
tirami su, but I found it so rich that two bites seemed an indulgence. Some 
store-bought cannoli, horns of cheese dough filled with a custardy cream made 
by the chef, are about the lightest sweet on hand. Better find a long sidewalk 
and head down it after your cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
Garduno's is moderately priced. Antipastos are $1.75 to $6.95. Pastas are 
priced from $6.95 to $10.95 (oven-baked pastas are all $6.95). Main dishes are 
$9.95 to $13.95, and include soup or salad, and pasta.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eat health-conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless litle gem, owned and 
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means 
"jade leaf"). Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil. 
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls, and stir-fried chicken in an edible 
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground 
pork with chili. Pad Thai are fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar, rubbery 
fish cakes with mint and cilantro, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Far Pavilions, 1520 West Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 548-7167. Open 
seven days, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant, beachfront Indian dining. Far Pavilions has a surfeit of specialties 
hard to find in other local restaurants: minced chicken balls in a spicy tomato 
puree; bhindi masala, a.k.a. curried okra; Bihari kabab, a saucy chicken dish 
from north central India. Some flavors run together here, but you can avoid 
that problem by sandwiching dishes in the fine tandoori breads from the 
restaurant's clay oven. Meats from the same oven are so good they should be 
eaten bareheaded, kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m., to 11 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new 
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest 
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red, '80s-chic motif 
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen, and a comal, the high-tech 
version of a stone tortilla cooker. The restaurant smokes its own meats, and 
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila. 
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz, 211 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton (714) 738-9339 and 158 W. Main St., 
Tustin (714) 731-9807. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenery Natural Kitchen, 119 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton (714) 
870-0981 and 323 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim (714) 761-8103. Open Monday through 
Fridays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays 10 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on a college campus; the food 
they serve does too. Best avoid the frozen poultry casseroles in favor of the 
meatless dishes like stuffed squash or veggie lasagna. Desserts like carrot 
cake and apple pie are reminiscent of a church bake sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenery is a modest, unadorned storefront restaurant with homey, 
health-conscious fare. Best dishes are the lentil burrito, with guacamole, and 
the unburger, made from ground nuts and brown rice. 
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 5 to 10 p.m., to 11 Fridays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this 
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly 
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you 
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop, and 
catfish entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE. 
Open seven days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., to 12 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's 
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe. 
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired 
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with 
roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the 30-foot vinyl crocodile 
sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic 
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an 
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no 
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a 
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory 
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music 
accompanying her is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m., weekends until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic-centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the 
New Wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and 
jackfruit. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open seven 
days from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban style 
cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa 
rellena, a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs, is about the best 
appetizer. Roast chicken Cubano, a crispy half chicken with bitter orange peel 
added for extra dimension, is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert 
-- it is the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery 
suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened 
this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange, and already it 
has become a county hot spot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous 
antipasto and then move on to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand-extruded 
homemade pastas (such as chewy ruotelle, little, six-spoked wheels perfect for 
soaking up sauce). Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has included 
polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should try it. His 
polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
California Pizza Kitchen, Newport Center/Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center 
Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. 
to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays to 11, Sundays to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 80s has come the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenom is 
here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on, anyway. 
This slicked-down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young, 
beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped 
with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat 
indifferent at present; high-energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should 
fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far 
from the tree; five-cheese, homemade sausage, and a delicious barbecued 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares? When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and 
the bottomless mugs of ice-cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's, in the Disneyland Hotel, 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
778-6600. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Hotel might not immediately spring to mind when the subject of 
restaurants comes up, but it ought to: Granville's, its flagship restaurant, is 
one of the best around. The room is designed for elegance, with mahogany 
sideboards, Regency-style chairs and overwhelming shades of burgundy. Chef Tim 
Owen trained with Boston cooking teacher Madeleine Kamman, and his cuisine is 
original and delicate. Such appetizers as Little Neck clams steamed in Pernod 
with spinach are wonderful, as are such entrees as loin of lamb in an anise 
crust, oven roasted with thyme and rosemary. There is an extensive wine list 
(featuring American wines only), and the service is impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Nakorn, 8674 Stanton Ave., Buena Park. (714) 952-4954. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Nakorn is an innocent looking storefront restaurant -- but inside awaits 
the blistering fare of northeast Thailand, arguably the world's hottest 
cuisine. A long list of specialties will make a believer out of you, ones like 
larb, ground pork with brown rice, onion, lime juice and chili, or nuad dad 
deal, a dried, salted beef with a faint aftertaste of the sea. Appetizers show 
the restaurant's class: Try a savage barbecued shrimp salad with mint sprig, 
and a homemade sausage wrapped up in cabbage leaves. Frog, eel and other 
exotica can be ordered from a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
McCharles House, 335 South C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch, 2 to 6 p.m. for tea; Thursdays through 
Saturdays 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now is your chance at 
this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in old town Tustin. You'll 
even get heart-shaped scones. Audrey Heredia and her daughter Vivian fuss over 
this dining and tea room, a spinster's fantasy of wooden tables, tasseled lamps 
and enough doilies to make Gladys Cooper an overcoat. Lunch is a choice of 
salads and little tea sandwiches. Dinner is simple and sweet. Don't miss a 
tempting array of home-baked goodies such as the rich chocolate cake served 
with clotted cream. 
</P>
<P>
Spats, 901 Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 558-1883. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m to 2 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Spats is one of those maddeningly confusing little restaurants where it is 
impossible to know what you are supposed to be eating. The chef is Japanese. 
The menu is Italian and Japanese. The ambience is pure California. Best to try 
are the more Japanese dishes like broiled beef on bamboo skewer, fresh oysters 
in the shell with Japanese dipping sauce, and soba, handmade buckwheat noodles 
treated with a simple respect. Avoid the gummy pastas and the pretentious 
Western concoctions. Most of them are better left to the concept stage. There 
is an adjoining disco if you get too impatient waiting for service. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Fish Company, 11061 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (213) 
594-4553. Open Sundays through Thursdays 11 a.m to 10 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Order mesquite broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or 
enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore 
tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the 
restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of 
them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart, lemon mousse pie. 
</P>
<P>
Soup Exchange, 151 E. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 992-5522. Open daily 
11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Salmagundi, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. (714) 549-9267. Open Mondays 
through Saturdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sundays noon to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Eat soup, live longer at these two emporia for our favorite comfort food. Soup 
Exchange is the slicker and less expensively packaged of the two, a soup and 
salad bar with such extras as frozen yogurt and muffins and a nacho bar to 
boot. It's all you can eat and every man for himself. Salmagundi is homier and 
even a bit trendy, with such exotic soups as tortilla, wild rice and country 
Cheddar; they change daily. Salmagundi also has a dessert bar where you can 
indulge in such goodies as trifle, apple brown betty and chocolate mousse. 
Either restaurant redefines the word excess. 
</P>
<P>
Scampi, 1576 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-8560. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Scampi is the name of a dark, noisy and unassuming Neapolitan style trattoria 
that has come to the nether reaches of Newport Boulevard, and it is already 
bringing new energy to the street. Chef Massimo Navaretta specializes in 
scampi, those outsized Italian crustaceans with a flavor between lobster and 
shrimp, but does many other things to perfection as well. Zuppa di vongole, the 
house version of steamed clams, has mysterious fragrances from a combination of 
herbs. Timballo di verdure, a flat noodle layered with fresh ricotta, 
vegetables, and herbs, is irresistible. Wear your T-shirt. The waiters do. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8998. Open 
Tuesdays through Thursdays 5 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatino's is familiar, Chicago import Italian, complete with a romantic beach 
view, the best sausage this side of Cicero, and cloying lounge-lizard music. As 
long as you don't mind hearing "Mama" three times during dinner, you will love 
the place. Owner Pete Sabatino mixes an outstanding Caesar table-side, using 
pickled garlic cloves that he hoards in a jar. Pastas are mostly fresh, with 
thick, flavorful sauces like pesto and Alfredo. Main courses, as in most 
restaurants of this genre, are almost beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
Shan-Li Palace, 5634 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 779-1410. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays to 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This Mandarin-style Chinese restaurant is further proof that gentrification is 
spreading like a brush fire. It is nestled snugly in the Anaheim Hills not far 
from the Riverside County line; a few years back you couldn't have found a 
hamburger stand in these parts. Order the steamed dumplings, despite the fact 
that the waiter may try to discourage you. They are wonderful. Spinach bean 
curd soup tastes as fresh as if the spinach came from out back. Twice cooked 
pork is fiery and colorful. Moo-shu dishes, minced meats and veggies rolled up 
burrito style, are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Mene's Terrace, 23532 El Toro Road (Orange Tree Plaza), El Toro. (714) 
830-3228. Open Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 9:30 p.m., 
Saturdays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mene's Terrace is like a sun-splashed Aegean taverna, transported magically to 
an El Toro shopping mall. You know you are not in Greece because you can see 
the Denny's just outside the window. The menu is small, but everything is 
prepared the way an Orthodox grandmother would prepare it. Tiropita and 
spanakopita, little cheese and spinach pies in a filo crust, are near perfect. 
The egg lemon soup is even better. Wonderful char-grilled meats, marinated in 
lemon juice and Greek spices, are served with rice pilaf and pan roasted 
potatoes. There is even complimentary baklava at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
A La Carte Bistro, 16847 Algonquin Road (Huntington Harbour Mall), Huntington 
Beach. (714) 840-8152. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., 
Fridays to 10 p.m., Saturdays 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The A La Carte Bistro has a giant menu for such a tiny space, and the portions 
are giant to match. Chef Friedrich Rechberger has a dedication that borders on 
fanaticism, and a deft hand behind the range. You have got to see the house 
salad to believe it, a huge, European-style platter of mixed salads that comes 
with dinner. Such game dishes as rabbit, venison, and quail abound. A must here 
is one of the chef's special desserts, such as Kaiserschmarn, a chopped-up, 
butter-fried pancake served with powdered sugar and pureed apricot. Guaranteed 
to keep the wolf from the door for days. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Khyber, 1000 N. Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-5200. Open Sundays 
through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and daily 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine at Royal Khyber is the rich Mughlai type from north India and the 
restaurant has a richness to match; it resembles a maharaja's palace. The best 
time to visit is for Sunday brunch, when a tempting array of more than 20 
dishes is spread out before you. Meats cooked in the 800-degree tandoor are 
tender and crumbly with exotic spices. Biryani, a simple basmati rice dish with 
peas and fried onions is soft and fragrant. Among the many other dishes, 
chicken curry, channa masala (stewed garbanzo beans) and the dessert, a 
carrot-almond pudding, are most memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Tootsie's Sidewalk Cafe, Newport Center/Fashion Island, 327 Newport Center 
Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 759-9000. Open Mondays through Saturdays 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m., Sundays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
 Tootsie's is a bit overdone for a sidewalk cafe, and the prices are rather 
steep. Nonetheless, the place is fun. It is an exaggerated-looking pink room 
that dares you to like it, complete with poster art, columns and gaudy mirrored 
tables. Food is average, but desserts, made by Tootsie herself, are 
outstanding. Flaky apple dumplings are served warm with vanilla ice cream and a 
perfect caramel sauce. A wonderful chocolate pecan pie has a dense chocolate 
mixture folded in. Cheesecake is topped with an outrageously rich turtle 
topping. Come to think of it the whole place is a bit outrageous.

</P>
<P>
STUDENTS OFFER THEIR SOLUTIONS FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From runaway teen-agers to the unemployed, from parents with children to the 
elderly, the streets of most major cities in our country are filling up with 
homeless people. Efforts are being made to provide shelter and food, but Hot 
Topics wonders: "How would you go about solving the problem of so many homeless 
people in the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
"Comic Relief is doing a good job of raising money for the homeless. People 
should just help out with churches who help the homeless in their communities." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Crim, 16, 
</P>
<P>
sophomore, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"Enlist as many of them as possible into the armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Tuffley, 19, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"Government should support our country and attend to our homeless and poor 
before helping other countries' homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wheat, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"The government needs to create more public-works programs so that homeless 
people can earn money while improving their districts and building low-cost 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Pierce, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"Government-funded housing should be provided under contract that (the 
homeless) work in a public-service job or repay by finding other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Jackson, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"You need to provide them with a means of making money. The federal government 
should set up a system by which homeless people get paid a certain amount for 
each hour they work on a public-service project (i.e., roads, buildings, 
monuments). If any of them have special talents, government could set up an 
agency by which they could put them with companies that need that talent. 
Housing should be provided by the government as well, kind of a loan to the 
homeless until they could pay it off. Of course, government would have to 
monitor these people to make sure they don't squander their money on liquor and 
drugs. Perhaps they could set up a community for the homeless in which they 
grow their own food, build their own houses -- a utopia." 
</P>

"First, have the government admit that there is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Karin Stein, 17, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
"Say that the most money you can make in one year is $1 million. The rest of 
the money should go to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
"Let people who live on the streets by choice stay there. Give the others a 
place to live and a job." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Green, 17, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Dana Hills 
</P>
<P>
"Re-prioritize government spending. Stop spending money on new military toys." 
</P>
<P>
Ian Fletcher, 18, 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"Give them a home." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Oprison, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Dana Hills 
</P>
<P>
"The tax system should be changed to where the rich pay more than middle and 
lower classes. A percentage of this money should be put toward helping the 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Kris Opbrook, 17, 
</P>
<P>

"Donate money for shelters and do volunteer work."

earthquakes and other disasters." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Rowe, 16, 
</P>
<P>
junior, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
"Increase funding to programs to help the homeless. Make more trade schools for 
them to be able to learn a trade. Make benefits for people who hire the 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Corona, 16, 
</P>
<P>
junior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
"Do what France did after World War II. Because many homes were destroyed after 
the war, the French built apartments which were low-rent, large housing 
developments. They also need jobs, so they could be given jobs as janitors in 
industrial buildings. Since most are not educated, those positions would not 
require education or experience." 
</P>
<P>
Lorena Perez, 17, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
"Some homeless people have made that choice to be homeless because they don't 
have the opportunity to be successful and to educate (themselves) and to do the 
little things they're supposed to do to make it to the top." 
</P>
<P>
Visco Ancich, 16, 
</P>
<P>
sophomore, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna take a lot of government aid and these people need education. They 
need to be offered child care, and they need to motivate and discipline 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Lathrup, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
"Build more cheap, government-funded homes around the most populated slums. In 
Europe they have many semi-high-rises that can house hundreds of people 
relatively cheap in densely populated places. These houses are really popular 
in Europe and they can be built very tastefully and safely." 
</P>
<P>
Monica Gyulai, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, University 
</P>
<P>
"We should provide more chances for homeless people to live better, and more 
chances for being accepted into society. It's hard to find jobs if they're 
dressed poorly and don't have a home. They should be able to have housing 
first, then they might find jobs to support themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Chung, 17, 
</P>
<P>
senior, University 
</P>
<P>
"If they want help, there should be appropriate funds and housing for them." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Piper, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"Make the people that don't have jobs get off their duffs and work. They can 
train with ROP for free." 
</P>
<P>
Brandi Burton, 17, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"If more Americans gave a damn, there wouldn't be such a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Catanio, 15, 
</P>
<P>
freshman, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"Gather people together and plan fund-raisers; then, with any funds the 
government and churches provided, we should build a building to house the 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Flores, 16, 
</P>
<P>
junior, Western 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a homeless tax collected every 6 months. All of the money 
would go to providing homes for them and putting them back into the community." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Holder, 14, 
</P>
<P>
freshman, Western

"Strike out the address requirement on job applications. That way, a person

RANDY ROBERTS IS WALKING THE NATION, MILE BY MILE BY MILE, WITH 10,000 
STRANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI BORAMANAND, Nikki Boramanand is a 17-year-old senior at Connelly High 
School, where she is a member of the student council. She has been accepted at 
UC San Diego, where she will major in chemistry and psychology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to say exactly what I expected. My religion teacher at Connelly High 
School in Anaheim, Tom Cendejas, had told me about a man who was walking across 
the United States -- each mile with different people (10,000 in all) from all 
walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the "American Journey" and the man who has been walking since 
last December is Randy Roberts. Cendejas likened Roberts' walk to "Hands Across 
America" -- the 1986 effort that joined people in a nationwide effort to 
publicize and alleviate the problems of hunger and homelessness in America. 
This time around, the beneficiary of any donations will be the Homeless Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
When Cendejas explained to the class that Roberts' American Journey was to 
partially raise awareness of social justice issues in our country, I half 
expected someone to be walking with and enlightening his fellow travelers on 
the evils of contemporary society. 
</P>
<P>
But my apprehension could not have been further from the truth, as I found out 
on a Saturday in March when I joined Roberts in walking that mile. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived at Pearson Park in Anaheim shortly after 3 p.m., and there, sitting 
at a picnic table under a modest banner marked by the logo of the American 
Journey was a mustached man who, as I approached, stood up and stuck out his 
hand to greet me. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing himself as Randy Roberts, he put a friendly hand on my shoulder as 
he explained that as we walked he would be recording our conversation for 
future use and reference. Roberts, 40, a Santa Ana architect who is also a 
seminar speaker and self-development instructor/trainer, said he plans a 
speaking tour of the country once his journey is complete, which he figures 
won't be for another 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
As we began our walk, I was surprised to discover that our conversation was 
primarily aimed toward me and my life. 
</P>
<P>
The American Journey, Roberts later told me, "is about people -- people who 
have something to say. It is an honest, open diary of who we as Americans are . 
. . that even though we are different, we are all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"And in the end, part of the American Journey is to show us that our 
differences don't mean a hill of beans, and that what we have in common is most 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts began our conversation by asking me such simple questions as where I 
was born and where I lived. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was born in Ft. Worth, Tex., in 1948 -- the elder of two children. 
</P>
<P>
He then proceeded to ask me about what he referred to as "the two subjects you 
never discuss with a stranger" -- religion and politics. I had no trouble with 
the question about religion, having attended Catholic schools for the past 11 
years, but I did have some trouble when Roberts wanted me to describe my 
political affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
At 17, I explained to him, it's really hard to say, yes, I'm a left-wing 
liberal or a right-wing conservative and fully understand the implications of 
what I'm saying. An understanding smile made its way across Roberts' sunburned 
face. He had already walked 13 miles in 80-degree weather that day. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was also interested in my family, my heroes and what was important to 
me. I was able to answer most of his questions with surprising ease and 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
I described my heroes, who, aside from my parents -- are mostly teachers at 
Connelly who possess qualities and traits I'd like to develop. I spoke candidly 
about what was important to me -- my family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has several heroes, including his father, a few teachers, John F. 
Kennedy, R. Buckminster Fuller and Walter Cronkite -- "people who risk, people 
who care about others who are less fortunate, and people who ignore cynics and 
make decisions, yet can admit when they are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, he was no longer a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Journey will bring people from all walks of life together to 
share a common base," Roberts told me. 
</P>
<P>
"You now have something in common with all the others I have walked with, and 
they have something in common with you -- yet, you've never met each other." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts wanted to know what I would ask President Bush if I had 5 minutes alone 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
I told him of a Calvin &amp; Hobbes comic strip that showed Calvin explaining 
to Hobbes that whoever got shot with a suction-cup dart was dead and that the 
other side would win. In the end, they shoot each other simultaneously and 
Calvin says, "Kind of a stupid game, isn't it?" I would like to tell the 
President of the strip and then ask him why we keep spending so much on the 
nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the effect I hope the American Journey will have," Roberts said, "is 
to help others express themselves to George Bush and other Americans." 
</P>
<P>
As we returned to the picnic table, I realized just how quickly the time and 
mile had passed. 
</P>
<P>
But he was already off again, this time with my religion teacher, on another 
mile's journey. 
</P>
<P>
I sat down and wrote my page in the "American Journal" -- a log book that 
Roberts will ask all 10,000 Americans who will eventually participate with him 
on his journey to write in. He hopes to publish the journal. 
</P>
<P>
Among the things I wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I have been touched, both by the hand of a man I've never met before, 
and even more importantly, by his heart . . . a heart that no doubt has touched 
others as he has walked his mile with them."

NOT MUCH REASON TO FEAR TOOTHPASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Cecil Adams' column "The Straight Dope," which has appeared in alternative 
newspapers since 1973, he answered the following letter: 
</P>
<P>
I understand some brands of toothpaste contain sugar. Would you be a consumer 
advocate and list those that do so I can avoid them? 
</P>
<P>
"Most brands of toothpaste contain not sugar but a very small amount of 
saccharin, about 0.2% of the total volume," Adams writes. "As you may know, 
there have been reports linking saccharin to cancer in laboratory rats, but 
industry spokesmen claim that a healthy 150-pound adult would have to eat 606 
standard size 5.5-ounce tubes of toothpaste every day for 50 years in order to 
reach the level of saccharin that caused the rat tumors. 
</P>
<P>
"A sweetener of some kind is clearly necessary; unsweetened toothpaste is about 
as yummy as a stick of chalk. Other toothpaste ingredients include natural 
flavoring such as spearmint or peppermint, beefed up by emulsifiers, 
preservatives and artificial flavors. These also are thought to be harmless, 
but you never know. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally I am oblivious to considerations of personal safety, but if you 
would rather not risk it, you might want to get yourself a box of baking soda 
and brush with that. For flavor you can throw in a little cinnamon." 
</P>
<P>
Will the calories consumed late at night turn instantly to fat when you fall 
asleep? 
</P>
<P>
No, a Washington physician says: If you're not overweight, you probably don't 
need to worry about late-night snacking. "It's not the time (we eat) so much as 
the amount of calories we ingest compared with what we spend," said Dr. Artemis 
Simopoulos, director of Washington's Center for Genetics, Nutrition and Health 
of the American Assn. for World Health and author of a report on late-night 
snacking in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. "I don't think it matters 
when you eat. If you keep the expenditure and intake in balance, you're not 
going to gain weight." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Grant Gwinup, professor of endocrinology and metabolism at UC Irvine's 
College of Medicine, agrees: "For normal-weight people, late-night eating is 
not a problem. But for obese people, it's bad to eat late at night." If you're 
trying to lose weight, "have five or six very small meals during the day," he 
advises. "And schedule the last meal so you're mildly hungry before bedtime."

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: HE HAS HUNGER UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Roberts can't stand the heat, but he stays in the kitchen anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa fire captain, Roberts would just as soon the alarm -- signifying 
human tragedy out there somewhere -- never rang. 
</P>
<P>
But the kitchen is a different story because that's the fun part of the job. 
Roberts, 37, loves to cook and obviously enjoys preparing large meals at the 
Baker Street station where he works. 
</P>
<P>
"Quantity matters more than anything else," he says. "These guys eat!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the favorites of the eight-man crew is the chicken wing recipe Roberts 
shared with Guys &amp; Galleys. "It's simple but very tasty," he says. "I 
usually make a minimum of 15 pounds of the things. We eat them hot or cold, as 
a main course or as an appeizer." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts says he and one other firefighter generally share the cooking chores. 
"All fire stations are different," he says. "In some of them, all the guys like 
to cook, and in others -- like ours -- there are a couple of us who really 
enjoy it, so the others just say, 'Have at it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a 14-year veteran of the department who lives in Trabuco Canyon with 
his wife, Mary Jane, and 5-year-old son, also pitches in at home. "My wife is a 
wonderful cook, but she lets me try my hand now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"While I like Mexican and Oriental foods, at home I generally keep it simple -- 
roasts, steaks and some chicken dishes."

JUDGE MAY CUT AWARD TO HUDSON'S LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the landmark AIDS lawsuit of Rock Hudson's lover said today there 
is significant evidence supporting a jury's decision that Hudson was guilty of 
outrageous conduct for hiding his AIDS diagnosis, but he said he will consider 
lowering the award. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert, launching a critical hearing to review 
the jury's decision, said he is inclined to deny a motion from the Hudson 
estate to throw out the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he will give lengthy consideration to motions asking that the 
jury's $21.75-million award to Marc Christian be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"There is significant evidence supporting the jury's verdict," the judge said. 
But he added there were also significant points raised on the question of 
whether the financial award is excessive and whether jurors were guilty of 
misconduct in deciding the monetary figure. 
</P>
<P>
"The motions are lengthy, and they raise significant points," Geernaert said. 
"We will take whatever time is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he will consider a claim that new evidence has arisen involving 
sexual accusations against Christian by a man who came forward after the 
verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden, had indicated before the hearing began that 
he might be willing to accept less than the full jury award. Rhoden said he 
would not be surprised if Geernaert reduced the award, which was considered 
excessive in some legal circles.

"To my knowledge this is the first time we have endorsed a bill with a waiting

endorsing an Oregon bill that would require a 15-day waiting period for buying 
a pistol. Judy said it also is the first time the most powerful anti-gun 
control lobby in the nation has actually helped develop a bill requiring

TEMPERATURES HIT RECORD HIGHS IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR FOURTH DAY 
</P>

<P>
Temperatures in Orange County reached record highs for the fourth consecutive 
day today. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the temperature in Santa Ana was 99. At El Toro Marine Corps Air Base 
it was 95 at 1 p.m. and at Fullerton Airport it was 97 at that hour. The 
previous record high for this date in Orange County was 91 degrees, recorded in 
1939 in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The past three days have been the hottest ever in April in Orange County. On 
Thursday a 112-degree reading was recorded in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
But today will be the last day of record-setting heat, according to Pat Cooper, 
a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the weekend it looks like we'll have more of a sea breeze. The ridge of 
high pressure that's bringing the hot weather will break down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooper still expects weekend temperatures in the 90s around the county and 
she added that some areas may reach 100-degree readings. By Monday or Tuesday, 
she said, temperatures will drop to the 80s inland and the 70s along the coast.

Koop, the top U.S. public health official since 1982, is a well-known leader in 
the effort to create "smoke-free" societies, repeatedly warning people that 
smoking increases the risk of many diseases.

A 26-year-old stabbing victim whose life-support system was disconnected eight 
days ago over the objections of his assailant died today nearly four years 
after the attack that left him in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Lane said her son, Mark Weaver, died at about 2 a.m. "He died 
peacefully. He never had a moment's pain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was being performed today at the request of the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver's feeding tube was removed last week after a probate judge ruled that 
Weaver's assailant, Noel Pagan, could not intervene. Pagan, who has served 
three years in prison for aggravated assault in the 1985 attack, feared he 
would be charged with murder if Weaver died. State prosecutors have declined to 
say whether they will bring a new charge against Pagan.

Riot police today fired tear gas and rubber bullets at thousands of 
stone-throwing Palestinians after Muslim prayers at Al Aqsa mosque, one of 
Islam's holiest shrines. 
</P>
<P>
Clouds of tear gas rose from the complex at Temple Mount, a Palestinian 
national symbol as well as the site of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by 
the Romans in AD 70. A barrage of shots was heard several hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
At least five police officers and three Palestinians were injured, said 
Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian television cameraman Wolfgang Scheider was hit in the face with a rock 
and collapsed when a barrage of stones were hurled at a building from which 
reporters watched the prayers. Scheider was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested 37 Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
A similar protest occurred in the West Bank city of Hebron. Hundreds of 
worshipers chanting nationalist slogans stoned troops who opened fire. Four 
Palestinians were wounded, and the army clamped a curfew on the city. 
</P>
<P>
The violence in Jerusalem came after 25,000 people attended noon prayers on the 
first day of Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting and religious fervor. After 
prayers, police said 4,000 worshipers raised five outlawed Palestinian flags 
and burned two Israeli flags. They chanted "Palestine is Muslim!" and 'Allahu 
Akbar!" (God is great).

Refugees seeking asylum, particularly Yugoslavs and Poles, are pouring into 
West Germany at almost double the record rate of 1988, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry statement said 34,812 asylum-seekers were registered in 
the first three months of 1989, compared with 18,527 in the corresponding 
period last year. A total of 103,000 arrived in 1988. About half the 11,235 
people who arrived last month were Yugoslavs and Poles, followed by Turks, Sri 
Lankans and Lebanese. 
</P>
<P>
The refugee influx has led to the emergence of anti-foreigner rightist parties 
in regional elections, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government has 
begun a crackdown to reverse its sinking popularity.

Rich investors flush with cash freed by new capital gains rules have poured 
money into Japan's stock market at an unprecedented rate and helped push it to 
new highs, market analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the torrent of yen pouring into the market has flowed from the 
country's thriving underground economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Underground money is coming out from under the rocks," said one broker. 
</P>
<P>
"The black market in Europe and Asia is associated with the Mafia and drugs," 
said the president of an investment advisory company. "But in Japan most of it 
comes from illegal property transactions." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very cash-rich individuals more or less leading the market," said 
Ross Rowbury, a senior broker at Sanyo Securities. "Institutions were left 
standing with their mouths open." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great taxation policy. Everyone is happy," said Rowbury. "Wealthy 
individuals are happy, securities houses are happy because the market is 
buoyant and the government is happy because it is getting money." 
</P>
<P>
The new capital gains tax system took effect April 1 and applies only to 
individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, there was no capital gains tax unless individuals traded 
over 120,000 shares or did over 30 transactions a year. If they did, the gains 
were taxed along with other income at a high rate and income sources had to be 
revealed to tax authorities who often asked the source of vast sums used for 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Now the rich are free to trade to their hearts' content without having to 
report the source of their capital. Individuals can either pay a 1% tax on 
stock transactions at the time of the sale or a 26% tax on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
The 26% option means going to the tax office and revealing all income sources. 
About 90% of individual investors have so far chosen the 1% solution instead, 
brokers said.

The sap from maple trees is running so slow in parts of the Northeast that some 
towns have canceled their annual pancake breakfasts for lack of syrup.

"One guy told me he didn't do enough to cover his pancakes," said Wilson Clark, 
president of the Vermont Maple Sugarmakers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The season for tapping maple trees for sap, which is boiled down to syrup, is 
nearing the end in southern New England amid signs that warm weather and an 
insect with a taste for maples will sharply lower syrup production. "Everybody 
is down at least 50% to 75%, with more on the heavy side," said Edward 
McColgan, president of the Massachusetts Maple Sugar Producers Assn.

The 10 Boeing 737-400 and six Boeing 737-500 aircraft will replace the

Aziz told the official Bernama news agency. He said that the sales agreement

1992. The 737-200s will be auctioned off.

The leaders of Japan's four major opposition parties today formed a united 
front to try to drive scandal-plagued Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita from 
office, which analysts now say is an increasingly likely possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The public broadcasting network NHK reported that the leaders of the Socialist 
Party, the Clean Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the 
Social Democratic Federation will jointly press for Takeshita's ouster and a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
The four leaders met for the first time in more than two years as a result of a 
perception that now is the most dynamic period in Japanese politics since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said, after a week of damaging revelations, that it looked 
increasingly likely that Takeshita would have to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese newspapers today reported that the prime minister had received 
an additional $190,000 from the Recruit Co., the enterprise at the heart of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week an aide admitted that Takeshita's political support group 
had received $275,000 in May, 1987, from the publishing and telecommunications 
group accused of trying to buy business and political favors. This was in 
addition to the $155,000 Takeshita had already admitted receiving.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today it will not interfere with plans 
for restarting the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear power plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's action came after a briefing by the staff in which it said it 
disagreed with the conclusion of a private industry watchdog group that recent 
troubles at the plant were the result of pressure to avoid a required shutdown 
if it did not operate enough. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Stello, the commission's executive director for operations, told the 
commission that if it did not object, "it would be our intention to allow the 
restart of" the 913-megawatt plant operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District.

The bleachers at Kezar Stadium were chopped up and sold for $20 a plank when 
1,500 football fans showed up to say farewell to the decrepit stucco pile built 
in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium, abandoned by the San Francisco 49ers in 1971 when they moved to 
Candlestick Park, will be torn down as part of a $9-million project that will 
result in a new, smaller stadium at the same site that will be used for high 
school sports. 
</P>
<P>
The party on Thursday night was held inside a huge tent in the middle of the 
football field. Fans paid $30 each to attend the bash, where they met such 
football legends as Y. A. Tittle, R. C. Owens and Leo Nomellini. 
</P>
<P>
The party's auction saw a football signed by the 1989 Super Bowl Champion 49ers 
go for $700. A 1948 St. Mary's-USF program went for $30. A jersey worn and 
signed by Owens was bought for $70. A helmet signed by all the former players 
who attended the party was sold for $250. 
</P>
<P>
Tittle, who was the 49ers quarterback, said he missed the place and the crowds 
that were almost close enough to touch. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember coming through the tunnel before they put the cage over it," he 
said. "It was fearsome." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Learner of the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Commission said 
construction on the new stadium will begin in October and will result in a 
structure that resembles the old Kezar. 
</P>
<P>
The new stadium will seat 10,000. The old Kezar initially seated 10,000 in a 
bowl below ground level, and a 40,000-seat above-ground superstructure was 
added in 1928.

Daniel Caduff edged fellow Swiss skier Peter Mueller in the men's super giant 
slalom today, and Austrian Anita Wachter easily took the women's event in the 
Lark Sports World International Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
The two won the men's and women's downhill races in the same meet on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Caduff skied down the 8,415-foot Mt. Higashidate Super-G course in central 
Japan in 1 minute, 47.23 seconds, against Mueller's 1:47.40. The course had a 
vertical drop of 2,145 feet and 54 gates. Austrian Willibald Zechner came in 
third in 1:49.51. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, over a 42-gate, 6,930-foot course, Wachter, the lone 
foreign entry, finished in 1 minute, 31.85 seconds, nearly six seconds ahead of 
Japan's Kana Kawashima, who was timed in 1:37.67.

Mayor Jerry Jernigan said the University of Michigan can expect a bill for at 
least $14,000 for police work and damage to public property during the 
celebration of Michigan's 80-79 NCAA basketball tournament victory over Seton 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to send a real clear message that this kind of behavior just won't 
be condoned in Ann Arbor any longer," Jernigan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The party, during which street signs were uprooted, awnings torn down and 
windows broken, cost the city $7,500 in police overtime and damage to fire 
equipment, City Administrator Del Borgsdorf said. Borgsdorf said damage to 
street signs and traffic lights totaled $6,500, and damage to private property 
totaled $78,000. 
</P>
<P>
University President James Duderstadt said the celebration that followed 
Michigan's championship victory was disgraceful and an embarrassment to the 
university.

PIRATE RELIEF ACE GOTT ON DISABLED LIST

Pirate relief ace Jim Gott, who set a club record with 34 saves last season, 
was placed on the 21-day disabled list today with an inflamed right elbow and 
will miss at least a month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
After being examined today by team orthopedist Dr. Jack Failla, Gott -- second 
in the National League in saves last year -- was ordered not to throw for three 
weeks. He is not expected to return until early May. 
</P>
<P>
Gott, knocked around in nearly all of his exhibition outings, returned to 
Pittsburgh from Montreal on Thursday after allowing Tim Wallach's game-winning, 
eighth-inning RBI single in the Expos' 3-2 victory. Gott was found afterward to 
have a strained ligament in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates recalled right-hander Scott Medvin from their Buffalo farm club to 
replace Gott, and Jeff Robinson will assume Gott's stopper role. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always preached since I came here that I wanted to have two stoppers in 
the bullpen," Manager Jim Leyland said. "We've used Robinson in that role. 
Hopefully, we've got him. Some guys think you should only have one stopper, but 
if you have one and you lose him, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Leyland suspected that Gott was having physical problems when he allowed 25 
hits, seven walks and 21 runs in 12.1 exhibition innings.
