THE L.A.-INYO AGREEMENT -- FINALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an easy solution to the legendary fight between the Owens Valley and the 
city of Los Angeles over the valley's water had been possible, the battle would 
have ended long ago. There was none. However, the tentative agreement reached 
by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Inyo County officials this 
past week seems the next best thing, one that will meet two major goals: to 
protect the valley environment against Los Angeles' over-pumping the ground 
water tables while allowing the city to continue drawing a reasonable supply of 
water from its wells in Owens Valley. The plan should be ratified promptly by 
Los Angeles and Inyo County governments. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was concluded after years of negotiation and legal battles 
between the giant city that had taken Owens Valley water virtually at will for 
more than half a century and the sparcely populated eastern Sierra county that 
long has viewed itself as the aggrieved victim of Los Angeles' insatiable 
growth. Los Angeles would love to pump all the water it could. Inyo County 
might want the city to go away altogether. But neither was going to happen. And 
neither side could count on winning in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
A court conclusion implied winners and losers, and continued bitter feelings. A 
negotiated settlement allows both sides to claim victory. 
</P>
<P>
The major benefit of the settlement is that it permits control of Los Angeles' 
pumping of valley water to be decided on the basis of evidence of likely damage 
to the environment and not the arbitrary water-export limits that might have 
been imposed by a court. If the evidence indicates that the Department of Water 
and Power is pumping too heavily in one area, Inyo County officials can require 
that the well be shut down. When a well is closed in one area, the city has the 
potential for drawing water from other valley wells. 
</P>
<P>
The city now pumps about 170,000 acre-feet of water from the Owens Valley, 
which represents nearly one-fifth of the city's annual demand. The well water, 
along with surface supplies from the Owens River and streams further north in 
the Mono Basin, flows to Los Angeles by gravity through the 233-mile-long Los 
Angeles Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Inyo County is to receive more compensation for lost property taxes, money to 
finance the county's water department and funds for recreation development. 
There will be more enhancement projects to compensate for past pumping damage. 
Inyo County officials also scored a considerable symbolic victory by getting 
the city to turn control of local water systems back to the communities of Lone 
Pine, Independence and Laws. For years, they suffered the indignity of having 
their water supplies metered and charged on the same basis as Los Angeles 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Both Inyo County and Department of Water and Power officials believe the 
agreement will be ratified by their governing boards without major opposition. 
Inyo County supervisors will hold hearings on the agreement in Independence on 
April 18; Big Pine, April 20; Lone Pine, April 25, and Bishop, April 26, before 
voting on the pact May 9. The agreement goes to the Los Angeles Board of Water 
and Power commissioners at its May 11 meeting and then to the City Council for 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
The pact will not solve all the problems that separate Los Angeles and Owens 
Valley. But it does seem to build a solid foundation for a fair future 
partnership between the Department of Water and Power and Inyo County in joint 
control of the valley's water supply. That is far better than either side could 
have expected from a prolonged court battle.

'CROSSROADS FOR CHILD CARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with a heavy heart that I read the articles about the three toddlers 
found in their sitter's pool. Just the week before, I had removed my 2-year-old 
daughter from her sitter's home because she had just put in a pool and refused 
to fence the pool from the house. Because she was unlicensed, there was no one 
to tell her "she had to have a fence built." 
</P>
<P>
I spent one full week looking for replacement care and what an education that 
was! I checked only licensed homes, and since 9 out of 10 day-care centers had 
no room, the pickings were indeed slim. What I did find were beautiful 
$300,000-plus homes where 12 children are grouped in a section of the garage . 
. . not to "track through the house" or homes that were messy and unkempt and 
children seemingly checked on only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care centers interview you, not the other way around. The prices are 
high, i.e., $85 a week average, which makes child care almost unattainable for 
most of us single mothers. There are pages of instructions and ironclad 
contracts written for the benefit of the day-care operators to be filled out. 
One of my other discoveries was that the day-care operators only want "easy" 
children who are passive and nap daily. 
</P>
<P>
I feel as if there is indeed a market out there for day care and the money to 
be made is excellent, but are these operators exploiting the need and the 
children for the benefit of the dollar? They follow the rules but somehow I 
feel that they lost the "motherly" touch that we hope to find in our 
caretakers. I finally placed my child in a preschool because I knew what I was 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
My heartfelt sympathies to the three mothers.

Your excellent editorial states, "Two senators whose views of the world do not 
mesh -- Democrat Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah 
-- are sponsoring this important child-care bill. Their measure would help 
states create new child-care programs, establish safety standards for operating 
those programs and help poor families pay for their children's care." 
</P>
<P>
Any money invested in the children of America is worth the investment many 
times over. My sincere blessings go to these two senators.

'CROSSROADS FOR CHILD CARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As The Times continues its assessment of our nation's child-care crisis 
("Crossroads for Child Care," editorial, March 27), further analysis needs to 
be conducted regarding the true cost of "quality" child care and who can afford 
it. The Times identified $75 per week as an average urban rate for child care 
in a provider's home. The Times doesn't clarify that such a fee is inadequate 
to pay for quality center-based programs, some of which may be those 
church-related programs mentioned later in the editorial where hundreds of 
thousands of children are cared for daily. 
</P>
<P>
The current debate on child care fails to adequately address what constitutes 
quality care, what such care costs and the effort that will be required to fund 
it. For many years now, research has demonstrated that quality programs require 
adequately compensated educated staff, small group sizes of children, and 
ratios of teachers to children that are generally better than the minimums 
currently mandated by the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California providers and consumers of quality center-based programs 
recognize that the cost is closer to $150 per week for infants and $90 per week 
for 3 and 4 year olds. The fact is that parents from all but the highest income 
levels require financial assistance in obtaining care for their children that 
is truly beneficial rather than custodial, or at worse, damaging. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of such costs seems to discourage a more careful examination of 
what we mean by "quality child care," but such an examination is precisely what 
is required if we are truly committed to establishing quality care for 
children. Excellent guidelines for quality have been established by the 
National Assn. for the Education of Young Children. Numerous groups have 
proposed strategies for funding such quality. What is clear is that all sectors 
of our society will have to make a commitment and work together cooperatively 
if our children are to have what many of us older Americans took for granted -- 
an enriching, safe, and most important, happy childhood.

MISSILES

<TEXT>
<P>
Your March 22 report, "Deal to Build Two Missile Systems Seen," characterizes 
funding both MX and Midgetman missiles as a compromise. The Air Force and 
Congress can't agree which missile is needed. Neither missile can increase 
national security because land-based missiles are no longer survivable. 
</P>
<P>
Building both missiles resolves the controversy in the wrong direction by 
increasing the budget deficit without increasing national security. 
</P>
<P>
A better answer is to build neither missile and to negotiate cuts to nuclear 
arsenals.

JACK SMITH: ENGLISH FAILS IN MATTERS OF SEXUAL POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My search for a female equivalent of the word womanizer, meaning a man who 
pursues women promiscuously, has not prospered. 
</P>
<P>
That is indeed strange, because the English language is so profligate that it 
has a word for almost everything, and usually more than one. 
</P>
<P>
The question arose from the widespread use in the media of womanizer for John 
Tower in his bid for Secretary of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
It is curious that the first definition of womanize in Webster's is "to make 
effeminate," which obviously does not apply in the Tower case; thus, the press 
seized on the second definition, "to be sexually promiscuous with women." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Williams finds it odd that as first defined womanize is a transitive 
verb, requiring a direct object; but by the second definition it is 
intransitive, and does not require an object. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he argues, "assume a surgeon whose speciality is the sex-change 
operation (doing only the male-to-female variety), and assume that this is all 
he does every day. But every night this same doctor goes helling around with 
eight or 10 different bimbos." 
</P>
<P>
By definition, Williams argues, the man is womanizing day and night. "But 
here's the dilemma: How can his womanizing be transitive in broad daylight and 
suddenly become intransitive after dark?" 
</P>
<P>
An interesting question, indeed, but one that has more to do with the vagaries 
and flexibility of the English language than with our object -- the discovery 
of a female equivalent for womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Winant may have a clue as to why there is none. She argues that 
womanizers are not only promiscuous with women, but enjoy an "eroticized 
domination" of women. "It has to do with 'conquering,' with prey, with taking 
prestige from 'having' women." 
</P>
<P>
Women, she says, do not generally seek eroticized domination of men. . . . "So 
there is no female equivalent of 'womanizing' because women's sexuality has not 
been cultivated along lines of conquering . . . women don't have the same power 
in the culture as men." 
</P>
<P>
Like Ms. Winant, Ruth Brown protests my suggestion that in Washington "men of 
power would be easy marks for sexually attractive women of ambition." She says 
that is "to slide the blame for the womanizer's predatory practice of feeding 
his ego to his victims. . . . It is quite impossible to think of the womanizer 
as a victim of a procession of sexually attractive women with ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
There is no female equivalent of womanizer, then, because there is no female 
equivalent of John Tower? 
</P>
<P>
Could be. But certainly there are man-chasers, to use the closest word I can 
think of, who pursue men of power for the fun of it, for financial gain or for 
the proximity to power. 
</P>
<P>
Grover Collins suggests a word he picked up as an oil engineer in Bakersfield. 
The term cruiser was used by most of the oil guys in reference to the ladies 
who frequented the bar at the old Bakersfield Inn and the many other watering 
holes in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing the word at the watering holes of Bakersfield we are straying far 
from the corridors of power in Washington, which is the proper venue for this 
inquiry. It is true that the women Collins describes were engaged in the sexual 
pursuit of men, but they can hardly be thought of as opposites to the 
womanizing power figures of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
John Degatina recalls that in his mother's gossip circle the words flirt and 
man-crazy were used, the second being more derisive. "I don't think any better 
terms have appeared," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Alvarez suggests philanderer, not only as a synonym for womanizer but 
also for its opposite, noting that his dictionary defines the verb as "to have 
many love affairs," and does not specify sex. (But Webster's New World (1988) 
says "to make love insincerely, said of a man.") 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn M. Trump of Hermosa Beach suggests that lothario, meaning a "gay 
seducer of women," could be feminized as lotharia. Somehow philanderer, 
lothario and casanova all suggest a lighthearted, romantic male, which does not 
seem to fit my image of John Tower and his ilk. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Sara Boynoff Coonradt says succinctly: "There is no feminine 
counterpart of the word womanizer, just as there is no feminine counterpart of 
the word cuckold." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think I care to get into that.

TOUCHING '50S-STYLE NOVEL OF A MAN, WOMEN HE LOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loving Women by Pete Hamill (Random House: $18.95; 414 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"Loving Women" is aptly sub-titled "A Novel of the Fifties," and more than 
anything else it is that. Written by a self-styled old guy, this is a 
thoughtful and touching recollection of the days around the Korean War and what 
it was like to be a youth in those days; to yearn above all to know how to be 
cool; to know about Bird and Dizzy -- to have saved your pennies to hear Art 
Tatum for one last time before his death, to go out (again, just as a kid, a 
timid little white kid, to some black club in the farthest Southern Boondocks) 
and hear a weird black guy (our own, dear, famous Little Richard) sing -- for 
the first, first time in the author's consciousness -- the magically evocative 
"Awop-Bop-a-Loo-Mop Alop-Bam-Boom!" 
</P>
<P>
Really, "Loving Women" is several novels at once. At its most accessible, it's 
a chest-beating, masculinist, How-I-got-to-be-the-guy-I-am narrative, with 
literary ancestors as disparate as Norman Mailer's "The Deer Park" and "An 
American Dream," Horace McCoy's "Scalpel," Irwin Shaw's "Two Weeks in Another 
Town" and '50s cult-classics like Wirt Williams' "Love in a Windy Space," and 
Gene D'Olive's "Chiara." In all these novels, the hero-narrators feel blue as 
they edge into a perceived, dry, middle age, but they are, in one way or 
another, saved by the love of a "bad" woman, a woman of uninhibited flesh who 
physically nudges them back to life. (Hamill's novel follows this paradigm 
perfectly, with the pleasing side effect that these sex scenes prove beyond a 
doubt that he, Hamill, really does know about "loving women" and that Norman 
Mailer is still just a timid Girl Scout in this particular area.) 
</P>
<P>
But -- if I read correctly -- I don't think that's what this book is really 
about. "Loving Women" really may be about loving women, an unlikely subject for 
a real he-man novel. At the beginning of this narrative, Mike Devlin, a 
burnt-out news-photographer, is locked into a supremely irritating relationship 
with his third wife, a New York feminist who insists on "intimacy," asking him 
how many women he's had. When he tells her the number comes to about 1,200 over 
a period of 30 years she can't stand the truth and has a four-star tantrum. 
(Reviewer's note: I'd bet the family property that the original number here was 
12,000. One new woman every 8 1/2 weeks seems awfully low for an authentic 
hard-boiled journalist who grew up in the '50s. Devlin would have been stripped 
of his photographer's jacket for a figure in the wimpy hundreds, considering 
it's a period as long as 30 years.) 
</P>
<P>
Anyway. Devlin's third wife leaves him. And, in a funk, Devlin tries to 
remember if he ever loved anyone. Yes. The first. A woman in the South named 
Eden Santana. A woman he met as a green Navy recruit when he served at Ellyson 
Field near Pensacola, Fla. Flash back to the year 1953, when Devlin, 17 and 
still a virgin, voyages away from a stark, unloving, austere Catholic childhood 
in Brooklyn to the experiences that will make him into a "man." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Mike is so sexually preoccupied he can only see sex, feel sex, 
breathe sex. And, along with his horny longings, he meets handfuls of other 
recruits who could have come from a World War II movie: An Italian, a Jew, a 
dreadful creep named Red Cannon who has a dreadful reason for his creepiness. 
But beyond these expected characters, Mike encounters a nice guy who's gay and 
terribly tormented, and a black musician who's fought in Korea, and a woman 14 
years older than Mike, who teaches him to love women, shows him what a loving 
woman should be. 
</P>
<P>
This lady, Eden Santana, is a creature of layered mysteries whose secrets 
shouldn't be given away here. But the main thing is that she's believable, 
unashamed, a little goofy, and though she withholds the truth, she's never 
afraid of it. By the end of this novel, Mike Devlin has received a double 
education in his first six months away from home -- to feel or not to feel, to 
love or not to love; to accept the man's world (all the reasons, for instance, 
for the Navy's authoritarianism), or to decide to live his life intuitively, to 
be alive. If I read the last page here correctly, this is an amazing book. If I 
don't, it's still a touching, nostalgic, affectionate embrace of a novel.

'DRIVING MISS DAISY' TAKES ITS JOURNEY SIMPLY AND WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy" has driven into town and parked at the Henry Fonda Theatre 
in Hollywood. It's not a flashy vehicle. But it gets great gas mileage. 
</P>
<P>
This series of brief scenes about an elderly Jewish widow and her chauffeur 
manages to cover 25 years in a mere 90 minutes, without stooping to melodrama, 
without seeming too sketchy, without ignoring the greater cultural and 
historical context of the South during the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Hollywood writers could take lessons in Economy 101 from the creator 
of "Miss Daisy," Alfred Uhry. Actors could benefit, too, from observing the 
no-gesture-wasted acting of Julie Harris as Daisy. 
</P>
<P>
The story follows a conventional arc: Two characters are thrown together. At 
first they're at odds, but gradually they come to terms; eventually they 
cherish each other. It's an oft-told tale, but seldom is it told this well. 
</P>
<P>
It begins in 1948, when 72-year-old Daisy Werthan totals her car and loses her 
insurance. Against Daisy's wishes, her son (Stephen Root) hires 60-year-old 
Hoke Colburn (Brock Peters) to drive Daisy around Atlanta. Within six days, 
Hoke breaks down Daisy's determination to ignore him. 
</P>
<P>
But a thin layer of friction remains, rooted in Daisy's much-denied racial 
prejudice and reinforced by her growing awareness of what she and Hoke have in 
common -- they're both outsiders, they're both aging, they're both lonely. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy is the more complicated of the two. It's her willpower that must be 
budged for the story to move forward, and later it's the remnants of her racial 
insensitivity that provide the play with much-needed tension. 
</P>
<P>
Hoke doesn't change much, except for the actual aging, nor does he need to 
change. From the beginning, he's almost too good to be true: scrupulously 
honest, diplomatic but frank, steadfastly helpful but not at the price of his 
own dignity, willing to admit his own inexperience (he can't read; he has never 
left Georgia) but also canny enough to use another job offer to get a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Because he's so admirable in every way, Hoke may be the more difficult role to 
play. Peters knows and honors the character almost too well. His face registers 
emotion more easily and graphically than most, and his performance occasionally 
verges on the obvious. At least early in the play, Hoke probably would try to 
suppress his feelings more than he does. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the teamwork between Peters and Harris is as beautifully timed as if 
they have been together as long as Daisy and Hoke. Their final scene is 
undeniably affecting. It's Harris who gets the play's best moments, and not 
surprisingly she makes them indelible. She gets the biggest laugh of the 
evening in the middle of the most potentially troubling scene, but that's 
Uhry's handiwork as much as hers. Probably her most unforgettable scene is a 
silent one, late in the play, when she slowly helps herself out of the car 
after a minor tiff with Hoke and pauses briefly to consider whether to try to 
make amends. That moment is worth a dozen speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Harris knows precisely how to toughen and then how to tenderize her 
portrait. We exit with the impression that we know Miss Daisy almost as well as 
Hoke does, but we would never presume to predict how she would behave. The 
performance has that kind of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, let us not forget Root as Daisy's middle-aged son. Although we see 
him primarily as a mediator, he's not a mere sounding board for the others. 
He's also the representative of the greater world outside these two rather 
insulated souls, and he handles that position with perception and grace. 
</P>
<P>
Director Ron Lagomarsino, who staged the original "Daisy," has kept this 
touring production on its toes. Thomas Lynch's simple, mobile set design does 
its job well, though it's odd that the stools used for the driving scenes 
remain on stage thereafter, even during scenes that occur behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Arden Fingerhut's lighting and Michael Krass' costumes are unobtrusive but 
unfailingly correct. And while Robert Waldman's incidental music may not be 
enough to satisfy those Los Angeles Civic Light Opera subscribers who are still 
wondering why this non-musical is part of the LACLO season, his blend of violin 
and banjo does help suggest the play's locale and era and mood. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6126 Hollywood Blvd., Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Wednesday and 
Saturday matinees at 2 p.m., Sunday matinees at 3 p.m., through April 30, then 
through May 14 with a slightly altered schedule: no Wednesday matinees, and 
Sunday evening performances at 7 p.m. Tickets: $28.50-$37.50; (213) 410-1062

CONTROVERSIAL L.A. DEBUT FOR CELIBIDACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Munich Philharmonic, which made its much ballyhooed U.S. debut over the 
weekend with concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and UCLA, is a solid, 
uneven, sometimes brilliant, sometimes untidy orchestra. Most experts agree 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
What they don't agree about is the conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, Sergiu 
Celibidache. 
</P>
<P>
He is, without question, an original -- an iconoclast, a mystic, a philosopher, 
a teacher, a cult figure, a bona fide musical maverick. He demands endless 
rehearsals. He refuses to make recordings. He strikes innocent, democratic 
poses while ruling the band like a willful autocrat. 
</P>
<P>
At 76, he has become an international celebrity almost by default. He plays by 
his own, old-fashioned, indulgent, anti-commercial, intellectually and 
physically demanding rules, or he doesn't play at all. 
</P>
<P>
That makes him either a sinner or a saint, depending on one's perspective. That 
explains why we haven't seen him until now. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental disagreement about Celibidache involves his actual prowess on 
the podium. Some observers regard him as a genius, pure and complex. To the 
devout he represents a living bond with the standards and aspirations of a 
distant golden age. The unmoved view him -- and dismiss him -- as a gimmicky 
eccentric who hides his weaknesses behind a network of carefully manipulated 
mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
The standing ovations that he elicited -- an uncharitable observer might say 
orchestrated -- at the Music Center on Saturday would suggest that Celibidache 
belongs among the lonely elite in a profession dominated by malpractitioners. 
Still, there were moments when a cool, objectively analytical head could wonder 
if the visiting and conquering emperor was really all that well dressed. A few 
boos reportedly punctuated the cheers on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For his second program here, Celibidache concentrated on the massive, 
sprawling, convoluted, potentially uplifting rhetoric of Bruckner's Fourth 
Symphony. Originally, he had scheduled Mozart's "Jupiter" as a curtain-raiser, 
but the bonus ultimately was abandoned. In context, one was grateful. 
</P>
<P>
Without much personal fuss or histrionic flair, Celibidache delineated 
Bruckner's romantic impulses on a heroic, majestic scale. This was Germanic 
music-making in the broad yet brilliant, increasingly obscure tradition of 
Furtwangler and Knappertsbusch. 
</P>
<P>
Celibidache carefully unraveled all the linear knots. He lingered over inner 
voices. He lent new meaning to the concept of pianissimo. He gauged the zonking 
climaxes with infinite care. He allowed the lyrical utterances to soar. He 
concentrated on sustaining organic tension, mindful that this is one long -- 
very long -- cumulative statement, not four isolated movements. 
</P>
<P>
It was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
He also tended to slow everything down, often without warning or obvious 
motivation, sometimes with willful determination. Bruckner's markings for the 
grandiose finale include the instruction, "nicht zu schnell" (not too fast). In 
this instance, the composer needn't have worried. 
</P>
<P>
The maestro lavished 90 minutes on this symphonic journey. He paused along the 
way for all manner of expressive detours, surprising accents, distortions and 
distentions. 
</P>
<P>
It was awful. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the performance was interesting even when it was awful. At a time 
when so many celebrated conductors are faceless, efficient technicians, 
Celibidache remains, if nothing else, a stubbornly compelling, fiercely 
independent force. 
</P>
<P>
We will, no doubt, have to hear more of him to judge whether he is a genuine 
interpretive giant or a talented, egomaniacal eccentric. It might be noted, 
however, that the impression he created last week at an open rehearsal for a 
staggeringly mannered Brahms Fourth reinforced the possibility of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The Muncheners responded attentively to their boss' subtle urgings. 
Nevertheless, one heard a lot of strident winds, blaring brass and scrambled 
strings. Although spirits were obviously high, unanimous precision seemed a low 
priority. The playing tended toward the "gemutlich." One wondered where all 
those vaunted hours of rehearsal had gone. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the best part of the show came when it was over. The house had 
been bathed in darkness for the Bruckner, but the lights came on for the a 
magnificently choreographed series of curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
First the maestro stood rigidly with his back to the adoring crowd and absorbed 
the good vibrations. Then he issued sharp commands for the orchestra to sit and 
rise and sit and rise, acknowledging the applause en masse. Then came 
painstakingly manicured bows by every soloist within the orchestra, followed by 
militaristic bows by individual sections. 
</P>
<P>
Then and only then did a frail and tired Celibidache turn, descend from the 
podium and face his admirers. He did this oh-so humbly, standing amid the lowly 
violins. He seemed to want to insist that he is merely a team player, a 
selfless member of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Wethinks he doth protest too much.

Although NBC struck out this season with a TV-series adaptation of the movie 
"Baby Boom," it will try again next season with a comedy based on "Working 
Girl." The network has ordered 13 episodes for the fall from Patchett-Kaufman 
Entertainment. The central role of the secretary-turned-businesswoman, played 
by Melanie Griffith in the film, will be filled by Nancy McKeon, one of the 
former stars of "The Facts of Life." CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN

In what was billed by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich as "precedent-setting 
cultural diplomacy," the Minneapolis-based Children's Theatre Company has 
joined forces with the Children's Art Theatre of Shanghai to produce a play. 
Plans call for an American playwright to write a play about the impact of 
China's Cultural Revolution and reforms on traditional values. It will be 
produced first at the Children's Theatre Company in September, 1990, and then 
at the Shanghai company in November 1990. After the run of the two individual 
productions, the casts will be integrated for a joint staging, which will tour 
the Asian Pacific with stops in Gagzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo and T'ai 
Pei. Both productions will be directed by Jon Cranney, artistic director of the 
Minneapolis group. The Minneapolis theater group already has a two-year 
exchange with Moscow's Central Children's Theatre, where Cranney is directing 
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN

Nashville police are investigating a theory that the murder of a Cash Box 
magazine researcher may have been linked to the manipulation of country music 
charts, the Nashville Tennesseean reported Sunday. Kevin Hughes, 23, who 
compiled the charts for the magazine, was fatally shot last month on 
Nashville's Music Row as he approached his car. Police believe Hughes' attacker 
might have been a professional hit man, the newspaper reported, and homicide 
detectives are investigating the possibility that Hughes may have been killed 
because he knew the Cash Box charts were being manipulated or because he 
refused to tamper with them. Police have found no direct evidence linking the 
murder to the country music business. Music Row promoter Bill Wence said he had 
9 or 10 calls the day after Hughes was killed. "All of them thought he was 
hit," Wence told the paper. "I believe that kid was killed because he knew 
things about Cash Box." Cash Box charts, along with the more closely watched 
Billboard record charts, measure the popularity of records, and high chart 
position can mean substantial financial gains for performers and record 
companies. George Albert, president and publisher of Hollywood-based Cash Box, 
said he did not know why investigators were pursuing possible chart 
manipulation. "I can't understand this whole thing. I don't know why the police 
or you or anybody else are going into a story that is something that nobody, or 
that we, know anything about," Albert told a reporter for the newspaper.

POP CAPSULES : BANANARAMA HALF-PACKS UNIVERSAL AMPHITHEATRE

<TEXT>

Four costume changes. Three male dancers. Lights! Smoke! Mirrors! And even a 
version of Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name"! Upon such show-biz glitz did 
the hit-making British female vocal trio Bananarama base its local concert 
debut before a half-full house Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the show was like a microcosm of POP -- especially the canned, diet 
variety. (There were 16 tons of recorded vocal tracks along with a four-man 
backup band.) On record, these fabulous babes (Keren Woodward, Sarah Dallin and 
Jacqui O'Sullivan) can get away with singing strictly in unison, mostly because 
the songs are either old hits (the Shocking Blue's "Venus," the Velvelettes' 
"He Was Really Sayin' Somethin' ") or exceptionally clever constructions 
("Cruel Summer," "Robert De Niro's Waiting"). On video, these fabulous babes 
can get away with amateurish dance routines, mostly because they're fabulous 
babes. But on stage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Topped by some wildly inappropriate stage patter, the evening's numerous 
unintentionally humorous moments went down much easier in the knowledge that if 
you didn't like the song being performed, there'd be a different one along in 
three minutes and that it too would sound exactly like the vocal tracks on the 
records. Have you ever sat down to a great big steaming bowl of polyester? DON

POP CAPSULES : ALABAMA ALL SHOOK UP BUT NUMBINGLY DULL

It didn't seem a very fair trade: The Southland treated the members of Alabama 
to what singer Randy Owen said was their first earthquake, and Alabama gave 
Southern Californians just another numbingly dull show Friday evening at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent new-traditionalist pretensions, the quartet continued to leech 
the life and immediacy out of country music, leaving a treacly effluvium that 
has more in common with disco than country. How close to country frankness and 
raw roots could they come when they're performing amid flashing strobes and 
pulsing synthesizers on a stage with a futuristic strip-mall-yogurt-shop look? 
</P>
<P>
At its best -- as on "Love in the First Degree" and "Lady Down on Love" -- the 
group turned in some well-crafted vocal harmonies, but the songs still sounded 
like commercials for a very weak beer. At its worst, it offered "The 
Borderline," a miniseries vision of a cowboy trail ballad devoid of grit and 
feeling. Nowhere was the mediocrity of the band more evident than on the 
encore, which included versions of "Land of 1,000 Dances" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's 
"Sweet Home Alabama." Countless bar bands have played these songs, and most 
could churn them out with more color and passion than Alabama. JIM WASHBURN

BRAXTON'S APPEAL REMAINS PUZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The continued appeal of Anthony Braxton is curious. 
</P>
<P>
A leading light in the jazz avant-garde since he emerged in the early '70s, the 
saxophonist is a strangely inept musician who, while evidencing scant growth as 
a performer in the last decade, still commands a good deal of critical respect 
and has a loyal audience for his unique, and puzzling, musical utterances. 
</P>
<P>
In his first local appearance in eight years, Braxton and bassist Buell 
Neidlinger offered duets to an almost full house during the first show at 
McCabe's in Santa Monica on Saturday. The program consisted of three Thelonious 
Monk compositions, one extended original and a brief solo extemporization for a 
crowd-demanded encore. 
</P>
<P>
That Braxton should desire to play Monk is another conundrum, for the 
saxophonist -- whose music has a serious philosophical bent -- avoids the 
obvious melody, rhythm and humor that was at the heart of Monk's work. 
</P>
<P>
"Off Minor" began with Braxton -- playing alto saxophone and emitting a muffled 
tone of questionable pitch -- stiffly reading the Monk line. He then soloed 
over Neidlinger's steady pulse, a pleasing thump that gave the piece a 
necessary anchor. Braxton's solo consisted of clusters of sound rather than 
clean, single-note articulations and had little to do with Monk's composition. 
Fortunately, Neidlinger's brief, unpretentious improvisation did. 
</P>
<P>
Braxton's original consisted of a series of leaping, angular lines played on a 
variety of saxophones and an odd assortment of mostly short, bowed and plucked 
phrases from Neidlinger. These written portions were followed by free 
improvisations. At times, Braxton, using circular breathing, offered wildly 
fingered passages on both sopranino and C Melody saxes that sounded like cats 
fighting or the cacophony of a traffic jam. For these efforts, Braxton was 
rewarded with ovations from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The show concluded with a melody reading of " 'Round Midnight," fairly true to 
the tenor of the tune, and a mercifully short Braxton solo encore. ZAN STEWART

NOJIMA PLAYS RAVEL

With his undemonstrative physical style and placid stage presence, Minoru 
Nojima might seem ill-suited for the fantasy of Ravel's piano music. Friday 
evening in Marsee Auditorium at El Camino College, however, he demonstrated 
ample poetic ability, supported with fastidious technique. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was also the official dedication -- it had been played previously 
-- of a new Steinway for the school, and began with introductions and short 
speeches from campus dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument sounded bright and dry at first, in the "Noctuelles" of the 
opening "Miroirs" set. Nojima was soon able to draw mellow, balanced sounds 
from it, however, while exploiting its clarity to full effect in "Alborada del 
gracioso." 
</P>
<P>
"Miroirs" and "Gaspard de la nuit" are foundations of pianistic impressionism, 
and where sustained reverie and pictorial nuance are called for, Nojima 
triumphed. "Oiseaux tristes" from the former and "Ondine" from the latter, in 
particular, proved minor miracles of musical imagery and interpretive 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
But Nojima's palette seems to hold only pastels. Though technically supremely 
assured, his "Scarbo" was far from scarifying, lacking thunder and hard edges, 
and "Le Gibet" proved merely mournful, wanting a sense of stark horror. 
</P>
<P>
Nojima matched these impressionistic masterpieces with minor examples of 
Ravel's neo-classic manner, the "Pavane pour une infante defunte" and the 
"Valses nobles et sentimentales." He was reasonably direct in the Pavane, but 
the waltzes would have profited from a greater emphasis on dance physicality 
and less subtle whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the preliminary speechifying nor the stuffy heat -- nor the occasional 
external sounds when the side doors were opened to improve the air flow after 
intermission -- distracted the large audience from attentive appreciation, 
which it demonstrated with steady applause. However, no encores were 
forthcoming. JOHN HENKEN

Former Rep. Mario Biaggi of New York arrived in Grapevine, Tex., to begin his 2 
1/2-year prison term for accepting a Florida vacation from former Brooklyn 
Democratic boss Meade H. Esposito in exchange for Biaggi's efforts on behalf of 
a ship repair company. Before leaving for Dallas-Ft. Worth International 
Airport, Biaggi told reporters in Newark, N.J., that he went to church and 
visited his wife, Marie Wassil Biaggi, who is hospitalized with Hodgkin's 
disease. Flanked by family members, the 71-year-old Biaggi smiled often as he 
used a cane to walk aboard the plane at Newark International Airport. The 
former 10-term Democratic congressman is expected to turn himself in to U.S. 
Correctional Facility officials today.

AFGHAN REBELS ATTACK CITY

Afghan guerrillas said they launched a major attack on the eastern city of 
Jalalabad, but the Soviet-backed Kabul government said its forces retaliated 
with artillery and air attacks, causing heavy casualties. The official Kabul 
Radio, monitored in Pakistan, said government forces killed about 250 
Western-backed guerrillas after they launched a three-sided attack. Rebel 
spokesman said the attack was aimed at capturing the airport and three 
government bases. The rebel offensive, begun last month, has been bogged down 
by heavy bombing by government planes and by mine fields. The guerrillas want 
to establish Jalalabad as the capital of their government in exile.

Heavy snow fell in Kansas and Colorado and record cold settled over portions of 
the Great Lakes states. Temperatures also plunged in Texas, providing relief 
from sizzling weather the day before. Snowfall ranged up to 11 inches at 
Goodland, Kan., seven inches at Boulder, Colo., four inches at Garden City, 
Kan., and three inches in Denver. A snow advisory was posted for western 
Kansas, and an advisory for snow and blowing snow in the northern and central 
mountains of Colorado. Strong northerly winds blew the cold air into southern 
Texas, where temperatures were as much as 40 degrees colder than at the same 
time Saturday, when highs were approaching 100 degrees. Flooding continued 
along the Red River and some of its tributaries in North Dakota, but cold 
weather is expected to slow the snowmelt and the river's rise.

Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley dismissed all private security companies 
at the nation's two international airports after last week's seizure of an Air 
Jamaica plane in Miami in a drug-smuggling case. Manley said that "a 
combination of monumental corruption and negligence" allowed nearly two tons of 
marijuana to be shipped on the state-owned airliner. An Air Jamaica cargo 
supervisor and an unidentified suspect in Miami were arrested in connection 
with the drug shipment. He also said Air Jamaica has dismissed all employees 
involved in loading the plane.

Soviet citizens and businesses may lease land for 50 years or more, sublease 
the property to others, and pass on the leases to their children when they die 
under a sweeping new law published in Soviet newspapers. The decree, issued by 
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, creates the same right to lease animals, 
equipment and even entire factories. It grants considerably more extensive 
property rights than many had expected, even after the Communist Party 
leadership in March approved the principle of leasing land to family and 
cooperative farms. The change in Soviet property rights was prompted by the 
disastrous state of the Soviet economy.

Several hundred residents of a drug-torn San Francisco neighborhood marched 
through the streets in a protest against crack cocaine and weekend shootings 
that left two dead and several injured in another part of the city. "We are 
going to march and shout and sing and pray till this crack cocaine is 
completely eradicated from our community," said the Rev. Cecil Williams, who 
led the march through the Ocean View area. Although the march and rally in the 
southern part of the city had been planned for several weeks, a drive-by ambush 
and another shooting less than two miles away in the Bayview-Hunters Point 
district gave people another reason to participate, said Williams, pastor of 
Glide Memorial United Methodist Church. Two gunmen got out of a car and fired 
more than 40 shots into a crowd, killing two people and injuring nine in the 
worst mass shooting in San Francisco since five people were killed and 11 
wounded in the 1975 Golden Dragon Massacre in Chinatown.

Former Rep. Mario Biaggi of New York, convicted of taking a payoff and 
obstructing justice, headed for 2 1/2 years in a federal prison in Ft. Worth, 
his pride intact and protesting his innocence. The 71-year-old Democrat, who 
served 10 terms on Capitol Hill after becoming a highly decorated policeman, 
was convicted of accepting an illegal gratuity for taking two vacations with a 
girlfriend in Florida at the expense of Meade H. Esposito, a longtime friend 
and the former Democratic boss of Brooklyn. The government said the trip was a 
payoff Biaggi received for using his influence in Washington, while Biaggi has 
maintained he accepted the Florida vacation as a friend of Esposito. Biaggi was 
sentenced to 30 months in prison and a $500,000 fine.

The Berkeley Peace Wall, two slabs of concrete covered with painted ceramic 
tiles, was dedicated as the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the crowd, "War will not 
work." The wall, actually two 4-foot-tall semicircular concrete arcs in a patio 
at Martin Luther King Jr. Park, was the brainchild of local artist Carolyn 
Marks, who came up with the idea about five years ago and calls it a "basic 
human family quilt." The tiles came from more than a dozen countries, including 
the Soviet Union, and carry slogans and artwork aimed at promoting peace. One 
tile reads "Peace through learning about each other;" another said "Humanity is 
one." Some of the estimated 2,000 tiles were no so clearly peace-oriented. One 
just said "Oakland A's", and another was simply a shadow portrait of two 
children holding hands and jumping. About 2,000 people, from preschoolers to an 
elderly woman wearing a Gray Panthers button, gathered to view the wall and 
hear a parade of dignitaries, including Jackson, extol peace.

CHURCH CREDIT UNION HELPS A COMMUNITY MANAGE ITS FINANCES

They came clutching bags of money. 
</P>
<P>
There were dozens of them, all parishioners at Holy Family Catholic Church in 
blue-collar east Wilmington. Gardeners and housekeepers and factory workers, 
they jammed the church hall after Mass, waiting in seemingly endless lines to 
put their earnings into a new financial institution: a church-run credit union. 
</P>
<P>
Some had never had a bank account. "They had this money sitting at home, under 
a mattress or something," said Lucia Moreno, whose own parents had always kept 
their money at home. 
</P>
<P>
"A lady came out, put her hand in her bra and came out with a wad of money," 
said Connie Calderon, who along with Moreno volunteered to help get the credit 
union started. "There are so many stories -- people came out, older people with 
their life savings in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"And with such trust!" 
</P>
<P>
That was November, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Drama 
</P>
<P>
In the more than five years since, a quiet drama has unfolded in east 
Wilmington as the founders of Family Federal Credit Union tackled complex 
government regulations -- and their own inexperience -- to bring economic hope 
to the Latino community at the southern end of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, they survived a severe financial crisis, discovering that not 
everyone who goes to church on Sunday pays debts on time. They also made the 
tough decision to tighten loan requirements, even though it meant cutting off 
some of the people who needed money the most. 
</P>
<P>
In this age of high-tech banking, Family Federal reflects the century-old 
principle behind the credit union movement: That a group of working people, 
tied together by a common bond, can pool their money to help one another. 
</P>
<P>
"They sound like the classic kind of volunteer credit union that could have 
been started in the 1930s and '40s," Neil Sawyer, spokesman for the California 
League of Credit Unions, said of Family Federal. "That's how it used to be. But 
it doesn't happen a lot now. The consumer is more sophisticated and the 
consumer financial market is more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
Since the advent of financial deregulation, people who propose small credit 
unions are encouraged to instead join with larger, existing credit unions that 
can offer a wider range of services. And credit unions that are not affiliated 
with businesses face an additional hurdle, because they lack payroll deduction 
services that guarantee members will repay loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$8.7 Million in Loans 
</P>
<P>
Yet, during its short life, Family Federal has loaned nearly $8.7 million to 
its members, many of whom would not be eligible for similar loans elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
It has $4 million in assets, offers its members up to $3,500 on a signature 
loan -- one without collateral -- and up to $50,000 for a secured loan. More 
than 4,500 people, all of them Holy Family Church members or their relatives, 
have active accounts there. Last year, the average account balance was $839. 
</P>
<P>
By credit union standards, these statistics are unremarkable. California has 
1,013 credit unions, 44 of which are affiliated with churches, and Family 
Federal is among the smallest. The American Baptist Credit Union in Covina, for 
example, has more than $100 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
But, says Father Luis Valbuena, Holy Family's pastor and founder of the credit 
union, numbers are not the only measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot evaluate the credit union by the loans that we do," Valbuena 
insisted. "I evaluate the credit union by the happiness and the security and 
the progress that it is making in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a neighborhood where financial security means being able to pay the 
rent or having a car that won't break down on the way to work, Family Federal 
has spelled progress. 
</P>
<P>
It has taught its members how to manage their money and how to save. It has 
kept them from paying fees to local check-cashing shops. It has paid dividends 
-- the current rate ranges from 4% to 6.25% -- to those who never before saw a 
return on their money. It has helped finance weddings and funerals, automobiles 
and back-to-school clothes, applications for amnesty and trips back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Place to Turn 
</P>
<P>
"Homes have been saved," Calderon said. "Kids that are newlyweds and can't get 
credit will apply there and buy a car to be able to go to a job. It pays for 
medical bills -- a lot of people don't have insurance. Anything that anybody 
needs, where they couldn't get it any place else, they're getting it there." 
</P>
<P>
The Ortiz family -- Jose, Maria and their seven children -- are one example. 
</P>
<P>
They live three blocks from the church in an upstairs apartment that consists 
of a kitchen, bathroom and a small living room that doubles as a bedroom for 
the entire family -- minus one daughter, who is married and lives elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Money is tight. Jose Ortiz brings home $1,200 a month from his job as a machine 
operator at an aluminum factory in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Family Federal has made several loans to the Ortizes. Last year, it 
financed immigration amnesty applications for the family, which began its 
migration to the United States a decade ago. Once those applications were 
approved, the credit union loaned the Ortizes money for a Christmas trip to 
Mexico, where some of the children met their grandparents for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a dream," said daughter Maria, 18. "We always wanted to go and all 
of a sudden we were there. They cried when we got there, and they cried when we 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Although the credit union has clearly helped improve his family's life style, 
Jose Ortiz said that is not the only reason he puts his money there. "We know 
that we have money in the bank," he explained in Spanish, "and we also help 
some other people who need it." 
</P>
<P>
Other credit union members cite similar altruistic motives -- a reflection of 
the teachings of their pastor, Valbuena. 
</P>
<P>
A priest with a reputation as a community activist, Valbuena has succeeded at 
making Holy Family a place where people go for more than religion. 
</P>
<P>
Church youth groups, non-existent before his arrival in 1982, now hold dances 
in the church hall at night. The church helps resolve landlord-tenant disputes, 
raises college scholarship money and has contracted with a dental clinic to 
provide low-cost care for parishioners. It also sponsors a food co-op that 
sells groceries at just above cost, in keeping with Valbuena's oft-repeated 
maxim that "you can't feed the soul without feeding the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long after Valbuena came to Holy Family that he began preaching about 
a credit union. This was the pastor's second such venture; in 1970, he 
established a credit union at Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avenue to Aspirations 
</P>
<P>
"When you live with the people, and when you feel the struggles of the people . 
. . you put two and two together," he said. "Most of these people, they are 
condemned not to progress along. They can never dream to better their homes, to 
move forward in life, to send their children to college." 
</P>
<P>
With 11 Masses each Sunday at Holy Family, and about 10,000 church members, 
Valbuena had a large audience for his message. He delivered it in a sermon. "I 
told them that God wants them to progress, especially the poor, and make 
something out of their poverty." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was Family Federal Credit Union born. 
</P>
<P>
Some took their money out of bank savings accounts to invest in Family Federal, 
even though they knew there would be no dividends for at least a year. During 
the credit union's first month in business, 463 accounts were opened. 
</P>
<P>
"We would do it after Mass, take their money, open their accounts, file and 
sort," Calderon recalled. "It was such a big mess; how they ever deciphered it 
and got everything in order is beyond me. None of us are bank people. We just 
went in there and worked with our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
The credit union staff -- a handful of the volunteers eventually became 
full-time, paid employees -- learned its lessons the hard way. "If you wait 
until you're all educated to start, well, then you've let so much time go by," 
explained Moreno, who became credit union manager in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno, who at the time was a 21-year-old college student, said she and the 
others struggled to make sense of government regulations, taking the thick 
manuals home to read at night. 
</P>
<P>
They muddled through audits in which federal examiners uncovered flaws in their 
handwritten ledgers. They discovered -- belatedly -- that they were required to 
obtain Social Security numbers when opening new accounts, and had to backtrack 
to comply with the rule. 
</P>
<P>
The loan committee met once a week to sift through applications. In the early 
days, they didn't even verify employment; a paycheck stub was enough. According 
to the credit union's former manager, Peter Mendoza, that practice ended after 
Family Federal realized it had been duped by a group of six men, all of whom 
applied for $1,000 signature loans claiming to work for a company that didn't 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
Even after that change, the loan delinquency rate was high. 
</P>
<P>
Performance evaluations conducted by the National Credit Union Administration, 
which regulates federal credit unions, show that in 1984, 1986 and 1987, Family 
Federal's delinquency ratio far exceeded the national average for credit unions 
its size. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Year 
</P>
<P>
The worst year was 1986, when more than 13% of Family Federal's loans fell into 
default, contrasted with a national average of 2.6%. The next year, a federal 
examiner forced the credit union to write off nearly $70,000 in bad loans and 
to hire a consultant to straighten out its books. 
</P>
<P>
The records were such a mess, Mendoza acknowledged, that the credit union once 
bounced a $20,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was criticized in several audits for the delinquency rate and for 
his reluctance to dun members who did not pay back their loans, Mendoza argued 
that his "broad lending policy" was necessary for Family Federal to reach out 
to the poorest of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"These banking people," he complained, "they don't see faces and people who 
need an opportunity. They see equations, they see statistics, they see curves, 
and that's how they do their job. If we start running this like Security 
Pacific and Bank of America, then what's the sense of having it?" 
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. One former member of the Family Federal board of directors, 
Abelardo de la Pena, said he quit because he thought Mendoza -- who later 
resigned as well -- had too much power. De la Pena also complained that Family 
Federal had inadequate criteria for issuing loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have proper training, we didn't have any guidance," he said. "So 
everybody was doing whatever their common sense (dictated)." 
</P>
<P>
When consultant Elsie Guimont arrived, she balanced the books and wrote policy 
manuals for the credit union. She encouraged Family Federal's staff to sue 
members who fell behind on their loans, and she also instituted more stringent 
loan requirements. 
</P>
<P>
These changes were not lost on Mike DeSisto, who sat on Family Federal's loan 
committee when the credit union first opened. 
</P>
<P>
DeSisto, who works as a gasoline blender for Union Oil Co. and owns a pizza 
parlor in Wilmington, recently asked Family Federal for a loan so he could buy 
drapes for his house. He was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got so much red tape now, you can't believe it," he grumbled. "I 
applied for a loan for $3,500 and you'd think I'd asked for the end of the 
world. And I have a full-time job. Back when I was on the loan committee, if 
the guy had a job, we gave him the loan." 
</P>
<P>
Yet as a result of the new policies, the credit union's loan delinquency rate 
dropped to 2.5% last year, just below the national average. The number of 
delinquent loans is down to 150 from about 500, according to the credit union's 
loan collector, Luisa Valladolid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Any Bank 
</P>
<P>
Now, the workings of Family Federal appear like those of any bank -- simple, 
clean, professional. The credit union has its own office in the church hall. 
Account records are stored in $160,000 worth of IBM computer equipment. Each of 
the four tellers has a terminal and, with the tap of a few keys, a customer's 
numbers are called to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Moreno said, "everyone is still learning." She constantly 
second-guesses herself, worrying that any mistake she may make could cost the 
membership money. At night, loan applications sometimes pop up in her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a big responsibility," she said. "This isn't like a regular job for us. 
This is something that we worked at in the beginning. It's important that it 
succeeds because I need this place. My parents need this place. My friends need 
this place."

WORKER STABBED AT CLINIC; PATIENT HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A psychiatric social worker was stabbed five times by the mental patient she 
was counseling in a Santa Monica board and care center Sunday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Ann Sauerwein, 44, was discussing a "minor arrest matter" with the male 
patient, whom she had been counseling regularly for about a year and a half, 
when the man locked the door, pulled out a knife and said, repeatedly, "I'm 
going to kill you, I'll kill you," she recalled from her hospital bed, where 
she was in satisfactory condition Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Police Sgt. Frank Fabrega, said a suspect, Larry Anthony Taylor, 
27, was arrested shortly after the attack when an officer spotted him in the 
1300 block of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was taken into custody without a struggle, the sergeant said, and was 
booked for investigation of attempted murder in the medical ward at Los Angeles 
County Jail, where he was being treated for a heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said Taylor had been anxious over a court hearing scheduled for today 
and, as he was stabbing her, told her he was afraid of going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, the social worker said, was for a minor offense that she could not 
disclose, because of client confidentiality. She said she had told the patient 
that another staff member would take him to court, when he pulled a knife and 
threatened her life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relied on Training 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she relied on her training during the attack and reasoned with 
Taylor while he was stabbing her, pointing out what consequences would result 
from the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept saying 'I'll kill you! I'll kill you!' Then I said, 'Larry if you do 
that, they will send you to jail,' " Sauerwein said. "The training is there," 
she said. "You know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
She said one thing in her favor was the fact that Taylor "was not delusional. 
He knew right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
As the assailant's attention was drawn away from the attack by workers at the 
facility who had been alerted by the shouting and began pounding on the door, 
Sauerwein said she wrestled with him and fended off several knife blows before 
Taylor fled. 
</P>
<P>
"He was scared and extremely dependent on someone being with him in court to 
protect him," Sauerwein said of Taylor. "I had told him his offense was not a 
serious . . . But he couldn't get over his fear . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident Recalled 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if we were arguing. We were talking. Then he came closer to me and 
first he said, 'I'm scared, I don't want to go to jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she did not feel any animosity toward Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Most psychiatric patients are not violent," she said "Larry is a young man who 
is immature and in certain instances cannot practice the best judgement. He 
will make decisions irrationally, without thinking about the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said Taylor was not a threat to anyone at the board and care 
facility, which specializes in psychiatric patients, and was well liked by the 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein, who suffered five stab wounds to the chest and arms, was taken to 
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center where she underwent surgery to inflate a 
collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
Officials described her injuries as "not life endangering." 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she was in good spirits and added that doctors told her she may 
be released in about five days. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she is employed by the county Department of Childrens Services, 
adoptions division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hired as Consultant 
</P>
<P>
She said she was hired as a consultant by the owner of the independent board 
and care facility. She said she had arranged for Taylor to stay at the center, 
which she refused to identify in order to avoid any negative association by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she previously worked for the same county mental health center 
where psychiatric social worker Robbyn Panich had been employed. 
</P>
<P>
Panich, 36, was stabbed to death on Feb. 21 by a mentally ill transient at the 
Santa Monica West Mental Health Service clinic on Euclid Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, David Scott Smith, 26, told authorities he was convinced she was 
the Anti-Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said she left the clinic a year ago, because of pending budgets cuts 
and the likelihood of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Panich was hired to fill one of the positions vacated by Sauerwein and several 
other clinic employes. 
</P>
<P>
The two had met once, for professional reasons, Sauerwein said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that Taylor had not discussed the Panich attack with her and, to her 
knowledge, did not know of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sauerwein said that although there had been a cutback in the number of 
county-funded counselors at the board and care facility, she did not believe 
the attack on her could be directly attributed to budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
She cited a lack of resources and access to information to check the 
backgrounds of patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Being able to know who we are treating would help immensely in reducing the 
stress and risk" involved, she said.

NEUTRONS AID CANCER FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bombarding tumors with high-energy neutrons instead of X-rays doubles the 
percentage of men who survive certain inoperable prostate cancers and could 
save the lives of one-fourth of those now killed by the disease, scientists 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men after 
lung and colorectal cancer. About 103,000 U.S. men will develop the disease 
this year, and 28,500 who have it will die, according to the American Cancer 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Laramore of the University of Washington School of Medicine in 
Seattle said the study he led indicates that one-quarter of those who die each 
year could be saved by nationwide adoption of neutron radiation as the 
treatment for such men. 
</P>
<P>
Neutrons are electrically neutral particles in the nucleus, or center, of an 
atom. They are massive particles, while X-rays are a form of electromagnetic 
radiation, as is light. Beams of neutrons attack cancer cells with about 100 
times the energy of X-rays, Laramore said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted at the university and other institutions. It involved 
91 men whose cancer spread beyond the prostate. Five years after treatment, 70% 
of those who received neutron radiation remain alive, twice the 35% survival 
rate among those treated with X-rays.

NICOTINE, WEIGHT LINK FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Providing strong new evidence to help explain why smokers tend to weigh less 
than nonsmokers and gain weight when they quit, researchers report that 
nicotine boosts the amount of energy the body burns. 
</P>
<P>
A new study found that nicotine increased the amount of energy smokers burned 
even when they were doing nothing while they smoked, and the increase in energy 
expenditure more than doubled if they were doing even routine tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The findings provide convincing evidence that smoking in and of itself can 
affect body weight, and the weight difference between smokers and nonsmokers is 
not simply the result of how much they eat or exercise, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers stressed, however, that the health dangers of smoking far 
outweigh health benefits smoking may provide by making or keeping people 
thinner.

VOLUNTEERS IN SIX CITIES JOIN IN TRASH RECYCLING EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every week, an elderly Duarte widow hauls recycling crates full of cans, 
bottles and newspapers to the curb for collection. Usually, she looks for help. 
If no one's available, she does it herself. But she doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a noble venture, but we're a little late in the game," she said, 
assessing the curbside recycling program Duarte started in May. "With the 
landfills filling up and the way things are these days, it's taken too long for 
us to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, the woman, who asked that her name not be published, and an 
estimated 2,650 other Duarte residents participate in one of six such voluntary 
programs operating in the San Gabriel Valley. With a crisis in waste disposal 
expected by 1992, a growing number of cities are turning to recycling to reduce 
the amount of refuse and to keep disposal rates from skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley, county officials and disposal companies said, has more 
curbside recycling programs in place or in the planning stage than any other 
area of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, Arcadia, Claremont, Diamond Bar, La Verne and Walnut have programs and 
Pasadena is experimenting with a pilot project. Other cities are expected to 
adopt programs within a year. Outside the San Gabriel Valley, seven cities in 
the county have adopted curbside programs. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling awareness may be heightened in the San Gabriel Valley because of 
three local landfills fast approaching their capacities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a hot topic out here because of the landfill closures," said 
Jennifer Kellogg, recycling coordinator for Websters Disposal, a subsidiary of 
Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest disposal company. The company 
operates programs in Diamond Bar, La Verne and Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a landfill in your back yard, you're looking for ways to keep it 
going or ways to keep it from expanding. People out here are really keyed into 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
The BKK Landfill in West Covina is expected to close as early as 1992, and -- 
under an agreement with the city -- must cease all dumping operations by 1995. 
Spadra Landfill near Pomona will reach the capacity permitted by the county 
sometime before the year 2000, according to county officials. Puente Hills, the 
area's largest landfill, will reach its permitted capacity in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co., which was slated to reach capacity 
at its landfill before 1991, received approval late last year for an 80-acre 
expansion. The Main San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, a local water conservation 
board worried about possible ground-water contamination, fought the expansion 
and has an appeal pending with the state. 
</P>
<P>
The county's landfill system is expected to reach its capacity in 1992 unless 
recycling and alternate disposal methods are developed to slow the process, 
according to Bill George, recycling coordinator for Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts. Currently, 45,000 tons are dumped each day, and the 
amount is expected to reach 60,000 tons within three years, George said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will reach a point in 1992, when there will be more refuse put out than can 
be buried in a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The public and some city governments have staunchly opposed waste-to-energy 
plants primarily over pollution concerns, making recycling one of the best 
alternatives for extending the life of county landfills, George said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, the developers of a large waste-to-energy plant in Irwindale 
withdrew their proposal after facing stiff opposition from residents, a 
coalition of seven San Gabriel Valley cities and Miller Brewing Inc., which 
operates a brewery near the proposed site. The state Energy Commission, which 
had been in the process of reviewing the project, subsequently voted to kill 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Readily Recyclable' 
</P>
<P>
While no panacea, recycling "can make a big difference," George said. Each day, 
about 20% of normal household garbage is "readily recyclable" material suitable 
for curbside pickup, George said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the county landfill problem, Pasadena, San Marino and South Pasadena 
are facing pressure to decrease the amount of refuse they generate because of 
restrictions Glendale has imposed on users of its Scholl Canyon landfill. In 
hopes of extending the landfill's life, Glendale officials have given an 
ultimatum to landfill customers to reduce their total waste output by 5% 
starting in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In its most popular form, curbside recycling generally involves residents of 
single-family households separating their newspapers, glass and metal cans from 
their normal rubbish. Participation in all San Gabriel Valley programs is 
voluntary, although each city adds the cost of the program, usually about $1, 
to the trash bills of all residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Trash Bills 
</P>
<P>
Profits from the sale of recycled products are most often returned to the 
residents in lower trash bills or rebates, but the returns have generally 
fallen short of paying for the costs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no ideal program," said George, in assessing the various programs in 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's program, in which an estimated 60% of the city's 4,400 households 
participate, has become the model for other area programs. 
</P>
<P>
The city is subsidizing the program by paying its trash collector, Best 
Disposal Co., $72,000, the amount the company was paying the city for the 
garbage franchise before the program began in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stackable Containers 
</P>
<P>
Residents place their newspapers, plastics, glass, aluminum cans and yard 
clippings into stackable plastic containers, which are picked up once a week on 
the same day as normal trash collection. As part of the garbage service, 
residents receive a 60-gallon or a 90-gallon trash can. 
</P>
<P>
But one basic problem with any recycling program, said Michael Miller community 
services division manager for West Covina's program, is selling an often 
unconcerned public on the need to recycle. "It's hard to convince the public 
that we have limited resources; they just put it out on the corner and don't 
think about it anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Resource Revolution' 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Duarte City Council authorized what city officials called a 
"resource revolution" with the goal of attracting another 20% of the city's 
households into the program. The effort will include weekly and quarterly cash 
drawings and a Hawaiian vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut's Joyce said the city is trying to get community support for its program 
by printing materials in Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese for its burgeoning 
Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
"From everything we've heard, if you don't continue to promote the program, it 
won't work," he said.

BURBANK COUNCIL INCUMBENTS' LUCK MAY RUN OUT IN TUESDAY'S RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least one of two Burbank City Council members running for reelection may 
lose his seat Tuesday in runoffs during the city's general election, political 
insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Al F. Dossin and Councilman Michael R. Hastings, who are both seeking 
second four-year terms, are facing two political novices -- attorney Tim Murphy 
and Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. George Bonney. 
</P>
<P>
Although City Hall observers expect Dossin and Hastings to do well, their 
opponents also stand a chance of knocking either or both incumbents out of 
office, according to political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Hastings appear to be the front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
By appearing at fund-raisers and neighborhood meetings, Murphy seems to have 
maintained the momentum he established in last February's primary election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has an excellent chance," said Lew Stone, president of the Burbank 
Firefighters Assn., one of the city employee unions backing Murphy. "Tim has 
name recognition throughout the city, and a number of people I've talked to 
said he's one guy that should be on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy finished third behind Hastings and ahead of Dossin in the city's Feb. 28 
election, when candidates were running for three seats on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Tom Flavin received more than 50% of the vote and won one of the 
seats. Councilwoman Mary Kelsey lost her seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dark Horse 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who has called Bonney the dark horse of the race, 
said she feels the fire captain might have a chance. "He's a long shot, but 
he's working really hard," she said. "People sense his sincerity, and he's not 
on an ego trip." 
</P>
<P>
In the city's only other race, City Treasurer Jack Whitney is defending his 
seat against Jim Rogers, a retired bank executive. Whitney, 79, has been 
treasurer for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin is leading the four council candidates in campaign contributions, 
according to documents filed with the Burbank city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin has $13,541 in contributions; Murphy, $12,730, and Hastings, $8,067. 
Bonney has not accepted any contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin and Murphy are endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers Local 15, the Burbank Firefighters Local 778, the Burbank City 
Employees Assn. and other local unions. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin and Hastings are endorsed by the Burbank Board of Realtors and the 
Burbank Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth a Common Issue 
</P>
<P>
The candidates seem to agree on the city's most prominent issue -- slowing down 
rampant development. They all supported a recently passed planned-growth 
initiative to slow the building of apartment complexes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Both Murphy and Bonney said the present council is not acting fast enough to 
stop development, and is being unresponsive to citizens who want to protect 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tired of seeing Burbank deteriorate," Bonney said. 
</P>
<P>
All the candidates except Dossin said they have refused campaign contributions 
from developers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hastings' campaign has received a boost from the Southern California 
Caucus, a political action committee of developers and other business people, 
spending $16,902 on his behalf. Despite the support, Hastings has insisted that 
he is not controlled by developers. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings expressed shock Friday at a mailer sent by the caucus. The mailer said 
"out-of-town" unions would be circulating in neighborhoods Saturday, "pimping 
for their hand-picked candidates. Their objective is simple -- total control of 
the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said he had nothing to do with the mailer. When asked if he was 
disassociating himself from the caucus, he said, "If this is the kind of 
material they put on, then, yes, I am." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the candidates, Hastings, 35, an advertising executive, has taken the 
most bashing since the primary election. Foes at council meetings have 
criticized him repeatedly for the developers' support. They also say he was 
responsible for pressuring a city department head to fire an employee two years 
ago, an accusation that Hastings denies. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents who live in the hillside areas of Burbank also have blasted 
Hastings, saying he flip-flopped on bringing popular acts to the Starlight 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings was one of the council members who approved an agreement with World 
Entertainment Services to bring major entertainers to the city-owned Starlight 
Amphitheatre. But when numerous residents complained about the crowds and noise 
that would result from large shows, he withdrew his support of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Dictator' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a representative of the people, not a dictator, and I only did what the 
people wanted," Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that people are out to get me, but that's what happens 
when a person is pro-active," he said of his reelection bid. "I've done a lot 
of things, and I'm going to offend some people. But I think voters can see 
through the lies." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has been one of the council's strongest proponents of slow growth. He 
has angered some of his colleagues with his unusual approaches: He wrote an 
ordinance that banned toy guns in Burbank; was the force behind commissioning a 
controversial war memorial, and established a yearly benefit for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Hastings said, he would work to complete the tentative deal between 
developer Alexander Haagen and the city to bring a major shopping mall to 
downtown Burbank. He said he also wants to work on a master plan for 225 acres 
owned by Burbank-based Lockheed Corp. that the city wants to develop. Lockheed 
is selling the property as part of a move out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 35, a deputy public defender, has said there has been too much 
development under the present council and that he would work to control growth. 
He cited a number of large developments -- including a controversial 129-home 
tract on hillside land -- that were approved. Many of the projects were in or 
around residential areas dominated by single-family homes, and density 
restrictions for some properties were loosened to accommodate the developments. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he is unhappy with the way council meetings are conducted. He said 
the televised meetings too often have degenerated into a forum for people to 
voice personal business or to blast city officials, and that the council has 
not controlled the proceedings. 
</P>

"People are using television to beat people up," he said. "The council has not 
brought a professional tone to the meetings. That kind of stuff does not belong 
here." 
</P>

Murphy is head of the Neighborhood Awareness Committee, which four years ago 
staged a failed bid to establish districts within Burbank that would be 
represented by individual council members. Murphy said he wanted to improve 
relations between neighborhoods and the council.

Dossin, 59, an insurance salesman, said he was happy with his role in getting 
Haagen to deal with the city for the shopping center. He also said he helped to 
keep industry out of the Rancho equestrian area, which is characterized by 
homes where people keep horses. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin said he also wants to control growth and traffic around Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also important that we get busy on planning for that Lockheed property," 
Dossin said, adding that the city might be able to put another shopping center 
on the land. 
</P>
<P>
George Bonney, 55, is a resident of the equestrian area, and residents of that 
area have been walking door-to-door throughout Burbank asking voters to support 
him. Bonney said he would work to mitigate the negative effects of increasing 
development in commercial and residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was also concerned about the commercialization of the Starlight 
Amphitheatre. "I'm an environmentalist, and we should not have anything that's 
going to rob the hillsides of their beauty," he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CLEANING GARAGE SHOT BY TEEN-AGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda man was in critical condition Sunday after he was shot by at least one 
of three men who tried to rob him in his garage, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Se Lee was shot in the face and chest during the 11:05 a.m. assault, said a 
nursing supervisor at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where the victim was 
recovering. Lee's age was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that the teen-age suspects, who remained at large, fled 
in a dark green, older model car, possibly a Toyota, Lt. Jim Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was cleaning out his garage on the 7500 block of Vanalden Avenue when the 
suspects approached him, asking for directions, police said. One of the 
suspects demanded money, and Lee was shot in a struggle that followed, Watters 
said. It was not known how many suspects fired at Lee, nor was there any 
indication that the suspects knew Lee, Watters said.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE MASTERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE JOKE IS ON HOCH AS PUTTS PUTTER AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

AUGUSTA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Faldo, queen-appointed Member of the British Empire, defeated Some Guy in 
a Red Sweater for the Masters golf championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot tell you much else about the poor slob who lost, except that his name 
is Hoch, which rhymes with choke, which is a word that -- sorry -- cannot be 
avoided when a mortal misses a two-foot putt that could have made him immortal. 
</P>
<P>
The guy who gagged was Scott Mabon Hoch, 33, some American who has not won a 
tournament in five years. About all we could tell you about Hoch before Sunday 
was that he has a degree from Wake Forest, has a brother named Buddy who is a 
pro bowler, and might be needing all his buddies to attend his wake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I don't carry a gun with me right now," Hoch said, maybe 15 minutes 
after the whole thing blew up in his face. 
</P>
<P>
Morbid? Melodramatic? 
</P>
<P>
No, a little black humor, is all. Hoch actually handled his misfortune rather 
nicely -- better than many would -- when the gods of golf decided to play this 
lousy practical joke on him. They robbed him of a $200,000 first prize, a 
lifetime Masters exemption, an honorary Augusta National club membership, and a 
scroll that would list his name beneath those of Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Arnold 
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he lose, he lost pitifully, forlornly, a sad young pup, beaten and 
wet. He missed a putt no more than four feet long -- Hoch called it five, but 
it looked more like three -- at the 17th hole, costing him the championship. 
Then he missed a putt 24 inches long at the 19th hole, costing him the 
championship. Not only did he lose, he lost twice. 
</P>
<P>
You can make a case, of course, that Scott Hoch lost with dignity, honorably, 
because after all, he did shoot a 69 on the final day of the Masters, and did 
outlast the likes of Ben Crenshaw and Greg Norman and Seve Ballesteros, and did 
make shots like his unbelievable uphill chip to the 17th, the one that had us 
primed to immortalize him as The Incredible Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, to be fair, he was more than just some guy in a red sweater. Throughout 
that hectic back nine, when he was battling tooth and nail against Faldo, 
Crenshaw, Norman, Ballesteros and Some Guy in a Brown Sweater, we admired the 
way Hoch hung tough. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to see how this relative unknown had actually accumulated nearly 
$800,000 in earnings over the last two years. Rarely a champion, Hoch has a 
habit of being a persistent challenger. On last year's tour, he had 10 top-10 
finishes, and once went 19 consecutive tournaments without missing the cut. The 
guy's no hack. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in his 10 years since turning pro, Hoch has won only three events, two of 
which were Quad Cities Opens. We are talking about a golfer here who may be a 
household word in Davenport, Iowa, and Rock Island, Ill., but probably not in 
the other half of the quad. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, he nearly won the Masters. The only reason he even qualified for the 
Masters was that the 14th of their 14 prerequisites for invitation entitles 
anyone who ranked among the previous year's top 30 money-winners to join the 
party, and Hoch squeaked in there 26th. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the way I played," Hoch said. "I hung in there when 
everybody else didn't. I really thought it was mine. All the immortality and 
all that other stuff, I'd be sharing in part of that right now, but I guess 
it's not to be." 
</P>
<P>
In darkness that nearly demanded a Day-Glo golf ball, Hoch and Faldo had their 
sudden-death playoff. Technically, it was their third round of golf in one day. 
They had completed a rain-delayed third round Sunday morning, then played 18 
holes more, then trudged back to the 10th tee. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, you could say, won the tournament Sunday by shooting a 77, a 65 and an 
8. 
</P>
<P>
The only person who beat Hoch, however, was Hoch. He was the leader after 16 
holes, needing nothing but a couple of pars. And, with "the chip of my life" 
after overshooting the 17th green, Hoch was sizing up that green jacket in 
about a 42 Regular. 
</P>
<P>
But he misread his putt, dropping a stroke. Which was nothing compared to the 
downhill two-footer on the first playoff hole, which is the putt he will be 
seeing in all his bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be stroked delicately, because a firm putt that did not drop 
dead-center would go racing past the cup. No way Hoch wanted to four-putt. So, 
he tapped it lightly, and the trickle-down effect was as costly as it gets. The 
putt never had a chance, staying left. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" Hoch said. "I hadn't three-putted a hole all week. Nice time 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing over it thinking, 'This is for the marbles,' and I guess I just 
pulled it. Funny thing was, I wasn't nervous. It was really strange. I really 
felt at ease all day long. I kept thinking, 'This must be my time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alas, 'twas not. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for the honorable Mr. Faldo, MBE, to make a marvelous putt, a 
heroic one, to win the way a winner should win. And it was time for the guy in 
the red sweater to shrink. Bury him in the Tomb of the Unknown Golfer. He lost 
his chance to be a known.

MURRAY OPTS FOR UCLA, HARRICK SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Glendora High School's Tracy Murray, who set state basketball scoring records 
this season, said he plans to attend UCLA, Bruin Coach Jim Harrick confirmed 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy to have him in the UCLA family," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray told the Associated Press Sunday: "Everybody said follow your heart, 
that you'll get this feeling and know where you want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the first day of the spring signing period for National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. national letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, a 6-foot-8 swingman, set a state career-scoring record of 3,053 points 
and a state single-season record of 1,505 points in leading the Tartans to the 
State Division I final. Although Glendora lost the game, Murray set a state 
tournament one-game record of 64 points. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 44.3 points, 14 rebounds and four assists in leading Glendora to a 
31-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Murray narrowed his choices to Louisville, Nevada Las Vegas, Villanova and New 
Mexico, in addition to UCLA. Murray, who told AP he made his decision Sunday 
morning after visiting the UCLA campus, said: "They're on the rise. They're 
coming back to where they're supposed to be -- on top. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the academics are great and the social life is good, too." 
</P>
<P>
Murray also liked Harrick's attitude. "He's a good coach, a nice guy who cares 
about his players," he told AP. "He wants to go all the way, and soon." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said he expects to be a third forward as a freshman and also expects to 
see action as a reserve guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play all five positions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has already signed Zan Mason of Westchester, Mitchell Butler of Oakwood 
and Rodney Odom of Kingwood, Tex.

WALLACE OVERCOMES DIZZY SPELLS, HOLDS ON TO WIN

<P>
Rusty Wallace, who experienced spells of vertigo during practice runs last 
week, left the remainder of Sunday's Valleydale Meats 500 field reeling as he 
took charge in the final 40 laps at Bristol, Tenn., to notch his third Winston 
Cup victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace had backup driver Dave Marcis ready to step into his Pontiac if the 
spells struck again. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of getting behind the wheel, Marcis was one of a track-record 56,000 
race fans who watched Wallace, a previous winner at Rockingham and Richmond 
this year, hold off Darrell Waltrip by three car lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was great today and I feel fine right now," said Wallace, who 
posted his first Winston Cup victory at the .533-mile Bristol track in the 1986 
Valleydale. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday morning, I woke up pretty sick. I got to the race track and the whole 
thing was spinning. You feel like you're spinning around in a bowl here anyway 
and you don't need vertigo." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace took the lead for the fourth and final time on lap No. 458 and went on 
to post his 13th Winston Cup victory, holding off both Waltrip and Geoff Bodine 
to win by .26 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine, who never led, took the third position with Davey Allison, a 
provisional starter, fourth and Dick Trickle fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Kalitta defeated Gene Snow to end a three-year dry spell and win the Top 
Fuel finals in the inaugural $384,350 National Hot Rod Assn. Winston 
Invitational drag race at Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Kalitta drove his dragster down the quarter-mile track in 5.194 seconds, while 
Snow came in at 5.351. The victory gave Kalitta a $25,000 bonus from Winston in 
the non-points event. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long time," said Kalitta, who last won a national event in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Don Prudhomme won the Funny Car division, earning $25,000 with a victory over 
four-time Winston Series champion Kenny Bernstein. Larry Morgan was the Pro 
Stock winner at 187.85 m.p.h. and 7.355 seconds. Second was 1988 Winston Series 
runner-up Warren Johnson.

DAVIS CUP AT SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
MCENROE, AGASSI COMPLETE SWEEP

<TEXT>
<P>
Davis Cup themes of the week: 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe isn't getting older; he's getting better. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi has "toned down" his act. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. team may just be, as captain Tom Gorman insists, "stronger than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans completed their surprisingly easy 5-0 sweep over a powerful 
French team Sunday at the San Diego Sports Arena when Agassi beat Yannick Noah, 
6-3, 7-6 (9-7), followed by McEnroe's 6-3, 6-1 waltz over Henri Leconte. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's matches meant next to nothing because the United States had taken an 
insurmountable 3-0 lead Saturday night with a victory by the doubles team of 
Ken Flach and Robert Seguso. Which is why Davis Cup officials followed the 
common practice of reducing them to the best of three sets on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
The United States advances to the World Group semifinals July 21-23 against 
defending Davis Cup defending champion West Germany at a site to be determined 
by the West Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Early speculation points to Dortmund, the site of West Germany's 1988 semifinal 
Davis Cup victory over Yugoslavia. Dortmund is located in the heart of the 
country's industrial district and has a huge indoor arena. The surface will 
probably be the same fast Supreme Court used in San Diego this weekend. It is 
Boris Becker's favorite court. And Becker's mentor, Ian Tiriac, is the promoter 
for the match. 
</P>
<P>
The West German team, which defeated Czechoslovakia, 3-2, this weekend in a 
surprisingly close quarterfinal, features Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb. Steeb, 
better on slow courts, beat Agassi last month in Florida. Becker has won 
Wimbledon twice. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"To say it's likely for us to win (against the West Germans) is an 
understatement," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly go in as favorites," McEnroe added. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi says he's playing the best tennis of his life and the Las Vegas resident 
claims his game no longer resembles a lounge act. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that all that stuff (his on-court antics) was so new last year made 
everybody think I was a comedian or something and not a tennis player," Agassi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Noah knows he is a tennis player. Agassi broke Noah's serve in the sixth game 
of the first set with a forehand passing shot on the line. He won the 
second-set tiebreaker and the match when Noah served his only double fault. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Agassi threw his shirt to an adoring crowd. Show men fade slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of McEnroe's match never appeared in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew within two minutes I was already into it," said McEnroe, who improved 
his record against Leconte to 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Noah nor Leconte was able to break McEnroe's serve in his two matches 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The final U.S. theme: Unity. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso, who have feuded in the past, say they are closer than ever. 
McEnroe, 30, and Agassi, 18, say they are learning to live with their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of fire up off his youthfulness," McEnroe said. "And he sort of learns 
from my experience. It's a good combination." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the United States won the Davis Cup was in France in 1982. If the 
Americans defeat the West Germans, they will play the winner of Yugoslavia vs. 
Sweden in the championship, which will be played Dec. 15-17.

SCOTT OSTLER: INSTEAD OF PEANUTS AND CRACKER JACK, IT'S TACOS, BRATWURST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There is a revolution in ballpark food, and I spent Sunday afternoon down in 
the trenches, investigating. 
</P>
<P>
While the Angels were raising their team batting average several points at the 
expense of the Seattle Mariners, I raised my cholesterol level to around 300. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if it's possible to hit 400 in this modern age of ballpark food. 
You'd have to be selective -- lay off tempting salads and not let any Polish 
sausages slip off the corner of your plate. 
</P>
<P>
And you'd have to avoid Candlestick Park, where the people who feed the San 
Francisco Giants' fans have gone to a new cuisine, featuring yogurt, meatless 
hot dogs, salads and mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mistake, of course. Anyone who is smart enough to eat that well 
wouldn't be a Giants fan. 
</P>
<P>
Mineral water? What next? Fourth-inning tea break? 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't aware the Giants' fans were such discerning diners. Based on their 
behavior at the ballpark, I figured a seven-course meal for a Giants fan was 
six beers, then eat the paper cups they came in. 
</P>
<P>
But I digress. The Angels' approach to new food is to expand on the junk theme, 
offer a greater variety than the ballpark staples of hot dogs, peanuts and 
nachos. 
</P>
<P>
I opened Sunday with chicken tacos at the Mexican food stand, the Old El Paso 
Cantina, which is part of the "Food Fair" located in the lobby on the field 
level, behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
I give this stand high marks for ambiance. There were tiny serapes hanging on 
the wall, and a sombrero, creating a veritable festival atmosphere. But the 
food lacked authenticity, if not elasticity. 
</P>
<P>
The taco shells were like the Dallas Cowboys defense -- they bend but don't 
break. They had the hardiness of cardboard, with none of the aroma or flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The meat was overcooked, mysterious chicken chunks. I ate one taco and was 
tempted to take the other shell home for my dog as a chew toy, but then 
remembered that I don't have a dog. Instead, I took the taco back to the stand 
and asked for my money back. 
</P>
<P>
My full purchase price was cheerfully refunded. OK, it was refunded, with no 
forms to fill out and no angry glares from the chef. 
</P>
<P>
I went away wiser and no poorer, a welcome bargain in any aspect of life. But I 
was still hungry. 
</P>
<P>
The Cinnamon Shop beckoned. Generally I try to avoid sweets, but I have been 
told that the cinnamon rolls at Anaheim Stadium are chunks o' heaven, light and 
luscious morsels of pastry. 
</P>
<P>
My roll, unfortunately, was as light and as chewy as a brick of pine tar. It 
didn't melt in my mouth, and I would think highly of its chances of survival in 
a ceramic kiln. 
</P>
<P>
It was sticky, though. If Jay Howell had this stuff on his fingers, they'd have 
to pry the ball out of his hand with a crowbar. I stopped eating my roll when 
it occurred to me that if a chunk sticks in my esophagus the way it sticks on 
my fingers, I might never eat again. 
</P>
<P>
Next was the pizza stand. The pizza looked decent, but they only had pepperoni, 
which I don't eat. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pick off the slices of pepperoni," the woman behind the counter 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
I declined, having done that in the past and finding it leaves unsightly 
craters in one's pizza, with the bare dough exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally I struck pay dirt at the fish and chips stand. For $2 I got several 
large pieces of fried fish. I had to dig through huge wads of fried batter to 
get to the fish itself, but the effort was worth it. The fish is tasty, if only 
lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't try the Sausage House -- which features Italian sausage, grilled 
bratwurst, grilled knackwurst and smoked Polish sausage -- because life is too 
short. 
</P>
<P>
And I didn't make it to the Potato Hut, where baked potatoes are served with a 
variety of toppings. I try to eat right, and I love baked potatoes, but there 
is something basically un-American about going to a baseball game and eating a 
potato topped with broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
I remember with fondness a simpler, more innocent time when, for a young boy, 
the ballpark was a safe haven from broccoli and baked potatoes. The Angels may 
be alienating millions of kids, while satisfying a relative handful of bad 
potato freaks. 
</P>
<P>
My only other complaint is that the Food Fair closes too soon, immediately 
after the game, denying fans a shot at the traditional one bratwurst for the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
By game's end I had decided to try the pizza anyway, even if it meant being a 
pepperoni plucker, but the ovens were shut down for the night. I guess the 
Angels don't want to spoil the appetites of all the fans who would be rushing 
home to mom's big Sunday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
In summation, I salute the Angels' efforts to cater to the increasingly varied 
and sophisticated palate of the modern baseball fan, even if there are a few 
kinks to be worked out of the taco shells and cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
My only real beef is with the napkins. Call me superstitious, but I consider it 
bad luck to eat in a place where the paper napkins are imprinted with an 
advertisement, complete with 800 phone number, for a hospital.

<P>
TOLLNER RETURNS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS CHARGER QUARTERBACK COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing you will notice about Ted Tollner, if you speak with him in 
person, is that he will be looking right back at you. He will be friendly but 
focused. Responsive but riveted. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you will notice about him is a face and an enthusiasm you sense 
you've seen or heard somewhere before. 
</P>
<P>
It does Tollner a disservice, but the names of Dick Vitale, college basketball 
commentator, and Jim Lange, the former host of TV's Dating Game, come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But Tollner does not string non sequiturs or self-promote in the bold-faced 
manner of Vitale. And though he resembles Lange, he does not see the world 
through rose-colored glasses the smiling way the game-show host used to. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner is straight-up-and-down serious about his new job as the San Diego 
Chargers' assistant head coach/quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent starter he inherits is Mark Malone, whose passing statistics have 
been the worst in the American Football Conference each of the past two years. 
The hope for the future is a promising but untested quarterback, Mark Vlasic, 
who injured a knee in Atlanta late last season. The Chargers' fallback 
quarterback is much-traveled Babe Laufenberg, whom Tollner once recruited when 
Laufenberg was a senior at Encino's Crespi High. Tollner was then an assistant 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Chargers, 6-10 in 1988, win with the quarterbacks presently on their 
roster? 
</P>
<P>
"My answer has to be 'Yes,' " Tollner said. "And I'm going to base it on this: 
The Chargers won six last year, and Seattle (winners of the dreadful AFC West) 
won nine. If you take three games and say: 'Can we take what's here and get 
more consistent with the improvement that's going to come from the natural 
maturity of some people and the continuation of this offensive scheme?' . . . 
If I look at the overall thing and say 'Can we be some percentage points better 
at the consistency of the quarterback position?' My answer is, 'Yes,' because 
we're talking about a line of six to nine games." 
</P>
<P>
Tollner, a former college quarterback at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, knows the 
disproportionate importance of the position he now coaches. He also knows the 
Chargers' quarterback outlook could (and should) change, either through draft 
or trade, before the 1989 season begins. But more important, he knows that's 
the business of Coach Dan Henning and Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of 
football operations. 
</P>
<P>
So he will look you in the eye and say: "For us to do what we want to do 
offensively, the quarterback position is the obvious key. We have talked about 
it. But I don't think it would be proper for me as an assistant to get into 
that. It should come from Steve or Dan." 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Ted Tollner who ran the football program at USC for four 
stormy years. Despite taking over a team already on probation for ticket 
scandal violations dating back to Marv Goux, a John Robinson assistant, his 
record at USC was 26-20-1. It wasn't good enough. In eight games against 
arch-rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, Tollner's Trojans were 1-7. On Dec. 8, 1986, 
Tollner became only the third USC head coach to be fired since the school began 
football in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner spent the past two years in Buffalo supervising the wide receivers and 
waiting patiently for more responsibility. When the Bills replaced offensive 
coordinator Jim Ringo with Ted Marchibroda last month, nobody blamed Tollner 
for interpreting this as the right reason to listen to Dan Henning's sales 
pitch when the Chargers named Henning their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Henning and Tollner had never worked together, so Henning's interest was a 
rarity in the relatively closed circles of National Football League coaching. 
But mutual acquaintances -- mainly Washington Redskins General Manager Bobby 
Beathard and former Charger assistant Ernie Zampese -- promoted a meeting 
between the two. It lasted five hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we talked, the more I got excited about the situation," Tollner said. 
"Hopefully that's a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
Said Laufenberg: "Dan Henning knows the passing game, and Ted Tollner knows the 
passing game. Plus, both have been head coaches. Effectively, we now have two 
quarterback coaches. On a lot of staffs, you're lucky if you have one that 
really knows the position." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Tollner was largely responsible for developing Trojan quarterback 
Rodney Peete before the arrival of Tollner's successor, Larry Smith. Peete was 
a Heisman Trophy candidate much of last season. And it's not inconceivable 
Peete could wind up with the Chargers, although at the moment it's a stretch to 
imagine the Chargers reaching for Peete with the eighth pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney offers many, many things, and I think he can play in this league," 
Tollner said. "First of all, he has the intellect that it takes to play in a 
sophisticated scheme. He has an excellent release, touch and accuracy on the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"His bonus qualities of quick feet and scrambling are in the top echelon, and 
he has enough arm. He wouldn't be in that great arm category by any means. But 
there are people who have less velocity playing winning football in this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
The natural assumption in any discussion about Peete and the Chargers is that 
Peete, because of his history with Tollner, would have less to learn about the 
complexities that normally hold back rookie quarterbacks. Tollner warns against 
that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The design and the terminology here are going to be different than what we had 
at USC," he said. "So he is going to have to learn, I would think, a totally 
new system." 
</P>
<P>
If he becomes a Charger, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Peete was quick to stick up for Tollner when USC fired him. "I would have bet 
anything he would have been back next year," Peete, the son of a football 
coach, said at the time. "He has done a lot for me, not just on the field but 
off the field, too. And I've learned a whole lot from him. I want to thank him 
for giving me all those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the beginning of the 1986 season that Tollner's Trojans would 
have to show the kind of progress in the win-loss category that would make it 
impossible for Athletic Director Mike McGee to dismiss him. McGee and 
university president James Zumberge decided 7-4 wasn't the kind of progress 
they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
But probation that kept the Trojans from bowl games in 1982 and 1983 and off 
television in 1983 and 1985 were too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tollner retained his dignity throughout his last season and refused to 
burn bridges when it was too late to get back to the right side. "This year, 
he's written the book on handling pressure," Peete said of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But 10 times in Tollner's four years, the Trojans lost by 20 or more points. 
Only one of his teams finished in the top 20 in the final wire-service polls. 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson, Tollner's predecessor, was a combined 11-3 against UCLA and 
Notre Dame and lost only two games by 20 points or more in seven years at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is 18-6 in two years at USC, including a combined 2-2 vs UCLA and Notre 
Dame. He is 0-2 in Rose Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner's only public complaint upon his departure from USC was his insistence 
that USC broke his contract, which had two years remaining. It took about a 
year, but Tollner's attorney and USC officials finally reached a settlement. 
"Part of the settlement was for me not to disclose what the settlement was," 
Tollner said. "But it got squared away in a very, very positive light. It was 
very favorable." 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, when Trojan basketball Coach Stan Morrison left in 1986, 
it took 2 1/2 years to reach agreement on the remainder of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took Tollner awhile to put the USC experience behind him. "I try to 
remember the best parts," he said. "All coaching jobs have their highs and 
lows, and my reflections on it, especially now that two years have gone by, are 
much more positive about the situation and the way it was -- coming in with the 
probation and leaving and having a moderate amount of success while we were 
there . . . winning a Rose Bowl . . . and having a winning record and going to 
two other bowl games -- we were moderately successful. Under the conditions, 
maybe we were more than that. But that's speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we left it (the program) healthy. The first year (after the firing) I 
think there was hurt. The firing process stings a little more. But as soon as 
you get on with your life and get coaching again, the sting disappears and you 
reflect back on the whole thing. At this point, I reflect upon it much more 
positively." 
</P>
<P>
Was the firing fair? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you have to say yes," Tollner said. "There was a difference of opinion 
on how the program should be run, I guess, between Mike (McGee) and I. And 
that's fair. He's the athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind we were headed in the right direction. In his mind we weren't. He's 
in that chair. I think if there's a difference of opinion on where you're 
going, there should be a change made. You've got to be on the same page. From 
my perspective as a football coach, I believed in what we were doing, and that 
will never change." 
</P>
<P>
Tollner has been through lots worse than getting fired. He was one of 26 
survivors of the Cal Poly plane crash on Oct. 29, 1960, in Toledo, Ohio, that 
killed 22 people, including 16 of his teammates. Tollner suffered a fractured 
and dislocated left ankle but returned to play quarterback for the team in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
And now he has jumped from a team that advanced to the AFC championship game 
last January to a team with an impatient owner, an untested general manager and 
a new coach who lost almost twice as many games as he won in his only previous 
experience running an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
But those are not the only considerations. All three of his children live in 
Southern California as do his three grandchildren. Plus, he is already familiar 
with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I know from when I was coaching at San Diego State the kind of excitement that 
can be generated in this community if you can win," Tollner said. "Whether we 
can get it back to that point or not, that's the challenge. I just keep 
blinking my eyes to make sure it's true that I'm back here." 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, it's true.

CBS denied a report that the network plans to air a piece alleging that retired 
major league umpire Satch Davidson helped fix baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News, citing a source close to CBS News, reported that the 
network "is planning to air a segment within a few days on gambling by umpires, 
including 'proof' that former major league ump Satch Davidson helped fix 
baseball games." 
</P>
<P>
CBS spokesman Tom Goodman called the report "irresponsible and untrue. Someone 
gave the Daily News the wrong information." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said the commissioner's office was aware of the 
report and would conduct a routine check of the allegations.

Athletic Director Doug Dickey says Tennessee basketball Coach Wade Houston, who 
broke racial barriers when he was named as the school's first black head coach, 
will not be offered a membership in an all-white country club. 
</P>
<P>
The UT athletic department provided $15,000 memberships to the exclusive 
Cherokee Country Club to Houston's predecessors, Ray Mears and Don DeVoe. 
Football Coach Johnny Majors and Dickey also are members. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and Houston discussed the matter before he was hired last week, Dickey 
said. Houston said he has no intention of fighting the decision.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
GUERRERO, IN GROOVE, GETS FOUR MORE RBIS TO LEAD CARDINALS, 15-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once he overcame his anger at the Dodgers for trading him, Pedro Guerrero took 
a look at the St. Louis Cardinals' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
When he saw all that speed and talent ahead of him in the batting order, his 
enthusiasm knew no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure going to get a lot of chances to drive in runs," he said. "With Vince 
Coleman, Ozzie Smith and Willie McGee in front of me, I'll probably have 
someone on base every time I come up. Who could ask for anything more?" 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, ordinarily a slow starter, hasn't had as many baserunners as he 
expected, but he is driving in runs. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero hit a three-run home run and finished with four RBIs Sunday to lead 
the Cardinals to a 15-3 romp over the Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith hasn't played yet this season, McGee is also hurt and sometimes he bats 
third instead of cleanup, but in just four games, Guerrero has driven in 10 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Once he really starts to hit, look out. He has all those RBIs with just five 
hits in 17 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember so many RBIs in just four games," he said. "I guess I'm just 
hitting at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his injuries, Guerrero batted .286 last season, but he was .371 with 
runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we got him for," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, a lifetime .307 hitter, mostly as a Dodger, isn't satisfied with his 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm swinging at a lot of bad pitches," he said. "That's something I want to 
control. Today when I struck out, I swung at a ball in the dirt. Even on the 
home run, the first pitch I swung at was way outside. I guess I was a little 
anxious. But I enjoy batting with men on base." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Oquendo, playing shortstop in place of Smith, also drove in four runs for 
the Cardinals, two of them in the first inning after Guerrero was walked. The 
Cardinals made it easy for Joe Magrane to even his record at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
New York 2, Montreal 1 -- The only rap against Dwight Gooden in his first three 
seasons with the Mets was that he didn't pitch too well in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, only 24 but in his sixth professionalseason, ran his record to 2-0 when 
Kevin Elster doubled home the tie-breaking run in the ninth inning at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Both victories, the only ones for the Mets, everyone's favorite to win the 
National League pennant, came in daylight. He has given up eight hits and four 
earned runs in 15 innings. He has struck out 15. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a duel between Gooden and Dennis Martinez. Although he gave up 
nine hits, Martinez left after eight innings with a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Andy McGaffigan opened the ninth by walking Gary Carter. Len Dykstra ran for 
Carter and was sacrificed to second. Elster doubled to center for his eighth 
hit in 17 at-bats. Last season as a rookie, the young shortstop hit only .214. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 9, Cincinnati 1 -- Rick Reuschel will be 40 next month, but since 
he made his astonishing comeback in 1985, he has become one of the most 
consistent pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Give him a lead and he's really tough. When Matt Williams contributed a 
first-inning grand slam at Cincinnati, his first hit of the season, the Reds 
were through. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, 19-11 last season, gave up four hits and a run in six innings to pick 
up his second victory in a row. Twenty wins at 40 is his goal. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jackson was the loser, but perhaps he deserved a better fate. He retired 
the first two batters, but after Will Clark singled, outfielders Eric Davis and 
Kal Daniels misplayed Kevin Mitchell's fly ball that bounced over the fence. 
Two walks forced in a run, then Williams made it 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson displayed anger when he was asked if he blamed the outfielders for not 
catching the ball. "Your question is pretty stupid, to tell the truth," he 
said. "The damage wasn't done until the home run." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, Pittsburgh 3 -- Outfielder Andre Dawson was throwing snowballs 
before the game at frozen Wrigley Field, but it was Rick Sutcliffe's fastballs 
that enabled the Cubs to sweep the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
At game time it was 33 degrees and there was a 25 m.p.h. wind. However, 
Sutcliffe went the distance, striking out 11, giving up seven hits and no 
walks, in getting his second victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Andre throwing snowballs, I didn't think there would be a game," 
Sutcliffe said. "It was cold, but once you face the first batter, you put it 
all behind you." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates are 1-5 and in last place. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Houston 4 -- Normally, the Astros are tough to beat at home. But 
with this loss, they have opened 2-4 in the newly refurbished Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn and Jack Clark each drove in a pair of runs and the Padres turned in 
a triple play as they beat Houston ace Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
It was a surprising loss for Scott. The Astros presented him with a 4-0 lead in 
the first two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Clark drove in two runs in the third when the Padres tied it. Gwynn's second 
hit, a single, scored Roberto Alomar from second in the fifth. It was Alomar's 
error that helped the Astros to a three-run second inning. DAN HAFNER

MARSH SETS UCLA RECORD IN 100 METERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Mike Marsh set a UCLA school record of 10.07 seconds in the 100 meters 
Saturday in a nonscoring track and field meet at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh finished second to Florida's Dennis Mitchell, who ran 10.06 in a race 
that was just under the allowable limit for wind. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic track and field team, won the 200 in 
20.42 but was limping after the race. The Bruins' Steve Lewis, gold medal 
winner in the 400 at Seoul, also was entered in the 200 but pulled up during 
the race with a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
They are doubtful for Saturday's dual meet at UCLA against LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Other outstanding marks at the Florida meet were a season best of 44.66 for 400 
meters by freshman Tyrone Kemp of Florida, a 195-foot toss in the discus by 
UCLA's Brian Blutreich and a 212-2 hammer throw by UCLA's Dave Wilson.

VIOLA GIVES UP TWO HOMERS AND LOSES HIS SECOND STRAIGHT, 8-1

<P>
The love affair between left-hander Frank Viola and Minnesota Twins fans, which 
reached a peak in 1987 when he played a major role in making the Twins world 
champions, has turned colder than the Midwest weather. 
</P>
<P>
It was freezing and snowy in Minneapolis Sunday, and it wasn't exactly warm in 
the Metrodome after Viola gave up two home runs to the eager young Baltimore 
Orioles, who beat the Twins, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Viola followed up his two World Series victories by posting a 24-7 record in 
1988 and winning the Cy Young Award. He was acclaimed as the best left-hander 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
When he turned down the Twins' offer of a three-year contract extension of $7.9 
million and said he was leaving after this season, he drew criticism even 
before he lost the opener last Tuesday to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The pregame greeting Sunday was warmer, but after giving up a three-run homer 
to Randy Milligan and a two-run shot to Cal Ripken, the Metrodome shook with 
boos. 
</P>
<P>
Viola was 14-2 at the Metrodome last season, but is 0-2 already this year. He 
said he is taking his poor start in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I threw the ball good today," said Viola, who wants an extension 
worth $8.1 million for three years. "All in all, I have to be pleased except 
for five runs and a loss. I guarantee you this isn't the end of my season. I'll 
be back." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who lost their first 21 games last season, are now 3-3 after 
collecting five hits in six innings to back Jeff Ballard's seven-hitter. 
Ballard missed a shutout when Kent Hrbek hit his second home run in two games 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan's home run came in the first inning and Ripken's in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken was 0 for 14 prior to the home run, which followed an infield hit by 
Mike Devereaux with two out. It was Ripken's second home run of the season and 
gave Ballard a 5-0 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was conscious of the fact that the Twins like to put big innings together to 
break open games," Ballard said. "It was nice to have five runs before they 
even scored." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, New York 3 -- It was new Manager Dallas Green, not owner George 
Steinbrenner, who lashed out at the Yankees Saturday night after just the fifth 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We stink," Green said. "I don't care about injuries. It's no excuse for 
playing dumb baseball. We're trying to hit 10-run home runs when we need a 
couple of base hits back-to-back." 
</P>
<P>
What Green didn't tell his players was what to do with the knuckleball of Tom 
Candiotti and they lost their fifth in a row since starting the season by 
beating Frank Viola. 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti baffled them, allowing only fourhits in seven innings, and left with 
a 4-1 lead. The Yankees scored twice on an error by second baseman Jerry Browne 
and had the bases loaded in the eighth with one out before Doug Jones shut the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who had 37 saves last season but pitched only five innings all spring 
because of a pulled rib-cage muscle, put a quick end to the rally to give the 
Indians their first three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out pinch-hitter Jamie Quirk, then retired Mike Pagliarulo on a fly 
to right. He struck out two more in the ninth for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hurt one bit," Jones said. "I feel completely rested. "I don't feel 
like I've lost any time. My pitches are all there." 
</P>
<P>
Once again former Dodger Steve Sax provided much of the Yankee attack. He was 
two for three and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy John, the only Yankee winner this season, was the loser. He gave up nine 
hits in seven innings, but only two of the four runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, Chicago 2 -- As a two-time 20-game winner, Dave Stewart believes it 
is a good idea to be ready to open the season. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out nine White Sox in 8 1/3 innings at Oakland and stretched his 
April winning streak to eight games. Last season he was 6-0 in the first month 
and is 2-0 already this season. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox hammered Stewart in his early seasons with the Athletics, but 
they can do nothing with the hard-throwing former Dodger lately. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who hasn't lost to the White Sox since the season finale in 1987, had 
held them to two runs in 28 innings until he ran into problems in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart gave up a single Greg Walker and a double to Carlton Fisk. When Ron 
Kittle hit a sharp grounder for an out, Manager Tony La Russa, brought the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
Sox Manager Jeff Torborg was impressed. "He came right at us with fastballs and 
got some strikeouts in key spots," Torborg said. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 8, Kansas City 6 -- Wade Boggs had four hits at Kansas City and the Red 
Sox, the last team to win a game this season, finally got a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals jumped in front 4-0, but then four relievers shut them down and the 
Red Sox pounded out 13 hits and were helped by third baseman Kevin Seitzer's 
three errors. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Burks had two hits for the Red Sox and his three-run double put the Red 
Sox ahead 6-4 in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 3, Toronto 2 -- Although his Rangers are off to a 4-1 start at Arlington, 
Tex., Manager Bobby Valentine is not happy with the way the middle of the 
lineup is hitting. 
</P>
<P>
He felt a little better about it when clean-up hitter Ruben Sierra hit a 
two-run home run with one out in the ninth off Tom Henke to pull out a win for 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a very good at-bat until the last swing," Valentine said. "Nobody in 
the middle of the lineup had hit a home run all spring until that one. It was 
an exciting way to end a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra's smash gave Kenny Rogers his first win in the majors. Rogers, appearing 
in only his second game, pitched one inning. DAN HAFNER

New York Yankees outfielder Rickey Henderson stole the 800th base of his career 
in the third inning of Sunday's game against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, with two out in a scoreless game, walked against Tom Candiotti and 
then stole second before scoring on Steve Sax's single. 
</P>
<P>
It was Henderson's sixth stolen base in six games this season. He's been caught 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson trails Ty Cobb by 92 stolen bases for the American League record. Lou

<P>
THERE'S MORE TO ENSENADA THAN A PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lorin Weiss has been associated with the Newport-Ensenada International Yacht 
Race race since 1952 -- almost from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
But he has never seen it because he has always been in the middle of it -- 
"racing or on the committee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss is general chairman of the 42nd event this year, and he marvels at how it 
has changed in becoming the world's largest international sailboat race. 
</P>
<P>
"In '52, you could get a complete lobster dinner in Ensenada for $2, and a 
bottle of tequila was 50 cents," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
That's the general attitude about the Ensenada, that it's a party race, and 
there's no denying that winning, though serious to some, is secondary to many 
of the between 600 to 700 entries. 
</P>
<P>
But Weiss and Doug Wall, president of the Newport Ocean Sailing Assn. that runs 
the race, say there also is a serious side more important than a victory. When 
all those boats set sail southward at noon April 28, three 18-wheelers will be 
rolling down Interstate 5 toward the border loaded with hospital beds, dental 
chairs, clothes and other items needed by the people whose town is invaded by 
the sailors on the last weekend of April every year. 
</P>
<P>
The program, "Hands Across the Border," started 11 years ago after devastating 
floods hit Baja California border towns shortly before the '78 race. Never was 
the diversity of the two cities linked by the race so evident. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago Ensenada Mayor Ernesto Ruffo Appel mentioned to Newport Beach Mayor 
John Cox that the city had built a new firehouse but couldn't afford a fire 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Newport Beach was about to surplus out an old truck, which Cox 
offered to Appel. The truck also benefitted a nearby cement plant, which with 
the added fire protection was able to satisfy insurance requirements and expand 
its operation and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers said as they unloaded their 18-wheeler at the military hospital last 
year they could see patients being moved off the floor into the new beds. 
</P>
<P>
Again this year, a truck will be parked at the Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club, 
1601 Bayside Drive, Corona Del Mar, from April 19 until the day of the race to 
collect donations for Mexican orphans. They need such items as clothing, 
bedding, towels, furniture, kitchen supplies and appliances, household items 
and toys. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Ensenada race has added another public service. Each boat will 
fly a burgee stating, "Drug Use is Life Abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Allison, 42, a dropout yacht broker from Seattle, has a passion for 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being at sea, I love being on a boat, I love to travel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has picked the right event: The fifth Whitbread Round the World Race that 
starts from Southampton, England, Sept. 2 for a 10-month, 32,943-mile 
circumnavigation of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Allison, who plans to have a crew of 10, is one of only two American skippers 
among the 37 entries. The other is Nance Frank of Newport, R.I., who plans to 
sail with an all-female crew. 
</P>
<P>
Allison has crewed in three previous Whitbreads, placing second twice and 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks it will cost about $2 million, a bare-bone budget compared to some 
rivals who are investing up to $6 million. Allison is counting on collecting 
some sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"The closer you get to race day, the easier it is to sell," he said. "But you 
need it at the front end." 
</P>
<P>
Allison is having a Santa Cruz 70 built by Bill Lee, the first to produce the 
ultra light-displacement boats (ULDBs) in significant numbers. These boats 
dominate off-wind, one-way races such as the Ensenada or Transpac, but Allison 
thinks they would also be practical for the Whitbread. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only one like it in the race," he said. "But it's basically a 
downwind race. We figure only 12% will be upwind in heavy conditions . . . the 
worst part north of Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
"It will require seamanship not to break the boat, but it's an incredibly fast 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Pending the outcome of the San Diego Yacht Club's appeal on forfeiting the Cup 
to New Zealand, the America's Cup Organizing Committee -- $3 million in debt -- 
has laid off seven employees, including executive vice president Tom Ehman and 
public relations director Tom Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Only a secretary to answer the phone and an accountant to open the mail remain. 
Mitchell said the layoff was "Plan C" among three decisions New York Supreme 
Court Justice Carmen Ciparick could have made: San Diego's catamaran was OK, 
the cat wasn't OK but the defense would be re-sailed, or New Zealand gets the 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC says it owes $4 million and has $1 million in assets. San Diego banker 
Malin Burnham, who heads the ACOC as he did Sail America, has guaranteed the 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's Steve Dair, who with his brother Brian planned to sail the 
ill-fated "Wingmill" against the Australian defenders at Melbourne in January, 
says plans are afoot to start a new campaign this summer, build two similar 
boats with rotating airfoils in 1990 and challenge the Australians again in 
'91. 
</P>
<P>
First order of business: raising $300,000 to finance the project. Also, a 
recent videotape presentation at the Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club left no doubt 
that a TV helicopter only 50 feet away caused the boat to capsize and break 
apart minutes before the first race was to start. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Nautical Museum will host a pre-Ensenada race reception 
April 26, from 5 p.m. to 8, featuring multihull sailors Rudy Choy, Bob Hanel, 
Vic Stern and Mike Kane. Hanel's Double Bullet, later sunk in the Caribbean, 
set the race record of 10 hours 31 minutes 2 seconds in 1983, the same year he 
set the Transpac record of 7 days 7:30:15 to Hawaii. Choy's Aikane X-5, with 
Kane aboard, has won the Ensenada the last two years. . . . ESPN will start its 
series of '89 sailing programs with the Congressional Cup at Long Beach Monday 
at 8 p.m. Rod Davis, the American sailing for New Zealand, collected an 
unprecedented third victory in the match-racing event with a 9-0 sweep.

DAVIS CUP ROUNDUP;

<P>
BECKER GIVES WEST GERMANY VICTORY OVER CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Becker defeated Milan Srejber, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, Sunday to give defending 
champion West Germany a 3-2 victory over Czechoslovakia in a Davis Cup World 
Group quarterfinal at Prague, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany will play host to the United States in the semifinals July 21-23. 
The United States advanced with a victory over France. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia had taken a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five competition Saturday 
after Srejber and Petr Korda beat Becker and Eric Jelen in doubles. But 
Carl-Uwe Steeb evened the score by beating Karel Novacek, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, in 
Sunday's first match and Becker clinched the victory by overpowering Srejber. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to win against Czechoslovakia in Prague before 12,000 of 
their supporters," West Germany's captain, Nikki Pilic, said. "We didn't feel 
too well after losing the doubles and we knew we would have to show on Sunday 
how strong mentally we are." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, ranked fourth in the world, got off to a fast start. He broke Srejber 
in the second game with two blistering returns and won the opening set in 31 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Becker double-faulted twice to give Srejber two break points in the second game 
of the second set. But Becker came back to win the game and the set. 
</P>
<P>
"After that (second) double fault, I really had to concentrate," Becker said. 
"But I held my serve and that was probably the decisive moment in the match." 
</P>
<P>
Steeb had evened the series by beating Novacek, who had replaced the injured 
Miloslav Mecir. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden advanced to the Davis Cup semifinals by beating Austria, 3-2, at Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg clinched the victory when he overpowered Austria's Horst Skoff, 
6-3, 6-2, 6-1, to give Sweden an insurmountable 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg only needed 1 hour 23 minutes for his victory, appearing in control 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a near perfect game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff seemed tired after upsetting Mats Wilander in a match lasting more than 
six hours Friday and also playing in the doubles Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With Sweden's victory assured, the second singles match was reduced to the best 
of three sets, and Austria's Alexander Antonitsch upset Mats Wilander, 6-3, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Sweden will play Yugoslavia, which defeated Spain in Split, 
Yugoslavia.

ARCHITECTURE: DESIGNERS GIVE HOSPITALS MORE APPEALING FACE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each room is decorated with colorful Amish quilts and cheerful ferns. The rooms 
are spacious enough to allow a relative or friend to sleep overnight, while the 
large bay windows offer long views over Santa Monica and the Pacific and let in 
floods of light. "Natural light lifts people's spirits," said Michael Bobrow, 
the architect who redesigned the Santa Monica building. 
</P>
<P>
Only he's not describing a new luxury hotel, but the $30-million remodeling 
that he designed for the 61-year-old Santa Monica Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrow, along with his wife, Julia Thomas, run BTA, perhaps the leading 
architecture firm in the area to specialize in hospital design. "There has been 
a revolution in the character of the hospital, especially in the past five 
years," he said. "The old institutional atmosphere based on long periods spent 
in a sickbed is on its way out." 
</P>
<P>
Their redesign of the hospital, since renamed the Santa Monica Hospital Medical 
Center, is a prime example of the new kind of hospital architecture that is 
necessarily more residential in character. Or what Bobrow called a "health care 
campus." 
</P>
<P>
The change in hospital design stems not so much from architects, however, but 
from cutbacks in federal and state spending on Medicare and Medicaid. Now the 
federal government imposes a price ceiling based on average regional treatment 
costs for groups of illnesses and therefore limits the amounts hospitals are 
reimbursed for specific treatments. 
</P>
<P>
The federal price ceilings also have sparked a trend toward separating 
traditional services, such as minor operations and standard tests, from the 
hospital to specialized medical boutiques run directly by doctors or outside 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efficiency Stressed 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has been a shift from long-stay inpatient care to shorter 
stays and more outpatient treatments. Hospitals are now under great pressure 
not only to be more efficient, but to compete for more sophisticated clientele 
who are careful about costs and care about the quality of the hospital 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
To define and refine the right hospital image, Bobrow and Thomas held a number 
of community workshops in Santa Monica, plus consultations with the staff. A 
clear picture of the changing hospital scene emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the increased competition for patients, they learned that there is a 
growing independence by doctors who now often provide treatment in their own 
surgeries rather than sending patients to hospitals. And hospitals must deal 
with a shortage of nurses, which dictates a more compact hospital layout so 
that fewer staff members can supervise more beds from one nursing station. 
</P>
<P>
During their design work, Bobrow and Thomas kept in mind a residential image 
for the modernized hospital. The new center's exterior features pink stucco 
walls and generous bay windows that give it the air of a series of brownstone 
row houses. The lobby courts between the wings are small Japanese gardens meant 
for "contemplation and visual relief," Thomas explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rooms With a View 
</P>
<P>
A new west wing was added to accommodate the redesigned patients' rooms. 
Although the number of rooms dropped from 365 to 320, each patient's room is 
half again as large. In the old hospital, the cramped patients' rooms had small 
windows so the rooms were dark, and the rooms sometimes faced another hospital 
wing, so there was no view worth enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the spacious bay windows not only cheer up patients, but as the natural 
light spills into the hallways, they also help visitors find their way around 
an often confusing hospital layout. 
</P>
<P>
By now it has become accepted in the architectural community that the need to 
economize has profoundly affected hospital design. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line has impelled the health-care community into a long-overdue 
concern for the comfort and convenience of both patients and staff," said 
Margaret Gaskie, senior editor of Architectural Record magazine. "Sheer 
economics has spurred the introduction of new programs, new settings and new 
images." 
</P>
<P>
The designs of new hospitals now being planned also reflect the streamlined, 
cost-conscious relationship between doctors, nurses and patients. Bobrow and 
Thomas also have designed the proposed 150-bed Palmdale Hospital Medical Center 
in Antelope Valley, which is scheduled to break ground this summer. The 
hospital will separate the inpatient and surgical areas of the hospital from 
the wing of independent doctors' offices. Every procedure that does not require 
an extended period in bed, from light emergency care to minor surgery, will be 
performed in the doctors' and outpatients' section of the center. 
</P>
<P>
This separation of the mildly troubled from the truly sick ensures that people 
who come in to see their physician or have an X-ray, need never confront 
patients being wheeled about on gurneys, or catch glimpses of post-operative 
inmates plugged into an array of intravenous tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Airy patient rooms will be laid out around a central nursing station that 
resembles a hotel lobby with a fireplace and easy chairs. Paintings and plants, 
which often seem an afterthought in traditional hospitals, will be carefully 
integrated into the design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Equipment 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to these home-like touches, the technical areas of the hospital are 
designed to seem highly efficient. The rooms that contain sophisticated 
X-ray-type machines such as lithotripters, a computerized tomography scanner, 
linear accelerators, along with cancer radiation equipment, will have a sleek, 
high-tech look. "People like hospitals to look friendly in the private rooms 
and public spaces," Bobrow explained, "but when it comes to the technology, 
patients need to feel reassured that the machines and procedures being used 
upon their bodies are extreme state-of-the-art." 
</P>
<P>
Standardization is fast disappearing in every aspect of hospital design. The 
old days of institutional beige are over. Color schemes today are a fine-tuned 
response to an age of increasing specialization of services. 
</P>
<P>
At the California Pediatric Center on South Olive Street, designer Pat Ford 
talked of "creating something joyous" to reassure children taking a trip to the 
doctor. Ford planned family seating groups of metal outdoor furniture painted 
in bright reds and yellows to give young patients something appealing to sit on 
as they anxiously await consultation. The metal benches, Ford noted, also were 
"too heavy for the kids to throw at one another." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Splash of Color 
</P>
<P>
The color scheme Ford devised relies on mauve, cream and blue, "which are just 
interesting variations on the traditional red-yellow-blue children's colors," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In older hospitals, one major problem that often disorients patients and 
visitors is the simple matter of finding one's way through the maze of 
corridors to a specific room. To remedy this, a new design specialty called 
"way-finding" has been developed. 
</P>
<P>
A leading specialist in this field is designer Diana Polkinghorne of La 
Jolla-based Jain Malkin Inc. Her company has been hired to help people find 
their way around the 35-year-old Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fontana. 
"Right now the Fontana facility is confusing and huge," Polkinghorne said. 
"People often get lost." 
</P>
<P>
To remedy that, Polkinghorne relies on "a directional concept of visual clues." 
She said that "we have developed a system of color zones that help you locate 
yourself in the maze. We have set up a landmark system that points up the main 
corridors used by patients and the public from the secondary corridors 
restricted to staff use. The landmark system also clearly distinguishes the 
various hospital departments, so you know where you are at all times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Follow 
</P>
<P>
In many hospitals, the abundance of printed signs and numbers often confuses 
more than it clarifies. Way-finding weeds out unnecessary signs, and makes the 
notices that are left more prominent and simple to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall effect of all these changes in hospital design signals a basic 
shift in attitudes as well as services," Thomas said. "In the past, patients 
often had the feeling that medical facilities were huge and complex mechanisms 
that functioned autonomously, without much concern for the individual 
sufferer." 
</P>
<P>
In the new hospital, Thomas declared: "The patient is a precious human being 
who happens to need care, and the staff are also people sharing a humane and 
sensitive architecture."

GERMAN FASHIONS HIT THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DUESSELDORF, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago the phrase "German fashion" would have been considered a 
contradiction in terms. 
</P>
<P>
France, Italy, America -- even Japan -- were considered the world's fashion 
leaders. The Germans, it seemed, were on the dowdy side. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Today the best German designers are highly regarded throughout 
Europe. And what's more, West Germany's sales in the apparel industry are 
comfortably ahead of any other European country's -- more than $13 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
West German exports of clothing are second in Europe only to Italy's, mainly 
because of Italy's production of knitwear. 
</P>
<P>
The lean, leggy women strolling along Duesseldorf's Koenigsallee, or Munich's 
Maximilianstrasse, are as elegant and stylish as their counterparts on Milan's 
Via Monte Napoleone or Paris' Avenue Montaigne. German women spend half again 
as much on clothing as do French women. 
</P>
<P>
"The German fashion industry has always been important," Manfred Kronen, 
chairman of the Igedo International Fashion Fair here, told a visitor recently. 
"But to many it seems to have been a very well-kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
Now the secret is out: German designs, while not up to Paris' haute couture, 
have become fashionable. They are increasingly popular throughout Europe, not 
only with women but with men who appreciate quality at a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 180,000 buyers attended Duesseldorf's four fashion fairs. There were 
8,000 exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Igedo fashion fair has an office that is open year around, with dozens of 
fashion houses maintaining permanent displays of clothing, accessories and 
cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spread-Out Industry 
</P>
<P>
Duesseldorf claims the title of West Germany's fashion capital, but Kronen 
acknowledges that the industry is spread out. Duesseldorf bases its claim on 
the fair, which brings fashion people together, and for its large number of 
glossy advertising agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Kronen, aware of the mundane reputation German clothing used to have, said: 
"Let's face it, the Paris label still means fashion. Milan has come up in the 
last 20 years. I realize that not many women are dreaming about a German dress. 
But they have it, they like it, they wear it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes stores even take out the German label. But we do the business, and 
we leave the glory to others." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, German houses were known for their reliability, he said, adding: 
"But it's pretty hard to take a good fashion-press photo of a punctual 
delivery. Today German fashion is acquiring an identity and gaining worldwide 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Among Germany's top houses are Jil Sander, Hugo Boss (which placed its clothes 
on U.S. TV shows such as "Miami Vice" and "L.A. Law"), Wolfgang Joop, Wolfgang 
and Margaretha Ley's Escada, Bogner, Klaus Steilmann and Herwig Zahm's Mondi, a 
favorite with the trendy Princess of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of up-and-coming young German designers: Reimer Claussen, 
Brigitte Heiner, Daniela Bechtolf, Yuca, Barbara Bernstorff, Sandra Pabst, 
Caren Pfleger, Beatrice Hymphendahl, Uta Raasch. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Steilmann has coaxed expatriate Karl Lagerfeld, one of fashion's 
supernovas, to design a line for his firm, which is based, improbably, in 
Bochum in the industrial Ruhr Valley. Steilmann, the largest clothing 
manufacturer in Europe, is one of the continent's real success stories. His 
sales last year were about $800 million, and $66 million of it went to the big 
British chain Marks &amp; Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
"We increased our business last year above what we expected," he said in a 
recent interview. "I think the secret of our success is quality and on-time 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the war, Berlin was a major capital of European fashion. After the war, 
clothing production was gradually rebuilt, and it spread to other parts of West 
Germany. For years the clothing need in Germany was simply to cover the body. 
Now we can concentrate on fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Steilmann, who is 60 and wears sober business suits, makes 
sure that his company has the flexibility to adapt rapidly to changing tastes 
in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to react quickly," he said. "A couple of years ago, green was all the 
rage, and we managed in a short time to produce 750,000 garments in green." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Touch 
</P>
<P>
In order to have a feel for the changing tastes of his customers, Steilmann 
surveys retail outlets personally and often. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to keep abreast of what is moving in stores so that you can react 
fast to supply the demand," he said. "Are jacket lengths coming up or going 
down? What colors are becoming popular? You need this information." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure a quick response, he employs 8,000 workers in his West German plants, 
which account for 55% of his total production. This way he doesn't need to wait 
for garments from the Far East, where 20% of his production is based to reduce 
overall costs. 
</P>
<P>
Steilmann, with his KS label, concentrates on the middle range of the market. 
Jil Sander, West Germany's most famous woman designer, aims at the top of the 
market with her simple, soft "avant-garde classics," as she calls them. 
</P>
<P>
In her cool white office in a Hamburg townhouse, dressed in a casual gray 
pantsuit and simple white shirt, Sander projects the restlessness and energy 
that catapulted her to the top in Germany's male-dominated business world. 
</P>
<P>
After studying at the Krefeld School of Textiles, where she took a diploma in 
textile engineering, she completed her studies at UCLA, then worked as a 
fashion journalist in New York and Hamburg. She switched to free-lance 
designing and presented her first collection in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started," she said, "German fashion buyers all went to Paris, then to 
Italy. It took some doing to make my own country believe there could be high 
fashion in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
As for her design ideas, she said: "I don't like overdressing. I don't like to 
see women looking like clowns. But I like to see their personality come through 
in what they wear. 
</P>
<P>
"So I emphasize good design, good material and patterns, and a feel for the 
body. If you don't feel comfortable in something, what's the point in wearing 
it? I like the fact that people say when you wear Jil Sander you feel the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to pay a thousand dollars for a suit, you want to get 
something back, not keep it 24 hours and then throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
Like most other top houses, Sander has branched out into cosmetics and 
perfumes, and she has set a precedent by using her own striking face in her 
advertising. Her business has doubled in four years, and she worries about 
overexpansion, which can mean suddenly mushrooming costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I've got to spend time on administration and management," she said. "When 
we were smaller, it was easier." 
</P>
<P>
Sander, Steilmann and other fashion leaders here look increasingly toward the 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be very important," Sander said. "I feel that if you can please 
fast-moving working women in Germany, you can please Americans too. But we have 
to be careful and not throw ourselves all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Steilmann put it this way: "I think America is wide open for German fashions. 
Americans appreciate quality and style at the right price."

DRAMA CRITICS CIRCLE FAVORS SOUTH COAST REP

<P>
"The Crucible" at South Coast Repertory, "Fences" at the Doolittle Theatre and 
"El Salvador" at the Gnu Theatre were awarded top honors by the Los Angeles 
Drama Critics Circle on Sunday. Each show garnered four awards, including one 
each for distinguished production, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory led all Los Angeles and Orange County theaters with five 
awards. The Los Angeles Theatre Center and the Pasadena Playhouse tied with 
three awards each. International City Theatre's "Distant Fires" and "South 
Central Rain," presented by the Pacific Theatre Ensemble at the Tamarind 
Theatre, each received two. There were no other multiple winners. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 awards given, 20 went to major theaters and 10 to smaller theaters of 
99 seats or fewer. 
</P>
<P>

HIS SUCCESS KEY: WRITE NOVEL BEFORE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James B. Patterson is president of J. Walter Thompson USA, an advertising giant 
with $1.6 billion a year in billings. He calls himself "a late bloomer." But 
he's an early riser. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: At 5:30 a.m. most weekdays, he starts the day by working on a 
mystery novel. He types until 7 a.m., then departs his Manhattan penthouse for 
the hurly-burly of big-league advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The novel business has been good for him -- he's had five published. The 
latest, "The Midnight Club," was optioned in December by film producer David 
Brown, whose dossier includes "Jaws" and "Cocoon." 
</P>
<P>
The book is about a tough, streetwise New York detective who works from a 
wheelchair. He was put there after being shot and crippled -- and his wife 
killed -- in retaliation for his efforts to nail a sleek, well-tailored, 
international criminal nicknamed the "Grave Dancer." 
</P>
<P>
The novel contains a good measure of hard-boiled suspense, the international 
drug trade, rogue cops, rotten officials, a dab of kinky sex and a love 
interest that evolves as the tale is told. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson joined J. Walter Thompson in 1971 as a junior copywriter. He 
graduated to published novelist five years later. 
</P>
<P>
A trim, bearded man who calls his reveille scrivening a form of recreation, he 
now is branching out to film, working on a screenplay as well as a sixth novel. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," he says of screen-scripting. "I feel that it's a better genre for 
me. I think I have a lot of stories. I think I know what I'm doing in the film 
area, because I've made so damn many films. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He refers to the 30-second kind for such entities as Burger King, Kodak, Slice 
and the Red Cross. That is a world from which more than a few now-hot directors 
in Hollywood have come. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson got the suspense world's equivalent of the Oscar his first time out 
with "The Thomas Berryman Number" -- an Edgar Award in 1976 from the Mystery 
Writers of America for the best first mystery novel. About the assassination of 
an important black leader in the South, it's the only book he ever wrote at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there's a lesson here," he wryly observes. His first success stemmed 
from three things: a love of reading and writing that he discovered in college, 
a need for a spare-time outlet and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
At the time he began "Berryman," Patterson -- a graduate of Manhattan College 
who also has a master's degree in English from Vanderbilt -- was working his 
way up through the creative ranks at JWT. 
</P>
<P>
His days were busy. Nighttime was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no one to love, so I'd go home and write in the kitchen, sitting on an 
iron chair, writing on a table too high to really reach," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The next novel, "The Jericho Commandment," was put together under happier 
circumstances, and in the process set the pattern for what now are his pre-dawn 
tussles with the muse. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lady in his life by then. The nights were for her. "So I started 
writing in the morning. I'd found that if you want to have somebody in your 
life, better have some time for them." 
</P>
<P>
It helps, he observes, that "generally, people do not want to get up at 5:30 
a.m." 
</P>
<P>
That the hero of his "The Midnight Club" is in a wheelchair is due to the 
experiences of a woman with whom Patterson once lived. 
</P>
<P>
"About 6 1/2, 7 years into our relationship, she developed a brain tumor," he 
says, softly and quickly. "It put her in a wheelchair for 2 1/2 years, and then 
she died." 
</P>
<P>
While alive, she remained vital, full of life despite her disability, he 
recalls, with a spirit that refused to quit. It was that spirit he put in the 
book, he says -- that and his close-up awareness of the difficulties of life in 
a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is just not geared for handicapped people," he says, noting, for 
example, how on bitter cold nights "the cabs won't stop because it's going to 
take an extra two minutes to deal with the wheelchair and a handicapped 
person."

KANSAS LOSES 25% OF WHEAT TO DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HAYS, Kan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring is bringing bad news to farmers in the heart of America's breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, the nation's major producer of bread-making hard red winter wheat, 
at least 25% of the 1989 crop -- enough wheat to meet American demand for one 
month -- already appears to be lost to a continuation of last summer's 
devastating drought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plants' Growth Retarded 
</P>
<P>
Half of the state of Kansas is dry. Tumbleweeds, the color of desert sand and 
the size of large dogs, blow across fields of green and yellowing wheat plants 
retarded in their growth by a lack of moisture. Winds whip up billows of dust 
that roll toward the horizon like dark clouds hugging the ground. Some river 
and creek beds have been dry for so long that weeds are sprouting under the 
spring sun. 
</P>
<P>
This is a time in the growing season when wheat fields should be a lush green 
and thick like a suburban lawn. Instead most fields are filled with narrow rows 
of immature plants separated by wider rows of topsoil. Some fields are barren 
and in others, lonely clumps of green stick up from the dry, gray earth. 
</P>
<P>
"This crop is two to three weeks behind where it should be right now," farmer 
Gary Antenen, 57, said, standing in one of his fields south of Ness City, Kan. 
And when Antenen pulled an apparently healthy wheat plant from the ground he 
was surprised to find underdeveloped roots. "They should be at least this 
long," he said holding one hand several inches from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat fields in Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado and West Texas are also 
suffering from below normal rain. Harvests could be off by 15% or more. In the 
Northwest, a large portion of the winter wheat crop is also in poor condition, 
damaged by a severe, wet winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bread Prices May Rise 
</P>
<P>
Consumers could feel the effects of a persistent drought later this year. If 
the dry weather continues, bread prices could jump as much as 10%, said Tom 
Roberts, executive vice president of the Kansas-based Wheat Quality Council. 
</P>
<P>
The potential losses are coming at a time when world wheat reserves are at 
worrisome low levels. "Wheat stocks are as tight as they've ever been," said 
Edward Allen, an Agriculture Department grain analyst. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. wheat stockpiles are expected to drop to about 534 million bushels by June 
1, less than a third of what they were two years ago. A short harvest could 
force the government to either curtail exports or to continue to dip into the 
nation's shrinking grain reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Of the surviving Kansas winter wheat crop, 70% was in poor to very poor 
condition last week, the Agriculture Department reported, while subsoil 
moisture necessary to sustain crops was inadequate in 77% of the state's 
fields. The state typically supplies 35% of the nation's winter wheat, more 
than 17% of the country's entire wheat supply and 11% of the world's crop. 
</P>
<P>
Concern is also mounting over the impact continuing drought will have on the 
winter wheat that will be planted next September for harvesting in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in real trouble," said Antenen, who farms more than 7,000 acres with his 
father and brother. "If we don't get any more rainfall, we've pretty well had 
the course." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst crop I've seen come on," said Joe Martin, a wheat researcher 
with 25 years' experience in central Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washington Crop Poor 
</P>
<P>
In the state of Washington -- the nation's top producer of white winter wheat 
used in noodles and popular in Asian markets -- 60% of the crop was in poor to 
very poor condition last week, the Agriculture Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The drought is also triggering record soil erosion across the high plains. In 
Kansas alone, topsoil has blown off of 4.77 million acres of land this year and 
crops on 600,000 acres have been destroyed by erosion -- one of the state's 
worst single season losses since the Dust Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the driest spell we remember," said Darrel E. Wark, 51, a Colby, Kan., 
farmer. "The fields are so fragile, so dry, that any breeze just sets off the 
dust." 
</P>
<P>
The worst dust storm in more than a decade darkened Kansas two weeks ago, 
sending a cloud of dust that reached Illinois and Indiana. Two people died in 
auto accidents and dozens more were hurt when visibility dropped to zero in 
much of the western half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the field and couldn't see more than a few feet," said Wark who, 
like many other farmers, is preparing to abandon some of the fields he planted 
last autumn because wheat either did not germinate or died because of drought 
and a winter of dramatic temperature variations. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we receive additional moisture through April and May, we're going to 
see more dust blowing," said Tim Christian, a spokesman for the federal 
government's Soil Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kansas State University agricultural experiment station here at Hays, 
there has been less than an inch of rainfall since the beginning of the year, 
two inches below normal. Only 14.3 inches fell all of last year, most of that 
before May 1, slightly more than half the rain the station recorded in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepares Aid Bill 
</P>
<P>
Last week Congress, pushed by House members from winter wheat producing states, 
began preparing disaster relief legislation for wheat farmers. A House 
Agriculture subcommittee drew up an aid package despite warnings from 
Agriculture Department officials -- who have a history of minimizing farm 
problems -- that it was too early to declare this year's crop a catastrophe. 
Winter wheat farmers were not included in last year's $3.9-billion drought 
relief legislation because the crop, already well along in 1988, was not 
seriously affected when the hot, dry weather settled on the nation's 
midsection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little premature to begin writing (this year's) crop down to a specific 
level," cautioned Norton Strommen, the department's chief meteorologist. "We're 
looking at a very different weather pattern this year than we were looking at 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
"If we get rain in the next two weeks it will help in southern Kansas," said 
Mike Smith, of WeatherData, consultants to The Times. "But in some areas around 
Great Bend, Hays, Ellsworth and Russell I don't think any rain will help 
significantly. Much of the wheat there is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Significant rain is not expected across Kansas and other portions of the Wheat 
Belt until later this week. Weather experts are predicting below-normal 
rainfall in the immediate future with near-normal rains later in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Normal rains later in the spring would provide some help to this year's winter 
wheat crops and would help to mitigate the concern about moisture conditions 
for the 1990 crop. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the best of times, rainfall is sparse across much of the winter Wheat 
Belt. Farmers leave half of their land fallow each year to store up moisture 
for the next crop. Normally fields that are fallow now would be absorbing 
spring rains and storing that moisture in the subsoil to nurture the crop to be 
planted next September. 
</P>
<P>
"We've probably stored up no subsoil moisture for next year's crop," said 
Martin, a wheat breeder at Kansas State University's Ft. Hays experiment 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Drought conditions are also still evident in portions of the Corn Belt from 
northwestern Illinois into Iowa and down to northern Missouri where farmers are 
beginning to prepare their fields to plant next fall's corn and soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rain Will Be Too Late 
</P>
<P>
Spring rains, if they come, will help Midwest farmers but for much of the Wheat 
Belt, the rain will be too late. 
</P>
<P>
Planted in September, winter wheat normally benefits from a blanket of snow 
that protects the young plants from arctic winds and sharp temperature 
variations. But last winter there was virtually no snow. The young, unprotected 
plants -- many with underdeveloped roots because of drought -- were shocked by 
a sudden change from record warmth in January when temperatures on the high 
plains reached the 70s and 80s to record cold during the first days of February 
when temperatures plunged well below zero. Plants died of winterkill. 
</P>
<P>
Melting snow and spring rains also provide moisture to help the plants rebound 
from winter and begin their rapid growth toward harvest time late in June or 
early in July. This year there was no melting snow and only marginal spring 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Plains Drought 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat harvests are threatened, and prices for bread could jump 10%

WRIGHT'S TIES TO DEVELOPER KEY FOCUS OF HOUSE PROBE

<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning with their first chat over coffee in 1963, the friendship of House 
Speaker Jim Wright and developer George A. Mallick Jr. has been predicated upon 
their mutual drive to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a young congressman; I was a young businessman," Mallick told The Times 
last week, recalling how he and Wright liked each other from the moment they 
met. "He was ambitious in politics and public service; I was ambitious in 
business. We both had dreams. We talked about our dreams -- you know, how young 
lions talk." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century later, both men have achieved their dreams. Wright, 66, holds 
the nation's third-highest office. Mallick, 54, a wealthy entrepreneur, has 
both made and lost millions of dollars in the boom and bust economy of the 
Texas real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
But the complex financial and social relationship that has grown up between 
these two men over the years is now a central issue of a House ethics 
investigation that threatens to tarnish much of their success and perhaps even 
deprive Wright of his speakership. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated by the House Ethics Committee conducting the investigation that 
Wright and his wife have received at least $100,000 in direct personal benefits 
from Mallick -- including the use of a Cadillac and a condominium. That is in 
addition to substantial profits that the Speaker has reaped over the years from 
their joint investments. 
</P>
<P>
A key question that congressional investigators are now trying to answer is 
whether Wright, in his gratitude for Mallick's largesse, ever used his power in 
the House to win legislation or government action that would benefit his 
friend. House rules strictly prohibit members from accepting gifts in excess of 
$100 from persons with an interest in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deny Using Influence 
</P>
<P>
Both men staunchly deny that Wright tried to use his influence to benefit 
Mallick on two occasions at issue -- once when the federal government was about 
to foreclose on a $2-million loan backed by the developer and another time when 
he was trying to raise funding for the restoration of the old Ft. Worth 
stockyards. Mallick noted that the loan ultimately went into default and that 
he never found funding for the stockyards project. 
</P>
<P>
"If I benefited, I want to know where?" Mallick said in a lengthy telephone 
interview from his office in Ft. Worth. "I don't see where I have monetarily 
profited by this relationship. I don't see where I socially have profited. I 
have never gotten a government contract. I have not had a HUD grant for more 
than 20 years. I've never asked him, his staff or any member of Congress for 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
After nine months of inquiries, the Ethics Committee is expected to issue its 
findings on Wright's financial affairs soon, perhaps as early as this week. 
Many in Congress have concluded that, if the report is very critical, Wright's 
leadership in the House could be weakened, perhaps so much that he would lose 
his top-ranking post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met at Dedication Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
As both Wright and Mallick remember it, they first met 26 years ago when the 
congressman attended a dedication ceremony of a shopping center developed by 
Mallick in suburban Ft. Worth. Afterward, they went for coffee, hit it off and 
talked for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Wright seemed drawn to Mallick because of the developer's 
notable success at making money. At the time, the young congressman was 
weighted down by an enormous personal debt that he had incurred in an 
unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick, the son of a wealthy wholesaler and grandson of a Lebanese immigrant 
who made a fortune after starting out as a peddler, already was well 
established as a real estate developer when he met Wright. By 1967, he would be 
hailed as Ft. Worth's "outstanding young man" of the year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mallick, Wright asked him during their first chat if he could 
invest some money in one of the many land deals that Mallick was putting 
together. "I sure would like to make an investment in real estate," he recalls 
Wright telling him. 
</P>
<P>
Their conversation led to Wright's first business deal with Mallick in 1965 -- 
a $5,000 investment with nine others to purchase a piece of property near Ft. 
Worth. Even after Wright sold his share a few years later, he continued to ask 
Mallick frequently about it -- "how's our investment doing?" he would say. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress who know Mallick characterize him as typical of many 
wealthy hangers-on that they encounter in their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen Drawn to Politics 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the innumerable people you see out there who just like to be a 
part of politics," said Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.), who -- like Wright -- has 
received many campaign contributions from Mallick. "There are thousands of 
these people around the country." 
</P>
<P>
While Mallick clearly likes being identified as the Speaker's friend, Frost and 
others insist that the Texas developer has never sought to trade openly on his 
relationship with Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"George is a 100% teetotaler, all-American, a good man and a good citizen," 
said Carlos Moore, another one of Wright's business cronies. "He's not a liar 
or a conner. I've never known him to drop Jim Wright's name in his life. 
Everybody knows he and Wright are friends, but you lower yourself when you 
flaunt it. If people want to draw their own conclusions, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Mallick acknowledges that his friendship with Wright is an unlikely one. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit of an odd couple," he said. "If you look at it, you wouldn't think 
we would fit. He's Protestant, Irish and red-headed; I'm Lebanese, Catholic and 
black-headed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Intensely Private 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite their many differences, Wright and Mallick both have reputations as 
loners and intensely private men. Like Wright, who has few close friends among 
his colleagues in the House, Mallick is known in Ft. Worth as a man who would 
rather spend time with his wife and five children -- ages 22 to 30 -- than 
socialize with the city's other wealthy folks. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick said that he was drawn to Wright initially out of admiration for the 
congressman's controversial stand in favor of civil rights. In 1958, when 
Mallick was building homes for middle-class blacks, he attended a public 
meeting at which he said Wright defended his civil rights stand after a woman 
in the audience demanded: "What are you going to do about these niggers?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mallick himself has experienced considerable discrimination during his 
life. His dark complexion has often been misunderstood in a town where there 
are few other people of Lebanese heritage. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, he recalls, he was ostracized by his teacher and other children after 
his family moved into the wealthiest neighborhood in town. "The teacher 
actually segregated me in the classroom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mallick believes that he is still the target of discrimination. He 
said he was particularly upset recently when he heard that an investigator had 
referred to him in private as "a short, overweight, olive-skinned man of 
Lebanese descent." 
</P>
<P>
In time, the Wright and Mallick families grew close, creating an even firmer 
bond between the two men. Mallick's wife, Marlene, talks by telephone almost 
daily with Wright's second wife, Betty. In addition, Betty and Mallick's 
daughter, Angela, like to go shopping together, and the Wrights frequently 
socialize with Mallick's sons, who are neighbors at the Ft. Worth condominium 
where they stay when the Speaker returns to his home district. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mallick, he and his wife frequently dine with the Wrights when 
they are in Ft. Worth -- either going to a restaurant or gathering at Mallick's 
sprawling ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
It was out of this friendship that the idea first arose to put Wright's wife on 
the Mallick payroll. After resigning from the House Public Works Committee 
staff when Wright became majority leader, she received salaries of $18,000 
annually from Mallick in 1979 and 1980 before switching to a position at 
Mallightco -- a closely held company that blends the names of the two families 
-- for the years 1981 through 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mallightco, which recently was dissolved, was formed in 1979 when the Wrights 
put up $58,000 in stocks and the Mallicks kicked in an equal amount of assets 
-- creating a pool of money from which they made investments in everything from 
stocks to gems. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick portrays Mallightco as nothing more than "an investment club" among 
friends. "On its best day, it wasn't worth a half-million dollars," he said. 
"There was nothing to hide or we wouldn't have put our own names on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acted as Adviser 
</P>
<P>
Both Wright and Mallick insist that Betty earned her salary from Mallightco. 
Wright refers to his wife as "a career woman," and Mallick added: "This was a 
serious job. She watched the stocks. She went to numerous meetings with me. She 
gave me some very good advice." 
</P>
<P>
Although he denies that he created Betty's job simply to funnel money to the 
Wright family, Mallick acknowledges that consideration was given at the time to 
how Wright's wife could best earn outside income without creating a conflict of 
interest for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"When she went to work for me, we thought it was perfect -- a local firm with 
no interest in legislation," he said. "This was so far removed from Jim 
Wright's job, it seemed very proper." 
</P>
<P>
Mallick said that Mallightco hired Betty primarily to avoid a 70% tax surcharge 
imposed on the earnings of personal holding companies that have no apparent 
business activity. "We needed an employee; Betty was that employee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her salary, Betty received the use of a brown 1979 Cadillac, 
which the family still drives, and the use of a condominium owned by Mallick's 
son, Steven. Before buying the condo in 1988, the Wrights paid $21.67 a day to 
use it whenever they were in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls It Strictly Business 
</P>
<P>
Mallick justified Wright's use of the condo by noting that he has always 
provided rent-free apartments for his employees. "That's the way I do 
business," he said. "It was Betty Wright's use of the apartment through the 
employ of the Mallick company. Jim Wright was merely her spouse." 
</P>
<P>
While insisting that their arrangement violated no rules, Mallick conceded that 
he made a mistake in not dissolving Mallightco in 1987 when Wright ascended to 
the position of House Speaker. He said he did not realize that Wright's 
finances would be scrutinized so closely as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his insistence that he has no interest in legislation, Mallick did 
provide Wright with a 25-page report on Texas' troubled savings and loan 
institutions in 1987 as the thrift industry was unraveling in that state. 
Wright asked him for the report after a meeting attended by about 125 Ft. Worth 
business people who were complaining about foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the concerns, Wright pressed House Democrats in early 1987 to 
amend legislation recapitalizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
to require federal regulators to show "forebearance" in dealing with the 
troubled thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick's role as adviser to Wright came into question as the result of a 
current lawsuit against Mallick, his wife and son, Michael, stemming from a 
$2.2-million loan that they received from the now-defunct Interwest Savings 
Assn. in 1985 to develop a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fire Sale Prices' 
</P>
<P>
When they made no payments on the loan, the property was liquidated for $1.2 
million by the FSLIC and the agency is seeking the additional $1 million from 
the Mallicks. The Mallicks have countersued on grounds that the property was 
sold at what Mallick describes as "fire sale prices" and that more should have 
been gotten for it. 
</P>
<P>
Committee investigators are reportedly investigating whether Mallick stood to 
gain directly from the forebearance clause that Wright sought in the savings 
and loan legislation. But Mallick noted that the savings and loan did foreclose 
on his loan. Moreover, he said, the shopping center loan was not facing 
foreclosure until more than six months after he completed his report. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Mallick insisted that his efforts on behalf of the stockyards 
development occurred long after Wright had already secured $11.8 million in 
federal grants for the project in the years between 1974 and 1986. He said that 
he would have earned an interest in the stockyards project if he succeeded in 
raising enough money to refinance the debt of the private developers but that 
he failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is nothing new for a man who by his own admission has made and lost at 
least two fortunes in his career. In fact, Mallick suffered a much worse 
setback in the economic downturn of the early 1970s, when he found himself 
overextended on loans and was forced to sell much of his property, including 
Mallick Tower, his 10-story showcase building in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sued by Bank 
</P>
<P>
Mallick subsequently was sued by a New Mexico bank for failing to repay a 
$1-million loan and, although he proved that the bank had failed to credit 
payments to his account, the lawsuit prompted an investigation by federal bank 
examiners and the FBI. The investigators found nothing, and Mallick's finances 
rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Mallick and his wife also have been cited or sued 
repeatedly by state, local and federal officials for not paying taxes. In the 
last six months alone, Mallick was sued by Ft. Worth for $8,640 in delinquent 
taxes, was hit with a federal tax lien for $2,250 and subjected to a state tax 
lien for $2,722.

TRADE EMBARGO WREAKS HAVOC; 
</P>
<P>
NEPAL IS PAYING THE PRICE FOR STANDING UP TO INDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
KATMANDU, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vijaya Hara understands none of the complexities of the Indian trade embargo 
that has plunged this remote Himalayan kingdom into crisis in the past two 
weeks. But, with each day it continues, Hara comes that much closer to death. 
</P>
<P>
A 58-year-old diabetic, Hara again made the rounds of every pharmacy in 
Katmandu on Sunday, desperately searching for Dianil, the drug that keeps him 
alive -- one of several critical commodities that have been stuck at the 
Indian-Nepal border since the embargo began March 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I am suffering now," Hara said feebly at his final unsuccessful stop of the 
day, Ashok Medicine Pharmacy. "If it doesn't come soon . . . well, it's just 
like that. One cannot say the word." 
</P>
<P>
As the Indian embargo, which has led to a virtual blockade of all principal 
trade routes into landlocked Nepal, entered its third week Sunday, Hara clearly 
was not alone in his suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of motorists and impoverished peasants lined up for as long as 12 
hours throughout the capital city, waiting for weekly rations of 1 1/2 gallons 
of gasoline and three quarts of kerosene, vital staples for transport and 
cooking that have been the principal commodities blocked at the Indian-Nepal 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Women and children clinging to battered kerosene cans said they hadn't eaten a 
cooked meal in a week, and local officials at ration stations said the 
three-quart kerosene ration handed out Sunday will last each family only a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's transport is paralyzed, and university campuses remain 
closed after rioting by radical student groups last week left many injured. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the nation's pharmaceuticals industry appealed urgently for 
chemicals to make such vital medicines as Dianil. Other industries, dependent 
on diesel fuel, remained at a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
So desperate is Nepal that nearby Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest 
nations, announced Sunday that it will "lend our neighbor a helping hand" by 
sending 1,000 tons of petroleum to Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, this is so tragic that Bangladesh, despite all of their own 
hardships, is extending a helping hand to us," a senior Nepalese Foreign 
Ministry official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"My hunch is the Indians calculated we would collapse within just a few days," 
the official said. "But we will not. They have done their worst. Now we must do 
our best and fight to survive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classic Confrontation 
</P>
<P>
The intricacies of the current crisis between Nepal and India are complex, 
rooted in a controversy over two recently expired trade and transit treaties. 
But most independent analysts and Western diplomats view it as a classic 
confrontation between an emerging regional superpower and a strategic yet 
landlocked nation that not only lies on India's border but also has survived 
economically through the years, largely through Indian generosity. 
</P>
<P>
And the bitterness that led to the present crisis dates back nearly two years, 
the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal, a Hindu nation that has enjoyed favored treatment from its far larger 
and more powerful Hindu-majority neighbor, has grown increasingly concerned 
about its own security and sovereignty in recent years, after Indian Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi ordered his troops into two other small South Asian 
neighbors, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. 
</P>
<P>
In what many diplomatic observers view as a symbolic gesture, Nepal decided 
last year to purchase military equipment from China, its neighbor to the north 
and a historic foe of India. 
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese government also announced that it was imposing restrictions on 
Indian residents and business people here, who in the past have enjoyed the 
same freedom that tens of thousands of Nepali migrants have enjoyed in India. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a feeling among the Nepalese that they had to take steps that would 
demonstrate their independence," a Western diplomat in Katmandu said. "And for 
India, which had treated Nepal almost as an extension of India in favorable 
trade terms, there was a feeling of betrayal. The trade and transit treaties 
are really just a battleground for these deeper issues, and the Indian position 
now is to simply sit back and wait for Nepal to define the future 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the waiting, deliberate pressure is mounting on Nepal, which already is 
ranked as the world's sixth-poorest nation, with an average annual per-capita 
income of just $160. 
</P>
<P>
When the two treaties expired March 23, the Indians closed 15 of the 17 land 
entry routes to Nepal, which relies on India for all of its petroleum and 35% 
of its other imports. And India is the lifeline for imports from third 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"When the border closed down, Nepal was caught napping," the Western diplomat 
said. The exact size of the nation's fuel stocks is a tightly held secret, he 
said, "but most estimates are that, with extreme rationing, they have about 30 
to 35 days left." 
</P>
<P>
The critical tests in the coming days will be whether India, which has publicly 
pledged to allow the shipment of all essential commodities from third 
countries, interferes with the Bangladeshi oil shipment or reneges on its 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
And for the Nepali government, the test will be how long its people can hold 
out before street violence erupts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, tiny Nepal, with 17 million largely impoverished people and a principal 
national industry of tourism, is stubbornly refusing to back down to Indian 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The government has taken steps to ensure that tourism and the hundreds of 
thousands of foreigners it attracts to see Mt. Everest and other sights each 
year are protected, supplying stockpiled fuel to keep all five-star hotels open 
and all international and domestic airlines running on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed by Nepal's Parliament on Saturday, the nation 
unanimously endorsed the steadfast stand of Nepal's ruling monarch, King 
Birendra, and appealed to the nation to face the current crisis "with patience 
and courage." 
</P>
<P>
There appeared to be considerable support for the policy in the 
several-blocks-long line for kerosene at Katmandu's lower-class Bagh Market on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have waited for 21 days already. We can wait more," said Nazirman Tandukar, 
the ward chairman in the neighborhood who was supervising kerosene 
distribution. "We are very unhappy. We are suffering a lot. But the people 
cannot do anything. The government and the king will solve this, and we will 
wait." 
</P>
<P>
Karna Bahadur, a 46-year-old ice cream vendor, had been waiting in the line 
since 4 a.m. He hadn't eaten a warm meal in a week, he said, "so it was better 
not to work today. It's more important to get the kerosene so I can eat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Criticism of India 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, few Nepalese in the long lines Sunday spoke harshly of India, 
which has shown no indication of resuming talks and resolving the treaty 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very sad about India and what it is doing to us," ward leader Tandukar 
said. "Before, they let us get everything we needed. Now, nothing is coming 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is the tradition of India and Nepal to be close friends. And we are 
still brothers." 
</P>
<P>
In official Nepalese quarters, however, the reaction was far sterner, an 
indication, analysts said, of the neo-nationalism that led to the current 
conflict with India. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nepalese will never feel the same toward India after this is over," said 
the senior Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
Charging India with "hypocrisy, white lies (and) snobbery," the official added 
that the Nepalese government believes India is simply staging the blockade to 
assert itself as a regional superpower and, in his words, remind Nepal that 
"they can destroy us if they wish." 
</P>
<P>
"You look at Sri Lanka, the Maldives and now this, and to us, this gives us 
more reason to be alarmed about our security," he added, referring to Indian 
claims that it started the embargo to protect its own security interests in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Nepal's arms purchase from China, which included about 100 troop 
trucks and anti-aircraft guns, was meant simply as a message to New Delhi of 
Nepalese sovereignty, the official said: "This was not deliberate on our part. 
</P>
<P>
"But the next time, it may well be deliberate. They're teaching us now. They're 
putting wrong ideas in our head." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ISOLATED 
</P>
<P>
Embargo by India, which has led to virtual blockade of principal trade routes 
into landlocked Nepal, is now in its third week. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Katmandu's transport is paralyzed, radical students have rioted and 
vital medicines are in short supply.

CHICANO STUDIES FIND FAVOR ON CAMPUS; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY CLASSES FILL UP, NEW RESEARCH CENTERS SOUGHT AS LATINO POPULATION 
BOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a decade of struggling to survive, Chicano studies programs at 
universities throughout the Southwest are becoming the focus of renewed 
interest, coinciding with growing public attention to the Latino population 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in Chicano studies programs has doubled on some campuses, and 
classes are drawing large numbers of Anglo students for the first time. Some 
University of California campuses are considering requiring that all 
undergraduates take an ethnic studies class. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature, calling the number of minority faculty at public universities 
"dismal," is pushing for increased hiring. And Chicano professors, emboldened 
by the encouraging signs of change, are pushing for new Chicano research 
centers on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
They also are calling for a recommitment to their 1960s ideals of challenging 
the educational institutions on behalf of their growing and troubled community. 
</P>
<P>
"The burning bush has been smoldering," said historian Rodolfo Acuna, a dean 
among Chicano scholars and founder of the Chicano studies department at Cal 
State Northridge, the nation's largest. "It's starting to heat up again." 
</P>
<P>
As radical Chicano graduate students during the 1960s, they barged their way 
into the white ivory towers of American academia and then insisted on staying 
-- on their own terms. But not long after their tumultuous beginning, Chicano 
studies programs began to falter. Dwindling enrollment, budget cuts and denial 
of tenure were common. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano scholars managed, nevertheless, to produce an impressive body of 
knowledge. But because they insist on analyzing the world through Chicano eyes, 
their work has often been dismissed as subjective and second-class, they say. 
Only in recent years have mainstream university presses begun to publish their 
works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Activist and Scholar' 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the scholars are particularly proud of those who, like Acuna, 
have maintained the 1960s' tradition of Chicano "activist and scholar." He has 
worked closely in various campaigns with labor union organizers and community 
activists in the San Fernando Valley. And his books -- including "Occupied 
America," the first general Chicano history written by a Chicano -- have become 
standard texts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research should address itself to the pressing problems of our community," 
said Tatcho Mindiola Jr., director of the Mexican-American Studies Program at 
the University of Houston and coordinator of the 17th Annual National Assn. of 
Chicano Studies Conference held in Los Angeles recently. He reminded his 
colleagues that the organization was founded to "challenge the status quo" and 
improve conditions in their community. 
</P>
<P>
Spawned through the protest marches, walkouts and sit-ins of the 1960s, the 
movement's activist tradition has admittedly set some of the scholars apart 
from the mainstream of academic life. 
</P>
<P>
"Our discipline was developed in opposition to the dominant paradigms of social 
science, which sustained the status quo, and essentially blamed our people and 
our culture for problems in education, employment and our inability to 
assimilate," said William V. Flores, a Chicano-Latino studies program professor 
at Cal State Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Chicano model of advocacy scholarship poses a challenge to the 
Euro-centered tradition of academic "objectivity," he said, Chicano research 
has been "maligned as biased, narrow and self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
In their defense, Chicano scholars point out that the so-called objectivity of 
previous Anglo scholars often misrepresented, denigrated or ignored Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We literally barged our way into mainstream academia," Mindiola said. "We've 
institutionalized our courses and wrested control over what is said about us. 
It used to be all in the hands of Anglo scholars; now the majority of research 
on Chicanos is done by Chicanos." 
</P>
<P>
But Chicano scholarship has yet to win general acceptance from the academic 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Methodologically, our stuff is completely sound," said David E. 
Hayes-Bautista, a UCLA School of Medicine professor who heads the university's 
Chicano Studies Research Center. The difference, he said, is that Chicano 
researchers look at the world based on a "Latino intellectual tradition . . . 
that leads us to see and analyze things differently." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in a study the center is conducting on AIDS among Latinos, 
researchers are dealing with issues of life and death, sex, sin and dying. To 
understand these issues among Latinos, they must be studied from a Latino 
Catholic "intellectual" framework. The Anglo Protestant model would not work, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegitimate and Undervalued 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 national survey of 240 Chicano professors, most said they were 
regarded on their campuses as "second-class" and "illegitimate" and that their 
research was undervalued by their universities, said Hisauro Garza, a visiting 
ethnic studies scholar at Santa Clara University, who conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chicano scholars have broken new academic ground. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time you've had Chicano historians begin to unearth a whole 
field of archival materials and documents previously overlooked. They've often 
gone into new terrain, or corrected erroneous concepts of earlier scholars, in 
documenting the real live story of Chicanos in this country," Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from standard methods, Acuna, for instance, has used Mexican and 
bilingual sources as well as American. This has led to some reinterpretations 
of history. 
</P>
<P>
For example, most U.S. historians hold that the motivation behind the Gadsden 
Purchase of 1853 was to provide a direct railway link between El Paso and San 
Diego. But on the basis of archival material he found in the border state of 
Sonora, Acuna concluded that the United States purchased the land because of 
the mineral deposits officials knew were there. 
</P>
<P>
The broad scope of Chicano scholarship was on display at the recent Los Angeles 
conference. Workshop topics ranged from the history of medicine in pre-colonial 
Mexico to the political conflicts between Chicanos and Chicanas; and from a 
panel on the corrido, or folk ballad, to one entitled "Rosita the Riveter: 
Midwest Mexican American Women During World War II." Other panels covered 
issues ranging from immigration, gangs and U.S.-Mexico relations, to politics, 
women, education and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the work has been primarily in the social sciences, 
increasingly, there are contributions coming out of the humanities. Much of the 
ground-breaking work of recent years has been in the areas of literary 
criticism and theory, said Hayes-Bautista, who cited the work of Rosalinda 
Fregoso at UC Santa Barbara. Also drawing attention is a book about the 
connection between Asian and Mexican poetic forms by Bruce-Novoa and E.A. 
Mares, of New Mexico, entitled, "En Breve: Minimalism in Mexican Poetry, 
1900-1985." Others point to a blossoming of literary works and of research by 
Chicanas about women. Margarita Melville's book, "Twice a Minority," deals with 
the issues confronting Latino women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Research 
</P>
<P>
Another expanding area has been that of public policy research. "The Burden of 
Support," a recent book by Hayes-Bautista dealing with the state's changing 
demographics and their economic implications, is frequently cited as an example 
of work in this field. 
</P>
<P>
Chicanos at UC Berkeley are working to establish a Chicano/Latino policy 
project, similar to the one at UCLA, to research public policy issues, said 
Melville, who heads the Chicano studies program at UC Berkeley. Chicana faculty 
at UC Davis also are trying to establish the first research center on Chicanas 
in the state, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While progress continues in some areas, Chicanos say there is still a long way 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report released last week by a joint legislative committee 
calling for the hiring of more minority professors, only 9.9% of all tenured 
faculty in the University of California system are minorities. Chicanos account 
for about 3.4% of the total, only slightly higher than the 2.6% of 10 years 
ago, Melville said. Latinos make up about 25% of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Permanent Underclass' 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the state's public universities must work harder to 
recruit minority students and that all undergraduates should be required to 
take a course in ethnic studies. California "is threatened with a permanent 
underclass," unless higher education better serves minorities, the report 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
UC campuses at Berkeley, Irvine, Riverside and Santa Barbara are already 
considering instituting the ethnic studies course requirement, said Rick 
Malaspina, a spokesman for the office of UC President David Gardner. Malaspina 
added that Gardner has long advocated developing a faculty more reflective of 
the state's minority and female population. 
</P>
<P>
But Malaspina said that "there has not been a lot of turnover and . . . there's 
competition (from other universities and from private industry) for the limited 
number of available" minority candidates. "We're working at it, but we need to 
do more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that not enough Chicano graduate students are in the 
academic pipeline to fill the growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the first generation of Latinos to teach in colleges in large numbers. I 
don't see another generation as large as we coming behind," said Mindiola, 
adding that the number of Latino graduate students has stagnated, if not 
declined, during the last decade. Melville at Berkeley blames limited financial 
assistance for the small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano scholars are critical of what some call the intransigence of American 
universities in facing the realities of a changing society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Society's Conscience 
</P>
<P>
"Universities should be the social conscience of society, the leaders. But 
they're not," said Adaljiza Sosa Riddell, who has been at the forefront of 
social change most of her life. She has spent most of the last two decades 
building one of the largest Chicano studies programs in the country at UC 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicanos are now at the forefront of a serious struggle for the future. To the 
extent that universities are moving on this issue, it is because they are being 
pushed by Chicanos," she said.

ECOLOGISTS FEAR WEAKENING OF RULES TO SAVE SOME WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Fish and Game Commission is proposing a regulation that 
environmentalists fear could weaken protection for some species of wildlife 
whose numbers are seriously declining in California. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, under pressure from business interests not to declare the 
desert tortoise and the chinook salmon as threatened, is proposing the creation 
of a lesser category of protection that critics worry could take the place of 
putting animals on the state's list of threatened or endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed regulation, the commission would be able to adopt a 
"recovery plan" for species whose status is of "serious concern," thereby 
avoiding the designation of threatened or endangered that would provide 
stronger protection for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Robert A. Bryant, however, said Friday that it is not the 
commission's intention to soften the California Endangered Species Act. He said 
the draft regulation would help safeguard many types of plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal's Intent Told 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal is not backing away from the commission's statutory 
responsibility under the state Endangered Species Act, but is a pro-active 
approach to ensure that there is long-term protection for all species," Bryant 
told a meeting of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Executive secretary Harold C. Cribbs, after several revisions in the proposal 
and days of discussions with opponents, pledged that the new system would not 
be used as a way to avoid listing either the desert tortoise or the winter-run 
Chinook salmon as threatened species. Populations of both species are falling 
sharply in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups such as the 
Defenders of Wildlife are concerned that the adoption of "recovery plans" could 
become a substitute for placing a wide variety of animals and plants on the 
threatened and endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
"As the regulation is currently drafted, it is a weakening of the (endangered 
species) act," said Cindy Williams, an aide to Assemblyman Robert Campbell 
(D-Richmond), who originally authored the state law. "The concept in and of 
itself is worth consideration but there are significant modifications that 
would need to occur to ensure that it was not used as an escape hatch for 
controversial issues." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Endangered Species Act, it is illegal to kill a plant or animal that 
is listed as rare, threatened or endangered. Destroying the habitat of a listed 
species also is prohibited unless the state approves a plan for providing 
adequate protection to the species. In addition, all state agencies are 
required to make protection of endangered species a top priority. State funds 
are available to aid in the recovery of listed plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, each "recovery plan" would vary and would not necessarily provide 
any of the protections of the endangered species law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Threatened Species 
</P>
<P>
In general, environmentalists like the idea of developing recovery plans to 
outline specific steps that would be taken to protect species that have 
suffered a serious decline in numbers. They would like to see the Department of 
Fish and Game develop such plans for the 254 species of plants and animals that 
are already listed as rare, threatened or endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed regulation, the department would be required to develop a 
recovery plan when the commission lists a species as endangered. However, the 
commission also would have the choice of ordering aup such a plan instead of 
placing a species on the list -- an alternative that could ease objections from 
developers or other business interests that have an economic stake in the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant sought to allay the concerns of environmentalists by focusing on the 
fate of several hundred species not yet listed but deemed to be of "serious 
concern" because of the decline in their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Richard Spotts, a lobbyist with Defenders of Wildlife, and Williams, 
the aide to Campbell, said they were wary of the commission's proposal because 
of its origin. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that the commission has moved slowly to designate the desert 
tortoise as threatened after ranchers whose sheep graze in the tortoises' 
habitat argued against the listing. 
</P>
<P>
After environmentalists questioned whether the commission had the legal 
authority to make such a decision, the commission proposed its controversial 
regulation. As first drafted, the rule would have allowed the commission to 
call for a recovery plan "in lieu of" listing a species as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after further protests from the environmental community, the panel's 
staff rewrote the regulation so that it would simply allow the commission to 
call for a recovery plan for a species that has not been listed as threatened 
or endangered. The commission also postponed a decision until its June meeting.

HAYDEN, FONDA: WILL 'MOVEMENT' SURVIVE THE SPLIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was more than a marriage that broke apart when Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda 
separated in February. Together, they were a movement, a cause, a target. They 
were two whom we knew as one. 
</P>
<P>
So today, nearly two months after Hayden loaded up his faded Volvo station 
wagon and drove away from the couple's Santa Monica home to take up residence 
in an apartment near Westwood, their many loyal friends and employees, their 
colorful ragout of enemies and any number of rank-and-file oglers ask: What of 
this movement, what of these two now? 
</P>
<P>
The short run offers short and incomplete answers. Both Hayden and Fonda can be 
found in familiar roles these days. She as an actress and exercise industry 
doyenne, her career possibilities backed up for as far as she can see; he as a 
state assemblyman with one eye on the Legislature's daily calendar and the 
other on the horizon looking for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical. At a time like this, you look for whatever normalcy you can 
in your life," one longtime associate said. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not another garden variety Hollywood parting. Both are churning, 
sometimes at the flash point, with feelings of anger and failure and doubt, 
according to those closest to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the circles in which the two travel, the mood is described as "sad, just 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
Says a friend of Fonda: "This is disturbing to a lot of people. We've all kind 
of grown up with them -- political people, non-political people, even those who 
don't like them. We all look at these things from our own point of view and 
say, my God, if they can't make it after all they've been through, who can?" 
</P>
<P>
For the long run, the separation raises questions that even Hayden and Fonda 
cannot yet answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Time of Introspection 
</P>
<P>
What chance for reconciliation? What is the likelihood that their estrangement 
will grow bitter, forcing friends and political supporters to choose sides? 
What side would they choose? What will happen to their joint campaign to 
politicize today's generation of young Hollywood celebrities? And what of 
Hayden's future in public service? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking hard, sorting out my emotions and I don't feel the need to 
resolve anything right now," says Hayden, sprawled in a coffee shop booth, 
picking at a late-night vegi-burger. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, there are two things I don't want to give up. Time for my personal 
life, and that cannot be pushed. And I'm reluctant to give up on any of my 
legislative work. I feel I'm coming into my prime." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden is pondering whether to run for the newly established office of 
California insurance commissioner. A statewide poll found him the favorite 
among Democrats for the position, which is to be filled in the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the top layer of his Southern California political staff has 
moved on to other opportunities, plunging Hayden into a major staff talent 
search. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Hayden has lost are the chief of his Santa Monica legislative 
office, the director of his personal political action committee, known as the 
Hayden Committee, and the executive director of his adjunct grass-roots 
political organization, Campaign California. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say there is no getting around the conclusion that he is "down" and has 
embarked on a top-to-bottom evaluation of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda has worn a game face in public but is "just plowing through her days," 
according to someone known to have her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be dishonest to say that every day is joyous but it's also dishonest 
to say I'm just plodding along," Fonda said in an interview from her Jane Fonda 
Workout office. "I'm somewhat on a roller coaster. Actually, I feel pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Few matrimonial calamities in recent memory hit home with such force -- 
stirring up the domains of politics and show business, making Page 1 headlines 
in everything from this newspaper to the National Enquirer. At least one news 
columnist found himself mongering gossip; and supermarket tabloids dabbled in 
political analysis. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, people were not -- and still are not -- sure how to handle the 
private relations between these two extremely public figures who cross so many 
different worlds -- politics, show business, physical fitness, jet set and 
protest, to name some. 
</P>
<P>
Two questions remain unanswered: Did Hayden leave or was he asked to leave? And 
why? 
</P>
<P>
The couple have lived up to a pact to keep this to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a million stories circulating. It's not like everyone knows the 
story and they can point fingers," says a friend well connected in both 
Hollywood and politics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hayden's Autobiography 
</P>
<P>
Along with talk about how they just grew apart, there is speculation now that 
in the course of writing his recent autobiography, "Reunion," Hayden was forced 
to confront a growing sense that in recent years his life was devoid of change. 
</P>
<P>
"The book had a lot to do with this (breakup)," says one friend. "How can it 
not affect you when you sit down and analyze the way you are living your life?" 
</P>
<P>
The book chronicles a life full of changes from civil rights activist, anti-war 
protester, courtroom defendant, from pauper to millionaire, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the upheaval, and Hayden is at work writing the epitaph to that 
romance -- a new chapter for the second printing of "Reunion," due out in late 
summer. He says it will cover the separation. 
</P>
<P>
Since separating, Fonda and Hayden have appeared only once at the same public 
function, a pro-choice event at MGM studios in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
But their son, Troy, 15, has proven a link that keeps them in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"If you realize you are good parents, you know you are good friends and you 
know you're not going to lose everything from 16 years, that's important," says 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
A less prying line of inquiry goes to the question of Hollywood and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere were Fonda and Hayden stronger for being together than in their 
approach to the entertainment community. By personal example and with their 
group called "Network," the calloused politician and the Academy Award winner 
succeeded in drawing Hollywood figures, particularly young ones, into the orbit 
of liberal activism.

In 1986, three busloads of predominantly young celebrities campaigned up the 
highway from San Diego to San Francisco on behalf of an anti-toxics ballot 
proposition. It was said to be the largest mass movement of celebrities behind 
a political issue since the savings bond drives of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Every cause needs leadership and a beacon that people can follow," says one 
associate. "I think the Hollywood community has difficulty focusing on things, 
and Tom and Jane played the role of keeping that political light burning. If 
they cannot find a way to keep up the enthusiasm, I think the community will 
lack for leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Others who have been active in the Hayden-Fonda star search believe that enough 
of their work has taken root to survive no matter what happens. "The 
infrastructure will last," says one. 
</P>
<P>
So what of Hayden's political career? 
</P>
<P>
There is no understating how much his marriage meant to his politics. 
</P>
<P>
As a celebrity, Fonda added energy and electricity to his routine political 
appearances, and she opened doors for him into the world of the rich and 
famous. She helped finance his political campaigns. Her exercise business 
provided millions of dollars to build and support his grass-roots organization, 
first called the Campaign for Economic Democracy and now renamed Campaign 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Community property laws being what they are, Hayden is sure to emerge from any 
divorce a wealthy man, to the extent that is a concern. He has established a 
small-donor base of political contributors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strength of Connections 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen whether he is well enough connected on his own in the 
Hollywood-liberal circuit to keep the campaign dollars flowing unencumbered by 
special interests. This has always given Hayden special political freedom. But 
one friend worries, "The thing you don't want to do is cross someone as 
powerful and important in Hollywood as Jane Fonda." 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Assembly Labor Committee and of a higher education 
subcommittee, Hayden has staked out one of his busiest years ever in the 
Legislature. He is likewise determined to assist California Democratic Party 
Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. in trying to expand the voter base for Democrats. 
And he is never far from the debate over where Democrats should go in order to 
win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But those closest to him, those dependent on him for their own futures, believe 
there is deeper turmoil below. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Speculation 
</P>
<P>
A few think Hayden is so preoccupied with his personal life and that the 
breakup has taken such an emotional toll, that he will be of no mind to risk 
his political career in a 1990 run for insurance commissioner. But just as many 
guess otherwise, that he will emerge with fresh determination not to sit still. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the coffee shop, the hour grows late and Hayden struggles with the 
question himself. 
</P>
<P>
"People must empathize with the fact that we all need time for ourselves now 
and again. If people will allow me the time, and I know they will, and not 
think of it as more than one of those painful times we all go through, then" he 
says, pausing, ". . . then I'll be there. Yes, more than ever." 
</P>
<P>
And what of Jane Fonda and politics? 
</P>
<P>
"I was a political woman before I met Tom. I think I will be a political woman 
the rest of my life. . . . I am much more interested in issues than in 
candidates."

The world's most complicated watch, which took a team of jewelers nine years to 
design and assemble, became the world's most expensive watch when it was 
auctioned off in less than two minutes Sunday for $2.74 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding for the 18-carat gold Patek Philippe watch that packs 1,728 parts -- 
but must be wound every 30 hours -- began at $1.67 million and moved up 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer's name was withheld, but the auctioneer -- Habsburg, Feldman of 
Geneva -- identified him as a South American. With a 10% commission and 6.2% 
federal sales tax, he will pay $3,169,000 for the timepiece. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the highest price paid for a watch at auction was $1.2 million in 
1984 for a clock from the mid-17th Century.

U.S. AIDES WARY OF GORBACHEV PROPOSALS 
</P>

<P>
Top federal officials, reflecting the caution that characterizes the Bush 
Administration's sweeping review of American national security strategy, 
complained Sunday that there is much "old thinking" in Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's new proposals and said the United States will not be rushed into 
responding to a flurry of new initiatives from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a week of extraordinary activity in East-West relations, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III dismissed one of Gorbachev's latest 
initiatives -- a proposal to halt the production of enriched uranium for 
nuclear weapons -- as "great words . . . (but) not much by way of deeds" 
because the Soviets' supply of uranium is already abundant. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Baker pointedly reminded 
the Soviets that "when we're ready to talk, we'll talk." The remark was in 
response to criticism that the Administration has been slow to react to 
Gorbachev openings. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, 
echoed Baker's skepticism toward Soviet initiatives, declaring that evidence of 
a significant change in Moscow's policy toward the Third World is "so far . . . 
mixed." 
</P>
<P>
The comments of the two top aides reflected the findings of the 
Administration's sweeping review of U.S. national security policy, which 
sources said foresees no immediate changes in the nature of superpower 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The still officially secret review of U.S. policy, ordered by President Bush 
when he took office, has concluded that the Soviet military threat to the 
United States may diminish significantly over the next decade if Moscow's 
present policies endure, Administration officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need to Keep Up Guard Seen 
</P>
<P>
But it warned that until there is firm evidence that Soviet nuclear and 
conventional forces have been reduced, the United States must maintain its 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably not surprising that the future looks somewhat like the present," 
Scowcroft declared on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
In a stance that is sure to anger conservatives, Scowcroft also hinted that the 
Administration's national security blueprint would call for caution in the 
deployment of missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
While Scowcroft said that he "would not" see early deployment of such defenses, 
he added: "I think strategic defense is here to stay and we need vigorously to 
pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most immediate decisions to emerge from the Administration's review 
will focus on the modernization of long-range, land-based missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The decision over whether to deploy a large force of small, single-warhead 
mobile missiles or to place at least 50 ten-warhead MX missiles on trains 
"could impact the negotiating positions that we will take in the resumption of 
the (Strategic Arms Reduction) talks," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft, who has long favored the deployment of the smaller mobile missiles, 
suggested that the system may still be the choice of the Administration, in 
spite of its $24 billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether deployment of the small missile system, widely known as 
"Midgetman," is feasible, Scowcroft replied: "Oh, yes, at the cost of other 
things, yes." 
</P>
<P>
While both men expressed caution in predicting changes in Soviet behavior, 
Scowcroft and Baker appeared to differ markedly on expressing hope for 
long-term change on Moscow's part, with Scowcroft especially critical of recent 
Soviet moves. He called it "discouraging" that Gorbachev failed to use a recent 
visit to Cuba to renounce the Brezhnev Doctrine, which promises Soviet 
intervention to shore up failing Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks, by contrast, reflected greater hope that Gorbachev will back 
his initiatives with actions.

Soviet voters turned out Sunday for the second time in two weeks to choose 
candidates in 64 constituencies where no clear winners emerged for places in a 
new, more powerful parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The March 26 vote showed public opinion swinging against the Establishment 
across the country, with scores of senior Communist Party and government 
officials failing to win election. 
</P>
<P>
Reformist figures were hoping to seize on the public mood to consolidate their 
gains during the second round, a runoff between the two leaders in 
multi-candidate contests where no one achieved the necessary 50% of the vote. 
Initial results are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The elections are to a newly created Congress of People's Deputies, which will 
in turn elect from its members a Supreme Soviet (Parliament), endowed with real 
executive powers in contrast to its rubber-stamp predecessor.

Gunfire erupted on the campus of Florida A&amp;M University early Sunday as 
police tried to subdue an unruly crowd of several thousand people, some of whom 
were angry because a dance was oversold. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people were arrested and several firearms were seized during the 
riot, which lasted several hours. One campus police officer was injured when he 
was hit in the head with a bottle and at least 10 patrol cars were damaged, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Several officers were pinned down by gunfire at one point. About 60 officers 
from the Tallahassee Police Department and at least 130 sheriff's officers were 
called in to assist the campus police.

TWO TEEN-AGE YOUTHS KILLED IN SEPARATE SHOOTING INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were killed in possible gang-related shootings Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted outside a party in the Willowbrook area of South Los Angeles 
when members of two rival gangs clashed, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Garcia, 16, was shot at 1:30 a.m. after briefly arguing with two men, 
according to Deputy George DuCoulombier. Garcia was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died three hours later. 
</P>

<P>
Echo Park Shooting 
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, Adolfo Padron, 17, was shot and killed outside a wedding 
reception in the 2500 block of West Temple Street in Echo Park, Los Angeles 
police said. A 13-year-old female companion was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Padron had asked three uninvited guests to leave the party, and when he 
departed about 1 a.m., they confronted him in a parking lot across the street. 
</P>
<P>
One of the intruders shot him and wounded a girl who also was in the lot, 
police said. There were reports that one suspect was a gang member, but 
investigators said they had not verified the report.

HIGHS IN 70S END FIVE DAYS OF TORRID HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's five-day heat siege came to an end Sunday, allowing 
residents to again take up some of the things they had put off because of the 
torrid weather. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures that had climbed into the 100s for four consecutive days last week 
and hovered in the 90s on Saturday peaked with a Civic Center high of 77 
Sunday. Highs on Monday were similarly expected to reach the mid-70s. 
</P>
<P>
When Toni Forge awoke Sunday morning, she decided to choose an outfit she had 
been unable to wear since a record-shattering heat wave started its reign of 
terror in Southern California last week. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a pair of long pants. 
</P>
<P>
For Forge, 25, the end of the heat wave meant having the luxury of going around 
in something other than shorts. "Last night was the first night I slept with a 
blanket and today is the first day I looked forward to going outside," she said 
as she strolled through Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
But the lower temperatures did not deter Southern Californians from descending 
on the oceanfront. About 500,000 people visited beaches stretching from Malibu 
to Cabrillo, according to Los Angeles County lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
County lifeguard Bill Powers, supervisor of a beach area stretching from Marina 
del Rey to Topanga Canyon, said he was glad to see the heat wave end. "When 
you've got two lifeguards looking at upwards of 7,000 people, lost kids whose 
parents you're trying to locate (and) accidents on the bike path behind you, 
it's hard," he said. "Just having the breeze makes things a lot easier because 
people are less tense." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday had just enough warmth and cooling relief to satisfy lovers of both 
extremes. It was still warm enough for Valerie and John Krugh, members of the 
Alta Loma-based New Song Church, to be baptized in an outdoor hot tub in San 
Dimas without the managers having to turn on the heat. 
</P>
<P>
And it was cool enough to give the Foster's Freeze at the corner of 16th Street 
and Pico Boulevard its first slow day in almost a week, and for beach-goers to 
exchange their shorts and sandals for jeans, light jackets and bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the heat took a lethal toll on the region before it receded. 
Police said a 56-year-old transient, identified as Phillip Cannon, died of heat 
exhaustion and dehydration in his car Friday in front of a Simi Valley 
restaurant.

140 ARRESTED IN 2-DAY 'REVERSE STING' TARGETING CUSTOMERS OF ROCK HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-day "reverse sting" on rock house customers ended in the arrests of 140 
people for investigation of various drug-related offenses, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's narcotics, gang detail and patrol deputies served warrants on 
suspected rock cocaine houses from 4 p.m. Friday until midnight Saturday, 
taking alleged dealers into custody and then posing as drug sales clerks to 
arrest people who bought $10 and $20 "rocks" from them. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, dubbed "User Accountability," was conducted in the communities 
of Carson, Firestone, Lennox and Lynwood. Most of those arrested were held in 
lieu of bail ranging from $2,500 for possession of cocaine to $5,000 for 
selling the drug, Deputy Sam Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make users accountable for purchasing drugs and put doubt in their 
minds about who they are buying from," Jones said in explaining the sting 
operation. "We want them to think it could be a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
The operation, which followed a similar one in Lynwood last week, was financed 
by Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who provided discretionary funds 
to combat drug use in his district, Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman said.

FOOTNOTES: THE ART OF ECONOMIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The view from Aerojet's office building in La Jolla is breathtaking. But a view 
of Torrey Pines Golf Course and the Pacific Ocean won't be the only thing 
missing when Aerojet moves its corporate staff to Sacramento in a cost-cutting 
move later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet plans to auction off a 220-piece corporate art collection that, 
according to Hugh Davies, director of the nearby La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art, ranks as one of San Diego County's finest privately held 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
The art collection -- including "Obliquequestionofaturtle," "Tri-Axial Rotation 
of a Floating Volume of Light" and "Desert out of Cadillac Window" -- is an 
integral part of Aerojet's high-style, contemporary building in La Jolla, 
according to spokesman Tom Sprague. It just wouldn't fit in, he said, at the 
firm's new home in Sacramento: a mundane office building that only overlooks 
another office building.

Dog Owners Thrown a Bone 
</P>
<P>
Next time your dog is too lazy to go out and forage for his own food, you can 
hand him your American Express card and the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of an 800 number somewhere in Connecticut these days is a 
Carnation Co. operator taking orders for a line of gourmet pet food called 
Perform. Already the maker of such grocery store standards as Friskies and 
Mighty Dog, the company figured that home delivery would set its high-priced 
fare apart. 
</P>
<P>
But the healthy-sounding Carnation division responsible for direct-marketing 
Perform -- the Center for Animal Nutrition -- carries its convenience pitch one 
step further than most food-by-mail firms. In his introductory letter, director 
Lloyd Miller says his recipe uses rice instead of other grains because it is 
more digestible -- leaving "the people who clean up after our dogs much 
happier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warhol Met the Challenge 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1981, the scene a dinner party in Heerbrugg, Switzerland, hosted 
by industrialist Alexander Schmidheiny -- who two years before had bought Napa 
Valley's Cuvaison winery. Proudly opening a bottle for an American guest, the 
late pop artist Andy Warhol, Schmidheiny asked: "What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
"What a lousy label!" Warhol replied. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidheiny's wife and partner, Christina, recalled that Warhol accepted a 
challenge to design something better. But somehow the resulting clump of 
colorful grapes sliding off a white background was to languish in a drawer 
until 1986. Then, wine marketer Manfred Esser, recruited to head Cuvaison, 
stumbled upon Warhol's work. 
</P>
<P>
The winery finally used the label recently to adorn 84 magnum bottles of 
Cuvaison's 1984 Merlot to be auctioned for charity. Two bottles raised $3,200 
at separate auctions. And a single bottle this year went for $2,300 -- 
outperforming a prize Bordeaux, a 1949 Chateau Petrus, which fetched $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Deal: Real Estate? 
</P>
<P>
Australian businessman Christopher Skase enjoyed a degree of privacy before his 
recent $1-billion deal to buy MGM/UA Communications. Now all that is out the 
window, thanks to accelerated press exposure -- plus the legendary zeal of the 
Beverly Hills real estate sales battalions. 
</P>
<P>
During his visit here last week, the Qintex Group chairman stayed at the 
Bel-Air Hotel, as he has off and on for four years. His presence has increased 
since his fledgling U.S. entertainment operation -- Qintex Entertainment -- was 
launched last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expects to emulate other Hollywood studio owners by getting a 
Beverly Hills mansion, Skase said: "I really haven't had time to think about 
it." Thinking a moment, he added: "Plenty of people are trying to sell me a 
house, though."

Trump Wants Tower in Brazil: New York real estate magnate Donald J. Trump said 
he wanted to construct a Trump Tower-style building in Brazil. "What I enjoy 
most is building great buildings. I think my most likely investment in Brazil 
would be building a Trump Tower-type building . . . a glamorous, super-quality 
building," Trump told a weekend news conference in Sao Paulo. He said the tower 
would be built there or in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's biggest cities. The Trump 
Tower is a Fifth Avenue skyscraper where Trump has his headquarters. Trump, in 
Brazil to make a donation to a hospital, said, "It is very likely I will make 
an investment here. Brazil is one of the few places in this troubled world I 
feel confident to make an investment in."

Dow Joins Venture in China: Dow Chemical Co. said it has entered a joint 
venture to build a $50-million chemical plant in China. Dow said it will join 
with China's Zhejiang Chemical Factory to build a plant in Ningbo. The new 
company, Zhejiang Pacific Chemical Corp., will start producing 20,000 metric 
tons a year of polyether polyol for China's growing polyurethane foam industry 
in 1993. Polyether polyol is used to make foam for cushions and laminated 
fabrics for insulation. Dow has also joined a consortium of Western firms 
studying expansion of a petrochemical complex in Shevchenko in the Soviet Union 
to help in the the manufacture of styrene plastics and ethylene derivatives.

Banco Ambrosiano Trial Ordered: Masonic lodge leader Licio Gelli and 34 others 
were ordered to stand trial in Milan, Italy, in connection with the 1982 
collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's biggest private banking failure. But 
Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computer firm, will not stand 
trial on extortion charges after magistrates dismissed all charges against him. 
After a seven-year investigation, the magistrates ordered 34 people to stand 
trial on charges of complicity in fraudulent bankruptcy and one woman to be 
tried for aiding and abetting fraud.

WINE FAMILY HAS STAKE WITH JAPANESE OWNERS

Until Kirin Brewery Co. came along, foreign firms purchasing American wineries 
have done so lock, stock and barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, when the Raymond Vineyard Winery announced completion of the 
deal in which Kirin, the brewing giant, became the owner of this Napa Valley 
jewel, a line in the press announcement noted that Raymond "will retain an 
ownership interest in the winery and will continue to operate and manage the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese buyers of wineries have left Americans in charge. When Otsuka 
Pharmaceutical bought Ridge Vineyards in Cupertino in 1986, it left Paul Draper 
and the late David Benion to run it. Sanraku and Sapporo left intact the staffs 
at Markham and St. Clement, respectively, two other Napa Valley wineries they 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
But in previous cases, the wineries were sold 100% -- all land, buildings, 
inventory, and stock. This makes the Raymond deal unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed here (by contract) for at least the next three years," said 
Roy Raymond Jr., president of the winery and the man who handles viticultural 
and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"And if things go well, and we expect them to, there are plans to stay on 
beyond five years," said Walt Raymond, Roy's brother and the wine maker. He 
declined to give specifics of the deal, but a source close to the winery 
estimated that the family retained about 15% of the stock in the winery. 
</P>
<P>
The key to retaining a portion of the winery, according to both sides in the 
deal, was the incentive factor. Kirin executives knew they needed to keep the 
Raymonds around to operate the winery and maintain the same high quality of 
wines produced since the winery was founded in 1974. And the Raymonds were 
prepared to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you have very talented and long-term management that you want to keep 
intact, structuring a deal this way gives them (the Raymonds) an inducement," 
said Joel Marcus, the attorney who worked with Kirin on arranging the deal. 
"This way, the Raymonds have a continuing stake in the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"This accomplished several things," added Marcus, a partner in the law firm 
Pettit &amp; Martin in Los Angeles. "It keeps the founding managers as your 
business partners, and I think that assures stronger management. And it gives 
them (the Raymonds) a great incentive to stay active in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Ramond added, "The way the deal is structured, our stock (in the company) 
will appreciate in value based on increasing (case) sales and profits." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Raymond said Kirin told the family the acquisition was "for investment 
purposes only. They take the long-term view, and they look at the Napa Valley 
as a quality region and Raymond as a quality property." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus pointed out that "some of the past deals (in which Japanese companies 
have bought American businesses) haven't been as creative as they might have 
been, and I think the reason is that they forget the essential ingredient of 
operations. But from the perspective of Kirin, I think you may see more of 
these kind of deals from now on from companies that see the long-term potential 
of inducements to the managers." 
</P>
<P>
The first and to date the largest Japanese purchase of a California winery was 
in 1984 when Suntory Ltd. bought Chateau St. Jean in Sonoma County for an 
estimated $40 million. Although management of that company initially didn't 
change, none of the former owners of Chateau St. Jean retained any percentage 
in the company. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening five years, however, most of the former executives of 
Chateau St. Jean have left, including the president, the national sales 
director and the head of viticulture. The key remaining employee is Richard 
Arrowood, the wine maker. Many of those who left say they couldn't adapt to the 
Japanese corporate style. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Raymonds say that under their agreement with Kirin, family members 
will call all the shots. "They (Kirin) gave us every assurance that we will be 
the managing people -- we will be the ones making all the decisions," said 
Walt. 
</P>
<P>
When it was first reported last October that Kirin and the Raymonds had struck 
a deal, estimated by sources at about $18 million, it surprised many in the 
Napa Valley who felt that Raymond was the least likely winery to sell. Case 
production had risen in the past few years by about 20% annually and by 1989 
was projected at near 140,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
And the company was not hurting financially. Its wines were highly regarded in 
the marketplace, both at restaurant and retail levels, and it was competing 
successfully in four different price levels with its chardonnays, which 
represent 57% of its production. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a winery for sale," Roy said. He said the property had never 
been listed with an agent, and the family wasn't even thinking of taking 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
"But Kirin had looked around, looking to buy a Napa Valley winery, and they had 
found a lot of them that were for sale and looked into them and found things 
that were wrong," Roy added. "Then they looked at us and after a while made us 
an offer." 
</P>
<P>
It apparently wasn't the only offer. Insiders say Hiram Walker, the 
British-based drinks company that recently paid a reported $38 million to 
acquire Clos du Bois winery in Sonoma County, also bid for Raymond. The 
Raymonds declined to discuss any other offers that may have been made.

PAC BELL OPENS A TECHNOLOGICAL WAR BY TEST-MARKETING A NEW TELEPHONE MESSAGE 
SERVICE. BUT HOME MACHINES HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES AND MAY PROVE TOUGH TO 
DISPLACE.

Just 21 years ago, the telephone answering machine was born in a Torrance 
garage. Since PhoneMate bought the license to that invention, which now has 
many competing versions, the answering machine has found ready acceptance, 
first among businesses that welcomed having telephones answered after hours 
and, since 1980, in a growing number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
But now California's largest local phone company, Pacific Bell, is testing the 
market for what it calls its "answer to the answering machine" -- voice mail, a 
phone-answering and message-sending service built into the telephone network 
and requiring no special equipment other than a push-button phone. 
</P>
<P>
What seems to lie ahead is a major marketing war between competing telephone 
technologies. Pacific Bell, which is conducting market tests with its new 
service in the port community of San Pedro and the Silicon Valley town of 
Milpitas, is confronting the answering machine head on. On buttons distributed 
at a San Pedro gathering called March 31 to introduce the service to the 
community, the company declared that its new system "puts the answering machine 
where it belongs -- inside your phone." 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Bell video played hilariously garbled answering machine messages and 
emphasized that its service requires the purchase of no equipment -- as long as 
the customer has a push-button telephone that "speaks" to computers. "It's a 
service built into the telephone system," the narrator explained. "There's 
nothing at all! Just a blank spot where the answering machine used to be." 
</P>
<P>
But PhoneMate, which parlayed the Torrance invention into nearly a 19% slice of 
today's answering-machine market and annual sales approaching $120 million, is 
far from throwing in the towel. Indeed, the company (since last year a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Japan's Asahi Corp.) regards Pacific Bell as "just another 
competitor in a very competitive field," said Larry Kloman, PhoneMate vice 
president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"They will certainly capture some share of market," he acknowledged, "and we 
will direct our marketing strategies accordingly. But there's plenty of room." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers last year bought nearly 9 million answering machines. That's 
nearly double the total of three years earlier. Industry sales have grown about 
20% annually in most of the 1980s, but market penetration remains only 20%. 
Analysts estimate, however, that at the present pace of sales, penetration will 
reach 35% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But by then Pacific Bell and many other local phone companies across the nation 
will be moving beyond market tests. And the phone companies enjoy real 
marketing advantages, Kloman said, notably, a directory full of readily 
identifiable customers. "That's a huge advantage." 
</P>
<P>
There are other advantages, too. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are scared of technology and won't buy an answering machine," 
said Steve Kropper, a senior consultant with International Data Corp. in 
Framingham, Mass. Such people, he suggested, might find an answering service 
offered by their local phone company attractive. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Casey Dworkin of Personal Technology Research in nearby 
Waltham, Mass., maintained that residential customers will be a very hard sell 
for the phone companies -- particularly if they already have answering 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Voice messaging is just not going to take off in the home," Dworkin predicted. 
"There may be some niche marketing for a home-office situation," but most 
households, he said, value such phone machine features as the screening of 
incoming calls. Voice mail can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, he said, buying a machine is not a continuing expense, such as voice 
mail, but a one-time cost -- and as little as $50 to $75, including such 
features as remote access to messages. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the experience of Contel of California, which first brought residential 
voice mail to the state last year, tends to bear out the difficulty of reaching 
that market. Alice Camuti, marketing coordinator for the Victorville-based 
phone company, has signed up only about 2% of 50,000 potential customers who 
could subscribe to voice mail, though the company claims to be making progress 
-- by stressing the answering-machine elements of the service and leaving other 
capabilities, such as message sending, for customers to grow into. 
</P>
<P>
But, Camuti acknowledged, "if they have an answering machine and it's not 
offering any problems, it's a hard sell. They say, 'It works fine, why do I 
need yours?' " 
</P>
<P>
Lisa French, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, is bullish about the future 
of voice mail. Nonetheless, she predicted that answering machines "will be 
around a long time . . . for folks who just want to have their telephone 
answered." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pacific Bell's entry into the ring is not PhoneMate's first 
David-and-Goliath match. In 1973, PhoneMate took on American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph after AT&amp;T tried to force its customers with answering machines 
to lease a special device to connect them to the network. When the dust settled 
three years later, the court ruled that answering machines could be plugged 
directly into any phone jack. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell chose its two test communities with great care, said Lee Camp, 
vice president and general manager of information services. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pedro is in many ways a unique community," he said. "but it also offers a 
balance that we expect to find throughout California." 
</P>
<P>
The "balance" includes a Latino population that makes up 29% of the 101,000 
residents, plus San Pedro's original core of Yugoslavs and Greeks drawn to the 
harbor and its commercial fishery. There are 35,000 households and 2,500 small 
businesses -- Pacific Bell's prime targets in the marketing tests. Such tightly 
defined communities, whose members keep in very close contact with one another, 
hold the greatest potential for voice messaging, Camp said. 
</P>
<P>
The other test market, Milpitas, has a populace that is technologically 
sophisticated and therefore unlikely to be awed by the new service. 
</P>
<P>
Camp said he expects the two tests to last at least six months.

HOW VOICE MAIL WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Contel of California pioneered residential "voice mail" in the high desert 
area surrounding Victorville last year, the phone company discovered a problem: 
Potential customers didn't know what it was. Many still don't, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that they don't understand what voice mail is and they don't know 
what 'voice mailbox' means," said Alice Camuti, Contel marketing coordinator. 
"One big obstacle is this low level of awareness." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "voice mail" is a relatively simple concept. It is basically a way of 
getting messages through your phone system at work or at home without 
installing additional equipment, such as a telephone answering machine, or 
hiring an answering service. 
</P>
<P>
The technology is built into the telephone network -- a software program hooked 
up to the phone company's switch serving a community (such as San Pedro, where 
Pacific Bell began offering the service this month). All the customer needs is 
a push-button phone that emits tones enabling it to communicate with computers. 
</P>
<P>
Voice mail allows customers to have their phones "answered" automatically in 
their absence or even while on another call. Calls are routed automatically to 
an electronic "mailbox" or "message center." 
</P>
<P>
On reaching the center, the caller hears the customer's own recorded greeting, 
or a generic one provided by the system, followed by an invitation to leave a 
message. Customers know that a message has been left when they get a stuttering 
dial tone upon lifting the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
If both callers are in the same community and both have voice mail, they can 
also send messages to each other through the system. The messaging capability 
lets a user send the same message to a number of people all with one call. 
Someone in charge of a car pool, for instance, might call in a message to the 
voice mail system and then have it transmitted to everyone involved in the 
pool. Or if inspiration strikes at midnight, you can record a message then and 
have it sent out during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
In its two test markets -- the other being Milpitas in Silicon Valley -- 
Pacific Bell is inviting its customers to open a "message box" to receive 
messages at no charge as an inducement to build a broadly based community 
messaging network. For a modest monthly charge, additional boxes can be 
assigned to other members of a household, offering private message storage not 
available on a single answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to be able to send messages as well -- in other words, to 
have more than just an answering machine -- the charge is $6 a month for 
residential customers and $12 for small businesses. (This month only, the 
company is waiving a one-time installation fee of $7 for residential customers 
and $15 for small businesses.) 
</P>
<P>
Residential and small-business customers alike pay 25 cents for each message 
that they send to another message box in their community. If one message is 
sent to more than one party, the additional, automatically routed transmissions 
cost 15 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
There's one thing that voice mail doesn't have, however, that answering 
machines feature: the ability to screen calls, listening to incoming messages 
without picking up the phone. BRUCE KEPPEL

<P>
Bellcore, the research laboratory in Livingston, N.J., owned jointly by the 
Baby Bell phone companies, is experimenting with the "next generation" of voice 
mail services. 
</P>
<P>
The services being tested by 60 residential and business customers enable users 
to answer calls to their home from anywhere while the caller is still on the 
line, have their telephones ring at more than one location and let through only 
selected callers while directing others to leave a message. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning how potential new services might be constructed and operated in 
future telephone networks and whether customers will be able to use these 
services easily and effectively," said project manager Maurice Lampell. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is just starting its effort to sign up residential customers and 
small businesses for new telephone answering and messaging services. And 
California's second-largest local phone company, Thousand Oaks-based GTE 
California, has postponed "indefinitely" its commercial tests, according to 
spokesman Larry Cox. 
</P>
<P>
But out in the hinterlands, Contel of California has offered voice mail 
services for more than a year, though with modest results -- about 2% 
penetration in four markets: its headquarters city of Victorville and the 
resort areas of Big Bear, Mammoth Lakes and Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Contel offers two levels of service: Basic answering service at $4.95 a month 
provides capacity to record 58 five-minute messages in a month; enhanced 
service, at a monthly flat rate of $19.95, receives and sends messages, 
automatically "stamping" each with the date and time, and enables customers to 
route a single message to up to 10 local numbers. (With special arrangements, 
Contel can compile message lists of up to 150 parties.) 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is using Octel Communications' voice-messaging equipment, produced 
in Milpitas; Contel employs four machines from VMX Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The entry of the so-called Baby Bells phone companies into the budding voice 
mail market became possible only in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court in Washington ruled that the local phone companies could use 
their networks to carry voice mail and other electronic information services as 
long as they met two conditions: They could not produce the information 
services themselves and they had to treat all suppliers of information services 
equally. 
</P>
<P>
The court and the Federal Communications Commission required the companies to 
modify their phone systems to assure that all outside vendors offering services 
requiring use of the local networks pay the same prices for equal levels of 
service. BRUCE KEPPEL

MESSY DEBATE OVER DOG BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
LICENSE TO ROMP UNLEASHES FEUD IN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Officially, the maps refer to the stretch of sand at the extreme northern end 
of Ocean Beach as Yogi Beach. But to the many San Diego dog owners who use the 
small patch of coast to allow their pets to run free, it's known by something 
else: Dog Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The name is all too literal to some Ocean Beach residents, who feel that the 
sandy spit jutting into the San Diego River Floodway has indeed gone to the 
dogs. Those residents are intent on cleaning up the beach by banning the 
animals from it, and that has owners worried. They fear they could lose one of 
only two beach areas in San Diego where canines are allowed to roam free any 
time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has drawn heated comments from both sides and hinted at developing 
friction between longtime residents of the funky beach community and newer 
residents who want to improve the area's image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance to Air Views 
</P>
<P>
It has also prompted the Ocean Beach Town Council to sponsor a town meeting to 
discuss the issue tonight at 7:30 at the Ocean Beach Masonic Lodge. About half 
a dozen representatives of county and city elected officials and governmental 
agencies have been invited. 
</P>
<P>
No official action is expected to take place tonight, but the meeting's 
sponsors say they hope the session will give both sides a chance to air their 
views. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is simple and messy. 
</P>
<P>
"The sand is full of dog feces," said Eileen Histen, head of the council's Dog 
Beach committee. "It's very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The situation has raised concerns about unsanitary conditions and drawn the 
attention of the San Diego County Department of Health Services. Officials are 
worried that the waste could lead to the spread of disease among humans and 
dogs using the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the dog droppings has to be addressed effectively," said Moise 
Mizrahi, chief of the health department's vector control division, which deals 
with problems presented by disease-producing animals. "Either the dog owners 
are going to have to be held responsible for policing after their dogs, or the 
alternative is to close it down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Mizrahi said conditions have not reached the point where the department would 
consider using emergency power to order that the dogs be banned from the beach. 
At the same time, he is concerned about the ability to enforce existing laws 
requiring that owners clean up after their pets. 
</P>
<P>
A city law requires that owners clean up after their dogs, but citations are 
rarely issued, because the law is difficult to enforce, said Sally Hazzard, 
director of the San Diego County Department of Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned with enforcing all of the laws, but this is not one of our 
high-priority items," said Hazzard, whose department is funded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard said she is interested in learning at tonight's meeting whether 
residents feel that Dog Beach has outgrown its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see if current events have overtaken the original designation," 
Hazzard said. "I have made no conclusion about that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Dog Beach and Fiesta Island are the only beaches in San Diego that are exempt 
from a law that requires dogs in public beach areas to be on leashes and 
restricts their presence to between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. The exemption for Dog 
Beach was approved in 1972, but neither Ocean Beach nor city or government 
officials contacted last week could recall why Dog Beach received special 
status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Public Asset 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burns, an Ocean Beach lawyer who is active among those critical of the 
state of the beach, said he is not especially concerned about banning the dogs. 
He just wants to see that owners are forced to clean up after them. He is 
annoyed by an attitude he said exists among some dog owners that the beach 
should effectively be left in their control. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should they be allowed to ruin a limited public asset?" Burns said. "If 
they are going to ruin it for everyone else, they don't deserve to be down 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But Andrea Savage, a resident of Ocean Beach for 12 years and the owner of two 
dogs, said she is concerned that the issue is about much more than just dogs on 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Ocean Beach has a bad reputation -- drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. 
What's happened is a lot of upscale yuppies are moving in, property values are 
going up, and some developers are trying to eliminate the bad reputation and 
make it an appealing place, a nice beach." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Grasso, an aide to San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, whose 2nd 
District includes Ocean Beach, agreed that the issue provides an example of 
what he called the changing nature of Ocean Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Ocean Beach is going through a revitalization," Grasso said. "The image of 
Ocean Beach as a place where people come down with their dogs to relieve them 
on the beach and let it wash into the water is something some in the community 
find offensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prelude to Total Ban? 
</P>
<P>
He said letters to Roberts' office were running slightly in favor of keeping 
the area open to unleashed dogs and that Roberts did not see a need to change 
the law at this time. 
</P>
<P>
But Savage fears that even stricter enforcement of the current cleanup law 
would be a prelude to banning the dogs altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unpopular to say, 'Let's ban all the dogs,' so they start by saying they 
want to clean it up," Savage said. Asking dog owners to clean up more carefully 
after their pets is impractical, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do, chase them down the beach with a shovel?" She said 
she advocates instead an increase in dog license fees to pay for more frequent 
cleanups of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Histen, the Dog Beach committee chairman, said the city has already begun to 
respond to resident concerns by placing additional trash cans and so-called 
"pooper scooper" shovels on the beach to help dog owners pick up the waste.

A 'SHOCKED' GOLDING SAYS HER HUSBAND IS INNOCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, in her first public comments on her 
husband's arrest in connection with an alleged money-laundering scheme, said 
Sunday that she found the news of the charges so unbelievable that she 
initially assumed it was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"It took quite a few minutes to realize that they weren't kidding," Golding 
said, recounting how she learned of the charges by telephone while in New 
Jersey following the death of her mother. "It was totally and completely 
shocking, and still is. . . . This is something that you read in a novel, not 
something that happens in real life." 
</P>
<P>
Golding, in comments at a brief La Jolla news conference and subsequent 
interview, declared what she characterized as her unequivocal belief in the 
innocence of her husband, Richard T. Silberman, the millionaire businessman and 
longtime Democratic Party power broker who was arrested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that when all the facts come out in a court of 
law, my husband will be exonerated," Golding said. "He is innocent. . . . My 
husband is an honest, loving and caring man, and he's been that way all his 
life, and that doesn't change in a few months." 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Golding seemed controlled and in command, said Dan 
McAllister, a longtime political associate who helped organize the event. Her 
voice cracked at times during a subsequent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to discuss the specific charges against her husband, Golding, 
one of San Diego's rising political stars, expressed her belief that much of 
the allegations released to date have been designed to cast Silberman in the 
worst possible light. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that only a portion of a certain number of facts are being 
told," she said, "and they are being told by someone who would like to 
prosecute someone." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 59, a co-founder of the Jack in the Box fast-food chain and a major 
figure in state and area politics for more than a decade, was freed after 
posting bail Saturday evening, following one night in the federal Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. He was arrested Friday at a San 
Diego hotel while allegedly negotiating to assist in the concealing, or 
laundering, of some $1.1 million in purported drug proceeds, according to the 
FBI. The person making the alleged arrangement with Silberman turned out to be 
an undercover FBI agent who had earlier arranged some $300,000 in 
money-laundering operations with Silberman, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman is to be arraigned in U. S. District Court today. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested was Chris Poulos, 62, of San Diego, commonly known as Chris 
Petti, who authorities say has been linked to the Chicago-area La Cosa Nostra, 
the organized-crime organization. The crime group's activities in Southern 
California and Nevada triggered the investigation, which has been going on for 
2 1/2 years, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Silberman's arrest, federal authorities said Golding apparently 
had no knowledge of the money scheme. She said Sunday that she had no inkling 
of the investigation of her husband until she learned of his arrest Friday. 
Authorities have said the money schemes involving Silberman date back some five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman has been home since Saturday evening, said Golding, who added that 
she and her husband have been discussing the case intensely, along with various 
lawyers. She refrained on commenting to the media until now, she said, so she 
might be better versed in the facts of the case. No decision had been made on a 
lawyer to represent Silberman, Golding said, although she added that the family 
had spoken with a number of prominent area counsels, including Milton Silverman 
and Louis Katz. 
</P>
<P>
There has been much speculation about what impact the charges could have on 
Golding's career. The 43-year-old chairwoman of the County Board of Supervisors 
and a leading area Republican is considered one of San Diego's pre-eminent 
politicians, and she is known to have ambitions for statewide office. Whatever 
the outcome of the criminal case, political observers say her husband's 
involvement in the case will likely tarnish her star. On Sunday, however, 
Golding declined to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"What about my political future?" Golding herself asked. "The only person whose 
future I've thought about is my husband's. . . . The best thing I can do for my 
husband now is stand by him and support him, which I intend to do." 
</P>
<P>
The support from others has been widespread, said Golding, who described her 
husband's spirits as shaken -- "He's in shock" -- but added that the couple is 
determined to fight the allegations. "I was most afraid that people would 
desert him, people he's known for years, but that hasn't happened," Golding 
said. "We've literally gotten call after call from people who worked with him, 
from friends, all offering support." 
</P>
<P>
As for her job, Golding said it might be necessary for her to cut down perhaps 
20 hours a week in her work schedule, which she said usually entails 80 to 90 
hours of work each week. She canceled a trip to Washington this week to spend 
more time with her husband, she said. But Golding said she has no intention of 
stepping down from elected office. She vowed she will continue to give as much 
as she can to her job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say this: My husband comes first, and my family comes first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Golding and Silberman were married in July, 1984, in the midst of her campaign 
for county supervisor. The two had previously had a well-known relationship, 
despite their affiliations with different political parties. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman has three grown children from a former marriage. Golding's two 
children, also from a former marriage, live with the couple in San Diego.

GANGS FACE OFF IN S. MISSION BEACH PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of two gangs faced off with guns in a South Mission Beach parking lot 
Saturday night, firing at least a dozen shots before the fight was broken up by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
At least two men are believed to have been wounded in the gun battle, police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident took place about 7 p.m. Saturday in the crowded beach parking lot 
at the southern end of Mission Boulevard. More than 100 people were in the lot 
when the two groups began arguing and shots rang out, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers patrolling nearby ran to the scene and called for more 
officers, Robinson said. A 9-millimeter pistol and a .357 Magnum were recovered 
at the scene, but no arrests were made, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour after the incident, a man checked into Physicians &amp; 
Surgeons Hospital with a gunshot wound to the leg. He said he was an innocent 
bystander at the fight, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, another man arrived at Sharp Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds to 
the elbow and side. He said he had been shot in an incident in Southeast San 
Diego, but police believe he might also have been at the brawl in Mission 
Beach, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it was not immediately known why the groups were fighting. The 
Police Department's gang detail will continue the investigation today.

FATHER ARRESTED IN TRAFFIC MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three children were injured Sunday night in an accident on California 78, east 
of Escondido, and their father has been arrested on suspicion of felony drunken 
driving and child endangerment, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey C. Jackson, 34, was reportedly driving east in the wrong lane of 
traffic on the highway, about 3 miles east of Bandy Canyon Road, when he 
swerved and hit an embankment and his truck rolled over, a police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His three children -- all under 14 years old -- and a woman passenger were 
trapped in the truck until they were freed by rescuers, the spokesman said. Two 
of the children were taken by Life Flight helicopter to Children's Hospital, 
and the third was taken to Palomar Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the names of the children or the woman, who was not 
their mother. No information was available on their medical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, who was not seriously injured, was booked into County Jail on 
suspicion of felony drunken driving and felony child endangerment.

MCENROE, AGASSI COMPLETE SWEEP WITH VICTORIES 
</P>

<P>
Davis Cup themes of the week: 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe isn't getting older; he's getting better. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi has "toned down" his act. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. team may just be, as captain Tom Gorman insists, "stronger than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans completed their surprisingly easy 5-0 sweep over a powerful 
French team Sunday at the San Diego Sports Arena when Agassi beat Yannick Noah, 
6-3, 7-6 (9-7), followed by McEnroe's 6-3, 6-1 waltz over Henri Leconte. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's matches meant next to nothing because the United States had taken an 
insurmountable 3-0 lead Saturday night with a victory by the doubles team of 
Ken Flach and Robert Seguso. Which is why Davis Cup officials followed the 
common practice of reducing them to the best of three sets on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
The United States advances to the World Group semifinals July 21-23 against 
defending Davis Cup defending champion West Germany at a site to be determined 
by the West Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Early speculation points to Dortmund, the site of West Germany's 1988 semifinal 
Davis Cup victory over Yugoslavia. Dortmund is located in the heart of the 
country's industrial district and has a huge indoor arena. The surface will 
probably be the same fast Supreme Court used in San Diego this weekend. It is 
Boris Becker's favorite court. And Becker's mentor, Ian Tiriac, is the promoter 
for the match. 
</P>
<P>
The West German team, which defeated Czechoslovakia, 3-2, this weekend in a 
surprisingly close quarterfinal, features Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb. Steeb, 
better on slow courts, beat Agassi last month in Florida. Becker has won 
Wimbledon twice. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"To say it's likely for us to win (against the West Germans) is an 
understatement," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly go in as favorites," McEnroe added. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi says he's playing the best tennis of his life and the Las Vegas resident 
claims his game no longer resembles a lounge act. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that all that stuff (his on-court antics) was so new last year made 
everybody think I was a comedian or something and not a tennis player," Agassi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Noah knows he is a tennis player. Agassi broke Noah's serve in the sixth game 
of the first set with a forehand passing shot on the line. He won the 
second-set tiebreaker and the match when Noah served his only double fault. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Agassi threw his shirt to an adoring crowd. Showmen fade slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of McEnroe's match never appeared in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew within two minutes I was already into it," said McEnroe, who improved 
his record against Leconte to 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Noah nor Leconte was able to break McEnroe's serve in his two matches 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The final U.S. theme: Unity. 
</P>
<P>
Flach and Seguso, who have feuded in the past, say they are closer than ever. 
McEnroe, 30, and Agassi, 18, say they are learning to live with their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of fire up off his youthfulness," McEnroe said. "And he sort of learns 
from my experience. It's a good combination." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the United States won the Davis Cup was in France in 1982. If the 
Americans defeat the West Germans, they will play the winner of Yugoslavia vs. 
Sweden in the championship, which will be played Dec. 15-17.

REED DOESN'T WIN, BUT GETS MORAL VICTORY

<P>
In vintage car racing, it's not always whether you win or lose, it's whether 
you finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
That's the philosophy Randy Reed of Spring Valley has when racing his 1914 
Tahis Special. 
</P>
<P>
The Tahis Special was one of five pre-World War II automobiles featured in the 
Fine Store Cup of the Rodger Ward Invitational-San Diego Historic Grand Prix 
Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Giddings of Walnut Creek won the race in his 1932 Maserati. Racers took 
12 laps on the 1.7-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just out there putting around," said Reed, who remained happy despite his 
last-place finish. "It's just important to be running at the end of the race." 
</P>
<P>
The occasional sputtering made spectators question whether the car could finish 
the race, but Reed, accompanied by his wife, Susi, was able to finish in 
Saturday's practice session and on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Susi pumped fuel through the car with the hand fuel pump every couple of 
minutes. The car holds 40 gallons of gasoline and under racing conditions 
averages five miles per gallon. It can reach speeds up to just over 100 miles 
per hour with its 110-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. The Wisconsin model JR 
engine was used for race cars from 1911 through 1915, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Tahis Special did stop at mid-course, but gasoline was added 
to get the car running. The tank just hadn't been filled, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's father, Lonnie, purchased the car in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had any interest in old race cars at that time and mainly wanted the 
parts for other cars," said Reed, who obtained the car from his father in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Tahis Special looks as though it should be retired to a museum with its 
crank-start engine, exterior gears and brakes and 35-inch tires. The black 
leather seats are wearing through in spots and the wood panel which houses the 
tachometer, oil pressure and water pump gauges has faded. The blue paint is 
cracking, revealing red paint, but Reed said the original color in 1914 was 
cream. Reed has attempted to keep the automobile as original as possible and 
has restored only the tires and has done minor engine work. 
</P>
<P>
The car sat in the younger Reed's garage until last year when it was raced for 
the first time in 25 years. Reed placed 13th out of 19 cars in the Monterey 
Historic Races last year. Reed said that was a much faster course than the one 
in San Diego. He said that this course was very tight on turns and it was 
impossible get a an accurate measure of how the Tahis Special can race. The car 
has been in a few automobile shows but this is its second race since coming out 
of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Tahis Special was built by Fredrick Robinson in Los Angeles in 1913. As far 
as Reed knows, this was the only one made. A year ago, Reed heard a rumor there 
was another Tahis Special, but he could not confirm it, he said. The Tahis 
Special probably is worth close to $100,000 today, according to Tahis. 
</P>
<P>
The car's first race was in Elgin, Ill., in 1914 by its original owner, Jack 
Teel. Reed said that in its day the Tahis Special was a prime contender in 
major auto races, although it never won. 
</P>
<P>
The Tahis Special just finished up a three-month stay at the San Diego 
Automotive Museum where it was on display. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the two-day event will benefit the museum, which is located 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Reed also raced on Sunday a 1963 Fiat Abarth and placed fifth out of 17 
entrants in the American Airlines Cup. David Springett of Rancho Palos Verdes 
won in his 1956 Lotus MKII.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: UC SAN DIEGO SETS ENDURANCE MARK IN WATER POLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC San Diego men's water polo team established a new mark for the Guinness 
Book of World Records when it completed a 26-hour game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The game, between two seven-man teams chosen from the 34-man Triton squad, 
began at 1:15 p.m. Saturday at the UCSD Natatorium and continued until 3:15 
p.m. Sunday and set a record for the longest continuous water polo game. It 
broke the record of 25 hours 36 minutes set three years ago by a prep team in 
Shropshire, England. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the white team -- Jason Brown, Todd Sells, Randy Franke, Tom 
Schatz, Jason Vance, Greg Goodrich and John Sklut -- defeated the blue team -- 
Larry Sanders, J.P. Beay, Peter McConville, Stuart Sweeney, Chris Carillo, Mike 
Schatz and Todd Brinton -- by a score of 488-460. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they would be able to do this," Coach Denny Harper said. "But I was 
surprised by how strong they were at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Harper also was a little surprised by what 26 hours in water can do to the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't look humanlike at the end," Harper said. "Obviously, their hands 
were pretty wrinkled and had a real ashlike color, but an hour or so later, 
they were all recovered." 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
No. 15-ranked University of San Diego scored a 5-3 victory over Fresno State 
with victories coming from No. 2 singles player Mark Farren and No. 3 Mike 
Noel. 
</P>
<P>
Farren edged Greg Anderson, 7-5, 6-4, and Noel had little trouble defeating 
Bertrand Lemercier, 6-4, 6-2. Farren and Noel then teamed for a 6-4, 6-3 defeat 
of Mike Noel and Lemercier at No. 2 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Eric Christopherson and Brian Dunn each drove in two runs in a four-run second 
inning to help San Diego State (24-14, 8-4) to a 6-3 victory over host New 
Mexico in the first game of a Western Athletic Conference doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico (8-21-1, 4-4) came back to take the second game, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive walks to open the bottom of the third inning proved the 
undoing of the University of San Diego as host Loyola Marymount scored five 
runs in the inning en route to an 11-1 West Coast Athletic Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros (15-20-1, 1-10) went on to walk eight and had six errors in losing 
their ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer League scored a 2-0 victory over the 
Arizona Condors in an exhibition game at San Diego City College. Jerome Watson 
and Arturo Valesco kicked in the Nomads' two goals.

Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons will miss up to three weeks because of a 
broken finger suffered in a fight that prompted his two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, ejected with the Chicago Bulls' Bill Cartwright in the first quarter of 
the Pistons' 114-112 overtime victory Friday, was examined Sunday at Harper 
Grace Hospital, Pistons spokesman Matt Dobek said. 
</P>
<P>
"Isiah does have a fracture of his second metacarpal, which is a bone right 
above his left index finger. The swelling still has not gone down. So they're 
going to re-examine him on Wednesday," Dobek said.

MISSION TO MOSCOW; 
</P>
<P>
SAN JUAN LAD HOPES TO MEET GORBACHEV ON WAY ROUND WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his fourth-grade classes at St. Margaret's School in San Juan Capistrano, 
Tony Aliengena doodles pictures of airplanes and daydreams of far-away places. 
</P>
<P>
When the Episcopal school lets out for the summer, the doodles and daydreams 
will become real. Beginning June 5, Tony is set to fly around the world in his 
father's single-engine plane. 
</P>
<P>
Over 6 weeks, the 10-year-old plans to pilot the Cessna 210 over the United 
States, across the North Atlantic, over Northern Europe and -- in the highlight 
of the journey -- across the entire width of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials in early March granted permission for Tony, his family and a 
small entourage to fly across their country -- the first time that they have 
provided such aerial access to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes to Meet With Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
After making 14 stops in the Soviet Union -- including Moscow, where he hopes 
to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- Tony intends to cross the 
Bering Strait and re-enter the United States through Alaska. From there, Tony 
and his entourage plan to follow the Pacific coast back to Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport, his point of departure. 
</P>
<P>
The larger goal of the global adventure is to enhance peaceful relations 
between the superpowers, said Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a certified 
pilot who helped teach his son to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Friendship Flight '89," Tony's flight will be carrying letters from 
American schoolchildren to their counterparts in the Soviet Union, as well as a 
"Friendship Scroll" signed by U.S. youngsters during the American leg of the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make (the scroll) big," Tony's father said at his home. "We want a 
million signatures." 
</P>
<P>
After delivering these things to Gorbachev, Tony intends to return home with 
friendship letters from Soviet children and a friendship scroll signed by 
youngsters during stops in that country. Tony hopes to deliver those good-will 
messages to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
A shy, soft-spoken youngster, Tony does not like to talk about himself. Aside 
from his flying talent, there is little about Tony that distinguishes him from 
other children his age. 
</P>
<P>
He plays Little League baseball. He plays football. And he likes building 
models and skateboarding. With his family, Tony also enjoys fishing, hunting 
and skiing trips. In the winter, the family spends many weekends at their snowy 
cabin in the mountains of southern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
But it is flying that sets Tony apart. He began learning to fly at age 4 from 
his father's lap. Tony's first aviation record was to become the youngest 
person to fly solo in an aircraft. He did that on March 13, 1988, by 
successfully piloting an ultralight aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's next feat was to fly across the United States and break a record set by 
10-year-old Eric Fiederer. Tony accomplished that goal in April, 1988, after 
flying from Orange County to Bedford, Mass. He broke another record by flying 
back, becoming the youngest pilot to traverse the country in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
The very day that he returned home from that adventure, Tony announced that he 
wanted to fly round the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bouts With Airsickness 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, a real estate investor and longtime flying enthusiast, remembers 
shaking his head in doubt. After all, several bouts with airsickness had 
plagued Tony on his bicoastal U.S. flight, and he was only minimally trained in 
instrument flying, a necessity for a round-the-world flight through varying 
weather patterns. 
</P>
<P>
But Aliengena did not say no. Instead, he presented this challenge to the 
youngster: "I said that if he could figure out a real good project, then we 
would support him." 
</P>
<P>
Tony did. In May, he penned a letter to Gorbachev, proposing the idea of a 
friendship flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I will try to learn some Russian words, so I can talk to you if I meet you," 
Tony said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
To show support for his son's letter, Aliengena sent one of his own to the 
Soviet leader. In the letter, he implored Gorbachev to approve the trip, in 
part because "I feel that the children of today are our leaders of tomorrow, 
and that if we can help bring the leaders of tomorrow closer today, we have 
accomplished a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
Tony heard back from his letter nearly 6 months later, when the Foundation for 
Social Inventions -- an arm of the Soviet newspaper Pravda -- let the Aliengena 
family know that the Soviet Union supports the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is of great interest and importance for us," a letter from the 
Soviet foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permission for Soviet Flight 
</P>
<P>
In January, an exhilarated Aliengena flew to Moscow to try working out details 
for the trip. Aliengena, most importantly, wanted to obtain permission to fly 
across the entire country, not just to Moscow, as the letter had stated. He 
noted that because the Cessna has a flight range of just 1,500 miles, it would 
be difficult -- if not impossible -- to try crossing the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The only other way to fly round the world, he added, is to go through the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After encountering some bureaucratic delays, Aliengena finally met with Victor 
Shumsky, Soviet head of European-U.S. relations. In fluent English, Shumsky 
said: "We know who you are and we know about your son. You have our permission 
to proceed with this project." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena flew home with the good news, proudly clutching a front-page article 
about him and his son that was published in Pravda during his visit. The 
article heaped praise on Tony, saying: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Article in Pravda 
</P>
<P>
"Tony wants to bring letters from American children . . . many letters of 
friendship and trust, hope and concern. But, what is most important, he wants 
to bring greetings from a generation of Americans who will enter life in 
America tomorrow. It is for them that the summit meetings (between Presidents 
Reagan and Gorbachev) were held. . . . All of that is just the beginning for 
them. They will continue to do what we are doing now for the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Soviet officials who met with Aliengena went home to his 10-year-old 
son that night to say that he had met the father of "the famous" Tony 
Aliengena, Aliengena said. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard of the Soviet boy's excited reaction, Aliengena invited him to 
accompany Tony on the trip. The boy, Muscovite Roma Tcheremnykh, gladly 
accepted, and the two have since become pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
Back in San Juan Capistrano, Aliengena rallied the entire family to begin 
organizing for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 People in Support Crew 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Susan, was placed in charge of obtaining Soviet visas for the 
Aliengena family and for an entourage of press and friends who will fly in a 
separate, twin-engine plane. In all, there will be 11 people along with Tony 
for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, Alaina, 9, was put in charge of the friendship letters and 
scroll, collecting letters and signatures so she can help Tony present them to 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
A family friend, Guy Murrel, a public relations executive, volunteered to help 
with publicity. Murrel soon began handling so many facets of the trip that 
Aliengena made him flight coordinator. As part of that job, Murrel runs 
"Friendship Flight '89," a nonprofit organization set up in El Toro to help 
collect donations for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
The flights of Tony's plane and the twin-engine chase plane will cost an 
estimated $150,000. The Soviet government has already agreed to pay half; 
Aliengena is raising donations to help pay for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anticipating Situations 
</P>
<P>
With most of the details of the trip left to others, Aliengena and his son have 
time to concentrate on basics: namely, making sure that Tony can handle the 
plane through a wide variety of situations. To help do that, they practice at 
Oceanside Airport, where Aliengena's Cessna is parked, at least twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
Watching during one recent session was Ed Fernett, Tony's former flight 
instructor, who will accompany the Friendship Flight as an observer for the 
National Aeronautics Assn., which verifies world records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be quite an adventure," said Fernett, who also accompanied Tony on 
his cross-country flight. "He's got his work cut out for him. But it's do-able. 
He's one fine pilot. He has some experience that some pilots don't get for 
years." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1 1/2-hour practice flight, Aliengena was unrelenting as an 
instructor, critiquing Tony's every move. Though this clearly rankled the young 
pilot -- as was expressed in good-natured banter back and forth -- Aliengena 
said it was necessary to keep Tony from becoming dangerously overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Training Sessions 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Tony complained that his father's instructions contributed to one 
fairly rough landing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wouldn't talk to me, I could do it," Tony said. 
</P>
<P>
"I get nervous," his father replied good-naturedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad, can you just be quiet for one landing?" the boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 16, I won't talk," father answered. 
</P>
<P>
Father and son stopped bickering long enough to enjoy a sunset from their 
aerial vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we were going to Mexico fishing, Dad," Tony said softly as the two 
drank in the magnificent sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, well, we just don't have the time right now," his father answered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Send Pen Pal Letter to Soviet Child 
</P>
<P>
Any child wishing to send a pen pal letter to a child in the Soviet Union can 
mail it to Tony Aliengena's school, and he will deliver it during his 
round-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
Each letter should be sent with a return address on the envelope and include a 
self-addressed envelope to simplify the return process. The letters should be 
limited to one page and can include a photo. 
</P>
<P>
To send a pen pal letter, first write on the envelope whether it is intended 
for a boy or a girl and the preferred age of the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Then write: Friendship Flight '89, St. Margaret's School Episcopal, 31641 La 
Novia Ave., San Juan Capistrano 92675. The letters will not be opened. 
</P>
<P>
Questions, comments or donations can be sent to: Friendship Flight '89, 
Children's Center for International Relations, 22691 Lambert St., Suite 503, El 
Toro 92630. 
</P>
<P>
This nonprofit organization has been established to help pay for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

TEEN KILLED IN CRASH DURING POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old Santa Ana boy riding in the back of a stolen pickup that was 
being chased by police was killed instantly when the vehicle flew off 
Interstate 5 at Oceanside and crashed into an apartment parking lot 75 feet 
below the freeway, police reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Three other minors in the truck were injured, one of them critically, in the 
crash late Saturday night after a 35-mile, two-county chase by Irvine patrol 
cars, a Costa Mesa police helicopter and California Highway Patrol units. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, traveling at speeds exceeding 95 m.p.h., swerved through traffic on 
the busy freeway, sometimes using the right-hand shoulder to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The dead teen-ager was identified by the San Diego County coroner's office as 
Enrique Solario. He died of head injuries, coroner's officials said. The office 
said the other youths in the pickup were between the ages of 14 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
The truck went over the side of the freeway between Mission Avenue and 
Oceanside Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police said they received a call shortly after 9 p.m. Saturday from a 
woman who reported that people in a truck and car were either trying to 
burglarize her automobile or steal it from the front of her Irvine home. 
</P>
<P>
Officers spotted the truck and the late model Toyota going north on Culver 
Drive near Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the car, which had also been stolen, turned right on Walnut Avenue 
and sped down the street and into Heritage Park, where it crashed into an 
abutment. 
</P>
<P>
Two teen-agers were arrested on suspicion of car theft. 
</P>
<P>
The truck continued north on Culver and onto I-5, with two Irvine police patrol 
cars after it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
95 M.P.H. on Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Officers reported that the truck maintained a speed of at least 95 m.p.h. on 
the freeway through Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Saddleback Valley, San Clemente, 
Camp Pendleton and into Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's Eagle 3 police helicopter was called on in the chase but had to 
turn back because of low clouds and fog. 
</P>
<P>
Before the chase entered Oceanside, the Irvine patrol cars pulled back and were 
replaced by CHP units. 
</P>
<P>
The injured youngsters were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, the 
CHP said. The driver of the stolen truck was in critical condition.

SHORTAGE OF $4,000 AT GW COLLEGE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golden West College officials have determined that at least $4,000 in college 
funds are missing and have asked the Huntington Beach Police Department to 
investigate for possible fraud. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Renley, vice chancellor for human resources of Coast Community College 
District, which governs Golden West, said Sunday that the missing funds are 
from weekend swap-meet receipts at the 2-year Huntington Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
The college, which is situated at Golden West and Edinger streets, rents 
parking lot space to swap meet vendors on Saturdays and Sundays, and the 
rentals bring in about $250,000 a year, Renley said. He said it may be 
determined that the $4,000 shortfall is actually more as the investigation, 
which is in the early stages, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met With Police 
</P>
<P>
"I met with Huntington Beach police last Friday, and they need additional 
material that I will be giving their fraud investigators on Monday," Renley 
said. He added that the college district also will continue its own 
investigation of the financial discrepancy at the school, which has an 
enrollment of 14,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Renley said that Gary Sperling, an associate dean at Golden West College and 
the administrator in charge of the swap-meet program and other community 
service activities, was put on paid administrative leave March 17, the day 
after tipsters told college officials something was amiss with swap-meet funds. 
</P>
<P>
Sperling could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Renley stressed that 
Sperling is not being accused of anything and that putting him on paid leave 
was an administrative move while an investigation took place. 
</P>
<P>
Renley said the college district's initial probe has determined "that funds are 
missing, and we don't know if it's an accounting or a clerical error." The 
$4,000 specifically unaccounted for are swap-meet funds for the month of 
February, Renley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone came to the district office (in Costa Mesa) on March 16 and talked to 
one of our officials and indicated there was a discrepancy in some of the funds 
from swap meets," Renley said. 
</P>
<P>
Renley said the initial investigation centered on the months of December, 
January and February. He said that the probe found an apparent excess of $2,000 
from swap meets logged in December, and an apparent shortage of $2,000 from the 
swap meets in January. The February receipts showed an apparent shortage of 
$4,000, Renley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The accounting system is not working," Renley said, referring to the 
discrepancies found on the books for those 3 months. "We will now be looking 
into the records for the past 2 years." 
</P>
<P>
Renley said he did not know how long it will take for an investigation to be 
completed. "We'd like to get this resolved pretty soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Renley said information about the fund discrepancies was given to Coast 
Community College District trustees at their meeting Wednesday. The trustees, 
through the college district headquarters in Costa Mesa, govern Golden West and 
two other community colleges.

$50 BREAST X-RAYS AVAILABLE THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Cancer Society will offer mammograms at the reduced rate of $50 
for about 2 weeks beginning next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, these breast X-rays, which can detect cancers before they can be felt, 
cost from $150 to $250, society officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the special reduced rate, a woman must be at least 35 years old, 
not have any symptoms of breast cancer, and not be pregnant or nursing a child. 
She also must meet several other health criteria, society officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 4 p.m. Sunday and running from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. from next Monday 
through April 30, women may call a special phone bank to request an information 
packet that lists the facilities offering the mammograms. The number is (714) 
772-8200. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the American Cancer Society, hospitals and radiology facilities 
around Southern California provided 25,000 mammograms at $50 each and 
identified more than 650 women needing further tests for possible breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Tash Sogg, the society's Orange County spokeswoman, said: "The goal is to 
provide low-cost mammograms to at least 75,000 Southern California women and to 
save lives, since breast cancer is almost 95% curable if discovered in its 
earliest stages." 
</P>
<P>
For more information on breast health, women may telephone the American Cancer 
Society's Orange County chapter at (714) 751-0441.

POSTSCRIPT: TRANSPLANTS NO LONGER MAKE HEARTS SKIP A BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Orange County's first heart transplant programs began last year, the news 
was splashed across the front pages of local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
And when the first two transplant candidates emerged from their germ-free 
isolation rooms, they became instant celebrities as, fighting tears or making 
jokes at bedside press conferences, they exulted in their new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a crimson T-shirt bearing the message "And the Beat Goes On," the 
county's first heart transplant recipient, Scott Headding, 26, of Huntington 
Beach, talked eagerly of plans to get back to fishing and playing the electric 
guitar. Headding had the surgery at UCI Medical Center last April 8. 
</P>
<P>
The county's second transplant recipient, physician Norton Humphreys, 58, said 
he thought at first that his surgery "would be like putting a new engine in an 
old car, but it hasn't worked out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, said Humphreys, who received his new heart last April 20 at Hoag 
Hospital, "I feel better than I have in a year." 
</P>
<P>
But 1 year later, heart transplants no longer grab front-page headlines. Heart 
transplants in the county are treated almost as routinely as kidney and 
bone-marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag in Newport Beach has transplanted donor hearts into eight people, seven of 
whom survived. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center in Orange has had six transplants, with three of the five 
patients still living. (Headding needed a second heart, then died after that 
second major operation after what his surgeon called "a very courageous 
battle.") 
</P>
<P>
Neither hospital has performed the 12 transplants a year that the United 
Network for Organ Sharing, a membership organization for transplant centers 
based in Richmond, Va., recommends for keeping a transplant team's skills 
finely tuned. United Network also sets a standard of a 73% survival rate, which 
Hoag has bettered but UCI falls below. 
</P>
<P>
However, United Network spokeswoman Kelly Straw noted that the recommendations 
are guidelines. Given the national shortage of donor hearts, not all transplant 
programs can meet them. 
</P>
<P>
Both county transplant programs will be formally reviewed at the end of their 
second year, said Robert T. Turner, a United Network manager. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, both Hoag and UCI had seemed in a race to perform the first 
transplant. But these days, the edge on the competition is gone. 
</P>
<P>
At Hoag, transplant surgeon Aiden Raney and cardiac surgeon Douglas R. Zusman 
"do not look at competition," Zusman said. "Our feeling is (that) centers who 
can do high-quality transplants should be allowed to do them." 
</P>
<P>
Both Hoag and UCI are doing more than transplants. Both centers have increased 
all open-heart surgeries, with 250 last year at Hoag and 61 at UCI. And since 
November, UCI has been one of 20 U.S. hospitals allowed to implant an 
experimental "ventricular assist device" that acts as an artificial heart, 
keeping patients who might need a transplant alive. Hoag expects to offer the 
VAD technology within the month. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag also offers a support program for transplant patients. Twice a month, 20 
to 40 heart recipients or potential recipients meet in a hospital conference 
room for low-fat snacks and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"They show each other their scars . . . they alleviate the fears" of undergoing 
a transplant, coordinator Mary Jane Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
A leader in the group has been Hoag's first transplant recipient, Humphreys. 
"They laughingly call me their poster boy," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Humphreys was bedridden and dying of degenerative heart disease when the 
transplant gave him new life. Now, at 59, he has taken to the lecture circuit 
to describe the medical miracle of his survival. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery exacted a price, however. "When you get a transplant, there's no 
free lunch," Humphreys said. "You trade dying for rather intensive medical care 
for the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
UCI has a parallel to Humphries: its second transplant patient, Gene Reynolds, 
45, who skis, plays golf, walks 5 miles a day and is back at work as a Pacific 
Bell customer service manager. Reynolds has counseled nine transplant 
candidates and their families and has arranged to be called to the hospital the 
night of a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
All the volunteer work is a small pay-back to the medical center, Reynolds 
said, for the miracle of his transplant. He said a transplant is "very scary," 
but having been through one, he knows firsthand that this is a "very viable 
alternative to death."

GUNMAN SURRENDERS AFTER 6-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A distraught man who was apparently upset with his wife held Orange city police 
at bay for more than 6 hours Sunday before giving up his revolver and 
surrendering, police said. The couple's two small children were with him in the 
house, but no one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said Robert Stark Jr., 24, was held on a charge of child endangerment 
after he surrendered late Sunday morning. The children were temporarily placed 
in Orangewood, a county facility for children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's wife Carol, 22, had returned to their East Washington Avenue apartment 
to find that her husband had locked her out. She went to a neighbor's apartment 
and called him on the telephone, police said, and Stark told his wife that he 
was going to kill her and himself. 
</P>
<P>
She called Orange police, who deployed a Special Emergency Response Team, which 
is designed to cope with hostage and barricade situations. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 5 hours, team members negotiated with Stark, who finally placed his 
revolver in the hallway outside the apartment and surrendered with the two 
children, a boy 2 years old and a 1-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have never hurt those kids," a neighbor who would not identify 
himself said of Stark. "That would be the last thing in the world he would do." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said a baby-sitter was watching the children Saturday night. Stark 
returned about 10 p.m. and appeared distraught over the whereabouts of his 
wife. The baby-sitter told police that Stark had waved a revolver around. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, police heard a shot come from the apartment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Several occupants of the apartment complex were evacuated.

SELLING TO A GROWING MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
HISPANIC AND BLACK BUSINESSMEN TARGET ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 5 sleepy years, the Black Business Alliance of Orange County has come 
alive, increasing membership from a stagnant 50 to nearly 225, and completing 
the county's first private business incubator for black small business, the 
Center for Business Excellence in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The center is a privately funded 2-story, 3,300-square-foot office complex in 
Santa Ana where small businesses can rent office space and share a central 
reception area, conference room, meeting room, kitchenette and off-street 
parking. Rents range from $195 to $525 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williamson, a 45-year-old commercial real estate specialist, heads up the 
changing organization. While other minority business communities are able to 
grow as Orange County's minority population grows, the black business community 
has no such luxury. 
</P>
<P>
As Williamson points out, "There's no real 'black business' to go after or 
target in Orange County." His organization is dedicated to helping its members 
reach the mainstream, because they have no alternative if they are going to 
thrive here. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson has a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Southern 
California. He recently discussed small business and minority business trends 
with Times staff writer Maria L. La Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Black Business Alliance of Orange County has been around for about 5 
years, but it has taken until 1989 for the group to really accomplish much. 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Williamson: It's been, not really dormant, just service-oriented at a different 
level. Until now, it involved itself in different community activities, a lot 
of programs geared toward making it easier for a minority business person to 
get started. Workshops, seminars. We still do a lot of that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The organization just opened its Center for Business Excellence. What was 
the thinking behind that? 
</P>
<P>
A. After a million workshops and seminars and meetings, I guess it was 
discovered that there were two basic things that interfered with a lot of 
minority businesses getting into the mainstream. One was housing. A lot of 
minority businesses had problems getting adequate housing for their businesses. 
I guess this is when this concept came together. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When did you start raising money to open this center? 
</P>
<P>
A. Probably back in September, through January. Surprisingly, we raised close 
to $250,000 from our membership solely. That's an average of $1,000 apiece. We 
found out that there are a lot of black business people out here that are 
really doing very well and are just quietly hidden away in the woodwork all 
over the county. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are you offering in your new center that black businesses can't get 
elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
A. A camaraderie that can't be found somewhere else. Basically, the center is 
for those who are now working in their garages, out of post office boxes, out 
of their briefcases, out of cars. It's a step up on the way to getting into a 
real professional office environment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The center has been around for about a month, but it's only one-third full. 
Why have you filled only 10 of the 30 office spaces you have to offer? 
</P>
<P>
A. For any small business person getting started, this is a big transition to 
step into an environment where you really need to make more of a commitment to 
being there, to paying rent. So we're seeing some reluctance at first. For 
someone who's working out of a briefcase and doing OK, it's a great big step to 
go to your own office. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What businesses have moved into the center so far? 
</P>
<P>
A. Engineering firms, management consulting firms, a janitorial service, a ham 
operator's school, we've got a secretarial service and the Tri-County Bulletin, 
which is the only black newspaper servicing the Orange County area. There are 
10 who have signed leases and about 10 or 12 that have put down deposits. We 
should be filled up in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One of the problems most small businesses have is financing at the 
beginning. What is your organization doing to address that issue? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's the second major problem we found, after getting adequate housing for 
a business. We are definitely going to provide funding and financing. We've 
been so successful with raising the funds for our facility here that right now 
it looks like we might be able to do (it) through the membership. Some of the 
businesses are a little bit more profitable. We'd try pooling funds. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Like Korean kyes, the fund pools whereby all the members put in, say, $1,000 
a month, and each member gets to take it out once and invest it in his 
business? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, not exactly that but something similar. Maybe not taking turns taking 
it out, probably just making it available to those who need it most. Those with 
ideas and business plans and desire but no ability to get the funds from a 
regular institution. There's not enough money to go around. Qualifying is a 
problem for a lot of entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there a black owned-and-operated bank in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. There is no black bank here. There is in L.A. But there will be a black 
bank in Orange County. We're working on it right now. We're looking at sometime 
in 1990. But then, you don't really have a black anything in Orange County. You 
don't have a black residential neighborhood, a black business district, there's 
no black anything. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is Orange County like for a minority business to do business in? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know about a minority business per se. Orange County is great for 
businesses in general and most of the businesses that are here are thriving and 
doing real well. I really haven't found a great big difference between 
so-called minority business and any other small business. We just happen to be 
black, geared toward black minority businesses. I'm sure that the problems are 
the same with any minority business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do minority businesses find that they do best when they operate in an area 
where there is a large foundation of the population or special interest group 
which they represent? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, not necessarily. Not unless they cater to that group of people. With any 
business, you want to have your target market and you want to work it. And it 
may be the same ethnic group, or it may be a market that's very, very 
different. In Orange County, it's pretty hard to target a black group. Where 
are they? I haven't found them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Orange County's black population in recent years has been dropping. In 1980, 
it was 1.3% of the county. In 1985 it was down to 1%. Does that make it more 
difficult to do business here? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, but it makes it different from the way other minority business 
communities do business. That 1% is pretty scattered. It's not like the black 
community you'd find in other cities in the United States. You can't be geared 
toward doing business with other blacks. You've got to deal with the open 
market. You have to be out there in the mainstream, which is pretty much what 
all small businesses are doing. You've got a large Hispanic population here, so 
I imagine that a lot of them are just working with Hispanics. With almost 
anybody else, especially in Santa Ana or anywhere near it, you have to deal 
with whoever is out there. And I guess that's what's going on with us. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there any specific line of business that a majority of your members are 
in? Manufacturing, service industries? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. We do whatever you could do to make money. We've got a lot of black 
entrepreneurs who transferred into Orange County with Xerox or Hughes or TRW 
and are setting up their own engineering and computer firms. A lot of that is 
going on right now. They're in a market where they've always dealt with the 
mainstream in their corporate employment. Now they're making a change. In the 
past, it was basically black-oriented businesses. There were a lot of barber 
shops, beauty salons, black restaurants. That's gone. Now you've got 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is that where most of the Black Business Alliance's growth is coming from? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. They transferred in and they like Orange County. They don't like 
climbing the corporate ladder, and they want to do their own thing their own 
way. Santa Ana is really booming and really fruitful. This is a great place to 
get started with a new business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the best thing about being a black business owner in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. There's opportunity in Orange County that I don't believe you'd find too 
many other places, just with the general economy doing as well as it is.

CBS PLANS MINISERIES ON NUSSBAUM OF STEINBERG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CARMODY, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS Entertainment has set itself the task of making a 4-hour miniseries out of 
one of the more unattractive stories of the decade: how Hedda Nussbaum, a 
onetime book editor, came under the thrall of a disbarred New York lawyer Joel 
Steinberg, endured 11 years of beatings at his hands and stood by while he 
fatally beat the couple's illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
A murder charge against Nussbaum was dropped in exchange for her testimony 
against Steinberg, 47, who is serving an 8- to 25-year prison term for the 
fatal beating of Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was arranged by CBS News' "West 57th" executive producer, Andrew Lack, 
and Nussbaum's attorney, Barry Sheck. Lack will produce the movie for the CBS 
Entertainment division, part of the deal he made with CBS News recently when he 
signed a new contract after being courted by NBC News 
</P>
<P>
A source at CBS Entertainment said Friday that the miniseries could be ready 
sometime late in the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS sources said Friday the network paid "considerably less" than $100,000 for 
the deal, which includes access to hundreds of pages of personal diaries 
Nussbaum has kept since she was 15. 
</P>
<P>
Nussbaum, 46, is a patient at a Westchester, N.Y., psychiatric hospital. She is 
scheduled to be released soon and reportedly has been looking for a furnished 
apartment near the hospital. Steinberg is appealing his first-degree 
manslaughter conviction. He was sentenced 3 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the diaries, Lack told the New York Daily News, "there's an 
enormous amount of material she has kept as a result of her legal and medical 
problems that's going to be the basis for much of the story I hope to tell. I 
want it to be an honest and compelling account of who this woman is and what 
happened to her." 
</P>
<P>
In 7 days of testimony at the trial, Nussbaum related how Steinberg would 
punish her by forcing her to beg for food, sleep on the floor and take ice 
water baths. She suffered 16 broken ribs and injuries to virtually every part 
of her body during the 11 years of the relationship, which ended Nov. 2, 1987, 
when Lisa was found unconscious in the couple's Greenwich Village apartment. 
</P>
<P>
NBC reportedly had been "active" in trying to secure rights to Nussbaum's 
story. An ABC spokesman Friday would not comment on whether his network was 
planning a dramatization of the case, or on reports that ABC would make its own 
miniseries based on Susan Brownmiller's "Waverly Place," a novel loosely based 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
One big question remains for CBS Entertainment: how to promote such an 
unpleasant 4 hours of TV. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shanks, a veteran U.S. producer and writer, took over Sunday as executive 
managing director of Channel 10 in Australia, one of three privately owned 
national channels Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
Shanks has signed a 3-year contract with the Sydney-based TV channel, owned by 
Frank Lowy, for a job equivalent to president and chief executive officer in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Shanks served as creator and executive producer of CBS's "The Morning 
Program," starring Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, which debuted in January 
but was replaced in late November of that year by "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Shanks, who previously served as an executive vice president at ABC for six 
years, helped create both "Good Morning America" and "20-20" for that network. 
Most recently, he wrote four made-for-TV movies for CBS Entertainment, which 
were co-produced by his wife, Ann Shanks, as well as two PBS specials.

THE SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY PERFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blame the earthquake for a sparse turnout at the Newport Harbor Art Museum on 
Saturday night. Those few without fear of aftershocks were rewarded with string 
playing of a high order from members of the Southwest Chamber Music Society. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious and adventurous program provided tremors of a musical sort in 
Wuorinen's String Quartet No. 3 (1987). This knotty yet cohesive work may well 
daunt those accustomed to a modern diet of saccharine minimalism. It may have 
daunted the players a bit too, from the look of it: Erstwhile horn player Jeff 
von der Schmidt essayed the role of conductor. 
</P>
<P>
But from the sound of it, violinists Jacqueline Brand and Kimiyo Takeya, 
violist Jan Karlin and cellist Richard Treat played with far more confidence 
with Schmidt directing. 
</P>
<P>
Having received its Los Angeles premiere Friday night in a Pasadena performance 
by the same forces, the single-movement work makes demands on the listener 
nearly as great as on the players. Based on a Gregorian chant, the 
non-programatic work moves quickly from a fireball opening to a passage where 
the notes of the chant are compressed into a cluster. 
</P>
<P>
The gradual emergence of the chant proper is the key event around which the 
other parts of the piece turn. The thickets of notes, in what is overall a slow 
movement that rarely pauses, can tire even the dedicated listener. But clearly 
the players had both the technical resources and the commitment to do the work 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Loosed from modern terrors, the quartet took flight in an exuberant reading of 
Ravel's Quartet in F. 
</P>
<P>
Brand's sweet sound literally set the tone for an opening movement of surging 
climaxes and suave interplay. The scherzo brought brief lapses of intonation 
and ensemble but emerged with its spirit intact. 
</P>
<P>
Minus Brand, the remaining trio opened the proceedings with a stimulating 
reading of Peter Warlock's arrangement of Three Fantasias by Henry Purcell.

A man dressed in an army uniform opened fire with an Israeli-made Uzi 
submachine gun today outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, killing one 
Palestinian and wounding three other Arabs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Army Radio said the assailant fled into the nearby Mamilla quarter, a 
deserted area of abandoned buildings scheduled for demolition. Jerusalem 
District Police Cmdr. Josef Yehudi said the motive for the shootings was not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Yehudi said that shortly before 8 p.m. the gunman, wearing what appeared to be 
an old army uniform, started firing near the Jaffa Gate of the Old City. One 
passer-by also fired during the incident.

As the slick of thick crude oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez stalled today in

it planned to repay the government for the military's expenses, but would 
deduct it from its income taxes.

"We're anticipating the costs incurred by the government at all levels will be 
eventually reimbursed by Exxon," said Don Cornett, the company's top Alaska

from your income tax and that is how it is expressed to customers."

As of Monday, 18,000 barrels of crude have been recovered, or 8% of the 240,000

Unions at Eastern Airlines and a management group headed by former baseball 
commissioner Peter Ueberroth have reached agreements that would remove a major 
obstacle to the sale of the strikebound carrier, a labor source said today. 
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal announcement 
would be made later today before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New 
York. Lifland must approve any sale of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland began a closed meeting with the principals at mid-day in bankruptcy 
court but there was no immediate word on the progress of the talks, which have 
been held under a news blackout. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth and his group have been seeking more than $200 million in concessions 
from three unions and Eastern's non-contract employees, but there was no 
immediate word on what, if any, pay-backs are contained in the tentative 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
The source declined to discuss the agreements further. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement followed a weekend of secret talks in Washington 
between the unions and representatives of Ueberroth, who last week reached 
agreement to buy Eastern from Texas Air Corp. for $464 million. Ueberroth could 
have called off the deal if agreements were not reached with the unions by 
midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Sell Eastern Shuttle 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth has said he will go ahead with plans to sell the lucrative Eastern 
Shuttle to New York developer Donald Trump for $365 million. 
</P>
<P>
The unions involved are the International Assn. of Machinists, the Air Line 
Pilots Assn. and the Transport Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
The IAM struck Eastern on March 4 after refusing to accept more than $120 
million in wage and other concessions demanded by Texas Air, Eastern's parent 
company. The other unions have accepted concessions in the past, but honored 
IAM's picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The unions brought Eastern operations to a virtual halt, and the airline filed 
for protection under the bankruptcy laws on March 9, five days after the 
walkout began. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern since the strike has been seeking court orders requiring the pilots to 
return to work. A federal district judge in Miami was scheduled to issue a 
ruling on the request today, but his office said the judge had granted a 
request from Eastern and the pilots union that he not issue the decision today. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend talks were held under the guidance of attorney David Shapiro, who 
is serving as court-appointed examiner of the airline under an order issued by 
the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
While union officials said they believed they could come to terms with the 
Ueberroth group, they expressed concerns about its plans for the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials also questioned statements by Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo 
that Eastern could be operating within 24 hours of completion of the sale to 
Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has been flying a skeleton schedule since the IAM walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from two of the unions, noting that the majority of Eastern's planes 
have been grounded for more than a month, said it would take some time to 
inspect them.

NO DISPARAGING REAGAN, SUNUNU WARNS

<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, reflecting President Bush's anger, 
has warned aides against "bad-mouthing" former President Ronald Reagan, a 
spokesman acknowledged today. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy apparently was touched off by complaints from former President 
Richard M. Nixon. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who also was 
spokesman under Reagan, was obviously angered in discussing the matter with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, who at one point accused a journalist of fabricating quotations, 
said Sununu had noted a report that some staffers were making disparaging 
remarks about Reagan and had cautioned them, "Don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
One source was quoted as saying "Reagan would still be asleep" at 7 a.m., when 
Bush typically arrives at the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed the concern of Bush and Sununu in responding to an 
article by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, which said 
Nixon "was so disturbed by what he read about Reagan-trashing inside the White 
House he fired off a protest" to Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was incensed, the columnists wrote, by a report from Knight-Ridder 
newspapers White House correspondent Owen Ullman that said Bush aides were 
depicting Reagan "as a dunce and making unflattering comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater today would not confirm any protest by Nixon but said, "The staff was 
told if (Ullman's) story is correct it's not helpful." He added that anyone who 
would ridicule Reagan should not be working in the White House under the man 
who was Reagan's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anybody who has been bad-mouthing Reagan," Fitzwater argued, 
accusing Ullman of "making up the quotes. It's a silly story. I don't know if 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ullman, who was present at the briefing in the White House press room, shot 
back immediately that Fitzwater was challenging his "integrity." The spokesman 
responded, "In that case I apologize. I just disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Ullman later told fellow reporters that he did not want to comment further but 
said, "Everyone here knows I don't make up quotes." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon reportedly told Sununu that the source of Ullman's report should be fired 
as an example to other staffers tempted "to play the same game." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater called the reports "irrelevant" but emphasized, "President Bush would 
not want any idea to prevail (that) this is going on. . . . We take it 
seriously in human terms." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added: "In my opinion, history will treat (Reagan) as one of the 
greatest Presidents ever. Everyone here certainly believes that."

The PLO today rejected Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal to hold 
elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it was a 
warmed-over version of the Camp David Accords. 
</P>
<P>
In its first reaction to Shamir's plan, the Palestine Liberation Organization 
said any elections in the territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East 
war should be held after Israeli withdrawal and under international 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir unveiled his election ideas in Washington last week as a way of breaking 
a deadlock in Middle East peace efforts.

A short-circuit apparently caused a fire that led to the deaths of 42 crew 
members of a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine off the Norwegian coast, Izvestia 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper also revealed that four of the victims died aboard the 
submarine when it caught fire and sank Friday. The rest apparently drowned. 
Twenty-nine were rescued from Arctic waters, but two died later. 
</P>
<P>
"According to provisional data, the fire started as a result of an electrical 
short-circuit," Sergei Vargin, head of the political department of the Soviet 
Northern Fleet, told Izvestia. "It started when the submarine was returning 
from a distant voyage and was sailing under water. When the accident happened, 
the submarine surfaced." 
</P>
<P>
No radioactive contamination occurred, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov 
said.

<P>
Three London tabloids published front-page headlines today speculating about a 
possible divorce for Princess Anne after disclosures about personal letters to 
her from a handsome young royal aide. 
</P>
<P>
"Can This Marriage Be Saved?" asked the Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
"Anne Divorce Crisis At Palace," said Today. 
</P>
<P>
"Royal Marriage Crisis," headlined the Daily Mirror, over a picture of the 
princess in a riding habit, titled: "ANNE. Sad, Shattered, Alone." 
</P>
<P>
The banner headlines were provoked by a Buckingham Palace statement Saturday 
that four letters to the princess that had come into the hands of another 
tabloid, the Sun, were written by the queen's bachelor equerry, Royal Navy 
Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, 34. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were stolen inside Buckingham Palace, where the princess has an 
apartment she sometimes uses. She lives with her husband, former army Capt. 
Mark Phillips, at Gatcombe Park in western England. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun said the letters were delivered to its offices anonymously. It did not 
publish the letters and said it gave them to Scotland Yard. The Yard said it 
was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was publicly known of the content of the letters, but the Sunday Mirror 
claimed to know that they were of "an extremely personal and intimate nature" 
and "too hot to handle." 
</P>
<P>
The princess smiled broadly as she began a hectic round of public engagements 
today by opening a new factory near Manchester in northern England. She did not 
comment on the press reports. 
</P>
<P>
Anne, 38, is seventh in line to the throne and has been married to Phillips, 
40, since 1973. They have two children.

Abortion rights activists lobbied on Capitol Hill today as their leaders 
predicted that the massive turnout for their march will leave a strong 
impression on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of activists who took part in Sunday's march got some quick lessons in 
congressional lobbying and then made their way to the offices of their local 
representative or senator to press their case. 
</P>
<P>
While law enforcement authorities estimated the Sunday rally crowd at 300,000, 
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said the 
turnout was more than 600,000. Either way, the turnout was higher than the 
90,000 people who gathered for a March, 1986, abortion rights rally in 
Washington and the number that the rally's organizers had predicted.

Asiana Airlines, a new South Korean carrier, today announced a deal worth about 
$1 billion to buy nine Boeing Co. jets and take options on seven more. 
</P>
<P>
Asiana officials said the airline, which began domestic flights in December and 
eventually plans North American service, did not want to purchase used aircraft 
because of high maintenance costs and uncertain reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying or leasing 
older planes," said S. Y. Park, chairman of Kumho Business Group, Asiana's 
parent company. "However, a new airline has enough problems establishing its 
market base without the burden of heavy maintenance responsibilities and the 
uncertainty of whether older planes will perform reliably." 
</P>
<P>
Asiana ordered two 747-400 jumbo jets from Seattle-based Boeing and took 
options for two more, and ordered five 737-400s and took options for another 
five. In addition, it converted two previous options for wide-body 767-300s to 
firm orders.

3 DEFENDANTS 'KNEW' OF PENTAGON BRIBERY;

Three California businessmen charged in the Pentagon corruption scandal "knew 
more than they wanted to admit they knew" about a scheme to bribe a Navy 
engineer, a prosecutor told a jury today. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, all former executive vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of 
Newbury Park, Calif., are accused of conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud in the 
first trial stemming from the government's nearly 3-year-old investigation of 
kickbacks and bribery in the Pentagon's purchasing system. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jack Hanly said in his closing argument that the 
defendants -- Eugene Sullivan, George Kaub and Dale Schnittjer -- were aware 
that a private consultant they had hired was paying bribes to obtain 
information about a lucrative radar contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$24-Million Contract 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Mark Tuohey, representing Kaub, tried to pick apart the 
government's case by pointing out that the main witnesses had pleaded guilty in 
exchange for lesser sentences and were cooperating with the government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams was to explain the charges to the jury 
before the group of four women and eight men begin their deliberations in the 
trial that began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tuohey said Kaub had no idea that William Parkin, the private consultant hired 
by Teledyne Electronics, had paid money to Stuart Berlin, a Navy engineer, for 
details about a $24-million contract that Teledyne won to make hand-held radar 
sets. Parkin and Berlin are among those who pleaded guilty in exchange for 
helping the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Motive . . . to Save Skin' 
</P>
<P>
The government's witnesses had "every motive in the world to save their skin," 
Tuohey argued. "Each came into the courtroom under immunity promising to 
cooperate with the prosecution with a hammer over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuohey said his client was in the dark, a victim of a conspiracy between 
Parkin, Berlin and two other men. Their only motive was "to get everything you 
can and don't tell anybody about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Hanly said of the defendants, "They knew more than they wanted 
to admit they knew." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the jury heard tape-recorded conversations between Parkin and 
the defendants obtained from wiretaps.

ROSENBACH WILL BYPASS REGULAR DRAFT

Timm Rosenbach of Washington State, the nation's leading passer last season, 
will pass up the NFL's regular draft to take his chances on a supplemental 
draft in early summer. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach's agent, Gary Wichard, said today that he made the decision so that 
the fourth-year junior would be treated -- and paid -- like a No. 1 draft 
choice "rather than a guy taken sixth or seventh, depending on how things 
fall." 
</P>
<P>
Today is the deadline for players who still have eligibility remaining to 
declare themselves for the April 23 draft. If they do not, they are 
automatically excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach, who completed 67% of his passes and threw for 2,791 yards with 24 
touchdowns and just 10 interceptions in 1988, is one of two prime junior 
quarterbacks who have decided to turn pro this year. The other, Miami's Steve 
Walsh, also is expected to bypass the regular draft. 
</P>
<P>
For Rosenbach, the beauty of the supplemental is clearly in the money -- with 
UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman sure to be the No. 1 pick, Rosenbach's value might 
be diminished by the NFL's "slotting" system of salaries in which salaries go 
down with each pick.

CZECHS ALLOW IVAN LENDL TO EMIGRATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities have ended their impasse with tennis star Ivan Lendl by granting 
his request to legally emigrate from the country, Rude Pravo, the Communist 
party daily, said today. 
</P>
<P>
The move apparently clears the way for Lendl to end his refusal to represent 
Czechoslovakia in such international matches as the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, lives in Greenwich, Conn., and has refused to 
represent Czechoslovakia in international matches for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Czechoslovak Davis Cup Coach Frantisek Pala made a 
last-minute attempt to persuade Lendl to return to the team when 
Czechoslovakia's No. 1 player, Miloslav Mecir, was unable to play because of a 
back injury in Czechoslovakia's Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal against West 
Germany last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, led by Boris Becker, won the best-of-five-matches competition 
3-2, capturing the final two matches on Sunday. (Story, Part III, Page 17.) 
</P>
<P>
"Lendl informed him (Pala) that his request for an emigre passport has not been 
granted yet," the Mlada Fronta daily said last week. Therefore Lendl reportedly 
refused Pala's request. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens (the emigre passport is granted), nothing will stand in the 
way for me to play for Czechoslovakia in some of the forthcoming matches," 
Mlada Fronta quoted Lendl as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"His request was recently granted, and he will be issued his emigre passport in 
the next couple of days," Rude Pravo said without further comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Lendl never ceased to be a Czechoslovak citizen," the daily said, "but last 
year he applied for an emigre passport with Czechoslovak citizenship 
remaining."

Black leaders criticized a decision not to give Wade Houston, Tennessee's first 
black head basketball coach, a membership in an all-white country club. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Doug Dickey says Houston, the first black basketball coach in 
the Southeastern conference, will not be offered a membership in Cherokee 
Country Club in Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
"The university needs to take a definite stand on this," state Rep. Joe 
Armstrong said Sunday. "Wade Houston was a member of the country club in 
Louisville as an assistant coach. You mean he's going to come to the University 
of Tennessee and be head coach and not be extended the same privilege?" 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the university should immediately cancel its memberships in the 
exclusive country club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Same Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
Knoxville City Councilman Casey Jones, who became the first black member of the 
Dean Hill Country Club two months ago, said, "I think he should be offered and 
allowed to have the same opportunity as the other coaches that preceded him. If 
UT can do anything to make the situation different, they should." 
</P>
<P>
The university athletic department has provided the $15,000 memberships to the 
exclusive Cherokee Country Club to Houston's predecessors, Ray Mears and Don 
DeVoe. Vols football coach Johnny Majors and Dickey are also members. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Cherokee Country Club does not have black members, and that is not 
an option (for Houston)," Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston said he has no intention of fighting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston said he and his family were members of a country club in 
Louisville, Ky., and said there would be advantages for the university if he 
belonged to the club in Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tremendous advantages for a college basketball coach with a program 
of the magnitude of the University of Tennessee's to have a place to take high 
school coaches who come in and want to play golf, if you can legally do those 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"I was accepted in the club here (Louisville). Everybody wants to monitor the 
membership and have the kind of club they can be proud of. If that happens, 
that's great. If not, I'm not going to make an issue of it."
