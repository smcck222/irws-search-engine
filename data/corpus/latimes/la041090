MOSCOW HAS BAD START II JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly the two superpowers are stumbling again over arms-control numbers. 
Last month President Bush proposed a ban on land-based mobile missiles with 
more than one warhead. Then Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent word to 
Washington last week that he could not bargain away the only big missiles he is 
able to hide and leave America's submarines free to prowl the seas with 
multiple-warhead missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The START II impasse arises out of two very different military traditions. The 
Soviet Union has always viewed intercontinental missiles much like very big 
artillery pieces. Because artillery is based on land, most of the Soviet 
nuclear force is based on land. The U.S. deployment pattern is markedly 
different because the Air Force and the Navy are competing for a piece of the 
nuclear action. The latest proposals of the first START treaty would leave only 
about 10% of U.S. warheads based on land, with the rest deployed on bombers or 
in subs. Under the same plan, Moscow would have more land-based missiles than 
any other kind. 
</P>
<P>
Each generation of submarine missiles is more accurate than the last and 
today's super subs are no easier to find than they ever were. This is a potent 
deterrent to a surprise Soviet attack because it would leave the entire sub 
force available to retaliate. Searching for a similar sense of security, the 
Soviets have begun deploying missiles that can be moved around and hidden on 
land almost as effectively as submarines are at sea. But Trident subs can also 
be first-strike weapons because their new missiles are so accurate they could 
cripple Soviet missiles in their silos. This is what Moscow cannot accept. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fresh climate in Europe and the Soviet Union, Moscow is not going 
to jump at an offer that has a clear bias in Washington's favor. If we want to 
ban multi-warhead land-based missiles because that would favor America, we will 
have to give something to Moscow in return. That much about arms control 
negotiations is not about to change.

MALAYSIAN RAIN FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We take strong exception to the thrust of "Malaysia's Native People Feeling 
Bite of Logger's Ax" (March 19). The article is misleading and over-dramatic, 
and does not give a fair assessment of the role of the timber industry in the 
Sarawak forest or in any other tropical forest. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to recognize that native groups in all regions of the world are 
in time exposed to advanced civilization, and it is an obligation of society to 
make available to those groups the benefits of a higher standard of living. The 
Penan natives of East Malaysia are very small in number, and it is unreasonable 
to assume that they would not be exposed to the outreaches of a more modern 
society whether or not timber harvesting takes place. It is also unfair to 
downplay the economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the International Hardwood Products Assn., we object to this 
misleading slant directed at our industry. Rather, we have taken the initiative 
to promote good forestry practice and have assumed a worldwide leadership 
position to ensure the ongoing preservation of tropical forest regions wherever 
they exist.

MALAYSIAN RAIN FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The connection between people seemingly totally separated by geography, 
culture, language and "development" was excellently portrayed in the series on 
the rain forest of Sarawak. Having made a visit to the Iban people of Borneo 
many years ago I was saddened to see the changes that so-called development has 
brought to their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than that, however, is the effect of destruction of the precious rain 
forest and how it impacts not only on their lives but also on our own. 
</P>
<P>
The realization still has not penetrated our consciousness that as we spew out 
carbon from our automobiles and factories in our industrial societies, we are 
very dependent on those rain forests for giving us the oxygen that sustains us. 
The indigenous people who are the guardians of that rain forest are in reality 
our guardians as well. The linkage is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see more on these vital ecological issues.

FAIR TAXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raymond Ponath in his letter (April 4) expresses a view that is unfortunately 
all too common: the belief that a progressive income tax is the only "fair" way 
to get citizens to pay for government services. This view stems from the idea 
that individuals with high incomes not only can, but should pay higher 
proportions of their incomes in the form of personal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, a progressive income tax is nothing more than a penalty for 
success. If we wished to institute a truly fair system of taxation, everyone 
should pay a flat rate on income earned, say 10%. No deductions, no writeoffs, 
nothing, just 10% right off the top. 
</P>
<P>
People with high incomes are not simply lay-abouts who sit back and wait for 
the money to come rolling in. They tend to be hard-working and highly skilled 
people. Fairness demands that everyone pay an equal share and not differential 
rates simply because they can.

A SHORT TESTIMONY OF ABUSE AND RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON WALKER, Ron Walker manages a restaurant in Sacramento. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was the eldest of four children. By the time I was 7, my parents' divorce was 
finalized. To prevent my father's visits, my mother packed us all up and left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
At first, her abuse was mostly mental. She took great pains to ostracize me 
from the family. I never understood why I was singled out, and I was afraid to 
ask. The physical abuse began when I was 10. In the beginning, it was only 
three or four times a week that she would beat me. After the beatings, she 
would run hot water in the bathtub, add salt and force me to sit in it while I 
was still bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
As the months went by, the beating and torturing turned into a work of art for 
her. She tried several things, including thorny rose branches, a fishing pole, 
a bamboo broom before settling on a white electrical extension cord, which soon 
became red with my blood. By that time, the beatings were daily. I was 11. 
</P>
<P>
My mother always quoted the Bible, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." She 
began starving me and locking me in the closet, alone with only my thoughts and 
imagination. I would dream of killing her. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13, while preparing a composition for school, I came across a 
book on state law with a section on child abuse. I told my school counselors 
that I was being abused. I was then removed from my home and placed in an 
emergency foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Up to then, I didn't know how close to death I was. I weighed 70 pounds; my 
height was only 4 foot 10; my skin tone was no longer brown but gray and 
yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Living with a foster mother was a difficult transition. I was extremely 
introverted, and my outlook on life was very negative. I would always expect 
the worst; that way, I'd never be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
My foster mother stressed that independence and hard work would get what you 
needed from life. By the time I was 15, I was planning my "emancipation" at 18 
and saving money. It was a problem, because I was allowed to have only $999. 
</P>
<P>
Before I left, I received a phone call telling me about the availability of 
food stamps or government assistance. I hated that. My plans were to make it on 
my own without help of any kind. Twelve years later, I'm happy to say I've been 
successful at that.

FOSTER-HOME OVERSIGHT: A CHECKMARK IN EVERY BOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Exposition Park welfare office is on Vermont Avenue, north of Martin Luther 
King Boulevard. There is always a crowd and a sense of chaos held at bay: 
children, some playful, some whining, bored men, haggard women, a babble of 
languages and disasters. It is life, and it is not orderly. 
</P>
<P>
The office of the county's foster homes' licensing unit is one floor up. There, 
it is as if someone has turned off the sound and slowed the frame. The touches 
of lilac paint, the reassuring sturdiness of old-fashioned manual typewriters, 
the lack of windows, which shuts out the view of palm trees but also that of 
decaying houses and the drear of poverty. Heads bend earnestly over the 
paperwork; the civil service is at peace. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Kamoto is a neat person. Her handwriting is even; when she enters her 
car's mileage on official logs, her figures line up. She keeps her pencils in a 
case and erases any mistake before writing over it. The six-page Regulation 
Compliance Checklist for foster homes is clipped within its folder. On house 
calls, she keeps the papers straight, the boxes checked. Order reigns around 
her. 
</P>
<P>
There are 32 licensing officers for the whole of Los Angeles County, and they 
are way behind. It takes months to get to see a new foster home. Beneath the 
unnatural office lights, there is the slow burn of the foot soldier blaming the 
fools at headquarters as he slogs on. "It's been so long since some of the 
folks up there were workers," Kamoto says, "they don't even remember." 
</P>
<P>
There is a space around Kamoto, a fatalism almost, as if life has taught her 
the safety of distance. No husband, no children, and hard, possibly, to work 
for a government that interned your American-born parents in a desert camp. 
"Hatred," she says, "drains a lot of your energy." But so does love. "I do all 
I humanly can," she says, "but no, I don't take it home." 
</P>
<P>
Foster care is a morass: drug-addicted babies, troubled teen-agers, poverty, 
cruelty, greed, a minefield of liability and lawsuits. Of course it is easier 
to concentrate on getting the paper work right; there life is beyond 
unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
There is little guidance, four supervisors in five years. So, like any infantry 
unit, the licensing team has turned in on itself. There is Harriet, a big, 
warm, black woman from Suffolk Springs, Tex.: "I can usually walk in a house 
and know when people are going to be good." Don, the wiry office clown sporting 
a touch of Navajo jewelry, spars with Walter, ACLU stalwart and Nation 
subscriber, who brings raw carrots in his Igloo lunch box. Mary, an engineer's 
wife, has been here 23 years and talks of "saints who have literally saved 
children's lives." 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, they leave their cocoon of routine and set off alone to face 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
The houses vary: small, large, old, shabby, clean, mostly black. The poor of 
pocket, the rich of spirit, those who have least are quickest to open their 
houses to parentless children. The middle class and well-to-do picture a 
15-year-old drug addict mother with visitation rights sitting on their English 
chintz sofas and shudder at the thought of suits, danger, threat. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a road of lean, small homes, Patti Kamoto parks her spotless Toyota and 
checks for gangs on the corner, guard dogs frothing behind fences. Her clients 
are new applicants who have already been allowed to take a year-old baby into 
their home. Their two children are in high school ("my son may go to the pros 
-- to the Kansas City Royals"), the vacuum cleaner marks run through the house: 
"They know we're coming, we make appointments," says Kamoto. "We can't live 
with a family for a week, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
The couple talk of how cute the baby is, how they baby-sat for him when he was 
with his last foster mother, how they never whipped their own children as they 
were whipped. 
</P>
<P>
Kamoto works doggedly through her checklist: She measures rooms and crib bars, 
worries over disinfectant, first-aid kits, monthly disaster drills, TB tests 
and CPR certificates, fingerprints for Sacramento. No awkward, prying, 
challenging questions. 
</P>
<P>
What will go in that huge empty space marked "motivation" on the Initial 
Licensing Study form? He says that he coaches school sports; she says that she 
works in a health center. Their word passes on trust. Confrontation, 
unpleasantness is skirted; Kamoto does not offend. Even the most detailed form 
cannot contain boxes for what is left unsaid, for questions unasked. 
</P>
<P>
It is a decent process invented for decent people who do not lie, cheat, beat 
and starve.

FOSTER CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE; REFORM IS 'DOABLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Freedman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cries of children at risk should be answered before they become screams of 
pain. What can be done to reform the system that too frequently compounds 
children's suffering? 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend an obscene amount to maintain kids" in foster care, says Brian 
Cahill, director of the nonprofit Hathaway Children's Services. "We don't spend 
a dime on the front end, on prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention worked for Casey, a young mother of six. Sexually molested and 
beaten as a child, she now found herself beating her own children. Her life, 
she now says, was "pure chaos," and she tried to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The school nurse saw the trouble signs and recommended that Casey seek help. 
Casey called a neighborhood center run by the Children's Bureau, a nonprofit 
agency. Two social workers came out: one for her, another for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The social workers told Casey where she could find ongoing programs that would 
help her and the kids. They didn't impose the programs, just encouraged her to 
take the initiative in breaking the cycle of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention saved one family. It also saved the county from taking on the 
burden of caring for six more children. Casey, who dropped out of school in 
seventh grade, is now studying for college entrance. She hopes to become a 
social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention is "doable," says Children's Bureau Director Judy Nelson. Reform of 
the system is doable, too. Here are 17 things that government and citizens can 
do: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pour money into prevention. Drug counseling and parenting classes are 
crucial to prevent abuse and for every $1 spent in family preservation 
services, $1.50 is saved in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
2. Provide continuity of care. Do everything possible to keep children from 
being bounced from foster home to foster home, social worker to social worker. 
Give each child one person who will be responsible for his or her case. 
</P>
<P>
3. Monitor children carefully and frequently. Face-to-face visits are a child's 
lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
4. Lower caseloads. If social workers are overwhelmed, children suffer. 
</P>
<P>
5. Create a comprehensive, objective system for evaluating children and the 
risks they face. The current haphazard evaluations allow too many crucial 
judgments to be subjective. 
</P>
<P>
6. Build a "child-friendly" Dependency Court to replace the current facility 
shared with criminal courts. Streamline judicial procedures and initiate 
mediation to resolve disputes out of court where possible. 
</P>
<P>
7. Provide independent legal representation for children in custody. 
Court-appointed lawyers cannot represent children's interests when they are 
simultaneously representing the county. Foster parents should also be permitted 
to testify in court, a right and responsibility currently denied them. 
</P>
<P>
8. Explain to children what is happening in a language they can understand. 
</P>
<P>
9. Enlist citizens to become volunteer advocates for children in Dependency 
Court. The city of Los Angeles has an innovative child advocacy program, CASA. 
</P>
<P>
10. Coordinate foster care with schools, as in the innovative Foster Youth 
Services program in the Sacramento public schools. 
</P>
<P>
11. Provide each child with a "medical passport" to give continuity of medical 
care, especially for drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
12. Base program funding for children on their needs, not on outdated formulas 
and partisan politics. Foster-care funding must not be capped in Washington. 
Federal family maintenance funding should also be open-ended. This will save 
money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
13. Bring new leadership and vision into the county's Department of Children's 
Services. California has some of the best minds in this field; they should be 
enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
14. Stop officials in the state and county from throwing brickbats at each 
other. Agency directors should sit down together and cooperate on a plan to 
make the county comply with state mandates -- and provide enough money to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
15. Create a public-private partnership for funding foster care. The corporate 
sector could initiate a major fund drive to raise millions for children at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
16. Enlist Hollywood to dramatize the needs of foster children and create 
programming that will help families deal with abuse rather than stimulate 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
17. Last, and most important, stop the cycle of children having children. 
Provide perinatal care to every mother and child. When pregnant women test 
positive for abusive substances, give them immediate drug counseling. Last 
year, 2,400 drug babies were born in Los Angeles County. Their suffering is 
unimaginable, and they are overwhelming the system. Jonathan Freedman

The van carrying abused children from the MacLaren Children's Center drives up 
to an ominous high-rise building with "Criminal Courts" written on the 
entrance. The children are driven into a high-security garage and the same 
caged-off entrance where the Night Stalker was brought for his day in court. 
The children's van halts behind a long black-and-white sheriff's bus filled 
with men wearing jail-issue blue jumpsuits. The children, age 4 to 18, wait 
while the men disembark in shackles and chains. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently the children ask if they are being taken to jail. But there is 
little time to explain that Dependency Court is separate from Criminal Court. 
The children, who have already suffered physical and sexual abuse, are 
frightened and disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
The system is confusing, but it typically works like this: 
</P>
<P>
Someone reports that children have been abused or neglected. Social workers 
investigate. If the children are in danger, they are taken away from home. 
Within three days, they must be brought into court for an initial detention 
hearing. During this period, they may be prevented from having any contact with 
their parents. The first time they are together again is in court, usually with 
an attorney sitting between the parents and the children. The proceeding will 
determine whether the children will return home or be put in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles County Juvenile Dependency Court conducted 56,136 
hearings -- nearly three times the caseload a decade ago. About 40,000 
children, by conservative estimates, are now under court supervision in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"The quantity of cases and shortcomings of CPS (Child Protective Services) 
create a substantial risk that the quality of justice desirable may not be 
achieved in this system," says presiding Judge Paul Boland, a champion of 
children's rights, who is doing his utmost to make the courts family-oriented. 
"Just as the children are at risk, the quality of justice in this system is at 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
Dependency Court is in the same judicial loop as the civil and criminal courts, 
and the contrast in how they operate is a reflection of the low esteem in which 
the county holds children at risk. In civil court, a judge may reserve 10 days 
to settle a $250,000 property dispute. In Dependency Court, a judge may have 
only 10 minutes to decide the fate of a child. Tens of thousands of children, 
predominantly minorities and poor, have had their lives changed in these 
10-minute legal proceedings, in which the judgments often are based on 
fragmentary reports. But who dares protest? Children can't vote. 
</P>
<P>
While the court personnel prepare for the daily grind of justice, a boy with 
immaculately combed hair and sad eyes, wearing a red sweater and red bow tie, 
is brought up on a freight elevator and taken to a dimly lit room furnished 
with a television set and not much else. There he waits with dozens of other 
children until a stranger calls his name and he is taken to a courtroom. The 
children may wait for a few minutes or all day. Sometimes they are never called 
and they go back to MacLaren Hall to wonder where their families are, and if 
they will be reunited, and when. 
</P>
<P>
In a holding tank converted into a narrow waiting room, the light filters 
through iron bars. A girl with blonde curls and a husky Latino boy are eating 
peanuts off the floor. "Animals!" a woman snaps at them, and goes on in this 
vein, unleashing her frustration. This out-of-control adult yelling at 
out-of-control children in the out-of-control courts is a snapshot of the whole 
out-of-control system. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people -- mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, friends -- sit 
on hard wooden benches in a corridor outside the courtrooms. There is no 
privacy. No place to consult quietly with an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 families in Dependency Court can't afford private legal counsel; 
they have court-appointed attorneys -- the same attorneys who simultaneously 
represent the county. This is a conflict of interest that is routinely weighted 
against the child. 
</P>
<P>
A bailiff calls a name, and a broken family -- mother and ex-husband -- goes 
into the courtroom. A toddler who was allegedly abused sexually by her mother's 
boyfriend calls frantically after her. The little girl is given a lollipop. The 
judge, overwhelmed with papers, sends the girl back to live with her mother, 
despite allegations that the child-abusing boyfriend is surreptitiously 
visiting her. "They don't listen!" laments the father. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, in the same courtroom, a janitor pushes through the swinging 
gate and halts directly behind a desk where two parents with histories of drug 
abuse sit waiting for the verdict. A deputy dumps a waste basket into the 
trashbin and the janitor rolls it out, while the judge reads into the record 
that the couple's three children are being placed in the custody of the state 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A generation of children is being treated like trash. The abuse of young lives 
and of justice is going on in full view of City Hall -- and of the Los Angeles 
media that inhabit the hallways covering movie stars' suits and celebrity 
murderers. The horror cases that make the news -- children abandoned, tortured, 
even killed by their caretakers -- don't diminish the general horror of 
children routinely, systematically, neglected by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Should society pour more money into this charade of justice? The county is 
considering plans for a new child-oriented Dependency Court facility away from 
downtown. But unless there is also a program to prevent abuse, the new 
courtrooms will immediately be overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"If funds were spent providing in-home family services at the point where the 
family first appears to be in crisis," thousands of cases could be resolved 
without going to court, Judge Boland says. 
</P>
<P>
Shortsightedly, child-abuse prevention doesn't rank with crime prevention in 
Gov. George Deukmejian's agenda. No wonder these stepchildren of the state, 
having suffered multiple abuses, including judicial and political neglect, 
predictably will turn someday against the state -- and against themselves and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, the children leave the garage looking back with huge eyes at the 
Dickensian courthouse, which now stands between them and their families. Many 
of them will return to this building in shackles, and some will be remanded to 
the custody of the state for as long as they live. 
</P>
<P>
Abused children cry out for protection, for affection and for guidance to grow 
up like other children. If they are denied what they deserve, they will come 
back to haunt us.

Still Pushing: Activist Angela Davis urged black students at Georgia State 
University to push mostly white universities to create black studies programs 
as a way fighting on-campus racism. "We fought for the right of 
African-American students to have access to the educational institutions of 
this country only to realize that the education . . . was flawed in and of 
itself," she said Saturday in Atlanta.

New News: CBS News anchor Dan Rather chastised the national media for listening 
to pollsters who say "real people care only about entertainment, sex and cats." 
In a speech in Washington, D.C., he asked: "Where are the publishers, editors 
and reporters of grit, gumption and guts? Television news and newspapers are in 
danger of sinking into a miasma of mediocrity."

Good Oates: Joyce Carol Oates was named Tuesday the winner of the $25,000 Rea 
Award, the largest U.S. prize for short stories. The Dungannon Foundation in 
New York which issues the award, said Oates 51, a professor at Princeton 
University, was cited for "her ability to constantly reinvent not only the 
psychological space she inhabits, but herself as well, as part of her fiction." 
Oates is the author of 20 novels and volumes of short stories, poems, essays

New Start: Romanian defector Nadia Comaneci appeared last week in Reno, Nev., 
for her first gymnastics performance in six years. Comaneci said: "I'm glad to 
be in my new homeland. This is very emotional for me . . . . I love America. I 
love you all." Her performance with 16 younger gymnasts was taped by ABC for 
broadcast April 21. She was recently reported to be in a personal relation with 
a married man who helped her defect in December.

YOUR BODY: NO RUSH TO USE CHICKEN POX DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acyclovir, an anti-viral drug used to treat genital herpes, can also shorten 
the duration and misery of childhood chicken pox, suggests a study published 
last week. But parents eager to get their children up and about may be in for a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In a random survey, Los Angeles area pediatricians said they are not likely to 
prescribe acyclovir routinely for chicken pox, an infectious viral disease 
marked by fever and blisters that strikes nearly everyone during childhood and 
lasts about five days. Doctors say the study, published in this month's Journal 
of Pediatrics, involves far too few children to warrant an across-the-board 
change in treatment -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, Dr. Henry Balfour, of the University of Minnesota, and his 
colleagues gave oral acyclovir to 50 children with chicken pox. Another 52 
children received placebos. Those taking acyclovir were sick about a day less, 
recovered from fevers more quickly and had fewer lesions. Reducing the course 
of the disease is not just a matter of convenience, experts say. It might 
reduce the likelihood of complications, which can include brain infections on 
rare occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Oral acyclovir will be available in pharmacies by May, said Kathy Bartlett, a 
spokeswoman for Burroughs Wellcome, which manufactures the drug. But it may sit 
a while on Los Angeles pharmacy shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wilbert Mason, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles and USC professor of clinical pediatrics, said the 
study won't affect his treatment of chicken pox. "It's a very preliminary 
study. It includes a very small number of patients. We need more substantial 
experience to consider a massive change in treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"I would not prescribe acyclovir except perhaps for an infant," said Dr. Elmer 
Crehan, a pediatrician on staff at Hospital of the Good Samaritan and Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles. "I look at this study with interest," said Dr. Loraine 
Stern, a Newhall pediatrician. "But I don't think it should (yet) change 
treatment. I'd put my money on a chicken pox vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
A chicken pox vaccine developed by Merck Sharp Dohme is now under review by the 
Food and Drug Administration, said Faye Peterson, FDA spokeswoman. The vaccine 
-- a live, weakened chicken pox virus -- works by creating an antibody 
response, thus protecting children from getting the disease once they are 
exposed, said Gary Bruell, a spokesman for the West Point, Pa., manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
But the FD questions whether the vaccine, called Varivax, would confer lifelong 
immunity, said Peterson, which is importantbecause chicken pox can be much more 
serious if contracted in adulthood.

Tapping Into the Value of Self-Help Audio, Video Tapes 
</P>
<P>
What's your next goal? To stop smoking? Lose weight? Boost self-esteem? Improve 
your memory? Enhance your sex life? 
</P>
<P>
Audio and video tapes with subliminal messages -- subconscious-level 
suggestions -- are just the ticket, proponents claim. Opponents say the tapes, 
widely available through mail order and bookstores, are long on promises and 
short on scientific claims. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the opinions of two researchers studying the effects of subliminal 
message tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Greenwald, professor of psychology, University of Washington, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
 "These tapes have not yet been demonstrated to be effective. The way to 
determine whether these work or not is to conduct a double-blind study, tests 
in which neither the subjects nor the researchers know whether subjects are 
listening to tapes with or without subliminal messages. Next, pre-tests and 
post tests must be done to determine if the target goal -- losing weight, 
stopping cigarette smoking, improving memory -- has been achieved. Basically, 
this research has not been done nor reported in journals. I am in the midst of 
a series of double-blind studies, which has not yet yielded evidence of the 
subliminal tapes' effectiveness. Let the buyer beware. People who buy these 
tapes risk losing their time and their money." 
</P>
<P>
Irene S. Vogel, psychologist, Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced that the audio subliminal message tapes work, but I think 
the video subliminal message tapes might. I recommend the video subliminal 
message tapes for clients trying to lose weight. People say they notice a 
difference. These tapes project messages on the TV screen. While watching 'The 
Simpsons,' for instance, consumers can also view a self-esteem program that 
tells them, 'I'm worthwhile.' The results are preliminary, but the impressions 
we are getting are favorable."

New Medicine Is a Snap to Take 
</P>
<P>
Call it medicine for people who hate to swallow medicine. Snaplets -- 
premeasured packets of medicine -- can be sprinkled into soft foods. "Good 
choices are yogurt, chocolate pudding, ice cream or applesauce," said Jack 
Lipworth of Baker Cummins Pharmaceuticals in Miami, which recently introduced 
the over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pharmacist Tom Menighan of the American Pharmaceutical Assn. in 
Washington: "The idea is a good one, though not necessarily new." The target 
consumers, he predicted, are children and the elderly.

ERMA BOMBECK: COOKING UP WAYS OF COPING WITH THE SWEET SMELLS OF EXCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't understand marketing experts. There's a new product on the grocery 
shelves called "Aromatica" rice. It smells like popcorn when you cook it. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a challenge can it be to make rice smell like something it isn't 
when it doesn't have any smell to begin with? When they can make Brussels 
sprouts smell like pizza or disguise sauerkraut so you don't pass out when you 
open the can, give me a call. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know where the idea came from, but I'll bet my last dollar it was 
inspired by kids. Children are naturally suspicious of food served to them by 
their mothers. There is dialogue about it before they even dip in their spoons. 
Questions such as, "What do you call this stuff?" "Are you going to eat it?" 
"What are those little bumps on the side?" Then they will sniff it and ask, "Is 
it supposed to smell like this?" 
</P>
<P>
I once passed out ice cream cones to my kids. They smelled them before they 
took the first lick. When I asked them why they did that, they said, "Because 
you are always trying to trick us." 
</P>
<P>
Grow up, America. Our entire society is being tricked every day into making 
things smell like something they aren't. Our bathrooms are sprayed to smell 
like a forest of Christmas trees, our dishes smell like a lemon grove and our 
cars are scented to smell like grape bubble gum. Our soap smells like peaches 
and our shampoo like strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that I'm opposed to making some foods smell better. It's just that 
there are other foods that need help more. Take fish. Please. Every day, I wish 
with all my heart that I loved fish. But I don't. If they could just remove the 
heads from fish and give it a beef odor when it cooked and perhaps add a little 
more fiber for consistency, they'd be onto something. I even have a name for 
it: steak. 
</P>
<P>
Most cheeses need work. I don't want to be in the same country as goat cheese. 
It always tastes the way a yak looks in one of those National Geographic 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
Cooked cabbage has the strength of nuclear fallout. The odor travels 100 to 200 
miles a day and is capable of making eyes water within a thousand-mile radius 
of where someone removed a lid. It could smell better. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the idea of renting a film and sharing a bowl of rice just doesn't do 
it.

ART BUCHWALD: A RUSH TO JUDGMENT . . . ON FLAG-BURNING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who say that President Bush does not have an agenda are misreading the 
newspapers. The other day the President requested that the Supreme Court rule 
on the constitutionality of flag-burning laws as quickly as possible. Mr. Bush 
wants an accelerated timetable in getting a court opinion for what he deems the 
most important issue of our time -- far more urgent than court rulings on 
capital punishment, abortion, the environment and the social issues that 
confront the nation today. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court agreed to Mr. Bush's request so flag desecration has been put 
on the justices' front burner, and arguments will be heard in May. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans are wondering why the hurry. How come the President is so 
desperate to get a decision, and why did the Supreme Court agree to drop 
everything to give him one? 
</P>
<P>
A mole in the White House provided me with the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has just received word that there is going to be a rash of 
flag-burnings this summer, and he wants the court to reverse its earlier 
opinion that flag-burning laws are unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
"How many flags does Mr. Bush expect to be burned this summer?" I asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"Four -- maybe five. It could be an epidemic. Bush is so worried about Old 
Glory going up in smoke that he sleeps with a fire extinguisher in his bed." 
</P>
<P>
"Being President is no fun," I said. "I am surprised that the Supreme Court was 
willing to go along with the speed-up of the case." 
</P>
<P>
"Congress directed it to. The law says that the court must expedite any 
flag-burning appeal as soon as it possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that because the national security of the country is at stake?" 
</P>
<P>
"That, plus the fact that every Republican congressman's election depends on 
it. No politician can face his constituency while the country's flag is in 
flames." 
</P>
<P>
"Is this the first time a President has requested that the Supreme Court 
leapfrog all its cases and rule on something as important as flag desecration?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but the President can't make that request too often because the court 
doesn't like to be pushed around. At the same time, when the patriotic health 
of the nation is in danger, then even the Supreme Court cannot sit idly by 
while people flick their Bics." 
</P>
<P>
"What if the court still declares that the anti-flag-burning law is 
unconstitutional? What will President Bush do then?" 
</P>
<P>
"He will demand that Congress pass an urgent constitutional amendment in three 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it took years to pass a constitutional amendment." 
</P>
<P>
"It does if you don't have an election coming up. You need to understand one 
thing. This country has many problems that it cannot solve. Preventing the 
burning of the flag is one of the few issues that Bush can deal with. He wants 
to go down in history as the President who saved the Stars and Stripes. He 
really deserves credit for getting the Supreme Court on it so fast." 
</P>
<P>
"Will the court rule on it before the summer recess?" 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't, it will be the end of Yankee Doodle Dandy as we know it."

Mexican Art Exhibit to Open: The first comprehensive exhibit of Mexican art to 
be shown in the United States since before World War II will open at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Oct. 10 and travel later to San 
Antonio, Tex., and Los Angeles, it was announced Monday. Philippe de 
Montebello, director of the Met, said more than 400 works from public and 
private collections in Mexico, Europe and the United States will be displayed 
at the museum through Jan. 13, 1991. The show will trace 30 centuries of visual 
arts in Mexico, from 1000 BC to 1950. GREG BRAXTON

Neil Sedaka to Undergo Surgery: Singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka, hospitalized 
since last week with an intestinal ailment, has decided to have surgery to 
correct the problem, said hospital officials in Danbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Sedaka, 51, will probably undergo surgery in the next week. Sedaka, who lives 
in Westport, Conn., was admitted to Danbury Hospital last Tuesday suffering 
from diverticulitis, an inflammation of the colon. The singer, who was listed 
in good and stable condition Monday, planned to remain in the hospital until 
the surgery is performed. It was not immediately known how long the surgery 
would take or what the recuperation period would be. GREG BRAXTON

Rock "Tempest" Honored: A rock 'n' roll version of Shakespeare's "The Tempest" 
and a drama about four South London clergymen were named the British theater 
season's best musical and play at the Laurence Olivier Awards in London. In a 
ceremony Sunday at the Dominion Theatre, Bob Carlton's "Return to the Forbidden 
Planet" (the Shakespeare adaptation) unexpectedly beat out the favorite, "Miss 
Saigon," in the musical category. 
</P>

But "Miss Saigon," a lavish Broadway-bound musical about the Vietnam War, won 
awards for outstanding musical actor -- Jonathan Pryce -- and musical actress 
-- Lea Salonga. David Hare's "Racing Demon" was named best play and also took 
best actor prize for Oliver Ford Davies. Irish performer Fiona Shaw was named 
actress of the year for performances in three productions -- "As You Like It," 
"Electra" and "The Good Person of Sichuan." The annual awards, named for the 
late actor Laurence Olivier, are the equivalent of Broadway's Tony awards. GREG

<P>
BROOKS' HOMER BRINGS LIGHT TO DODGERS' DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was the dawning of a new season for a new team with new attitudes, new 
offense, new pitching, new dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And a new Dodger stadium chant. 
</P>
<P>
Huuu-beee! Huuu-beee! 
</P>
<P>
New right fielder Hubie Brooks got the Dodgers' second century off to a 
memorable start Monday with a line drive three-run home run in the eighth 
inning that provided a 4-2 comeback victory over the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Against Padre starter Bruce Hurst, who was struggling after pitching a 
no-hitter for six innings, Brooks stepped to the plate in the eighth with 
Alfredo Griffin on third base and Willie Randolph on first. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers trailed, 2-1. There were two out. The crowd of 48,686 hummed with 
anticipation. According to Mickey Hatcher, Manager Tom Lasorda turned to him on 
the bench and began an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me that this late-inning pressure situation is where Brooks is 
really tough," Hatcher said. "He was telling me that this is a guy who wins 
games in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was summarily silenced by the crack of Brooks' bat on Hurst's first 
pitch. The ball flew on an ascending line, high over shortstop Garry 
Templeton's head, higher over left fielder Fred Lynn's head. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ball bounced into the seats, Brooks was one step from first 
base. He tucked his head down and clapped his hands. The crowd erupted in 
cheers that sounded like boos. 
</P>
<P>
 Huuu-beee! Huuu-beee! 
</P>
<P>
"Naw, man, I couldn't hear that," Brooks said, as calmly as when he faced 
Hurst. "To tell you the truth, I couldn't hear much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just hoping for a line drive single to tie the game. I would have been 
happy with that. I guess it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks shrugged. "I don't know what the story is with me in those situations. 
But I don't like being in them. I would rather get up there in the eighth 
inning with us leading, 5-0. That's what I like the most." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who signed last winter as a free agent outfielder from Montreal, can 
spend all afternoon downplaying his ability under pressure. But the statistics 
don't support his modesty. 
</P>
<P>
He has hit at least .270 with runners in scoring position for the last seven 
years. Last season, in late-inning pressure situations similar to Monday's, he 
batted .350, third in the league. 
</P>
<P>
As Lasorda was saying, that's why the Dodgers signed him. He's not so much an 
outfielder as a stress tab. And when he crossed home plate in the eighth inning 
Monday, the only thing they needed to worry about was holding that two-run lead 
with one of baseball's best bullpens. 
</P>
<P>
Oops, not so fast. With record-setting Jay Howell sidelined for two or three 
days because of shoulder stiffness, Lasorda turned to new reliever Don Aase. 
</P>
<P>
Aase almost made the remaining fans sorry they stayed, allowing a one-out walk 
to Fred Lynn and a single to Benito Santiago. But eight pitches later he made 
them glad again, retiring Garry Templeton on a pop fly to third baseman Jeff 
Hamilton, and striking out pinch-hitter Rob Nelson, looking. 
</P>
<P>
"This one was sweet," Randolph said. "Real sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Not for the Padres and Manager Jack McKeon. When the two teams play again 
tonight in San Diego in the Padres' home opener, he may still be trying to rid 
himself of the bad taste caused by Monday's obvious question. 
</P>
<P>
Why was Bruce Hurst still in the game when Hubie Brooks came to the plate? 
</P>
<P>
Hurst allowed just two baserunners, on an error by Templeton and a walk, before 
Brooks broke up his no-hitter in the seventh. But between then and Brooks' turn 
at bat in the eighth, four of the nine batters reached base. Randolph, the 
batter before Brooks, worked a walk, and a couple of the pitches to him weren't 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Because of limited spring training, Dodger starter Orel Hershiser was already 
out of the game. He had left after six innings, having allowed just Fred Lynn's 
homer and two singles. 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Hurst would go the same route when Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson 
visited him before Brooks batted. But Hurst remained -- for one pitch too many. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon defended his decision, saying, "Here's a guy who pitches a brilliant 
game and somebody is going to ask me about the forkball he left up? Really, 
that was the only bad pitch he made the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson added, "What can you say? He made a bad pitch to the wrong guy. If he 
made that same pitch to Alfredo Griffin, it was probably a fly ball to left 
field." 
</P>
<P>
Funny he should mention Griffin. The Dodger shortstop, who began the inning 
with a single to left, said it was obvious Hurst was losing it. 
</P>
<P>
"When he left him in there, I thought we had a chance," said Griffin, who was 
moved to third base by Jose Gonzalez's bunt and Juan Samuel's fly ball to right 
field. "He was perfect in the beginning, but he wasn't throwing the same then. 
He was hanging a couple of pitches to me that I didn't see earlier. He was 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, who threw 92 pitches to Hershiser's 70, said he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be out there, and if it happened again, I would still want to be 
the guy on the mound," he said. "I wasn't tired. I just made a bad pitch where 
he could beat me." 
</P>
<P>
And after all, these were the Dodgers, who last season nearly set records for 
ineptness under pressure. In the seventh inning or later, with the score either 
tied or the Dodgers trailing by no more than three runs, the team hit .217. In 
those situations with runners in scoring position, as in Monday's game, the 
Dodgers had 10 hits in 101 at-bats, a .099 figure, lowest in the National 
League in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that was before Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you, I did not like it up there," protested the Los Angeles native 
after his happiest homecoming. "Seriously, those are not situations that I 
enjoy. I never really thought it would happen this way." 
</P>
<P>
Then he laughed. You just knew he would laugh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
There were few people happier to see Hubie Brooks' home run than Juan Samuel, 
who could have been the game's goat after misjudging a Garry Templeton fly ball 
in the seventh inning that led to an RBI double and a 2-0 Padre lead. With 
Benito Santiago on first base after a single off middle reliever and eventual 
winner John Wetteland, Templeton lofted a fly to center. Samuel chased it 
nearly to the warning track, and then inexplicably stopped as the ball fell on 
to the track in front of the fence. Considering Samuel's highly publicized 
fielding problems while he spent his first year in center field last season, it 
was not the kind of play his reputation needed. "I got burned . . . I've got to 
get used to things on this field," Samuel admitted afterward, saying that 
before last weekend he played just one game in center field in Dodger Stadium. 
"The background behind home plate is hard during the day here. It's hard to 
pick up the ball." He also said that because Dodger coaches want him to play 
shallow, the chances of making mistakes near the wall are increased. "Sometimes 
when you take chances playing shallow, you have problems getting back," Samuel 
said . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dodger trainer Bill Buhler said that pending Jay Howell's condition today after 
playing soft-toss Monday, he could be ready in two or three days. "We don't 
think it's anything serious. . . . It would be a normal thing during the middle 
of a normal spring training," Buhler said of Howell's stiff shoulder. Since Don 
Aase pitched Monday, look for Mike Hartley to be Howell's right-handed 
replacement tonight in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Opening day was extra special for one Dodger who appreciated just taking his 
place on the third-base line. Jose Gonzalez, in his 10th year in the 
organization, was spending his first opening day with the big league team. 
"It's amazing," Gonzalez said before Monday's ceremonies. "Running to the third 
base line for the introductions, that will be like the 1988 World Series for 
me. I have worked so hard, for such a long time. You know I think it is 
great.". . . Kal Daniels thought opening day was great for a different reason: 
there were no Pete Rose rumors bothering his team like last season in 
Cincinnati. "Last season's opening day was miserable," Daniels said. "It wasn't 
like a real opening day, it was like a Pete Rose day, with everybody following 
Pete around and asking the players what they thought about it. I'm glad that's 
over." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first opening day missed by Dodger broadcaster Jaime Jarrin in 31 
years, since he joined the club in 1959. Jarrin remains hospitalized in Vero 
Beach due to internal injuries suffered in an automobile accident earlier this 
spring, but has been moved out of intensive care for the second time and could 
be released as soon as Thursday. He will likely not return to his KWKW Spanish 
language station until after midseason.

JOHNSON, DIVAC KEY LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: YUGOSLAV CARRIES HIS WEIGHT AGAINST MAVERICKS' DONALDSON. MAGIC SCORES 38. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vlade Divac is the size of, well, a Yugo compared to the Mack truck that is 
Dallas Maverick center James Donaldson. Divac, the Lakers' rookie center, 
easily gives up about 40 pounds as well as almost a decade of experience to the 
bulky Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the best set of circumstances for the Yugoslav to make the second 
start of his NBA career on Monday night. But with Mychal Thompson out because 
of a hyper-extended right knee, the Lakers had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Divac scored 21 points, four shy of his season high, and had 11 rebounds in the 
Lakers' 113-106 victory before 17,505 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Divac's play may not have been the overriding factor in Lakers' 58th victory -- 
Magic Johnson had a season-high 38 points, including a career-high 19 free 
throws -- but the center matchup could have been a major problem without 
Thompson to defend Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Vlade did a hell of a job against Donaldson," Laker Coach Pat Riley 
said. "I really questioned starting him. We thought a lot about not starting 
him and going with a small lineup. But Vlade did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's victory, the Lakers' seventh in a row, all but wrapped up the club's 
bid for the NBA's best record. The Lakers (58-17) lead the Detroit Pistons by 
four games in the loss column with seven to play. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was undeniably superb in jump-starting the worn-out Lakers, playing 
their fourth game in five nights, and Divac provided stability in the middle on 
a night they needed it. 
</P>
<P>
Divac had problems adjusting to Donaldson, who made all four shots he attempted 
in the first quarter. By halftime, though, Divac had 14 points and six rebounds 
and Donaldson had been shut out in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And, even though the Lakers pulled away from the Mavericks by using a smaller 
lineup and a half-court trap in the third quarter, Divac finished with his most 
points of the season against a true NBA starting center. His season-high 25 
points came mostly against Sacramento's gimpy Ralph Sampson on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I (was) much better against Donaldson," Divac said. "When I play against 
Donaldson, I know I have to push. I play physical now. Before, I couldn't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's performances no longer surprise Riley or his teammates. Included 
Monday night was a 55-foot basket at the halftime buzzer and a series of 
impressive drives to the basket. And many of his eight assists were 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Johnson and Divac, the Lakers were led by A.C. Green's 15 points 
and nine rebounds and Byron Scott's 13 points. Rolando Blackman and Sam Perkins 
had 19 and 18 points, respectively, for Dallas. Donaldson finished with 11 
points and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers shot only 46.2% and had 17 turnovers, they beat Dallas 
because of Divac's steady play and the idea that Johnson would not let this one 
get away. 
</P>
<P>
Of his 55-foot shot, Johnson said: 
</P>
<P>
"I just got a good look at it and got my feet together and it was shot on a 
line," Johnson said. "It was one shot that goes in every 100 times. I guess 
this was my 100th time." 
</P>
<P>
He went to the free-throw line 22 times, a career high. The Lakers seemingly 
had the game won with about two minutes to play, leading by 15 points. Out went 
Johnson and the rest of the starters. But the Laker reserves squandered most of 
the lead, forcing Riley to bring back Johnson with 30 seconds left and the 
Lakers leading by only five points. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, though. Johnson sank two more free throws and the Lakers pulled 
out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unconscionable that I would have to put Earvin back in the game," Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, Riley was pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great win," he said. "Playing four games in five nights, they rose 
the the occasion -- Earvin and James (Worthy). This is as competitive as I've 
seen us during the regular season."

GRIFFEY'S HOME RUN LEAVES ANGELS IN COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Angels expected to have more than five hits in their season opener Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven didn't expect the one-and-one fastball he threw to Ken Griffey 
Jr. in the fifth inning to stay more outside than inside on the 20-year-old 
outfielder, who turned it into a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
But losing their home opener didn't create agony among the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Regret, maybe. Disappointment, certainly. But concern? Hardly. It's far too 
early to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"No, we're going to panic and go home," Manager Doug Rader said with a serious 
expression, before laughing at his own joke. "C'mon. Last year we lost our 
first game of the season to the White Sox, and we won 91. Maybe it's an omen." 
</P>
<P>
Their offensive production in a 7-4 loss to the Seattle Mariners looked more 
like a repeat of last season than a peek at the future. Starter Brian Holman, 
one of three players the Mariners acquired from Montreal last season for Mark 
Langston -- who later signed with the Angels -- gave up three hits in five 
innings before 38,406 at Anaheim Stadium. Blyleven, making his 12th opening-day 
start, had only one rocky inning, but the Mariners made the most of it to score 
five runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to start out the way I did," Blyleven said. "We scored four runs, 
and that should be enough for me to win. Everybody wants to win the opener. I'm 
just sorry I didn't perform in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"But, hey, we've got 161 more. One sixty-one and one wouldn't be a bad record." 
</P>
<P>
His record is 0-1 because of Griffey's 365-foot shot over the wall in right 
field. Blyleven had gotten through the first four innings unscathed, giving up 
only two singles. And he might have escaped the fifth with little damage had 
third baseman Rick Schu been able to start a double play on Brian Giles' 
one-out grounder instead of only a force at second. 
</P>
<P>
Pete O'Brien led off the fifth with a double to right field, moved to third on 
Greg Briley's grounder and scored on Edgar Martinez's single to left. Dave 
Valle sent a bouncer under Mark McLemore's glove for another single, sending 
Martinez to third and bringing up Giles, who started at shortstop because of 
injuries to Omar Vizquel and Mario Diaz. Schu corraled Giles' grounder, but not 
deftly enough to get the double play. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit the heel of my glove and bounced out," Schu said. "If I come up 
cleanly, it's a double-play ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners exploited that gift, when Harold Reynolds singled to center and 
Griffey pounded Blyleven's fastball over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The fifth inning was a tough inning. I just got the ball up a little bit," 
Blyleven said. "I'm not happy with the way I pitched, but I felt good. I just 
made a pitch to Griffey that was inside, and I didn't get it as inside as I 
wanted and he hit the heck out of it . . . it was the same pitch I struck him 
out on (in the fourth inning), maybe a little bit higher. I planned to go 
through the fifth one-two-three. I didn't plan to give up 12 hits and five 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
He gave up seven hits, not 12. "It only seemed that way," he said. But the 
Mariners got to five Angel pitchers for 15 hits, four by Griffey and three by 
Valle. 
</P>
<P>
The big fifth erased a 2-0 lead the Angels had built on Johnny Ray's 
first-inning home run and his sacrifice fly in the third, set up by a single by 
Schu and walks to Mark McLemore and Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
"They had some two-out RBIs and we didn't," Rader said. "We had some 
opportunities with two out and didn't capitalize, and that was the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people on this ballclub are not anywhere near operating level. 
We're emphasizing patience and understanding. I believe in these people because 
this is a very good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, who was enjoying a spectacular rookie season last year until he broke 
a bone in his left hand, had an unsettling day before he unsettled the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I had butterflies this morning and threw up once in the hotel right before I 
came to the stadium," he said. "Last year, I didn't know what to expect, so I 
couldn't be scared or nervous. This year, I know what to expect, and that made 
me nervous. I don't know why. Those feelings went away after the first pitch, 
the first at-bat. It was time to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels weren't perturbed about losing their first game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still 161 left. It's too early for us to be troubled or for anybody to 
think anything's wrong," said Willie Fraser, who yielded three hits and two 
runs in relief of Blyleven in the sixth inning. "I don't know if the hitters 
are ahead of the pitchers: Nolan Ryan went out today and threw five innings and 
didn't give up a hit. It'll all even out in a couple of weeks. At least, I hope 
it does for me." 
</P>
<P>
McLemore believes things will even out sooner than a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game's nothing to worry about," he said. "A game like tonight, you 
just look at the positives. We played good defense, but we didn't capitalize on 
some chances . . . It's only been one game. It's a long season." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' lineup contained two slight surprises -- right-handed hitter Rick 
Schu starting at third against a right-handed pitcher instead of switch-hitter 
Donnie Hill -- and Mark McLemore hitting ninth. Devon White was the leadoff 
hitter early in the spring and McLemore had occupied that spot for most of the 
later games. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader is determined to make a leadoff hitter out of White, who has 
speed to create havoc when he reaches base but struck out 129 times and walked 
44 times last season. "Hitting first helps him refine the skills he needs to 
incorporate in his swing, and that's why he's hitting there," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries dictated that Chili Davis (sore groin) would be restricted to a 
designated hitter role instead of playing in left field, and that Dante 
Bichette would play left. Brian Downing's continued problems with sore rib 
muscles also kept him from being the DH. Schu won out over Hill because of his 
experience at third. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Schu) is swinging the bat right now, number one, and number two, his 
background is third base and I just thought it would be a little bit easier 
assignment for him today," Rader said. "Regarding Brian and Chili, the factors 
were how proficient Chili would have been defensively with the groin and how 
well Dante is swinging the bat. Brian is not 100 percent." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he felt "some butterflies and excitement" about opening day, adding 
that "what I always want to do is get it over with and get into the grind of 
the season where you get numb. Numbness usually takes two or three weeks into 
the season . . . I'd rather be a little more calm and analytical than be caught 
up in the excitement of opening day." 
</P>
<P>
His Mariner counterpart, Jim Lefebvre, recalled his first opening day, as a 
Dodger in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Opening day is always special," he said. "We won the game. (Don) Drysdale 
pitched. I popped up to the catcher four times, but who cared? It was opening 
day and I was a Dodger." 
</P>
<P>
As recognition for making the team, Schu -- who had worn uniform number 60 in 
spring training -- was given the more conventional number 20. It was the number 
of the man he unsuccessfully tried to replace in the hearts of Philadelphia 
Phillie fans: Mike Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always a big fan of his," Schu said. "I couldn't get the number when I 
was over there. I didn't care what number I got here, just as long as I was 
here." Hill also got a new number -- 22, instead of the 52 he sported in spring 
training.

For Tony Granato, it was the deal that would not die. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard during All-Star game weekend that he had been traded from the New 
York Rangers to the Kings, along with fellow wing Tomas Sandstrom, for Bernie 
Nicholls, Granato was excited. 
</P>
<P>
But his excitement faded when he kept hearing about it. 
</P>
<P>
In newspapers. On television. From fans. 
</P>
<P>
And from Bernie. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls went public the day of the trade, calling it, "a dumb deal," and 
barely stopped to catch his breath over the ensuing days, blasting both King 
Coach Tom Webster and General Manager Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
"Though Bernie was well liked here, when the trade was made, I thought it was 
done," Granato said. "But no one seemed to forget it. Instead of just letting 
everyone play, they had to keep bringing it up, how Bernie was doing every day 
with the Rangers. I got tired of hearing about it, tired of reading about it. 
</P>
<P>
"People have their own opinions. I wanted to prove to the Kings what I could 
do. I was not worried about other people." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
"I met him and he's a good guy. He means no harm," said Granato of Nicholls' 
bad-mouthing. "He has nothing against Tomas or me. That's just the way he 
approaches things. I don't believe it would be the right way for me, but if he 
wants to do it, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Granato's frustration was heightened by an existing groin pull. He got into 
only one game before being sidelined again. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do?" Granato asked. "(The Kings) were patient and took 
no chances. They wanted to make sure I was 100%, so they gave me an extra week. 
It was a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the frustration ended for Granato, it began for Sandstrom, who went 
out with a facial injury. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in New York of all places, the line the Kings had dreamed of when the 
trade was made skated onto the ice: Granato on one side, Sandstrom on the other 
with Wayne Gretzky in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
That line produced eight goals and 14 assists in three games, all victories for 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Too good to be true? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, as it turned out when Gretzky took his turn on the injured list, first 
because of a groin strain, then a hyper-extended back that sidelined him for 17 
days. 
</P>
<P>
But the trio was reunited Sunday night at the Forum for Game 3 of the 
best-of-seven opening-round playoff series between the Kings and Calgary 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom, set up by Gretzky, got the first goal. Granato got the game-winning 
goal unassisted in overtime as the Kings won, 2-1, to take a 2-1 lead in the 
series with Game 4 tonight at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
With the Kings skating short-handed, Granato stole a pass from Gary Suter, 
skated to within a couple of feet of goalie Mike Vernon and shot the puck over 
his glove and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
As the red light went on and his teammates jumped on him in celebration, 
Granato tried to keep the moment in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get too high," he said. "If it had been the seventh game, it would 
have been a lot better. You've got to remember, this is only one game. Now Game 
4 is even more important." 
</P>
<P>
Does he at least derive some satisfaction at proving that maybe the deal wasn't 
so dumb, that the critics might have been too quick to judge? 
</P>
<P>
"That won't be decided for a couple of years down the road," Granato said. 
"Right now, I'm just thinking about winning hockey games." 
</P>
<P>
It was what the Kings wanted to hear Monday from Gretzky: no news. 
</P>
<P>
No spasms in his back. No pain. Nothing new from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After missing all but one period of the previous 10 games and practicing only 
two days, Gretzky played a full game and the 8 minutes 37 seconds of overtime 
Sunday against the Flames with no apparent problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky attended a team meeting Monday and then went in for another therapy 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"He's feeling fine," Webster said. "He's pretty loose. He's even looking 
forward to getting walked on today." 
</P>
<P>
That comment referred to part of Gretzky's therapy, but the King center also 
got walked on a bit Sunday, twice crashing to the ice after getting hit by 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Did that make Webster wince after waiting so long for Gretzky's return? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't notice," said the coach, grinning. "I was looking the other way. It 
was nice to see him able to play and to take some hits. He has responded well, 
but that's the way it is with backs sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The news was not so good for defenseman Tom Laidlaw. Out with a lower back 
injury since March 17, the same day Gretzky had played his last full game, 
Laidlaw practiced the past week and had hoped to be in the lineup tonight. "He 
won't be available," said Coach Tom Webster.

TRANSPLANTS OF MARROW: STRANGERS ANSWER CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a Sunday morning at Temple Judea in Tarzana, Nancy Landis has arrived for a 
blood test to help a woman, a stranger whom she saw on television. 
</P>
<P>
The woman needs a bone marrow transplant. And although Landis, 20, doesn't 
completely understand what's entailed in becoming a donor, she is certain that 
Temple Judea is where she should be this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this lady on the news," says Landis. A small bandage covers the crook of 
her right arm, where two tablespoons of blood have been drawn. As with other 
donors, the blood sample taken from Landis will be used only for testing to see 
if her tissue is a match for the woman or another patient needing a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a daughter my age," Landis says. "I saw how she was struggling to 
live. I want to help that lady." 
</P>
<P>
The blood drive at Temple Judea is for Fran Arnold, a 48-year-old Tarzana 
mother of three who is dying of leukemia. But the scene could have been 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ on Crenshaw Boulevard, 
friends of William Rall, who is dying of leukemia at age 11, register potential 
donors for a preliminary blood test to see if their marrow might match his. 
</P>
<P>
In Long View, Tex., blood drives are held almost weekly to search for a match 
for two residents who need bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, the fire and police departments compete to see who can 
register the most employees as potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
On the TV talk show "AM Los Angeles," co-hosts Tawny Little and Steve Edwards 
give blood samples that will be tested and entered in a registry. In Hollywood, 
actor Dustin Hoffman pleads for a donor for a student whose time is running 
short. In Oregon, an archivist searches for a family's distant relatives to 
find someone who could donate marrow for two sisters with a rare, fatal blood 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
There are appeals for donors -- everywhere, every day. 
</P>
<P>
And in a growing number of cases, the appeals are not in vain, says Liz Quam, 
of the National Marrow Donor Program in St. Paul, Minn., a federal program 
founded to match transplant patients with potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in its three-year history, the registry has enough donors to 
offer a terminally ill patient the slim chance of receiving a transplant from a 
stranger when no suitable family member can be found. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, bone marrow transplants were performed only as a last resort to 
save cancer patients. (Chemotherapy and radiation were -- and still are -- the 
standard treatments.) But medical advances have transformed the risky procedure 
into a reasonable option for children and adults with leukemia, lymphoma, 
aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, radiation poisoning and dozens of other 
rare, fatal blood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
And the advances have come at a time when public enthusiasm for donation is on 
the rise, Quam said. While blood donation is a somewhat anonymous procedure -- 
a donor doesn't know who the blood will go to and for what specific purpose -- 
bone marrow donors can know the identity of the recipients and invariably say 
they feel as though they are saving someone's life. 
</P>
<P>
Energized by the turnout of donors nationwide, patients with about 50 types of 
fatal blood diseases and their doctors are scrambling for transplants as their 
best shot for a cure. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, unless you had a family member that matched you, there was no 
hope," Quam said. "Now, because we have started to envision a large enough pool 
of donors to meet all needs, it has become a real hope." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the registry listed 42,000 potential donors and was criticized as 
being too small to be viable. 
</P>
<P>
But, due to the explosion of public awareness and aggressive campaigns for 
donors, the number has soared in six months to almost 100,000, surprising 
registry officials who had somewhat pessimistically projected they would reach 
100,000 by January, 1991. The increase in donors improves the likelihood that a 
recipient will find the one person in 20,000 who has matching bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the number of bone marrow transplants nationwide has jumped from 
about 15 transplants a month last fall to about 30 a month now, Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
Success depends heavily on locating the best possible donor, however, and 
because of the complexity of bone marrow itself, this is a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow is a red fluid, the consistency of jelly, that circulates inside 
bones and manufactures red blood cells. Unlike blood, of which there are four 
basic types, marrow contains so many components that pairing donor and 
recipient is like trying to find the mates among 20,000 shoes scattered from 
California to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
In the same laboratory process used for paternity testing, technicians identify 
six particular components in blood called human leukocyte antigens, which can 
be found in many combinations. Ideally, all six of the antigens from donor and 
recipient should match. 
</P>
<P>
Transplants can be performed if at least four match, but the chances of success 
are reduced. Antigens are linked to race and ethnicity to some extent, and 
blacks, Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and Jews are particularly 
under-represented in the donor registry, Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have those components matched, the body recognizes that the 
marrow is foreign and will reject it," Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
Most potential recipients would gladly face the odds of even a 
less-than-perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
According to the national registry, about 9,000 people each year require bone 
marrow transplants for survival. About 30% will find a donor among family 
members. The other 70% must search for an unrelated donor. Fewer than 
one-quarter will find a match now through the registry. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had about 1,000 searches going on in the last few weeks, and the number 
grows steadily," Quam says. "And there are going to be patients who have such a 
rare (tissue) type that we can't find a donor for them." 
</P>
<P>
The registry needs at least 250,000 donors to meet all requests. 
</P>
<P>
Anissa Ayala of Walnut Grove has not found a donor. Last year, the teen-ager's 
parents conceived a child hoping that the sibling might be a donor for Anissa, 
and their plight has been highly publicized. Tests show that the baby girl, 
born last week, is a suitable match. But the parents, who have stated that the 
newborn will be loved for herself as well as for her bone marrow, have been 
criticized for their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Such stories of desperation have triggered the national registry's emerging 
success, Quam says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very reserved person, but when your kid's life is on the line, you do 
really strange things," says Tony Templeman of Artesia, whose son received a 
bone marrow transplant last year from an unrelated donor. "I decided I wanted 
to do whatever I could and not have any regrets." 
</P>
<P>
The Templeman family sponsored testing for 1,500 people over five nights last 
May without finding a match for Phil, 26, who had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"But that was not a disappointment for us," Templeman says, "because we felt we 
were helping someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The registry located a donor for Phil a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is a donor, you're rescuing the family as much as the patient," 
says Susan Rafkin of the Life-Savers Foundation, a Covina-based nonprofit group 
founded to boost the donor pool through recruitment and fund raising. "There is 
a lot of turmoil. You have to go public if you want to get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
Quam believes the despair will end. Few altruistic campaigns have caught the 
nation's fancy as bone marrow donations. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lundeen, 39, an insurance agent from San Diego, calls his experience 
donating bone marrow "the best thing that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Lundeen, a longtime American Red Cross blood donor, entered the registry in 
March, 1988, and was told: "Thanks, but don't expect a call real soon." 
</P>
<P>
Three months later he was contacted as possible match for a 43-year-old 
Jackson, Mich., man with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember it in terms of feeling like a lottery winner," says 
Lundeen, whose donated marrow was flown to Michigan. "It's a chosen feeling. In 
the back of your mind, you wonder if you would do it if called upon. You get to 
be a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Donor recruitment specialists try to educate potential donors about the process 
before the first blood test. But about 10% of potential donors who are 
contacted as a match decline to continue the process, Quam said. Some have 
legitimate reasons, such as pregnancy. Some back out simply because they did 
not understand what was involved. They are not legally obligated to go through 
with the process. 
</P>
<P>
More interesting, Quam says, is why people donate. The national registry is 
conducting research to understand what motivates donors. 
</P>
<P>
Quam has some clues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very emotional experience for both the donor and the patient," 
she says. "After that intent-to-donate form is signed, that donor is living for 
two people. Our donors are our most poignant advocates." 
</P>
<P>
The response is thrilling to those who worked for years attempting to launch a 
national registry. 
</P>
<P>
Only five years ago, a panel of medical experts convened by the federal 
government concluded that a registry for unrelated donors wasn't viable. The 
panel recommended against starting it, Quam says. 
</P>
<P>
"Until six months ago, there was incredible skepticism that there were even 
50,000 people in the country who would go through the donation procedure," she 
says. "It's fun now, because we have enough numbers to show that isn't 
happening."

XENAKIS WORKS, OUT OF DOORS, ON SALK INSTITUTE'S NORTH LAWN

<TEXT>
<P>
An expanse of green lawn, the size and shape of a city block, overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean at sunset. Overhead, a blue, cloudless sky. Rising from the East, 
a near-full moon. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged around a central seating area are 16 loudspeakers, broadcasting a full 
spectrum of electronic sounds, from under-whispers to full industrial blasts. 
</P>
<P>
In this setting, on the north lawn of the Salk Institute at UC San Diego on 
Sunday afternoon, Iannis Xenakis' "La Legende d'Eer" (1977), a work originally 
incorporating laser technology and mirrors, was revived. 
</P>
<P>
The 5 p.m. concert -- including a meal break at intermission -- offered also 
the U.S. premiere of "Voyage Absolu des Unari vers Andromede" for electronic 
sounds and kites, and "Rebonds" for solo percussion. 
</P>
<P>
At this penultimate event of the now-concluded "Xenakis at UCSD" festival, 
"Legende" made a stunning impression, aided in no small way by the physical 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes into the 45-minute sound-construct, the sun set. The remainder 
was heard, with only natural lighting, in the quickly darkening twilight. The 
audience, an informal group of about 100 rapt listeners, sat, stood and lay 
down on the grass through the work. Their concentration seemed total. 
</P>
<P>
Xenakis' pieces have this kind of effect on listeners. After one accepts his 
concept of grating, sometimes pain-approaching noise, as well as ambient sounds 
as apprehendable music, the ingenuity of his creations can become clear. The 
mathematical planning and minute detailing lavished on each work certainly 
obviate any haphazardness; this the listener senses. 
</P>
<P>
In a spoken program note before the performance, Xenakis said the piece had its 
premiere at the opening of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, later traveled to 
Germany and Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is dying on the (California) shore," the composer/architect commented. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Vitality, not death, is the subject of the piece, which recounts the 
story of Eer, who was killed in battle, but came to life again, days later, and 
told of visiting the other world, from where he was sent back. 
</P>
<P>
Even without lasers and mirrors -- the production team, headed by Joe Kucera, 
put on the piece without extra technology, when the price of such technology 
reached $10,000, a spokesperson for UCSD said -- the sound essay itself makes 
sense. To be surrounded by varied, contrasting, colorful and 
imagination-resonant sounds in a natural environment can become an 
extraordinary event. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old "Voyage," created last year for a kite festival in Japan, turned 
out to be more visual, similarly stimulating. It is an electronic score 
accompanied by two large super-kites -- each incorporating a dozen individual 
flying parts, with tails of perhaps 20-foot length. These are operated by kite 
masters -- at this event, Hyper-Kites of San Diego -- who improvise to the 
sound-score. 
</P>
<P>
In full sunlight, "Voyage" sounded and looked perfectly engaging through its 
quarter-hour length. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Schick, the virtuoso percussionist who had played two works on the 
Saturday-night program, moved outdoors Sunday afternoon for "Rebonds," another 
demanding showpiece that he performed from memory, and with fascinating 
theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
Schick has an actor's concentration and a dancer's physical control. He makes 
no motion without motivation, describes the music with his body, and yet does 
not distract from the aural experience. "Rebonds"is neither very long nor 
inordinately complex; it seems, instead, perfectly constructed. Schick played 
it with a wondrous and projected sense of its genuine importance.

'BOGEYMAN' TO CAP '90 LATC SEASON

<P>
"Bogeyman," a new piece by Reza Abdoh, Mira-Lani Oglesby and the same creative 
team responsible for last year's "Minamata," will cap the second half of the 
1990 season at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which also will include two 
other new works, two modern classics and two musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Ibsen's rarely staged "The Wild Duck" kicks things off July 12-Aug. 12, under 
the direction of Stein Winge, artistic director of the National Theatre of 
Oslo. It will have the same design team as "The Inspector General," Winge's 
most recent outing at the theater, including Pavel Dobrusky (sets) and Marianna 
Elliott (costumes). 
</P>
<P>
"The American Popess," a one-person play set in a morally bankrupt 21st 
Century, will feature actress Nan Martin as a woman Pope, talking to her new 
flock about a return to basics from a rented TV studio. This work by 
German-Argentine playwright Esther Vilar will be staged by LATC consulting 
director Alan Mandell Aug. 16-Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Third in the line-up is an exploration of the life and death of Times reporter 
Ruben Salazar, accidentally shot to death during a police action in East Los 
Angeles Aug. 29, 1970. Developed collectively by LATC's Latino Theatre Lab 
(which has taken on the pseudonymous name Violeta Calles for the occasion), 
"August 29" will play Aug. 30-Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," about the Salem witch hunts, will be staged 
Sept. 6-Oct. 13 by LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
"The Joni Mitchell Project," commissioned by LATC from artistic associate David 
Schweizer ("Kingfish," "Demon Wine," "The Illusion") and writer Henry Edwards, 
looks at the last quarter century through 20 Mitchell songs (Nov.1-Dec. 16). 
</P>
<P>
And "Blues in the Night," conceived and staged by New York director Sheldon 
Epps (a piece that has played London and New York), will examine the 
tribulations of three nameless women in a run-down hotel in the 1930s through 
songs of the '30s and '40s (Nov. 8-Dec. 23).

<P>
A month earlier than previously announced, the California State University 
Board of Trustees next week will review the large and controversial pay raises 
for 27 top university officials -- including the 43% salary hike, to $195,000 a 
year, given to Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds. Trustees are to meet in special 
session at the Oakland Airport Hilton on April 20, the day after a committee 
meeting on the issue at the same location. 
</P>
<P>
Those raises, which took effect Jan. 1, have been denounced by faculty, 
students and the state legislators for their size and the secrecy surrounding 
them. Cal State officials contend that the raise for Reynolds and the hikes 
between 21% and 28% for the other administrators bring salaries in line with 
those at comparable institutions around the country.

A teen-age girl on spring break was killed in a head-on collision with a car 
drag-racing on a highway near Palm Springs, authorities said. Another young 
woman and two youths were also hurt in the collision on California 111 in 
Rancho Mirage, about 10 miles southeast of the desert spa city, where tens of 
thousands of students have converged for an annual weeklong party that begins 
with springtime vacation at high schools and colleges.

Timare Blanke, 17, of Corona, died at a hospital shortly after the crash, 
Riverside County sheriff's deputies said. A passenger in Blanke's car, Chin 
Huang, 18, of Anaheim, was treated at the same hospital for minor injuries. The 
names and condition of two 16-year-old Torrance boys in the other car were not 
released. The wreckage and victims "were scattered for about three blocks," 
Police Lt. Lee Weigel said.

L.A. TO RUN METER ON SLOPPY, RUDE CABBIES IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nasser Ahmed Yousuf was a scofflaw -- and everyone within sight of his ankles 
knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at him," shouted one of several cabdrivers standing with the young hack 
Monday in a taxicab holding lot just outside Los Angeles International Airport. 
"He's wearing white sweat socks. You have to wear black socks. You can't wear 
sweat socks. You can get penalized for wearing sweat socks." 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of men erupted in laughter, Yousuf raised his pants legs and 
displayed the offending footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Under one of the newest city laws, such fashion gaffes soon could put Yousuf in 
line for a fine. The ordinance, which Mayor Tom Bradley signed into law last 
February, prohibits cabdrivers from sporting such items as tank tops, leisure 
suits and cut-off pants. 
</P>
<P>
Under an elaborate penalty points system, cab companies could be fined up to 
$1,500 for repeated violations of the dress code. The dress code is part of a 
broad taxicab ordinance that also regulates the behavior of the drivers. 
Drivers can be fined up to $500 for being rude to passengers, tampering with 
meters and other violations; their companies or cab associations can be fined a 
maximum of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the city will begin citing violators on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" asked the young cabbie, shrugging and smiling as his fellow 
hacks continued to chide him. "This is cheaper than black socks. Black socks 
cost $7. I can't afford that. I can afford white socks, though. They are cheap, 
something like $3." 
</P>
<P>
Economics aside, many cabbies across the city say the law is stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect the law to force us to dress clean or be polite," insisted 
Tamirat Chilot, a driver with United Independent Taxicab. "This is America. We 
know you're supposed to take a shower; we know you don't leave the house dirty 
and talk rudely to passengers. We are not animals." 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the city Department of Transportation, which will administer 
the law's disciplinary system, maintain that many local cabdrivers cannot be 
depended upon to be nice and neat on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is only there because it's needed," said Ken Walpert, a public 
utilities engineering associate. "We receive complaints about the cabdrivers 
regularly. We get complaints about discourtesy, overcharging. Refusal to make 
short trips is one we receive all the time." 
</P>
<P>
However, the drivers at LAX blamed unlicensed cabbies, or "bandits," for many 
of the passenger abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"The bandits, if they have a scanner, they will hear about a call and go to the 
location," Chilot said. "If I had a passenger in Mid-Wilshire, they'd try to go 
there and take him." 
</P>
<P>
Chilot said the city should focus on ferreting out bandit drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"They never go after the bandits," he said. "Instead, they harass us. The 
bandits, they are driving around all over the city, making the rest of us look 
bad. We don't need these laws; they do." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald D'Agostino, a city Transportation Department investigator, said his 
department has established a task force to address the bandit problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some cabdrivers said they welcome the new codes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these things we should have been doing before," Berhane Gherbe said. 
"Too many of us were not. I don't mind if it's good for the passenger." 
</P>
<P>
Some drivers said the law is equally as good for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make cabdrivers look respectable instead of like bums," said 
Bill Swearingen as he waited for a fare in his cab in front of the Flyaway 
Terminal in Van Nuys. "If I got off a plane at Los Angeles Airport and saw some 
of the drivers, I would not get into their cabs. They look ratty." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Cooper, a driver at United Independent, said the law signaled a 
long-overdue return to codes that cabbies lived by when he started driving in 
1939. 
</P>
<P>
"There was only one way you could drive a cab then," Cooper said, "and that was 
with a white shirt, a dark suit and a black tie. You had to be neat then. The 
city let things get out of hand. It's the city's fault. Now, they are trying to 
get back to that." 
</P>
<P>
But some drivers said the laws are too rigid. 
</P>
<P>
"Laws like this are just more pressure on the cabdrivers," Mehroad Hatami said. 
"It's like when you put too much air in a balloon. Eventually, it will burst." 
</P>

passengers. Morris Cooper, a driver since 1939, welcomed the move. LARRY DAVIS

PROSECUTOR DECLINES LIFE TERM IN CRACK CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprising move, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles passed up an 
opportunity Monday to employ a tough new anti-drug law that dictates life 
sentences without parole for repeat offenders convicted of selling even small 
amounts of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved Fred Hagler, a Compton man convicted in January of selling 
65.9 grams (2.3 ounces) of crack cocaine. It was Hagler's third felony drug 
conviction, and under a 1988 law he could have been sentenced to life 
imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, persuaded the judge to disregard -- for purposes of 
sentencing -- one of the prior convictions. This allowed Judge Alex Kozinski to 
give Hagler, 37, a mandatory 20-year term instead of life -- the minimum term 
available under mandatory federal sentencing laws for selling at least 50 grams 
of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Alan G. Dahle said a variety of factors prompted 
the request for a more lenient sentence. He pointed out that Hagler had not 
used a gun in his drug-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the veteran prosecutor said his decision had been approved by 
his superiors in the U.S. attorney's office, including James Walsh, who heads 
the major drug crimes unit, and Robert Brosio, the acting U.S. attorney. Dahle 
also said he had consulted officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
which arrested Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office's handling of the Hagler case contrasted sharply to 
how it acted when the first opportunity arose to use the mandatory 
life-sentence law. Four months ago, the U.S. attorney's office used the statute 
for the first time in securing a life term for Richard Winrow, 22, who was 
convicted of possessing 5.5 ounces of crack, his fourth drug-related 
conviction. When arrested, a .357-caliber handgun was found in Winrow's 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
While law enforcement officials have praised the mandatory sentencing law as a 
deterrent against drug-dealing, Dahle said the U.S. attorney's office has 
decided to evaluate the opportunities for mandatory life terms on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy decision," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
A relieved Elliot Stanford, Hagler's lawyer, said he was "amazed that the 
government made a policy decision not to go for a life sentence." He had 
submitted briefs arguing that such a sentence was unconstitutional because it 
violated the Bill of Rights' prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Stanford argued that even 20 years was too much, because some 
murderers might get out of jail before his client did. He also said that under 
state law, Hagler would have received a five-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski said from the bench that, in some respects, a 20-year sentence for 
selling 2.3 ounces of crack was shockingly harsh. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe Congress meant to shock," the judge said. "Congress wanted to 
shock those who think they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Dempsey Jones, the DEA agent who worked undercover on the case, said 
the agency basically agreed with the decision not to ask for a life sentence, 
but added that he believed that Hagler should have received 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dahle said 20 years was hardly an excessive sentence for Hagler. He said 
Hagler's record -- including convictions in 1983 and 1986 -- showed that he had 
been dealing drugs for years and that Congress was trying to deal with 
recidivists such as him. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug dealers," the prosecutor said, "are destroying that community, and we 
have an obligation to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
Hagler spoke briefly just before the judge pronounced sentence. "I was a 
hard-working guy trying to make money legally," said Hagler, the father of 
three children, one of whom testified on his behalf at trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't kill no one. I'm not a drug dealer. I was a user. . . . I was clean 5 
1/2 to six years." He said that drug-dealing had been widespread at the New 
Wilmington Arms project, where he was arrested by a task force of agents from 
the Drug Enforcement Agency and local police. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kozinski said from the bench that he was confronted with a difficult 
decision. Nonetheless, he said Congress had the authority to enact a statute 
that compelled a 20-year term for a person found guilty of dealing 50 grams or 
more of crack if the person has a previous felony drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski, a federal appeals court judge who was presiding over Hagler's trial 
in an attempt to help a federal district judge with an overloaded calendar, 
said if it were his personal decision to make, he might have rendered a lighter 
sentence. He said he believed that there were important questions raised by the 
mandatory-sentencing law that need further review. 
</P>
<P>
And he concluded by urging Hagler to appeal the sentence: "I think you have a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic interruption occurred midway through the proceeding when, from the 
back row of Courtroom 6 in the downtown federal Courthouse, a woman launched a 
wailing plea for Kozinski's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Green, the mother of Hagler's co-defendant, Stephen Green, begged 
Kozinski to reverse a decision he had made earlier in the morning, sentencing 
her 20-year-old son to a 10-year term mandated for anyone selling at least 50 
grams of crack cocaine. She also implored the judge not to impose a harsh 
sentence on Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
"My son and this guy was set up," Green yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see the neighborhood," she said referring to the Compton housing 
project where Hagler lives and she used to reside. "There are other people 
there dealing drugs that I know about, but I can't say who. You get killed when 
you come forward." 
</P>
<P>
Green, 43, told the judge that she was a mother of eight who worked for $3.75 
an hour at a convalescent home and taught her children to live honestly. She 
pleaded: 
</P>
<P>
"I raised them in church. Please! Please! Please! Fred is a good man. He works 
on cars. We're poor black people. That is a terrible neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski interrupted the outburst and invited Green to come to the front of the 
courtroom, where he told her that he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you tried hard and this is extremely painful," Kozinski said. "The 
problem is the Congress decided this is a very serious problem. Mrs. Green, I 
don't want you to get discouraged. You have other children. They're doing well. 
Stand by them. Stephen is young. He'll survive this." 
</P>
<P>
Then Green's daughter, Dietra, yelled, "No, he won't," and led her weeping 
mother from the courtroom.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMNESTY DEADLINE RUMOR SENDS HUNDREDS TO 
INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 600 immigrants flooded an Immigration and Naturalization Service 
office in Sepulveda Monday morning, mistakenly believing a rumor that today was 
the deadline to apply for legal residence status under the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor apparently started last Wednesday afternoon when the San Fernando 
legalization office on Parthenia Street ran out of the temporary work 
authorization cards issued to illegal aliens who have applied for residency 
under amnesty programs. 
</P>
<P>
Because they could not issue work cards, the office stopped accepting amnesty 
applications and told prospective applicants to return this week. The office 
continued to turn away applicants last Thursday and Friday, said Richard 
Walden, chief legalization officer of the Northridge amnesty office.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAPING IN MEXICO DRAWS MAXIMUM TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Covina chiropractor who engineered the kidnaping of his ex-lover's daughter 
in Mexico was sentenced Monday to more than 19 years in prison -- the maximum 
-- and ordered to pay more than $500,000 in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Peralta was indicted under a novel use of a federal law against 
international hostage-taking. He was convicted late last year of kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The abduction of Maria Robleto, 22, a dental student at a technical college in 
Mexico City on June 15, 1989, stemmed from a soured personal and business 
relationship between her mother and Peralta, the indictment said.

"We're liable to be dead by lunch," she says. 
</P>
<P>
We pass the last few homes along the roadside, then a Little League field, a 
juvenile detention camp and a man walking his goose. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see that?" she says. "The man walking his goose? That's a bad luck 
sign if I ever saw one." 
</P>
<P>
She loves to spook me. Ex-Catholics never completely lose their fear of the 
devil, hell and evil omens implicit in a man walking his goose on the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
Satan in shorts and a T-shirt, followed by the Goose from Hell. 
</P>
<P>
The walkie-talkie on my lap crackles static. I pick it up and say, "Bigfoot 1, 
this is Bigfoot 2, did you . . . er . . . call me?" 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how to ask in radio talk if anyone in the pickup truck leading us 
had tried to contact me. 
</P>
<P>
"Negative," is the reply. 
</P>
<P>
My wife shakes her head. "Bigfoot 2? You poor man, what has a lifetime of 
writing done to you?" 
</P>
<P>
It's this way. A guy who works in a bread factory was driving along Upper Big 
Tujunga Canyon Road one day when he saw a creature towering over the chaparral 
about 150 yards off the highway. 
</P>
<P>
This somehow came to the attention of part-time free-lance video journalist 
Matt Moneymaker, a student at UCLA. Matt passed the information on to Danny 
Perez, founder and, as far as I can determine, sole member of the Norwalk 
Center for Bigfoot Studies. 
</P>
<P>
They gave me a call and here we are, standing on the side of the road, looking 
for signs of a creature I don't even believe in. 
</P>
<P>
My wife has taken a few photographs and is now standing by, as she puts it, to 
drive for help should Bigfoot decide I am little more than a walking taco. 
</P>
<P>
I have written of Perez before but had never seen him in his sasquatch-hunting 
outfit. It is an olive-drab jumpsuit that bears the name of his organization. 
Some of the letters have been ripped off in past Bigfoot expeditions, however, 
so it reads, "Center or Bi foot Studies." 
</P>
<P>
The young man who spotted the creature shall remain nameless. I don't feel 
anyone under 21 ought to have to live down a Bigfoot sighting so early in life. 
Call him Fred. 
</P>
<P>
The creature he saw was 8 feet tall and reminded Fred of either a grizzly bear 
or a camper with a pack on his back. There are similarities, I suppose, if the 
camper was naked and covered with hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you use alcohol or drugs?" Perez asks somberly. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of his Bigfoot investigative technique. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," Fred says. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever had psychiatric treatment?" 
</P>
<P>
"Naw." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take a look," Perez says. 
</P>
<P>
The two of us start down the hillside into shoulder-high brush. I hear my wife 
say, "So long, Bigfoot 2." I can't get the Goose from Hell out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to believe he saw something," Perez says as we struggle through the 
undergrowth. A creek lies ahead. "There's water here and every living creature 
needs a drink." 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds pretty good to me too," I say. I'm not thinking about water. 
</P>
<P>
Dead vines puncture my left leg. Blood spots appear on my new Levi's Dockers 
and I wonder vaguely if Bigfoots (Bigfeet?) respond to the smell of blood. 
</P>
<P>
I have been assured they only eat mice, lizards and snakes, into which category 
journalists do not generally fall. But who can say for sure that the monster 
might not want to add columnist du jour to his otherwise humdrum menu? 
</P>
<P>
Perez has been hunting sasquatch for 15 years. He regards it as a serious, 
ongoing investigation he undertakes when he isn't wiring houses or selling 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
This is abundantly clear as he pecks grimly through the chaparral, looking for 
footprints, bits of hair or Bigfoot fecal matter. I'm not looking that hard for 
the fecal matter, but I'm sure we'll spot it if it's around. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, we find nothing but dozens of broken beer bottles and some 
strands of nylon I mistake for hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying he wasn't there," Perez says when we regain the safety of the 
highway. "I'm just saying we never saw him." 
</P>
<P>
As we drive away, my wife says she knows I had my heart set on finding a 
sasquatch and she's sorry I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe next time . . . Bigfoot 2," she adds, suppressing a giggle. "Over and 
out." 
</P>
<P>
We eat at a Greek restaurant in Palmdale called Pozi's. I order Goose from Hell 
but have to settle for stuffed grape leaves and a pita bread sandwich instead.

It's tempting to say that Tommy Lasorda's restaurant chain has two strikes 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Dodger manager's eateries in Marina del Rey and Pasadena have 
folded, the latter after it was cited for numerous health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day '90 arrived Monday with his roster reduced to one: Tommy LaSorda's 
in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
General manager Steve Rich couldn't explain why the name is spelled with a 
capital "S" on this branch -- "maybe there was some type of mix-up," he said -- 
but he was optimistic that the more limited menu will be a hit with fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve Italian and American food but we don't have ribs (as did the Marina 
and Pasadena spots)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich dismissed speculation that Lasorda, who is a part owner, may have hurt his 
own business with his much publicized diet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still allowed one meal a day," the restaurant manager said of the 
baseball manager. "He comes in here all the time to have pasta." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it remains to be seen if, business-wise, Lasorda is stretching himself 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In case you're keeping score. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's boys couldn't buy a hit in the early going Monday, which no doubt 
accounts for what may have been the earliest Opening Day appearance ever of a 
beach ball in Dodger Stadium: The fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium guards, who appeared to be in mid-season shape, chased the illegal 
sphere down in less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lake Wobegonite-turned-New Yorker Garrison Keillor seemed relieved to be back 
in Gotham City after performing a show here with the L.A. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk down the street in New York," Keillor said on his radio show, 
"you don't find a lot of people decrying the fact that New York is becoming 
more and more like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call it The Hunt for the Yellow Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of an El Pollo Loco franchise in Sherman Oaks are searching for the 
20-foot-tall inflatable balloon mascot that was rustled from the premises six 
weeks ago. In exchange for its return, they've offered a reward of "12 free 
chicken combos," no questions clucked. 
</P>

The failure of the California Democratic Party to endorse either John Van de 
Kamp or Dianne Feinstein for the gubernatorial nomination over the weekend at 
the L.A. Convention Center calls to mind the old Will Rogers quip: 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a member of any organized party -- I am a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noting that a $285 extension course, Field Studies of California Birds, meets 
in a room at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, Ethan Figerote of Spring Valley 
Lake comments: "I guess you would have to be crazy to pay $285 to look at 
birds."

MADD OFFICIAL'S SON DIES; DRUNK DRIVER SUSPECT HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The son of the woman who heads the Los Angeles chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving was killed and his girlfriend seriously injured when their pickup truck 
was rammed head-on by a car driven by a suspected drunk driver with two 
convictions, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Adam R. DeJesus, 19, of Canoga Park died shortly after the Saturday night 
accident on California 18, about 24 miles east of Palmdale, the California 
Highway Patrol said. Shanya Roberson, 19, of West Hills was in stable condition 
Monday at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus was the son of Marcy DeJesus, executive director of the Los Angeles 
MADD chapter. MADD was founded in Southern California 10 years ago. The 
organization spearheaded a nationwide campaign against drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Darshan S. Grewal, 42, of the Santa Clara County city of Campbell, was arrested 
by CHP officers on suspicion of drunk driving. Officer Miguel Siordia said 
Grewal, who was also hospitalized with injuries, could face prosecution for 
felony vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said investigating officers heard that Grewal had been drinking earlier 
in the day, but had no other evidence. It will take at least a week for results 
of a blood test to show whether Grewal was legally drunk, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would indeed be a horrible irony if Marcy lost her son to this because it 
was alcohol-related," said Ted Goldstein, a MADD board member. "Obviously the 
office staff and the board of directors of MADD are reeling over this." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the collision, Grewal was driving with his brother's license, 
Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Grewal's driver's license had been suspended in July, 1989, because of 
drunk-driving convictions in 1988 and 1983, Department of Motor Vehicles 
records show. He had also been forbidden, as a condition of probation, to drink 
alcohol, a DMV spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Grewal was in stable condition at San Bernardino County Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred about 8:30 p.m. Saturday as DeJesus and Roberson were 
headed east on California 18 about 2 1/2 miles west of the Los Angeles-San 
Bernardino county line. Authorities said the couple were headed for a spring 
college break vacation at Lake Havasu. 
</P>
<P>
Grewal, driving west on the two-lane road in a 1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, 
crossed into oncoming traffic while attempting to pass a large truck and struck 
DeJesus' Toyota pickup at 65 to 70 m.p.h., Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
"It knocked the Toyota about 20 feet backward," he said.

MEXICO GOING 'PRIVATE' TO FUND ROADS, PORTS, PHONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a country with a virtually empty treasury, Mexico has ambitious plans. 
</P>
<P>
By the time his term ends in 1995, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
promised 2,400 miles of new, four-lane highways and bridges, a $10-billion 
overhaul of the antiquated telephone system and increased spending on social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
So how does the Harvard-educated economist expect to pay for this? A big part 
of the answer is privatization -- handing over major parts of the economy to 
private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas and his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, have cut the number of 
state-owned companies to 746 from the 1,155 there were in 1983. Another 344 are 
slated for divestiture -- either by sale, liquidation or gift. 
</P>
<P>
As a turn-around strategy for corporations, the plan is classic: Spin off 
peripheral subsidiaries and invest the money from the sales in the core 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the strategy can work for a nation like Mexico, where a 
system of state economic dominance has assured political stability. That system 
has been in place as long as Eastern Europe was Communist. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has made some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure adequate investment in the divested companies, sales agreements often 
are conditioned on buyers' commitments to modernize plants and equipment that 
the financially strapped government has neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Besides selling off companies, the government is taking bids from corporations 
to build toll roads, ports, thermoelectric plants and cellular telephone 
systems, public projects that previous Mexican administrations would have 
undertaken themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations finance the projects and operate them long enough to recover their 
costs and turn a profit -- by charging tolls, for instance, in the case of 
roads. Afterward, they will turn the projects over to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Early results are positive. 
</P>
<P>
A badly needed bridge is under construction between El Paso, Tex., and the 
neighboring Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez. Roads are being built between the 
industrial centers of Monterrey and Nuevo Leon in the north as well as between 
the resorts of Cuernavaca and Acapulco in central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Government subsidies to state-owned companies fell to less than $500 million in 
1989, contrasted with $5.4 billion in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
That has freed money for other uses. This year, for example, the federal budget 
for education increased -- after adjustment for inflation -- for the first time 
in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The sales have also permitted better economies of scale, supporting the 
country's export drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterrey-based Alfa Group, one of Mexico's largest industrial 
conglomerates, was able to consolidate marketing and administrative operations 
after buying a state-owned company that makes ingredients used to manufacture 
synthetic cloth. The acquisition complemented plants that Alfa already owned, 
said Juan Morales Doria, executive vice president of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Even the union leaders in some state-owned companies see a positive side to 
privatization. The leader of workers at Telefonos de Mexico has called for 
rapid privatization of the government-owned telephone company. Meanwhile, the 
head of the oil workers union has said the petrochemical industry needs private 
investment in order to modernize. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are concerns about the long-term consequences of 
privatization. They range from fears that the soundest companies are being 
sold, leaving the weakest to founder, to outright skepticism about the motives 
behind the sales. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying such worries are questions about how far the government will go in 
privatizing industry and about what will be left of the implicit economic and 
social pacts that have kept Mexico stable. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of these pacts was an economic system that Mexicans call state 
capitalism. That system made the government responsible for the bulk of 
Mexico's investment capital, providing not just roads and schools but also raw 
materials at subsidized prices for domestic manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years after World War II, the system seemed to work. The economy grew at 
an average rate of 6% a year. However, fiscal deficits also grew as the 
government absorbed failing companies to save jobs and assure continued 
domestic production of everything from buses to refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the government tried to cover these deficits by exporting oil 
from the state-owned petroleum monopoly, then by taking out billions of dollars 
in foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
The effort backfired. Plummeting oil prices and soaring interest rates 
increased the deficits as the government struggled to keep up debt payments. 
There was no money to buy planes for the government's two commercial airlines 
or new equipment for the 64 state-owned sugar mills. 
</P>
<P>
That forced Mexico's leaders to re-examine the country's economic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by its creditors, Mexico opted to give private enterprise a greater 
role in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
De la Madrid, who was president then, scrapped plans for 80 new state companies 
that existed in name only. Special funds that provided low-interest loans for 
everything from financing roads and bridges in border areas to promoting 
manufactured exports were abolished and their functions taken over by state 
development agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sales and liquidations began. By early 1986, the government had 
put 172 companies -- from hotels to auto parts makers -- up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the government said that the telephone company, airlines, steel 
mills, food-processing plants and a state-subsidized grocery chain were 
strategic and would remain in government hands. Since then, the airlines and at 
least one of the food-processing plants have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone company and grocery stores were among the 66 companies targeted 
for sale at the beginning of this year. Last month, the names of two major 
steel mills and all state-owned mining interests were added to the for-sale 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the industries that remain strategic -- untouchable, not for sale -- are 
electric power, banking, oil and basic petrochemicals. But as more companies 
are sold, rumors persist that even parts of these industries will eventually go 
on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns about the future exacerbate present worries that the government 
has sold larger, profitable or easily restructured companies, while smaller, 
troubled state companies have languished without buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials partially addressed that concern last month by announcing 
plans to package the small companies in groups for sale to venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in Mexico accepts the government's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Salinas' strongest opponent in the 1988 presidential 
election, has been especially outspoken in criticizing privatization. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers include multinational corporations -- for example, Anglo-Dutch 
Unilever's $74 million purchase of a cooking oil and pasta plant near Mexico 
City -- and Mexican entrepreneurs. Consortiums of foreign and Mexican 
businesses have been assembled for large buyouts, such as that of Mexicana 
Airlines for $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said he would have preferred to see companies simply given to their 
workers. The government has given 20 companies to worker groups and another 29 
are scheduled for such transfers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the firms transferred have been agricultural distribution and marketing 
companies, which were given to farming cooperatives. Worker groups also get 
preference in sales of companies. However, such sales have not always been 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the National Farmers' Federation was the winning bidder in the 
January, 1988, sale of Algodonera Comercial Mexicana, a cotton marketing firm. 
But by August, 1988, the farmers were missing payments, and the government 
repossessed the company. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the Salinas administration, the company was sold again, this time to a 
group headed by a Mexican businessman for $737,000 in cash and $2 million to be 
paid after the company is reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has been quick to turn down some multinationals. 
Chrysler's offer for DINA, a consortium of auto parts and bus manufacturing 
companies, was rejected as inadequate in October, 1988. A year later, the 
company was sold to a group of Mexican entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Such examples illustrate both the setbacks the Mexican government has 
encountered in its privatization efforts and the determination of the Salinas 
administration to overcome setbacks.

STATE TO LAUNCH ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials today will unveil the first phase of a bold anti-smoking 
advertising campaign built on the theme that smokers are being duped by 
cigarette companies. 
</P>
<P>
The $28.6-million ad campaign, part of a $220-million project funded by the 
Proposition 99 cigarette tax, is expected to infuriate the tobacco industry and 
provoke a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
The winner in the war of words could dictate U.S. smoking trends, said Dr. 
Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the statewide television, radio, print and billboard ads will 
address the advertising practices of the tobacco industry, which health 
officials charge is targeting susceptible groups, such as youths, minorities 
and women. The state's anti-smoking campaign will focus on the same groups. 
</P>
<P>
One anti-smoking advertisement addressing young blacks will feature a song 
about tobacco by the rap musician Deezer D with the lyrics: We used to pick 
it/and now they want us to smoke it. The ad will appear on radio and 
television, including MTV. 
</P>
<P>
Another television spot will depict a smoke-filled office where tobacco 
industry executives are discussing tactics to lure individuals to smoke, 
despite the known health risks of smoking. "We're not in business for our 
health," a fictitious tobacco executive says. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said his office is braced for a backlash from the tobacco industry. And 
Monday, an industry spokesman labeled the state's campaign a "political" first 
step in an attempt to ban cigarette advertising altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kizer: "There is some stuff people will be quite bothered by. I anticipate 
controversy. It's the most competitive, aggressive and largest advertising 
campaign both to discourage people from smoking and prevent them from getting 
habituated. If the campaign is successful, it's going to hurt (cigarette 
sales). And the tobacco industry is going to translate that hurt into 
something." 
</P>
<P>
The advertising and marketing segment of the two-year, anti-smoking campaign is 
considered the key element in achieving the state's goal of a 75% decline in 
smoking by 1999. According to Kizer, smoking is the state's leading preventable 
cause of death and disease, costing Californians $7.1 billion each year in 
health care and lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99, which increased the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack on Jan. 1, 
1989, also includes funding for anti-smoking education in public schools and 
health departments, which would focus on health risks. 
</P>
<P>
The central theme of the advertising campaign, however, is to reverse the 
seductive image of smoking created through decades of cigarette-company 
advertising, Kizer said. The campaign was created by the Los Angeles 
advertising firm of keye/donna/pearlstein. "The objective is to change the 
image that the tobacco industry has created for smokers -- that it's sexy, 
glamorous, youthful -- to it's dumb, dirty, dangerous," Kizer said. "A lot of 
young people may not realize how much they're being duped. They've been sold a 
bill of goods. Some of the ads are going to let them know that 1,000 people 
give up smoking each day by being buried. They (youths) are being recruited to 
take their place." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a tobacco industry spokesman, anti-smoking advertisements 
that address the marketing techniques of cigarette companies would violate the 
intent of Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
"They pitched Prop. 99 as: 'We want to reach underaged children. We want to 
educate children to the purported health effects of smoking,' " said Thomas 
Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a Washington-based industry 
group. "Anything beyond that is not educational, it's political." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria said cigarette advertisements are designed to persuade smokers to switch 
brands, not to attract new smokers. He said he had not seen the state's 
anti-smoking ads and that industry leaders would view the ads before deciding 
whether to respond further. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said: "These ads sound like they are trying to educate adults in terms 
of a political agenda. Those attacks are trying to lay the groundwork for a 
next phase of a political agenda, which is to ban advertising from cigarette 
companies. These people are on a long march toward prohibition of tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
Although most people are aware of the health risks of smoking, the tobacco 
industry has been successful in selling an illusion that smoking is harmless, 
said Paul Keye, who directed the campaign for keye/donna/pearlstein. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-smoking advertisements will attempt to shatter that illusion, he said. 
A full-page ad scheduled to appear Wednesday in newspapers statewide contains 
the message: "First the smoke. Now the mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
"What we really want to do is show the connection between the tobacco industry 
and its advertising and promotional practices," Keye said. "This campaign goes 
right at tobacco companies' predatory marketing." 
</P>
<P>
While smoking rates have fallen 20% among adults in the last two decades, a 
similar decrease has not been seen among minorities, youths or women, Kizer 
said. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, 
high blood pressure, emphysema and several types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In blacks, the rate of lung cancer, which is highly correlated to cigarette 
smoking, is 58% higher than whites. Lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as 
the leading cause of death among women. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of anti-smoking campaigns to influence minority groups is due to 
both the lack of effective education designed for those groups and a shift in 
cigarette-company advertising, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just de facto that the message wasn't reaching these folks. They 
were targeted to think that smoking is a good thing," Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
To counter that advertising, anti-smoking messages must deliver images and 
emotions instead of information, he said. The campaign will rely heavily on 
television spots, most of which will be paid for by the state, although it is 
expected that stations will donate some time for public service spots. Some ads 
will be in Spanish and, possibly, an Asian language. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that respectable people -- teachers or doctors -- standing in a 
room reciting facts about the dangers of smoking has a modest to minimal 
effect," Kizer said. "That's why I think we have to appeal to the visceral 
response. The message is, 'What is cool? Who do I look up to?' " 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will also address the dangers of smokeless tobacco and secondhand 
smoking. In one television ad, a smoker seated next to a nonsmoker inhales on a 
cigarette. The nonsmoker then coughs and exhales the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In another ad, a baby observes his parents smoking and raises his spoon to his 
lips to imitate them. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said the campaign will be monitored for its effectiveness. While 
anti-smoking television spots in the late 1960s appeared successful in reducing 
smoking rates, little evidence exists to prove that such ads work, he conceded.

CERRITOS FINDS TOLERANCE AMID ITS ETHNIC DIVERSITY

<P>
It first came to Alex Beanum during his campaign for the Cerritos City Council 
12 years ago, when he figured he knocked on at least half the doors in this 
quiet enclave of stucco tract homes. 
</P>
<P>
As he trudged through neighborhoods that looked like a bland, cookie-cutter 
version of middle-class suburbia, it suddenly hit him: whoosh . . . the smell 
of curry. Next house: the sizzling aroma of soy sauce and peanut oil. A few 
doors down: a pungent cloud of spices whose origin completely stumped him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be standing at the door and then, bang!" said Beanum, who won the election 
and served eight years as a councilman. "You could smell the cultures." 
</P>
<P>
What Beanum detected with his nose were the first whiffs of a striking ethnic 
migration that even today is difficult to perceive with eyes alone in this 
sedate bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos, according to a 1988 study by two Cal State Northridge geography 
professors, is the most "ethnically diverse" city in the nation, beating such 
gateways of immigration as Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. San 
Francisco finished fourth; Los Angeles and New York didn't even make the top 
30. 
</P>
<P>
The study by James P. Allen and Eugene Turner was based on 1980 census 
information on 13 ethnic groups in more than 2,900 communities around the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, like most people, we expected the larger cities like Chicago, New 
York and Los Angeles to come out on top," Allen said. "I was quite amazed 
because I didn't know anything about Cerritos." 
</P>
<P>
While much has changed in the decade since the last census, Cerritos has only 
solidified its claim to be on the exclusive list of diverse communities. 
</P>
<P>
According to data collected by the USC Population Research Laboratory, 
non-Hispanic whites had become a minority in Cerritos by 1986. Since then, 
their numbers have dwindled even further. They now constitute just a third of 
the population, followed by Latinos at 16%, Filipinos 15%, Koreans 13%, blacks 
12% and Chinese 7%, according to an estimate based on the USC study. 
</P>
<P>
For all its diversity, the city has largely managed to achieve what has been 
elusive for many Southern California communities: a tolerant coexistence of 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Beanum, a black, and Daniel K. Wong, a Chinese-American, have both served as 
mayor. Perry N. Barit, an architect who came to the United States from the 
Philippines 20 years ago, is now head of the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC School District Board of Education, which serves Cerritos, currently 
has one Asian and one Latino among its seven members. In the last 10 years, two 
blacks and two Latinos also have served on the board. 
</P>
<P>
The real test of the city's diversity lies in its neighborhoods. On Beanum's 
small cul-de-sac, he counts whites, Filipinos, blacks, East Indians, Chinese 
and Koreans as neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Many churches now have services in two or three languages and in the schools it 
is not interracial strife, but interracial dating that has become a vexing 
problem for parents and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos Mayor Diana Needham said one reason she believes the city has remained 
peaceful is the rigid land-use plan the City Council drafted nearly 25 years 
ago. The council envisioned an affluent, progressive and tightly zoned 
community. That vision remains intact today. 
</P>
<P>
Its development into a suburban community in the late 1960s coincided with the 
enactment of federal anti-discrimination laws, a burgeoning ethnic middle 
class, and a booming demand for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which is still best remembered for the disastrous 1986 Aeromexico 
airliner crash that killed 82 people, is now known as an expensive pocket of 
suburban living in the sprawling urban stew of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are one of the most diverse ethnically, we are one of the most 
homogenous economically," Needham said. "We have no poor areas, no extremely 
rich areas. That's the key." 
</P>
<P>
Wong, the former mayor and now city councilman, said the pursuit of the good 
life in Cerritos has a well-scrubbed uniformity to it, driven by the 
upper-middle-class mentality that attracted people to the city in the first 
place. "It's a peaceful, harmonious bedroom community," he said. "That's what 
everyone came here for and that's how they want it to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Life in America's most diverse city, however, is still a far cry from the dream 
of the melting pot. It is more like a mosaic, residents say, of separate parts 
laid next to each other, divided by the city's very diversity of languages and 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
One resident said she has never spoken with her Korean neighbors. "I don't know 
them," she said. "I don't even know if they speak English." 
</P>
<P>
At St. John's Lutheran Church, Pastor Donald Koepke tells of how six white 
families left the church after a Chinese-language service was started four 
years ago. "They said: 'This is no longer my community and now they're taking 
away my church,' " Koepke recalled. "I agonize over that." 
</P>
<P>
Even Beanum, a hulking, jovial man who grew up in a black community near 
Detroit and remembers the days of segregation well, said life in Cerritos can 
be as socially separate as when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it peaceful? Yes. Is it tolerant? Yes. But it is no paradise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drive down the four-lane thoroughfare of 195th Street, past the acres of soft 
beige tract homes and neighborhoods surrounded by cinder block walls. The city 
looks like any master-planned community where people wave to each other 
occasionally, but spend most of their time at work or inside with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Turn onto Gridley Road and head for the city's main commercial center, where 
instead of bustling ethnic shops as in Koreatown or Chinatown, flat tracts of 
homes are dwarfed by the Los Cerritos Mall and the rows of car dealers at the 
Cerritos Auto Square. 
</P>
<P>
In 30 years, the city has gone through a whirlwind transformation, from a quiet 
backwater dairy town with more cows than people to a modern suburban community 
where nearly every piece of land has been covered with homes or shopping 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
As late as the mid-1960s, there was nothing here but thousands of acres of 
pastureland. The city was called Dairy Valley -- home to one of the greatest 
milk-producing industries in the world with more than 100,000 cows and just 
3,500 people spread over the broad, open flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
The city incorporated in 1956 in an effort to protect itself from the spreading 
urbanization of Los Angeles. The dairymen feared expansion by the neighboring 
city of Artesia, which they believed was poised to zone the dairies out of 
existence in favor of suburban development. 
</P>
<P>
In a hastily arranged meeting, the dairymen gathered in the tiny offices of the 
Central Milk Producers and began their push for cityhood. The incorporation was 
approved in 1956 by a vote of 441 to 391. 
</P>
<P>
By 1967, the city had become ringed by suburbs and the dairymen eventually 
agreed to sell their land to developers hungry for one of the last major tracts 
of land in the metropolitan area. The city of Dairy Valley took the upscale 
name of Cerritos, or Little Hills in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
It changed in the space of just a few years from an enclave of no growth to one 
of the fastest growing cities in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The first residents to move in were mostly white, but Beanum said a smattering 
of minorities were attracted to this new city rising out of the open fields. 
</P>
<P>
The homes were new, the prices reasonable and the place itself was so new that 
he figured there would be no rules, no ghetto boundaries, no tradition of 
bigotry. "It was like a clean slate," said Beanum, who bought a six-bedroom 
home for $34,000. "A breath of fresh air that smelled like a cow." 
</P>
<P>
Beanum said the first waves of people to move in all seemed to be the same: 
They were young, family oriented and uniformly middle class in their 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he moved in there was an automatic bond as families talked 
about their children's schooling or the latest fads in home improvement. "It 
was great to come out here. We were all in the same boat together," he 
recalled. "You didn't care what color your neighbors were. The only thing you 
worried about was whether they were getting their lawn in fast." 
</P>
<P>
Beanum, whose wife is white, said that as their children grew older and 
graduated from high school, the bond between people began to loosen. With the 
average home price pushing $300,000 now, more and more of the old-timers are 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The largest influx of minorities has come in just the last decade, boosted by 
the migration of Asians, whose population has nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Karim Mulji, a dapper, soft-spoken jeweler from Pakistan, moved to Cerritos 
three years ago, like many other Asians, because of its highly reputed school 
system and lack of crime. The migration of Asians to Cerritos, however, has not 
been nearly as smooth as the first movement of minorities into the city. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers have been far larger and the barriers of language and customs more 
difficult to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
It is a frustrating phenomenon that Koepke of St. John's has been grappling 
with for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Koepke, an energetic, gray-haired pastor who marched with the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala., started a Chinese-language service in 1986 
because of his belief that the church should reflect its community. His goal 
was to forge a single religious family from two disparate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The task, however, has been more daunting than he imagined. "The challenge is 
to develop bridges, but we are not always creative enough to bridge the 
cultural gap," he said. "We have two languages, but not one congregation." 
</P>
<P>
In the parking lot on Sunday mornings, churchgoers at the early morning 
English-language service file out to their cars as the 40 or so people who 
attend the Chinese-language service arrive for their turn in the chapel with 
Koepke's co-pastor, Donald Wu. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and English groups meet several times a year for summer picnics and 
joint services, but Koepke said the dream of one religious family remains 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
Language is only part of the problem. Even Koepke is unsure if two groups that 
meet separately, pray separately and may even have different visions of God, 
can be forged into a single family. 
</P>
<P>
Others share Koepke's frustration in trying to bridge the gap between cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission Chairman Barit said he is constantly trying to get Asian 
and white friends to mix at city or Chamber of Commerce function. But 
inevitably, he sees the different groups of people gravitate toward their own. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking about voluntary interaction, there isn't much," he said. 
"There is still the feeling that white is white and Asian is Asian." 
</P>
<P>
Barit said breaking down barriers has only become harder because of the large 
influx of Asians. When everyone was a newcomer 20 years ago, there were few 
conflicts. Today, Barit said, many of those who moved to Cerritos years ago 
feel the city is being overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling the resentment," he said. "We are not trying to establish an Asian 
community, we are trying to establish an all-American community. It's just 
becoming Asian because we can't help it." 
</P>
<P>
In this year's City Council election, Korean candidate Charles J. Kim raised 
almost twice as much money as the other 12 contenders combined. Much of the 
funding for his campaign came from supporters outside of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one spot in the city where at least part of the dream of a melting 
pot has been achieved, it is in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Mako Nagasawa, a senior at Whitney High School, said one reason for the lack of 
conflict is that no one group has become dominant, unlike Monterey Park, where 
the conflict between longtime residents and the large population of Chinese 
newcomers has been a constant sore point. 
</P>
<P>
Although Asians make up more than a third of Cerritos' population, the number 
of Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, East Indians, Japanese and Vietnamese are small 
by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like part of the majority," Nagasawa said. "At most schools, 
Asians are Asians. But here there are so many different Asians." 
</P>
<P>
His best friend is Chinese and his girlfriend is Korean, he said. "People 
expect you to mix here," he said. "That's the tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Loc Ta, a senior at Cerritos High School, said it's hard not to meet students 
from other cultures because there are so many different ones on campus. "There 
are no boundaries . . . for students, that is. You have to keep your mind open 
because you have no choice here," said Ta, who came to the United States from 
Vietnam when he was 3. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a vexing problem that school administrators have had to deal with 
is interracial dating. "I just spent three hours on that today," said Norman Y. 
Fujimoto, assistant principal at Cerritos High School, after a grueling 
counseling session. 
</P>
<P>
The students get along fine; it's the parents that are the problem, he said. 
"It all goes back to the parents, who are very much Korean, Vietnamese or 
whatever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ta said most of his friends have learned to adapt to their parents' prejudices. 
"I was going out with an Irish girl last year," he said. "I just didn't tell my 
mom." 
</P>
<P>
Eddy Luh, who graduated from Whitney High School, said it was a rude awakening 
when he left four years ago to attend Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Luh, now a senior at Cornell, said it was the first time he felt the sting of 
being different. There was nothing dramatic, just small things, like feeling 
unwelcome in a bar or uncomfortable at not seeing other Asians on the street. 
</P>
<P>
After four years in college, Luh said, he has two groups of friends: one mainly 
white and another mainly Chinese. He has come to accept it as a fact of life 
that the two groups rarely mix. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left Whitney, I had a false idea of how the world is," he said. "When 
you see that it isn't that way, you steer off your line a little bit this way 
and then a little bit that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that Whitney gave of racial mixing is the idea I've been trying to 
stay on," he said. "But that is the ideal you will never achieve again."

MERGER WOULD BOOST SMOG IN L.A. -- REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY COMPLETED ON COMBINING SAN DIEGO GAS 
&amp; ELECTRIC AND SOCAL EDISON. AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS PROMISE TO TAKE A HARD 
LOOK.

<P>
Emissions of air pollutants would increase significantly in the Los Angeles 
region if San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. merges with Southern California 
Edison Corp., according to a draft environmental impact report released by the 
state Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report found, however, that the pollution increases in the Los Angeles area 
and some surrounding communities, including Ventura County, could be offset in 
large part by the merged utility. That could be accomplished, the report said, 
if the utility applied new conservation measures and used San Diego area plants 
when smog alerts necessitated a slowdown of power plants in Los Angeles, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
The report, a yearlong analysis ordered by the state Public Utilities 
Commission, said these and other mitigation measures would cost about $65 
million over 18 years. The two utility companies have said they will save $1.7 
billion over 10 years by combining operations. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, the proposed merger, which would create the nation's largest 
utility company with 4.8 million customers and is widely opposed in San Diego, 
had sparked little interest among Los Angeles air quality administrators. But 
on Monday, Bill Kelly, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, said his office would give the report its full attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to look at the complete impact report and study it 
carefully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the report concluded that the merger would improve air quality in the 
San Diego area because existing Edison power plants in Los Angeles would be 
used instead of older, less efficient plants in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
According to a summary of the 900-page report released by Edison, San Diego 
would experience an overall 5% reduction of nitrous oxide emissions and a 60% 
reduction in power-plant nitrous oxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
But the report found that power-plant nitrogen oxide emissions in the Los 
Angeles region would increase by about a third after the proposed merger. 
Overall, Edison said, total nitrogen oxide emissions in the Los Angeles area 
would increase 0.16% -- 1.7 tons per day above the 1,040 tons a day now emitted 
by all sources. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that more than 3,000 jobs could be lost in San Diego 
County if the merger is approved -- 1,505 directly and about 1,558 secondary 
jobs in related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But a vice president at Edison, Lewis M. Phelps, said Monday that the report's 
authors erred in assuming that all job cuts would be in San Diego County. He 
said the company expects to reduce the work force in San Diego County by 
between 300 and 400 positions. Another 700 or so jobs will be eliminated in 
various sites in Los Angeles, Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps and Michael R. Peevey, an executive vice president at Edison, said they 
were pleased with the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The report gives us a clean bill of health in most areas," said Peevey, citing 
the report's finding that the merger's impact on hazardous materials disposal 
and water resources and fisheries is less than significant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big day for us," Phelps said. "We're gratified that the report 
confirmed what we've been saying all along: this is an environmentally positive 
merger." 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group opposing the proposed merger, said the report's 
optimistic predictions are based on a faulty premise. 
</P>
<P>
"It is premised on the belief that the Los Angelenos will tolerate our air 
pollution. That is unlikely. There are serious air pollution concerns for Los 
Angeles," said Shames, who said the report would hurt the merger's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a knockout punch, but it's a body blow" to the utility companies, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boards of both utilities approved the merger in November, 1988, and 
shareholders of both assented in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The deal must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the 
state PUC.

INFIGHTING DOOMS GOP'S BID FOR CONTROL

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the year the Republicans in the California state Assembly were hoping 
to rise up and seize control from the Democrats for the first time in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Once in power, they could begin to chip away at years of Democratic deeds. They 
would try to give the death penalty new teeth, and free business from onerous 
regulations. Health and welfare programs for the poor would be kept in check. 
Taxes and state spending would be cut. California schools would get new energy, 
if not new money. 
</P>
<P>
But a strange thing happened on the way to a conservative majority. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of controlling the Legislature's lower house, Republicans are on the 
run. They are disorganized and disaffected. Bickering and back-stabbing, they 
are a party divided, sniping at each other as much as at the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Needing 41 seats to hold a majority in the 80-member house, the GOP has only 
33. And the party is struggling to maintain that number. 
</P>
<P>
So bleak is the prognosis today that some Republicans fear they could lose 
several more seats in this year's elections, leaving them perilously close to 
the point where the Democrats would wield an unstoppable two-thirds majority. 
Such a margin would allow the Democrats to pass appropriations bills and 
override gubernatorial vetoes without needing a single Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the doldrums," said conservative Republican Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
of Newport Beach. "We're in disarray." 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have fallen short in the Legislature even as California voters 
have been choosing Republicans for President and governor in every election 
since 1980. The voters, who as a group have become increasingly Republican 
during the last decade, also ousted three Democratic-appointed Supreme Court 
justices, elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate and just barely reelected 
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, who had won two previous races by landslides. 
</P>
<P>
But year after year, the electorate sends a majority of Democrats to both 
houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Various Republicans in the Assembly blame their plight on at least half a dozen 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
Some say that district lines drawn by the Democrats in 1982 have unfairly kept 
Republicans from ever mounting a serious challenge. Others note that a campaign 
finance initiative co-sponsored by Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson may 
have backfired on the party. The initiative stripped legislative leaders of 
their ability to transfer political funds to their allies, making the statewide 
political party operations more important in legislative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, with former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. as chairman, were able to 
out-raise the Republicans by more than $300,000 in 1989, and they spent much of 
their money on a plan using computer technology to target voters and generate 
absentee ballots in record numbers. Republicans, meanwhile, are still using 
campaign methods developed 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But any mere listing of symptoms risks overlooking the illness: The Assembly 
Republican Caucus -- as the group of 33 is known -- is a body at war with 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Personal and philosophical divides cut across the caucus at different angles. 
Some members who should be ideological soul mates hardly speak to each other. 
Others who disagree on many issues find themselves united only in their 
opposition to the current leadership. 
</P>
<P>
These overlapping factions have weakened the party's defenses against a 
Democratic majority led by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the guileful San 
Francisco Democrat who has held his post since 1980. In Brown's 10 years as 
Speaker, the Republicans have elected four different leaders to do battle with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, the Assembly Republicans have been most noteworthy for their 
ability to get Gov. George Deukmejian to veto legislation they opposed. Last 
year, the Assembly GOP began to work actively with Democrats, the Senate and 
the governor and produced several compromises on major policy issues that left 
lawmakers from both parties patting themselves on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, ironically, a leading challenger to Republican Leader Johnson portrays 
these deals as failures rather than successes. 
</P>
<P>
The compromises at issue set the stage for a ballot measure that, if approved 
by the voters in June, would double the state gasoline tax and raise the 
constitutional limit on state spending. Another deal enacted a temporary 
quarter-cent sales tax increase to pay for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, who has tried to oust 
Johnson as Republican floor leader, argues that these bipartisan deals -- while 
applauded by editorial writers -- were bad for Republicans because they blurred 
the distinction between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than raise taxes, McClintock argues, the Republicans should have 
insisted on paying for the $800 million in earthquake relief from the rest of 
the state's $50-billion budget. And rather than advocate a gas tax increase, 
McClintock favors boosting the highway fund by using the present sales tax on 
gasoline purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"Republicans have failed to give the public a good reason to vote Republican," 
McClintock said. "That's a shame, because the polls tell us that they are with 
us on virtually every issue there is." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Johnson brushes off McClintock's criticism, blaming the discord 
within his caucus on "permanent malcontents" who will complain no matter what 
the leadership does. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel supremely confident of my grip on the leadership," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's confidence stems in part from the factionalized nature of his 
opposition. Even members who oppose Johnson do not necessarily agree with 
McClintock's alternative recipe for success. For example, Assemblyman Stan 
Statham, a moderate from Oak Run in Northern California, said he believes the 
party needs a broader focus, not a narrower one. 
</P>
<P>
"Those new Republicans out there, their favorite television program is 
'thirtysomething,' " Statham said, referring to the weekly show popular with 
young professionals. "They are moderates. They don't want to vote for a person 
who sets moral standards for them. We have to make it clear that we are 
middle-ground America, that we include all people and exclude no one." 
</P>
<P>
Other Republican dissidents say they want the GOP caucus to adopt a more 
moderate tone on abortion, although only a handful of the group's 33 members 
support a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion. And they 
complain that on the environment, automobile insurance and other issues of 
concern to Californians, the caucus reacts to events without a coherent program 
to offer as an alternative to the Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), the former 
Republican leader and a Johnson ally, is that the issues with which Republicans 
have been identified "no longer impel the public to turn out and vote." The 
death penalty and taxes, for example, are no longer effective for Republicans 
because the Democrats' position is now similar to their own, Nolan said. The 
Democrats have "given up" on opposing the death penalty and other anti-crime 
legislation, he added, and rarely does a candidate for any office anywhere 
advocate a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"People usually vote because they feel threatened or they're angry," Nolan 
said. "That's what turns out the marginal voter. And we don't have those issues 
anymore. So the party is going through a transition where we are searching for 
a message." 
</P>
<P>
But while the Assembly Republicans are looking inward, Democrats are seizing 
the initiative, going around Republican lawmakers to strike deals with a 
legacy-minded Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Democrats banned military-style assault weapons over the objections 
of most Republicans, and they recently passed a bill to create a 15-day waiting 
period on rifle purchases. Now Democrats and the governor are talking about 
requiring employers to provide health insurance for their workers, an idea that 
goes against the grain of the traditionally pro-business GOP. 
</P>
<P>
This predicament contrasts sharply with the attitude of a few years ago, when 
Nolan was the Assembly floor leader and his troops were charging hard. In 
November, 1986, the Republicans gained three seats to give them 36 and put them 
within striking distance of the 41 needed to capture a majority. It was then 
that 1990 was set as the goal for taking control. 
</P>
<P>
But the seeds of the effort's disintegration may have already been sown. 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts, the downfall actually began in the spring of 1986, when 
Nolan's leadership cadre anointed several candidates in the primary elections, 
bankrolling them with money raised in an intense new fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Nolan's candidates lost the primary elections to home-grown 
Republicans who went on to win the general elections. Two other candidates 
picked by the leadership also won seats. But the Republicans fell short in 
three other races by a combined total of about 12,000 votes, a gap that many 
believe might have been closed had Nolan not used scarce campaign resources on 
battles against Republican Party regulars in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
More determined than ever after these close defeats, Nolan cranked up the 
fund-raising effort another notch. He pressured the business community, 
philosophically aligned with Republicans, to quit giving so much money to 
Democrats. And he hired several consultants to serve dual roles as 
policy-makers and money-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
One of these was Karin Watson, a former agribusiness representative. Watson, 
raising money for Nolan and Hill, was later snared in the FBI sting operation. 
She has pleaded guilty to extorting money for Assembly Republicans while she 
worked for the leadership, and she is cooperating in the ongoing federal probe 
of Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
The cover on the federal sting was blown in August, 1988, just as the fall 
campaigns were beginning. Although Democrats also were targeted in the 
investigation, Nolan, as the GOP member in charge of raising money and 
distributing it, was vulnerable. The Democrats linked several Republican 
candidates to Nolan and the sting, and they went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"That really was a rock in the road to what might have been a pretty decent 
Republican year," said Robert Naylor, who was state Republican Party chairman 
at the time and who in 1984 was defeated by Nolan in a fight for the party 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan downplays the effect of the primary election fights and his involvement 
in the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real problem in this caucus is that there is a whole group of 
people who just are not going to lift a finger to help elect more Republicans," 
he said. "With that attitude -- that we will just sit on our hands unless we 
see how it advantages us internally -- we are never going to get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Johnson, who replaced Nolan as leader after the 1988 elections, 
has been no more able to unite the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after his selection, Johnson angered many in his own party 
by authorizing the mailing of critical letters to voters in the districts of 
three Republicans who were expected to support Speaker Brown's bid for a fifth 
term as Assembly leader. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Johnson tried unsuccessfully to remove a fellow Republican from the 
powerful Assembly Rules Committee, causing further divisiveness. And, repeating 
the tactic that Nolan had used, Johnson stepped into a primary election battle 
by opposing a San Diego County Republican who enjoyed substantial support from 
abortion rights activists. The candidate, Tricia Hunter, won despite Johnson's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson appears now to have enough support within the caucus to hold onto his 
leadership post. But even if he does survive, there is a substantial minority 
who oppose him. And members in every camp seem to agree that the party 
continues to be crippled by disharmony. 
</P>
<P>
"The caucus is just a bunch of individuals looking out for themselves," 
Assemblyman Ferguson said.

BARRINGTON HALL, ONCE HOTBED OF UC RADICALISM, CLOSES 
</P>

<P>
Barrington Hall, UC Berkeley's oldest and most notorious student-run housing 
cooperative, which some viewed as a last bastion of student radicalism, shut 
its doors Monday after a final legal bid to keep it open failed. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a city known for its tolerance of different life styles, the residence 
became a victim of changing attitudes. Since 1985, Barrington Hall had been 
attacked by neighbors over its residents' alleged drug use, noisy parties and 
generally rowdy life style. Last fall, the 18-house University Students 
Cooperative Assn. that operated Barrington voted overwhelmingly to shut 
Barrington. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 165 "Barringtonians" then living at the hall moved on, but 18 
students challenged the vote in court and continued staying in the building. 
They recently moved their belongings out, but have been staying in the house in 
sleeping bags while their attorney tried to postpone their eviction. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the students exhausted their legal options when an Alameda County 
Superior Court judge refused to reconsider a Municipal Court ruling against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Barrington Hall most recently was in the news in March when a party at it 
erupted into a melee between police and more than 500 youths. The five-hour 
confrontation began when police sought to break up the party. More than a dozen 
people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that incident, many current and former Barrington residents considered 
the house, as a sign painted above its entrance stated, "An Oasis of Madness in 
a World Gone Sane." And its passing was noted with dismay by some on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They are destroying the last center of Berkeley radicalism," sophomore John 
Darrah said as he watched sheriff's deputies peacefully evict the last 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to make Berkeley a safe place for wealthy, conservative students. 
They don't want them to get infected with different ideas or learn different 
life styles," said Darrah, one of those who stayed at Barrington until its 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
Added Denise Tukenmez, a three-year resident at Barrington and a biology honors 
student who dyes her hair bright green, "Barrington is a place where you 
learned to accept other ways of thinking and challenge the prevailing ideas in 
society. There's really nowhere else like it." 
</P>
<P>
The outside of the building has suffered from years of neglect. Inside, its 
walls are covered with graffiti and brightly colored murals, many dating back 
to the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the cooperative association say the murals will be painted over and 
the building, worth an estimated $3 million, repaired. The leaders say it will 
be sold or turned into housing for married graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
Barrington had a long history as a center of political activism. 
</P>
<P>
It opened in 1933 after 14 UC Berkeley freshmen banded together to seek 
low-cost, shared housing. The single house they formed grew into the 
1,400-member cooperative association, a nonprofit organization unaffiliated 
with UC Berkeley's administration. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their counterparts in dormitories, students in the co-ops are 
responsible for all work involved in running the houses, with each resident 
required to put in five hours of work per week. The co-op's board is made up of 
representatives elected by each house and sets policy for the association. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Osborne, who lived at Barrington in the late 1930s, remembers its 
residents as leaders of campus support for the leftist Popular Front in the 
Spanish Civil War. "It was a radical hotbed even then," said Osborne, who 
recently retired after owning a Berkeley soda fountain for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, marches in favor of civil rights and against the Vietnam War 
were coordinated out of Barrington. In the 1980s, a new generation of the 
house's residents directed campus campaigns against South Africa's apartheid 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the surrounding community grew less tolerant of 
activities at the house, especially after several incidents in which residents 
admitted using heroin and LSD. 
</P>
<P>
"I have time and time again seen all of these sweet All-American kids come 
through those doors and come out as deadbeats and anarchists," said Beverly 
Potter, a neighbor suing the co-op association for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I'm not against students exploring life, but I am against them 
becoming drug addicts and getting AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Several closure attempts failed, but students in other co-op houses began to 
lose patience with Barrington after their rents were hiked in order to fight 
lawsuits by Potter and other angry neighbors. The association's vote to shut 
down the Barrington followed a September incident in which a minor allegedly 
drank LSD-laced punch at a September party at the house.

DEUKMEJIAN BACKS WILSON ON CRIME BILL

Sen. Pete Wilson and the man he hopes to succeed as governor, George 
Deukmejian, disagree on abortion rights, offshore oil drilling and the 
regulation of dangerous pesticides. But the state's two most prominent 
Republicans showed Monday that they can always find common ground in that old 
GOP standby: crime. 
</P>
<P>
At a Capitol news conference with several crime victims and family members of 
victims present, Deukmejian endorsed Proposition 115 -- the so-called "speedy 
trial" initiative -- which Wilson has sponsored and made a chief component of 
his campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
And Wilson pooh-poohed as a "cynical ploy" Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's 
warning that a provision in the law-and-order ballot measure could threaten the 
abortion rights of California women if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Roe 
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He said Proposition 115 will improve the state's court system. "For better than 
a quarter-century the state Legislature . . . has refused to prosecutors, peace 
officers and the citizens of this state the protections they are entitled to 
have," Wilson said. "There is a fundamental right of all Californians not to be 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said the initiative campaign gives new meaning to the old maxim that 
"justice delayed is justice denied." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the victims and their families who are denied justice as a result of 
these long delays," said Deukmejian, who has built his 28-year political career 
around an anti-crime theme. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Proposition 115 would eliminate pretrial hearings after 
grand jury indictments, give to judges rather than lawyers the right to 
question jurors before a trial and consolidate trials of multiple defendants 
accused of committing the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also conform the right of privacy in California law to that 
in federal law, where the right to privacy is not spelled out in the 
Constitution but instead is subject to the interpretation of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Van de Kamp and several abortion-rights groups argue that this provision 
of Proposition 115 could give new life to an old law on the California books 
that makes certain abortions a crime. That law has been considered 
unenforceable since California voters placed a right to privacy in the state 
Constitution in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson rejected Van de Kamp's use of the abortion-rights argument as an 
underhanded attempt to defeat the initiative. "His tortured legal theory is a 
cynical ploy," Wilson said. "The ballot language makes it clear that this is in 
no way a threat to the existing . . . right of privacy which the people of 
California voted into the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor against 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, is circulating his own 
court-reform bill to get the necessary signatures to put it on the November 
ballot. It is identical to the Wilson initiative, except that it has language 
saying abortion rights would not be affected. Feinstein has endorsed the Wilson 
initiative.

FUN, SUN AND BUNS; 
</P>
<P>
LAID-BACK STUDENTS ENJOY SPRING BREAK AT BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For the guys, the proper beach fashions are loose-fitting shorts and for the 
gals -- well, less seems to be best. And the the bodies should be lean and tan. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the consensus of students on spring break who were taking in 
the mild weather in Pacific Beach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Avowed sun-worshiper, Breneth Badway of Pacific Beach found scenery just 
"fine." She was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Fun, sun and buns," were what brought the group out, said Lisa Evans, one of 
Badway's friends on break from Mesa College. And James, one of the guys in the 
group and a student at San Diego State University, said all he wanted from his 
spring break was: "More girls, less talk, more action . . . girls in 
G-strings." 
</P>
<P>
The group had plenty of people to watch. About 50,000 people took to the city's 
beaches Monday, according to lifeguard Troy Keach. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend crowds reached about 100,000 Sunday, but the people were as mild as 
the breeze, with San Diego beach patrol officers reporting a "quiet weekend." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Officer Mark McCullough said, "There was nothing out of the 
ordinary. Just a couple of drunk and disorderlies and a few bottle violations 
on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Bottles on the beaches are not allowed, but canned beer is, and, along with the 
sound of surf, was the inevitable question: "Wanna beer, dude?" 
</P>
<P>
The department's beach patrol unit has been doubled for the week, from six 
officers to 12, McCullough said, as students from San Diego State, the 
University of San Diego, and other local schools take to the water. 
</P>
<P>
But the extra officers haven't put a damper on the students' spirits, according 
to one Pacific Beach resident who spent the weekend on the beach and at local 
clubs with friends from Northern California and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa De Luca, 21, of Pacific Beach said the crowds were "outta control . . . 
drinking and dancing on the tables." 
</P>
<P>
De Luca, a student at SDSU, said the weekend brought the chance to meet guys 
from out of the area, including Marines on leave from South Carolina and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"They just loved California. . . . They were just so polite and so much fun," 
De Luca said. "They took us to breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
But teen-age revelers heading for Tijuana did not have much fun, especially the 
roughly 800 of them who were turned back at the border during the weekend by 
police checking identifications, said Bill Robinson a spokesman for the San 
Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 pedestrians made it through the gates, and there were only 13 
arrests, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of those were for "public drunkenness," Robinson said, adding that three 
arrests were of juveniles violating curfew and one was of someone who was 
interfering "with a police officer in performance of his duty." 
</P>
<P>
Weather for the rest of the week promises to be fair, but there will be low 
clouds early today and increasing late tonight at the beaches, according to the 
National Weather service. 
</P>
<P>
High coastal temperatures will be from 63 and 68 today and Wednesday, water 
temperature will be about 61 degrees, and the surf will be about 3 to 4 feet at 
12-second intervals, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland it will be fair, with highs from 78 to 82 degrees and lows from 45 to 
53. In the mountains, the skies will be clear and high temperatures will be 
from 63 to 70, lows from 35 to 45. Desert temperatures will be from 85 to 93 
and lows from 50 to 60.

STATE ASSEMBLY, CITY COUNCIL RACES, BALLOT MEASURES FACE VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in parts of San Diego County will decide a special state Assembly 
primary, two Del Mar City Council races and three North County ballot 
propositions today. 
</P>
<P>
Polls in the 78th state Assembly District and throughout the county will be 
open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Persons uncertain of where to vote or who experience 
other Election Day problems can contact the voter registrar's office at 
565-5800 for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In the 78th District primary, the names of nine candidates will be on the 
ballot, but three have withdrawn from the race for the Mid-City Assembly seat 
vacated by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate last December. 
</P>
<P>
The third special state legislative election here within the past six months, 
the 78th District contest has drawn only cursory attention from both the news 
media and potential voters. As a result, most campaign consultants predict a 
turnout of only about 20% of the district's about 173,000 voters. If that 
projection proves valid, roughly half of the votes in the race may have already 
been cast via absentee ballots, nearly 17,000 of which had been received by the 
registrar's office as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unorthodox procedures governing special elections, all candidates of 
all parties will appear on today's primary ballot. If no candidate receives 
more than 50% of the vote, the top vote-getters of each party will compete in a 
June runoff for the remaining six months in Killea's unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a runoff, Republican Jeff Marston, a former aide to San Diego City 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), is all but 
assured of a spot in it, because the only two other GOP candidates withdrew in 
the race's closing weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Four Democrats -- former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch, lawyer Howard 
Wayne, county probation officer A. L. (Bud) Brooks and lawyer Judith Abeles -- 
also are seeking the seat. Peace and Freedom Party candidate Jane Rocio Evans, 
a teacher, is also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In Del Mar, three candidates -- architect Lew Dominy, management consultant J. 
Rod Franklin and investment researcher Chris Helton -- are competing for two 
City Council seats. Voters there also will decide on Measure A, a ballot 
proposition dealing with building height and size regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Two school financing measures will be decided in Encinitas. Proposition B would 
authorize the construction of two elementary schools, and Proposition C would 
establish a $95 annual tax per property parcel for the next five years to help 
reduce class sizes and fund other programs in the Encinitas Union School 
District.

JAIL PLAN WOULD ADD BEDS FOR 1,000 INMATES; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION: SUPERVISOR JOHN K. FLYNN PROPOSES USING EXISTING FUNDS TO EASE 
CROWDING AT COUNTY FACILITIES AND CREATE A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR DRUG OFFENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to build a $19-million, 450-bed expansion of the jail at the county 
government center, expand other corrections programs and create a separate 
facility for inmates convicted of drug-related offenses was proposed Monday by 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plan could be built without additional revenue and would eliminate 
the need to build a larger and more expensive facility on any of five 
controversial rural sites now under consideration by the board, Flynn said. The 
existing jail holds almost three times its 400-inmate capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan would allow us to get our beds much sooner," Flynn said, adding that 
expansion of existing facilities would avoid delays while public hearings are 
held on rural sites, all of which are opposed by nearby cities or residents. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said the county cannot afford to build a jail at a new site because 
voters will not support a half-cent sales tax that would be needed to pay for 
construction. A new jail at one of the rural sites is supported by Ventura 
County Sheriff John Gillespie and other supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do the present plan, we will have to take that money from somewhere, and 
it will probably be from social services," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said his plan would provide 700 new beds for county inmates. An 
additional 300 beds would be provided without any funding specified. 
</P>
<P>
It was Flynn's most recent proposal to cope with the county's burgeoning inmate 
population on a limited budget. His fellow supervisors rejected a similar plan 
Flynn proposed last year, and none contacted Monday supported the expanded jail 
at the county government center. 
</P>
<P>
"You're purely warehousing people," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said of a 
several-story building with no grounds for outdoor exercise, work or 
rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
County officials had hoped to finance, with a half-cent sales tax, an 
800-inmate jail to be built on 100 rural acres. But county officials later 
learned that a two-thirds voter majority would be required for passage of the 
tax proposal -- a margin considered highly unlikely. Officials are now 
considering a scaled-back jail with 400 beds, to be built with existing 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and other supervisors favor a rural site where the jail can be 
expanded over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors are expected to choose one of the five sites within the next three 
months. An environmental impact report released in January selected a 
county-owned site on Toland Road east of Santa Paula as the preferred location. 
</P>
<P>
Other sites considered include one at Todd Road, southwest of Santa Paula; 
Pancho Road, south of Camarillo and east of the Camarillo State Hospital; 
Potrero Road, farther south along the coast, and Hueneme Road, east of the city 
of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
County predictions show that by 2010 the county will have 2,800 more prisoners 
than beds if nothing is done. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn's plan would allow the county to solve its problems without incurring 
more debt that the county cannot afford to repay, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
In Flynn's plan, the county's existing $41 million would pay for the 
$19-million, 450-bed jail in Ventura, the 100-bed expansion of the county's 
Honor Farm in Ojai for $4.2 million, the 100-bed expansion of the Rose Valley 
facility for $4.2 million, the 50-bed addition to the East County building near 
Simi Valley for $2.1 million, and the renovation of a former jail building in 
Oxnard to provide 26 more beds for about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes no funding, however, for Flynn's proposals to build and 
develop a drug-treatment facility, add 300 beds to the work furlough program at 
the Camarillo Airport or build a $10-million parking garage at the county 
government center that would be necessary if the new jail were built there. 
</P>
<P>
Three of four fellow supervisors criticized Flynn's plan for a four-story 
building next to the existing jail as too costly and too short-sighted. But 
they endorsed his efforts to segregate drug offenders, many of whom are 
nonviolent and do not need the expensive confinement of a jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug offenders could be housed in a less severe setting," said Supervisor 
James Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
A facility where inmates would receive drug treatment or rehabilitation could 
ultimately decrease the influx of new inmates, 60% of whom are now jailed for 
drug-related offenses, said Supervisor Maggie Erickson, who supports Flynn's 
plan to finance the program with funds from President Bush's "war on drugs" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you spread the net wider to slow down the sale and use of drugs, that 
brings more people into our jails," she said. "The feds have money available to 
help with that." 
</P>
<P>
JAIL EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
<P>
1. Work Camp: Add 100 beds to existing 90. 
</P>
<P>
2. Honor Farm: Add 100 beds to exiting 241. 
</P>
<P>
3. Ventura County Jail: Add new building with 450 beds to existing 400-bed 
facility; new 1,000-space parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
4. Work Furlough Facility: Add 300 beds to existing 300. 
</P>
<P>
5. East Valley Law Enforcement Facility: Add 500 beds to existing 20.

VENTURA MERCHANTS CASHING IN ON LOCAL STUDENTS' SPRING FLING 
</P>

<P>
Unfazed at the prospect of scholar-sunbathers out on a spree, seaside merchants 
in Ventura County Monday bid welcome to spring break. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: 
</P>
<P>
Vacationing college students double and triple the merchants' income and signal 
the beginning of their busy season. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to spring break," said Dorothy Miller, who owns the Bikini 
Shack, a shop two blocks from the beach in the Pierpont area of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Her business has doubled since the spring intermission began on Friday, Miller 
said. Fringed bikini bottoms are popular with girls this year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Boys too, presumably. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 p.m. about 300 people had wandered through the Village Kite and Toy store 
in Ventura Harbor, employee Ed Back said. On most weekdays it gets three or 
four at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredible difference," Back said. "It's like I can't get my work 
done." 
</P>
<P>
At Charlie's Seaside Cafe and Restaurant, which sits near the San Buenaventura 
State Beach, about 25% more customers are expected to order breakfast, lunch 
and dinner this week, Assistant Manager Traci Hook said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of activity out on the beach, a lot more movement and 
sunbathers," Hook said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's miles of beaches have not yet joined Palm Springs and Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., as meccas for collegians. Most of the beach-goers are from 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
There were some exceptions, including Scott Harris, 20, and Anthony Silva, 20, 
who were motoring to Palm Springs when their car broke down. 
</P>
<P>
The adaptable Cal Poly San Luis Obispo sophomores peeled off their shirts, 
grabbed two drinks from their seven cases of beer and settled onto the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"This week is for girls, beer and fun," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight freshmen from Cal State Northridge continued a three-year tradition by 
camping at McGrath State Beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to fight with smog," said Anthony Granato, 18, of Westlake 
Village. "It's quiet and peaceful, unlike Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that Ventura's spring break is without problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the three days since schools let out for vacation, rangers at state 
campgrounds between Oxnard and Carpinteria have received complaints that youths 
are disturbing the peace, said Andy Zilke, a supervising ranger. Six groups of 
about eight people each had been evicted from campsites by Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They just got a little carried away," Zilke said of one group of roisterers 
that critics said were swearing, throwing beer cans and relieving themselves 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Campgrounds throughout the county, which can hold about 4,000 people, are 
almost all full. 
</P>
<P>
Zilke said about 20% of the campers are unsupervised students between 18 and 25 
years who are searching for the typical spring break. 
</P>
<P>
"We're full to the brim," Zilke said. "The weather seems to be very conducive 
to a pre-summer fling." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities added eight lifeguards to the area's beaches, bringing the total to 
10, in anticipation of big crowds and out-of-shape students mixing suds and 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the ocean has been calm. Lifeguards have rescued one person caught in a 
riptide and treated three minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hardly any waves, and the rip currents are really small," said 
lifeguard Jon Silver, 29, glancing at the bodies baking around him. "It's a 
real good day to break them in for spring vacation."

History almost repeated itself in Bottle Village on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the Simi Valley folk art landmark, auctioned off in 1981 amid 
much controversy, avoided the same fate Monday with just 24 hours to spare. 
</P>
<P>
The village is a unique collection of 13 buildings and 20 sculptures 
constructed from thousands of used bottles, license plates, tools and anything 
else Tressa (Grandma) Prisbrey could drag from the city dump. The property was 
donated in 1986 to a committee dedicated to its preservation, and Prisbrey died 
in 1988.

County tax collectors had set a Tuesday deadline for the payment of back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in and paid $1,112.05, which was all the prior taxes they owed," 
said Cynthia Simmons, manager of the public service division of the Ventura 
County Tax Collector's office. "That puts them out of jeopardy of being sold, 
but they didn't pay this year's. They still have about $900 in current year's 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The delinquent taxes dated back to 1982. If the payment had not been made by 5 
p.m. today, Bottle Village would have been auctioned off in the spring of 1991, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Grandma Prisbrey, who was described in her 1988 obituary as a "wiry, 
cantankerous woman," started her famed Bottle Village in 1955 and worked on it 
for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
What has been described as an eyesore by some neighbors also has received 
international acclaim as folk art. The village occupies a third of an acre at 
4595 Cochran St., including a house made from shot glasses, a wishing well made 
of milk of magnesia bottles and a dollhouse made from 6,000 bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The property and Prisbrey's legacy was auctioned off in 1981 because the owner 
had defaulted on a mortgage. After changing hands several times, the site was 
donated in 1986 to a committee dedicated to its preservation. Back taxes had 
not been paid, and continued to accumulate, according to Helen Dennert, 
president of the preservation committee. 
</P>
<P>
The tax payment was made about 3 p.m. Monday, Dennert said, leaving the 
committee with no funds and debts of $2,745. 
</P>
<P>
Bottle Village has been closed to the public since 1982, when the city of Simi 
Valley shut it down for violating safety codes. Dennert said it will reopen if 
the city grants a special use permit, allowing tourists to walk around the 
site, but not enter the buildings. But costly renovations are needed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If a long-sought tax exemption is not secured for Bottle Village, another 
$1,800 in taxes will be due next year. JEFF SCHNAUFER and PEGGY Y. LEE

<P>
Mupu Elementary School District of Santa Paula received $4,333 as its quarterly 
share of proceeds from state lottery sales, about the same amount received last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the funds are earmarked for fine arts and student field trips," 
Principal Mark Stevens said at Monday's school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Previous lottery earnings have been paid to teachers as salary bonuses, Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the three-member school board also agreed to make the final 
$673 payment for a trip that seventh- and eighth-graders took last year to 
Astro Camp near Big Bear Lake. Donations and student fund-raisers financed the 
remainder of the trip, which cost nearly $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted to allow girls' Mini Sox baseball practice on school 
grounds and made a formal request to purchase an awning for the school's lunch 
area. RUSS CHARVONIA

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET FOR BROTHERS IN MENENDEZ 
SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A preliminary hearing for two brothers charged with killing their wealthy 
parents in Beverly Hills will be held in late May to allow resolution of a 
legal battle over tape-recorded evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Charles Rubin scheduled the hearing for May 24, two days after 
a Santa Monica judge is to decide whether taped conversations between the 
defendants and their psychologist can be used at their trial. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Menendez, 19, and his brother, Lyle, 22, answered "Yes, your honor," when 
asked Monday if they would waive their right to a speedy hearing. The two, who 
appeared in dark business suits, are accused in the shotgun murders of their 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc., and his 
wife, Kitty, 44.

77-ACRE TRACT, MALL PROJECT TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a 77-acre residential and retail project on the northeast 
corner of Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road is scheduled for consideration 
today by the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The project would include 454 single-family homes and condominium units, and a 
51,275-square-foot retail center. 
</P>
<P>
In order to approve the project, the council must rezone the entire site and 
amend the general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Planning Commission narrowly rejected the project. Although the 
vote was 4 to 3 in the project's favor, general plan amendments require the 
support of at least five commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The three commissioners who voted against the project said they believed the 
proposed residential development is too dense. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Lindo Neighborhood Council, a group of nearby residents that has met 
several times with the developer, Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills, opposes the 
commercial portion of the project. In a letter to the commission, neighborhood 
council Vice Chairman Jay Holsinger said the group fears the retail center 
would increase traffic congestion. HUGO MARTIN

600 IMMIGRANTS RUSH TO INS OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
AMNESTY: A SHORTAGE OF TEMPORARY WORK CARDS TRIGGERS THE FALSE RUMOR OF A 
DEADLINE FOR APPLYING FOR LEGAL RESIDENCE. POLICE OFFICERS ARE CALLED IN TO 
CONTROL THE CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 600 immigrants flooded an Immigration and Naturalization Service 
office in Sepulveda Monday morning, mistakenly believing a rumor that today was 
the deadline to apply for legal residence status under the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor apparently started Wednesday afternoon when the San Fernando 
Legalization Office on Parthenia Street ran out of the temporary work 
authorization cards issued to illegal aliens who have applied for residency 
under amnesty programs. 
</P>
<P>
Because they could not issue work cards, the office stopped accepting amnesty 
applications and told prospective applicants to return this week. The office 
continued to turn away applicants last Thursday and Friday, said Richard 
Walden, chief legalization officer of the Northridge Amnesty Office. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people who had been turned away became concerned that the program was 
about to end," Walden said. "It was a wildfire rumor that got out. Word got 
around the community quickly. The rumor mill works very effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Divided in language but united in their confusion and desire for a green card, 
sari-clad women, turbaned men, immigrants in work clothes and others in suits 
milled around the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the office, staff members processed the applications of about 170 people 
who had been allowed inside while six police officers, speaking with the aid of 
the loudspeakers on their patrol cars, urged the rest of the crowd to leave and 
return another day. 
</P>
<P>
An immigration lawyer stood amid the crowd, repeating that the program was not 
closing and warning those in line that immigration officers might deport them 
if they did not leave immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Although the original amnesty program established by the federal government was 
scheduled to end in May, 1988, it has been extended by court rulings that found 
the initial eligibility requirements too strict. 
</P>
<P>
Those court rulings are being appealed by the INS, and until the issues are 
completely litigated, amnesty offices must continue accepting applications for 
amnesty, Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of the work cards stems from an increasing number of aliens 
applying for amnesty to get work permits -- and some "bureaucratic snafus," 
Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the San Fernando office processed about 15 applicants a day, but now 
about 300 people a day come to apply. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in applicants is probably caused by an increasing awareness about the 
court-ordered extension and by a growing number of people who realize they can 
get temporary work permits just by filling in a minimal amnesty application, 
Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid supplies blank work authorization cards, upon which immigration 
officials affix the photograph of the applicants who show the cards to 
employers as a form of identification and proof of their right to work. 
</P>
<P>
Walden said he ordered more cards in January but was told that the company had 
stopped producing them, thinking the amnesty program had ended. 
</P>
<P>
As his supply ran lower, Walden said, he contacted the regional INS office and 
asked officials to locate extras from other offices. 
</P>
<P>
A spare box of 1,700 cards was located early last week in Stockton, but a clerk 
there -- ordered to dispatch them to Northridge by overnight mail -- 
accidentally sent them through the regular postal service. 
</P>
<P>
The cards arrived from Stockton Monday afternoon.

'ABANDONED' ISLANDERS BUILD CORE OF FOLLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There weren't any stretch limos delivering 7-foot-tall players earning 
seven-figure salaries. But fans of the Santa Barbara Islanders nonetheless were 
treated to a spirited basketball game Sunday night as the local favorites were 
defeated by the Rapid City Thrillers, 127-100. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders -- whose players average about $10,000 annually -- became an 
abandoned franchise in February after the Continental Basketball Assn. team's 
managing partner reportedly failed to pay rent at the team's former home, Santa 
Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials decided to move the club to Ventura College to complete 
post-season play and Ventura has since welcomed the team with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
And now that the "Cinderella" Islanders have advanced to the final round of the 
national conference playoffs, their local popularity has been even greater. 
While an estimated 600 fans travel from Santa Barbara to Ventura to view the 
games, most of those attending recent games were from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first game," said Tom Flaminio of Ventura. "I'm here primarily out 
of curiosity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders are up against the wall following Sunday's loss, which put the 
Thrillers of South Dakota ahead 3-2 in the best of seven series. Unless the 
Islanders win both remaining games Monday and Tuesday, fans may have witnessed 
their final professional basketball game in Ventura for a while. 
</P>
<P>
The CBA considered permanently relocating the Islanders to Ventura County about 
six months ago, but the absence of a local arena that could accommodate 6,000 
fans forced the league to scuttle the idea, said CBA Vice President Bob King. 
"We were very impressed with the demographics in the Ventura area," King said. 
</P>
<P>
The CBA, which took over ownership of the Islanders after the previous 
management defaulted on payments, is talking to about 10 groups who may want to 
buy the team and keep them in Santa Barbara, King said. The franchise fee is 
about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great basketball," said Steve Rifkind, a Solvang doctor who claims to 
be the Islanders' first season ticket-holder. "Half the players came from the 
NBA, and the other half is headed for the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Kearny, who accompanied Rifkind to the game, recalled that he often 
would "drive to the top of San Marcos pass so that he could receive the radio 
broadcasts of Islander away games." 
</P>
<P>
If the Santa Barbara Islanders prove victorious in the final games against the 
Thrillers, they will advance to the league championship playoffs against either 
LaCrosse, Wis., or Albany, N.Y. RUSS CHARVONIA

OREGON JUDGE THROWS OUT METZGER SUIT 
</P>

<P>
PORTLAND, Ore.

<P>
A judge threw out a counterclaim Monday and ordered an Oct. 8 trial in a 
$10-million lawsuit accusing California white supremacist Tom Metzger of 
inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian man. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, leader of the White Ayran Resistance, is accused in the wrongful-death 
suit of encouraging racial violence among his followers, three of whom were 
convicted of involvement in the November 1988 fatal beating of Mulugeta Seraw 
outside his Portland apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, who lives in Fallbrook in northern San Diego County, has denied any 
responsibility for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a public-interest law firm in Montgomery, 
Ala., and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, a New York-based Jewish 
organization, filed the lawsuit last fall against Metzger, his son, John, White 
Aryan Resistance and two Skinheads convicted of taking part in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger is acting as his own attorney in the case, and he filed a countersuit 
in January, claiming that Seraw and two friends had provoked the violence and 
that Metzger and his group were damaged as a result. 
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute hearing, Metzger told the judge the Southern Poverty Law 
Center and Klan Watch are "two major organizations committed in print to the 
destruction of Tom Metzger." He criticized "a nationwide media blitz" aimed at 
raising "massive amounts of money with wild attacks on Tom Metzger." 
</P>
<P>
"So I probably have been damaged as much as anyone could be damaged," Metzger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Multnomah County Circuit Judge Ancer Haggerty dismissed the countersuit on the 
grounds that it was not a valid claim, said Portland attorney Elden Rosenthal, 
who will represent the plaintiffs along with Morris Dees, a civil rights 
activist and head of the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
A small crowd followed Metzger out of the courtroom and to his car, chanting, 
"Ban the Nazis, ban the Klan! No more Metzgers in our land!" Metzger grinned at 
the entourage behind him, doing a slight jig in time to the chant at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Dees has been working on Seraw's case since April, 1989. He first filed the 
suit in a federal court but refiled it in state court in November after 
deciding that was a more suitable venue. 
</P>
<P>
Seraw was beaten to death in November 1988 as he and two friends were getting 
out of a car in front of Seraw's home. Three Skinheads confronted them, and 
Seraw was killed by a blow to his head with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit have been mailing out copies of the autopsy photo 
of Seraw's skull and a letter asking for funds to support the case.

FAN WHO THREATENED ANCHORWOMAN GETS 3 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A West Los Angeles man who told a co-worker that he was going to shoot KNBC-TV 
news anchorwoman Kelly Lange was sentenced Monday to three years in state 
prison, the maximum penalty allowable under a recently enacted law prohibiting 
"terrorist threats," prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Sevy Hudson, 57, who had been writing the newscaster for five years, was 
convicted in December on one count of making a terrorist threat under a law 
restored to the California Penal Code in 1988, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan J. 
Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson was "obsessed" with Lange, Gruber said. He inundated her with cards, 
gifts, flowers and phone calls, and spoke of her to his co-workers as if they 
had a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts were returned, and Lange never met or spoke to Hudson, but "he told 
people they were engaged to be married," Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the letters were flattering and affectionate, but others were hostile, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Lange testified that, several years ago, she received a 
postcard from Hudson that said "something to the effect of 'I am going to blow 
your head off in the parking lot some night, and you are never going to know 
what hit you.' " 
</P>
<P>
After he was fired last August from the telemarketing firm where he worked, 
Hudson told a former co-worker that he was "bored with life" and was going to 
Burbank to shoot Lange, Gruber said. Prosecutors who filed the case against 
Hudson last year said that he was "despondent" because he felt that Lange did 
not understand him. 
</P>
<P>
The co-worker reported Hudson's threats, and he was arrested Aug. 11, 1988, in 
a motel where he lived. Authorities found a .38-caliber handgun, a shotgun and 
ammunition in his room. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing Monday, Hudson's attorney, Deputy Public Defender James 
Coady, argued that his client should receive probation since he has no prior 
criminal record. But Gruber asked that Hudson receive the maximum penalty 
allowable so that he could undergo extensive psychiatric therapy before 
returning to society. 
</P>
<P>
"He does need treatment. He does need care. Sometimes we sentence for 
rehabilitation, and that sentence was certainly part punishment and part 
rehab," Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>
A KNBC spokeswoman said Monday that neither Lange nor the station had any 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
A recent spate of threats and acts of violence against celebrities has produced 
legislation designed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Leigh Penn, a woman described by police as obsessed with actress Sharon 
Gless, was arrested March 30 after allegedly barricading herself inside the 
actress's Studio City house and threatening to kill herself. In July, a 
19-year-old Arizona man described as an "obsessed fan" allegedly shot actress 
Rebecca Schaeffer to death at the door of her Los Angeles apartment.

<P>
Complaining of noxious odors and hazardous chemical releases, the city of El 
Segundo is suing Los Angeles to force environmental and safety improvements at 
the giant Hyperion sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, asks the court 
to take jurisdiction over hazardous materials and construction projects at 
Hyperion. That would make the plant more responsive to residents' complaints 
about fumes, noise and dust, said El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks $8 million in punitive damages in connection with a March 
19 incident in which three residents near the plant suffered headaches, nausea 
and burning eyes, apparently from fumes. One woman was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said he could not comment 
on the suit because his office had not yet received a copy. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo City Council announced in December that it would sue Los Angeles 
because of problems it blamed on Hyperion, which borders El Segundo on the 
west. The council authorized the suit March 23 after lawyers for the city had 
taken statements from more than 100 residents who complained about odors from 
the facility. Some said they suffered health problems as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the March 19 incident that prompted city leaders to unanimously 
approve the suit, City Manager Ron Cano said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Hyperion officials covered up the causes of the chlorine 
odor that residents complained of March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials said at the time that a scrubbing device used to remove 
hydrogen sulfide gases had malfunctioned, but they added that it was unclear 
whether the problem had caused the smell cited by residents. Officials from the 
city and the South Coast Air Quality Management District said they could not 
pinpoint the source of the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that the problem stemmed from the mishandling of "chlorine or 
some other similarly harmful material" at Hyperion. In seeking the punitive 
cash damages, the city alleges that Hyperion officials "failed to be fully 
cooperative" with the El Segundo and AQMD investigators.

BROOKS' HOMER BRINGS MCKEON SECOND GUESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, engulfed by a sea of note pads, microphones and 
cameras, kept looking around the room Monday afternoon, just waiting for 
someone to break the silence. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he pleaded for someone to ask that first question. At least make a 
comment. Heck, even a cough would do. 
</P>
<P>
At last, The Question, the one on everyone's minds, slowly began tumbling 
forth: "Uh, Jack, uh, do you think, maybe you left Bruce Hurst in the game, uh, 
a bit too long?" 
</P>
<P>
While reporters ducked for cover, McKeon sat back in his office chair and 
laughed, nodding to pitching coach Pat Dobson, as if to say, "I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were plenty of culprits in the Padres' 4-2 season-opening defeat to 
the Dodgers in front of 48,686 fans at Dodger Stadium, but McKeon was the one 
left fending off the questions. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter that the top five batters in the Padre lineup -- Bip 
Roberts, Roberto Alomar, Tony Gwynn, Jack Clark and Joe Carter -- went one for 
20 with six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't do our jobs, and we didn't even get on base," Gwynn said. "I'm 
not going to sit here and place the blame on somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter that the middle of the order -- Gwynn, Clark and 
Carter -- came to the plate just once with a runner on base, and failed to even 
move him over. 
</P>
<P>
"That just can't happen night after night if we're going to win," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't even seem to matter that Hurst was the one who left the forkball 
hanging over the plate in the eighth inning, yielding a two-out, three-run home 
run to Hubie Brooks, that erased a 2-1 Padre lead and resulted in their sixth 
consecutive opening-day defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who threw the pitch," Hurst said, "I'm the one who's responsible, 
you can't blame anybody else. And that's the way it should me." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter who was accepting the blame, it was McKeon who decided to leave 
Hurst in the game, and it was McKeon who sat in his office for almost an hour 
afterward, explaining why. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even think about taking him out," McKeon said. "The way he was 
pitching, and with his stuff, the last thing on our minds was that he'd hit a 
three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, the way he was pitching, I'd take my chances again every 
time. It's not too often you're going to see something like that happen with 
Hurst on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, indeed, was just nine outs away from joining Bob Feller as the only 
pitchers in major-league history to throw no-hitters on opening day. He had 
retired 16 of the past 17 batters he faced, allowing just two fly balls into 
the outfield, when he took the mound in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he was pitching," McKeon said, "I really thought he had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, just setting the stage for the ruination of Hurst's day, broke up the 
no-hitter with a leadoff single to center field. Eddie Murray followed with 
another single to left, and within seconds, Greg Harris and Mark Grant were 
warming up in the Padre bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
They never were needed. Kal Daniels sacrificed the runners over, and Hurst 
induced ground outs to Jeff Hamilton and Mike Scioscia, resulting in just one 
run. 
</P>
<P>
When Hurst took the mound in the eighth, he still had made only 76 pitches, no 
more than 13 pitches in any inning after the first. Really, Hurst said, he felt 
as good now as he did when he opened the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope nobody's second-guessing Jack," Hurst said, "because I felt OK. I 
wasn't tired at all." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, playing it cautious, had Craig Lefferts and Calvin Schiraldi warming up 
in the bullpen when Hurst opened the eighth. Alfredo Griffin, the Dodgers' No. 
8 hitter, led off the inning with a single to left field. He moved over to 
second on Jose Gonzalez's sacrifice bunt, and went to third on Juan Samuel's 
fly ball to right field. But with two outs, Hurst walked Willie Randolph on 
five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"That really didn't bother me, though, because Randolph has hurt me in the 
past," said Hurst, who knew better than anyone else that Randolph had a career 
.393 batting average (33 for 84) against him. "I just didn't want to make a 
mistake to him." 
</P>
<P>
As Brooks strode to the plate, Dobson went to the mound to chat with Hurst. 
Dobson asked Hurst how he felt. He told him not to forget about Randolph at 
second. And he pleaded with him not to leave a ball up in the strike zone to 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson walked to the dugout. Hurst was left standing on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were taking him out," Griffin said. "He was hanging a couple of 
pitches to me that he wasn't doing in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when they left him in, we had a good chance, because he wasn't pitching 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson barely had sat down on the bench when Hurst let go of a forkball that 
stayed high in the strike zone. Brooks swung. The ball landed 400 feet away 
over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was gone just when I heard that crack," said Gwynn, playing in right 
field. "When you hear a sound like that, you know it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brooks: "I was just hoping I'd get a single and tie it up, but it didn't 
work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst finished out the inning by retiring Eddie Murray on a ground out to third 
base, but it was too late. The damage was done. And three outs later, when the 
Padres failed to score against reliever Don Aase -- recording just his fifth 
save in four seasons -- the second-guessing commenced. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say, he made a bad pitch to the wrong guy," Dobson said. "If he 
had thrown that same pitch to Alfredo Griffin, it's probably a fly ball to left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was no talk of taking him out, whatsoever. He deserved the chance to 
win or lose that game. I guarantee if we give him that same chance 15 more 
times this year, he gets out of it 13 or 14 times." 
</P>
<P>
There, of course, was speculation that the Padres' decision might have been 
different if they still had Mark Davis in the bullpen. You remember the guy? He 
saved 44 games and won the Cy Young award last season, but took off for Kansas 
City and their four-year, $13 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
So what about it, if Davis was around, would he indeed have been in the game? 
</P>
<P>
"If we had Mark Davis, we would have done the exact same thing," Dobson said. 
"Maybe if he (Hurst) had finished that inning, we might have gone to the 
bullpen, but not there. It wouldn't have mattered who was in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
Said catcher Benito Santiago, who went three for three and was hit by a pitch 
in his four plate appearances: It might have made a tough decision, but we 
don't have Mark Davis any more, so we can't even think of that." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres instead were left thinking about the 161 remaining games on their 
schedule, laughing at the notion that opening day was more important than any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
OK, sure, so maybe outfielder Darrin Jackson wouldn't be in full-uniform by 
9:25 in the morning any other day. It's doubtful Clark will be shaking hands 
with all of his teammates before another regular-season game, telling them to 
have fun. And third baseman Bip Roberts is unlikely to have butterflies before 
any other game before mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
But it still counts the same. Just one of 162. 
</P>
<P>
If there needed to be a reminder of the relative insignificance of a 
season-opener, one only needed to talk with Jackson on Monday morning. Jackson, 
who battled testicular cancer in 1987, was reading a front-page article in the 
morning paper about Ryan White, the 18-year-old from Indiana who died Sunday 
after a five-year bout with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"That changes your perspective of things in a hurry, doesn't it," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lynn, who never before had faced Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, homered in 
the second inning on the second pitch he had ever seen from Hershiser. When 
asked what his teammates told him of Hershiser before the game, he said, "They 
told me I'd probably be going zero for four." . . . Dodger fans let Padre first 
baseman Jack Clark know they still have a good memory Monday, booing him loudly 
during the pre-game introductions. Clark, in case you forgot, hit the home run 
in the 1985 playoffs off Dodger pitcher Tom Niedenfuer, vaulting the St. Louis 
Cardinals into the World Series. . . . Tony Gwynn was asked by ESPN announcer 
Chris Berman which nickname he preferred: Tony Gwynn One for the Gipper; Tony 
the Mighty Gwynn; or Tony Gwynn, Lose or Draw. Gwynn chose the first; his 
brother, outfielder Chris Gwynn of the Dodgers, was left with the second 
nickname. . . . This was the first of four home-openers the Padres will be 
participating in over the next eight weeks. The Padres, who will have their 
home-opener at 7:05 tonight at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, also will be in 
the San Francisco Giants' home-opener Friday, and the Cincinnati Reds' 
home-opener April 17. . . . The crowd of 48,686 at the game Monday was 12,572 
more than the Padres played in front of during their combined 14 
spring-training games. . . . Former Padre pitcher Dave Dravecky, who retired 
from baseball last season because of a bout with cancer, will throw out the 
opening pitch tonight in the Padres' opener against the Dodgers. There also 
will be presentations of 1989 Gold Glove awards before the game to Gwynn and 
Benito Santiago. Gwynn also will receive his fourth Silver Slugger award.

COMPUTER FIRMS UNABLE TO AGREE ON SINGLE UNIX SYSTEM

<P>
Merger talks have ended between an AT&amp;T unit and a consortium of rival 
computer makers developing a different version of an important computer 
operating system, the groups said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement means that two major versions of the Unix operating system 
will be promoted in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
An operating system is the base layer of software that controls such computer 
functions as operating the keyboard and opening files. It differs from 
applications programs, which provide such specific uses as word processing or 
spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
The talks were aimed at merging the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
division that develops and sells AT&amp;T's version of Unix with the Open 
Software Foundation, a nonprofit company formed by AT&amp;T rivals to promote 
another version of Unix. Also included in the merger would have been Unix 
International, a group of Unix users set up by AT&amp;T to advise it on Unix 
development. 
</P>
<P>
David Tory, president of the Open Software Foundation, said his group entered 
into the merger discussions with the expectation that a merged organization 
would not be controlled by AT&amp;T or any other company. 
</P>
<P>
"However, an agreement on that principle could not be reached," he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Cunningham, president of Unix International, said AT&amp;T never proposed 
giving itself an upper hand in the merged group. Instead, he said, the talks 
collapsed when Open Software Foundation members couldn't solve disputes among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T developed Unix 21 years ago, but other computer makers later devised 
incompatible variations of it. That means applications software developed for 
one version of Unix usually can't be used on a computer running on another 
version. 
</P>
<P>
But in announcing that merger talks had broken off, the groups said they had 
agreed to adhere to a number of industry standards in developing Unix. 
</P>
<P>
Unix is becoming the operating system of choice as computer companies 
increasingly introduce machines that adhere to industrywide standards.

DEVELOPMENT FEE PLAN DRAWS SHARP PROTEST IN OTAY MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new fee to be levied on real estate development as a means of funding 
low-cost housing in San Diego has drawn sharp protests from Otay Mesa 
manufacturers and developers, who say the tax could end up inhibiting business 
expansion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Foster, vice president of Sanyo North America, which operates a huge 
refrigerator factory in Otay Mesa, said the tax would add about $400,000 to the 
cost of a $10-million-plus, 400,000-square-foot addition planned at the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanyo has made no definite decision on whether or when to build the 
addition, Foster said, the tax would be an inhibiting factor. He said Sanyo, 
which employs 400 workers at its 330,000-square-foot plant in Otay Mesa, moved 
there from the Kearny Mesa area so it would have room for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council passed the tax measure by a 5-4 margin March 26. If 
the measure passes a second time at the council's second reading April 16, it 
will take effect within 60 days. The rule would impose a fee of from 50 cents 
to $2 per square foot on all new industrial warehouse, office and retail 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-member Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce is campaigning against the tax, 
whose monies would go into a city-administered housing trust fund. By adding 
30% to the fees already being paid by developers of industrial buildings on 
Otay Mesa, a cost that eventually will be passed along to tenants, the tax will 
make Otay Mesa a less desirable place for businesses, the chamber says. 
</P>
<P>
"The development industry is holding the load instead of these costs being 
spread out," said Andrea Korogi, the chamber's executive vice president. Bob 
Filner, the city councilman whose district includes Otay Mesa, voted with the 
majority to approve the tax, she said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the $12-million tax is a key element in helping balance a 
$60-million shortfall projected for the fiscal year that begins July 1.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Japanese stock market averages move up and down chaotically, U.S. 
stocks continue to hold their own on low volume, said Irving Katz, director of 
research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The time is drawing near for U.S. companies to release their first quarter 
earnings, and expectations are that many of them will report a decline in 
profits, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, American stocks continued to show little change in price. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks seem to be dividing into two tiers, with the only major 
movements of one point or more, up or down, being made by the stocks of larger 
companies that have attracted institutional investors. In contrast, smaller 
capitalization stocks are hardly moving in price, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside this week were: Magma Power, gaining back the $2 it lost the 
previous week; Xytronyx, up $1.375, and Chart House Enterprises and Cubic 
Corp., each up $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Price Co. stock reacted to its recently reported flat 
second-quarter earnings, dropping $2; Rohr Industries, one of the unfavored 
defense stocks was down $1.875, and HomeFed Corp., Maxwell Laboratories and 
Molecular Biosystems, each were down $1 . 
</P>
<P>
New lows were recorded this week by Advanced Marketing Services at $5.75; 
Agouron Pharmaceuticals at $8, and Synbiotics at $3.125. 
</P>
<P>
A good gain was made by Beeba's Creations, up $.375 after reporting excellent 
second-quarter earnings of $.27 per share, versus $.22 for the comparable 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Computer &amp; Communications Technology (CCT) was the largest percentage 
gainer of the week, gaining $.375 to close at $.875 as it announced it would 
merge with Sunward Technologies, a private company. Sunward will own 55% of the 
outstanding stock of the combined companies.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL SERIES TARGETS L.A. PHILHARMONIC PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Seeking the increasingly elusive orchestra subscriber seems to be the toughest 
challenge of music administrators in the 1990s. For its 1990-91 season, the San 
Diego Symphony is offering no fewer than eight series to lure patrons to 
Symphony Hall on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic announced last week that, after 69 years of 
playing a San Diego series, it is throwing in the towel, blaming scheduling 
difficulties at Civic Theatre and a serious downturn in subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago, prospective patrons to the local Philharmonic series had 
to join a waiting list to purchase a subscription. The Philharmonic's April 28 
Civic Theatre concert will be its swan song in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to overlook an opportunity, Neale Pearl, executive director of the La 
Jolla Chamber Music Society, quickly dispatched his glossy brochure for the 
society's 1990-91 International Orchestra series to local Philharmonic 
subscribers. Pearl hopes to sign up disappointed Philharmonic fans for the 
society's upcoming performances of four guest orchestras in Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The third season of the society's series of imported orchestras will open Jan. 
28, 1991, with the return of the Moscow State Symphony, under Yevgeny 
Svetlanov. Duo-pianists Katia and Marielle Labeque will play the Poulenc 
Concerto for Two Pianos with the Orchestra de Paris on March 6, 1991. (The last 
time the sisters Labeque visited San Diego, they were memorable more for their 
wardrobe than their music-making.) Maestro Kurt Masur and the Leipzig 
Gewandhaus Orchestra will perform April 22, 1991. To complete the ambitious 
series, pianist and conductor Philippe Entremont will lead the Vienna Chamber 
Orchestra on May 4, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl noted that the society's orchestra series is the hardest to sell. Even 
with the undeniable cachet of the Philadelphia Orchestra capping the 1989-90 
orchestra series, subscription sales were just under Pearl's prudent 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the society's other downtown series, the tony brand-name 
Celebrity Series at Civic Theatre, is a promoter's dream. Soprano Kathleen 
Battle's Nov. 17 recital opens the series, followed by pianist Emanuel Ax in a 
solo recital. Soviet-born pianist Yefim Bronfman, who made a strong impression 
on local audiences in SummerFest '89 concerts, will return in concert with the 
Guarneri Quartet on Feb. 16, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter will play an all-Brahms recital Feb. 21, 1991. The 
series winds up with the English Chamber Orchestra and violinist Pinchas 
Zukerman in the dual role of soloist/conductor. Zukerman will solo in J. S. 
Bach's E Major Violin Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
SONOR kudos. When UC San Diego's contemporary music ensemble SONOR made its New 
York City debut the last week of March, New York Times critic Bernard Holland 
gave the group two thumbs up. Performing their most demanding repertory -- 
Ferneyhough, Xenakis, Reynolds, Erickson and Yuasa -- SONOR was lauded for a 
well-conceived, well-played program. In Reynolds' most recent composition, a 
violin concerto titled "Personae," soloist Janos Negyesy was praised for his 
authority in executing the composer's bravura passages. The SONOR performance 
was given at Columbia University's Kathryn Miller Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Felix turns judges into fans. On March 29, 15-year-old Felix Fan won the grand 
prize and the first prize among cellists in the National Solo Competition of 
the American String Teachers Assn. The competition was held at the University 
of Maryland, and Fan's awards were in the precollege division. Fan, a student 
at the Bishop's School in La Jolla, was awarded $2,000 for his exemplary 
performance of Bartok's "Rumanian Folk Dances" and Saint-Saens' A Minor 
Concerto.

Renowned author Mario Vargas Llosa, who won the first round of Peruvian 
presidential elections, is likely to lose to surprise runner-up Alberto 
Fujimori in a runoff vote, political analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, an agricultural engineer and the son of Japanese immigrants, rose 
from political obscurity in the last month to finish second in Sunday's 
first-round voting. 
</P>
<P>
The alignment of parties whose candidates were eliminated Sunday favors 
Fujimori in the runoff, to be held June 3. If it were held immediately, 
analysts said, Fujimori's popular momentum would carry him to certain victory. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa won about 32% of the votes Sunday to Fujimori's 29%, according to 
unofficial but reliable projections. Conclusive official results are not 
expected for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, 54 and a political newcomer, received ratings of more than 50% in 
voter preference polls during several months last year. But this year, his 
support has gradually fallen, leaving an opening that Fujimori has quickly 
filled. Fujimori, 51 and also new to politics, had poll ratings of less then 2% 
until a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a rising phenomenon," said Manuel Torrado, a prominent pollster and 
political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Datum, Torrado's polling firm, conducted a small survey before Sunday's 
election that asked whether voters would choose Fujimori or Vargas Llosa in a 
runoff. Fujimori beat Vargas Llosa 58% to 35% in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Torrado said that Vargas Llosa's only chance of winning the runoff is to 
completely change the strategy of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made a bad campaign in which he has been identified with the 
right-wing, the rich, the whites," Torrado said. The majority of Peruvians are 
poor and of Indian descent. 
</P>
<P>
As Vargas Llosa has fallen out of favor, Fujimori, at the head of a new party 
called Cambio 90 (Change '90), has gained support with a low-key, simple 
message of support for small businessmen, slum-dwellers and peasants. His 
campaign motto is "Honor, technology and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Many Peruvians are said to associate Fujimori with Japan's economic success and 
even to hope that he will attract Japanese aid and investment. 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of Peruvian workers currently are unemployed or 
underemployed, and inflation is racing at more than 2,000% a year. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Monday, Fujimori attributed his success to his campaign 
message and to a "new political style." He expressed optimism for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to work with strategy, political strategy, and I am going to show 
once again how politics is managed in this new style here in Peru," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Torres, another pollster, said Fujimori's spectacular rise has created 
an "emotional factor" that works against Vargas Llosa. 
</P>
<P>
"If the second round were tomorrow, the emotional factor would prevail and 
Cambio 90 would be favored," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres did not rule out a reversal of Vargas Llosa's decline in popularity, but 
a foreign diplomatic analyst said that, "I think it's too late" for Vargas 
Llosa. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that militant members of President Alan Garcia's American 
Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) will vote against Vargas Llosa, who heads 
the Liberty party. About 16% of Sunday's voters cast ballots for APRA candidate 
Luis Alva Castro despite widespread discontent with Garcia's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll go with Fujimori, absolutely," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The APRA campaign depicted Vargas Llosa as a dangerous right-winger whose 
free-market policies and proposals for austerity would add to the suffering of 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the strongest scare campaigns I have ever run across," the 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa also is unlikely to receive runoff votes from Peruvians who 
support the United Left and Socialist Left parties, the diplomat said. 
Together, the two leftist candidates won about 10% of Sunday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
For Vargas Llosa to win the runoff, the diplomat said, he would have to take 
votes that went to Fujimori in the first round. He said it is more likely that 
Fujimori will take votes from two parties that have supported Vargas Llosa in 
his Democratic Front coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the runoff will face the problem of trying to solve Peru's deep 
economic ills without majority support in the new Congress elected Sunday. 
According to projections, Vargas Llosa's coalition won 63 of 180 seats in the 
Chamber of Deputies, while Fujimori's Cambio 90 won 34. APRA appeared to have 
49 seats, the two leftist parties 23 and others 11.

VICTORIOUS CONSERVATIVES PROMISE REFORMS IN GREECE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: MITSOTAKIS IS ASSURED OF A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT. THE AILING 
ECONOMY IS HIS TOP PRIORITY.

ATHENS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greek conservatives returned triumphantly to political power Monday, promising 
broad economic reforms to roll back eight years of combative socialism and to 
repair strained relations with American and European allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Athens stock market jumped nearly 15% to record highs Monday when it became 
clear that conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis would have a slender but 
emphatic absolute majority in the 300-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an entirely new era," said one stock trader, reflecting private-sector 
confidence that a Mitsotakis government will move swiftly to invigorate 
Greece's ramshackle economy and recover the confidence of its wealthy partners 
in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's election, the third in 10 months, Mitsotakis' right-center New 
Democracy Party won 150 seats on 46.9% of the vote, final official returns 
showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Assurance that Mitsotakis, 71, would have a majority that eluded him in 
elections last June and November came at midday Monday when Constantine 
Stephanopoulos, a prominent lawyer, pledged that his centrist Democratic 
Renewal Party's lone parliamentary deputy would vote with New Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation where right-left passions are deep and finely etched, Sunday's 
defeat may prove the last hurrah for wasp-tongued Socialist Andreas Papandreou, 
prime minister from 1981 until financial scandals cost him a majority in the 
June elections. 
</P>
<P>
Greece has been governed by powerless interim governments since then, while 
Papandreou, a 71-year-old former Berkeley economics professor who faces trial 
on corruption charges, worked patiently on a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the man who dominated Greek politics for a decade emerged from 
Sunday's vote as a battered also-ran. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement, or Pasok, won 38.6% of the vote and 123 seats. A Communist-led 
coalition with which Papandreou had hoped to form a governing majority got 
10.3% and 19 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining eight deputies elected Sunday, only the Stephanopoulos 
supporter has common ground with New Democracy. The other seven include four 
independent leftists pledged to the Socialists and Communists, an aloof 
Ecologist Party supporter and two leftist representatives of Muslim communities 
in northern Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis, a stolid, dogged professional politician, said Monday that he hopes 
to form a government by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the political side of a new government's agenda will be early election of a 
new figurehead president for Greece. President Christos Sartzetakis' term is 
up, but deadlock in the interim parliaments since June failed to produce a 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis is also expected to seek electoral reforms that would allow New 
Democracy to improve its parliamentary majority. He charges that 
Papandreou-engineered reforms stressing proportional representation cost New 
Democracy the June and November elections. New Democracy supporters tirelessly 
note that, with 42% of the vote in her last reelection, Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher won 375 of 650 seats in the British Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis has also pledged prompt upgrading of diplomatic relations with 
Israel to full ambassadorial level. Papandreou had balked at that in deference 
to Arab sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, a majority conservative government should mean quickly 
resumed negotiations on renewing leases for American military bases here, an 
issue that was a standby target for the Socialist and Communist campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the United States announced that it would close controversial 
Hellenikon Air Base at Athens airport and a communications center at nearby Nea 
Makri, pleasing some Greeks but alarming others worried at the loss of local 
employment at the bases and the implications for American military assistance 
that will total about $350 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
In resumed talks, a Mitsotakis government is expected to agree to new leases 
for two bases on Crete and about 20 smaller facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially more incendiary for Mitsotakis in a country that is no stranger to 
terrorist violence is the American demand for jailed Palestinian Mohammed 
Rashid, who is wanted in the United States for the in-flight bombing of an 
American jetliner over Hawaii in 1982. Interim governments have lacked the 
political strength to honor an American deportation request approved by Greek 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Greek analysts believe that Mitsotakis will approve the deportation, but they 
expect him to tread lightly. 
</P>
<P>

EX-EAST BLOC NATIONS MEET TO FORGE REGIONAL ALLIANCE;

EUROPE: HUNGARY, POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA DISCUSS AN ECONOMIC AND SECURITY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solutions to Central Europe's troubles were easier to come by in 1364, the last 
time the Czechoslovak, Hungarian and Polish heads of state tried to forge a 
united economic and security policy for the region. The three kings, meeting in 
Krakow, agreed to scrap tariffs and trade barriers after an evening of talk, 
good food and a little wine. 
</P>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on Monday reminded his negotiating 
partners from Hungary and Czechoslovakia of the successful pact among their 
forebears more than six centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday's effort to link the three most reform-oriented nations of Eastern 
Europe in a new economic and defense alliance stalled over their differing 
states of readiness for integration with Western Europe and over the future of 
their relations with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Age-old ethnic conflicts that threaten many of Europe's fragile new democracies 
also prevented any major advance on the road to regional unity. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel called the Bratislava meeting to discuss 
how the three nations might voluntarily cooperate, now that the alliances of 
the Warsaw Pact and Comecon that bound them under socialism have begun 
withering. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening address to the presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers, 
Havel proposed that a new European security commission be created this year, 
based in the Czechoslovak capital of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, however, reportedly pressed for such an institution to be based in 
Warsaw, to bolster the Polish state that is wedged between the Soviet Union and 
a new economic superpower forming to its west as the Germanys reunite. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also brought up the idea of Hungary and Czechoslovakia joining in an 
Adriatic trade bloc with Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Poles know they do not belong to this historical alliance of Alp-Adria, 
but they fear they could be left out of a new integrated European community 
without it," Havel noted in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski said that such a southeast 
European alignment would not be a problem for Poland, which he says enjoys good 
relations with the Adriatic and Alpine states. 
</P>
<P>
Poland has been discussed as a potential partner in a regional alliance with 
Scandinavia. But its severe economic problems, foremost among them a foreign 
debt approaching $40 billion, might frustrate its integration with prosperous 
nations like Sweden and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said officials from the Central 
European corridor would gather again in a few weeks to discuss how they might 
move the security commission plan forward. 
</P>
<P>
One awkward drag on the talks Monday was the lame-duck status of the Hungarian 
delegates. Sunday's elections in Hungary made clear that Foreign Minister Gyula 
Horn would leave his office soon, as will Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth and, 
eventually, interim President Matyas Szuros. The three were sent to represent 
Hungary at the Bratislava talks. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly sensitive point for the three national delegations was the 
question of their foreign relations, especially with the Soviet Union that once 
dominated them. 
</P>
<P>
Havel suggested that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms might be 
losing momentum and questioned whether Lithuanian's thwarted attempts to break 
away might complicate Eastern Europe's relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski warned against "adopting a missionary 
tone" with Moscow, stressing the need to maintain good ties with the superpower 
as well as defending the right to self-determination for Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
While no agreements were reached at the Bratislava conference, participants 
deemed it an important first step to strengthening ties in the region.

PARTIES AGREE ON NEW E. GERMAN COALITION; 
</P>

POLITICS: CONSERVATIVES WILL HOLD 11 OF 24 MINISTRIES. TALKS ON UNIFICATION 
WITH WEST GERMANY CAN NOW BEGIN.

<P>
After prolonged negotiations, East Germany's new political leadership agreed 
Monday on a broad, conservative-led coalition to guide the country toward 
unification with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement means that the process of negotiating that unity can now begin in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nearly certain that we'll have the grand coalition we've been striving 
for," Prime Minister-designate Lothar de Maiziere said. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said his victorious Christian Democrats will hold 11 of 24 
government ministries. The moderate left-wing Social Democrats, who finished a 
distant second in the voting, will hold seven portfolios and the centrist 
Liberals will hold three. Two small right-wing parties that allied with the 
Christian Democrats in the March 18 election -- the German Social Union and 
Democratic Awakening -- will take two seats and one seat, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Social Democrats, Markus Meckel, a 37-year-old Protestant 
pastor, was named foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
He will represent a government of political neophytes that has also placed a 
clergyman and pacifist as defense minister. Rainer Eppelmann, a Protestant 
pastor and co-founder of Democratic Awakening, will effectively take charge of 
what was once considered the Warsaw Pact's premier fighting force, the East 
German army. 
</P>
<P>
Eppelmann was jailed both for refusing to do active military service and later 
for opposing deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Comments by Meckel following Monday's talks indicated that the Social Democrats 
may be prepared to back a compromise formula on the role of a united Germany in 
a post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has proposed a united 
Germany inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but with no NATO forces 
stationed in what is now East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Meckel said that he is against the stationing of NATO 
forces in East Germany but fell short of rejecting NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
Among other portfolios announced Monday, 61-year-old Social Democrat economist 
Walter Romberg will become finance minister, and Peter-Michael Diestel, 38, 
general secretary of the German Socialist Union, will be named interior 
minister and also have the title of deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution of portfolios is expected to be formally approved today by all 
member parties. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the Liberals and Social Democrats in the conservative-led 
coalition means that the government can, in theory, count on the backing of 
nearly three-quarters of the 400-member Parliament. Such support is expected to 
give political legitimacy to the tough decisions involved in the unity process 
and also facilitate constitutional changes that will be required. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's agreement also leaves the Communists as the only major opposition 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new Cabinet means that political forces supported by 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will hold a clear majority in the new East 
German government. Such an alignment is expected to ease work on sensitive 
decisions leading to German unity, such as a currency union in which the West 
German deutschemark will become the all-German currency, replacing the 
non-convertible East German ostmark. 
</P>
<P>
The leaderships in both Bonn and East Berlin are pushing for implementation by 
July 1, but the terms have become highly controversial. Last Friday, hundreds 
of thousands of East Germans demonstrated in several cities in favor of a 
straight 1-for-1 exchange rate. They went into the streets after the 
conclusions of a West German Bundesbank report, which recommended in most 
instances an exchange rate of two ostmarks for each deutschemark, were leaked 
to the West German press.

U.S. TO SPEND $1 BILLION TO CLEAN UP PLANT

<P>
The Energy Department has agreed to spend more than $1 billion to clean up 
toxic and radioactive contamination at its nuclear weapons facility at Fernald, 
Ohio, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it has signed a proposed consent agreement with the Energy 
Department that requires four specific cleanup actions to be carried out at the 
Feed Materials Production Center, all under the EPA's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the consent agreement had been submitted to the Justice 
Department for final approval, which is expected within 15 days. The public 
then will have 30 days to comment on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said the consent agreement outlines one of the biggest cleanup 
operations ever required under the federal Superfund toxic waste cleanup 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Fernald plant, a 1,050-acre facility near Cincinnati, has become heavily 
contaminated by toxic and radioactive wastes generated during several decades 
of operations involving the production of radioactive uranium metal for the 
government's nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to releasing tens of thousands of pounds of uranium dust into the 
environment during operations, Fernald was used as a storage site for other 
radioactive wastes that have leaked into ground water beneath the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, now operated by Westinghouse Co. for the Energy Department, was shut 
in the spring of 1989 because of operational and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed consent agreement, the Energy Department agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove contaminated ground water from under the plant site, an operation 
that is now under way, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stabilize structurally unsound tanks containing radioactive wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Collect contaminated rainwater runoff from the waste pit areas.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
WILL SEND QUESTIONNAIRE TO CANDIDATES, NADER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Monday that he will send a questionnaire to 
every candidate in the race for California insurance commissioner at the end of 
this month and by May 12 make public the answers, along with his own 
comparative scoring of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The questionnaire will not be a very conventional one," Nader said. "It will 
be a detailed series of questions to determine what the candidates' various 
positions are, how they view the role of insurance commissioner and to what 
degree they are prepared to enforce Proposition 103. . . . If they say, 'who 
the hell am I to send out such a questionnaire,' then they ought to be aware of 
the thousands of Californians who are asking me how they should vote in this 
contest." 
</P>
<P>
Nader's sponsorship of Proposition 103 in 1988 was credited in many quarters 
for being highly influential in the insurance reform measure's narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating that he would make no personal endorsement in the race, Nader 
declared in an interview: "The results of the questionnaire, the scores given, 
will speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Nader, speaking from his organizational headquarters in Washington, said he 
will make public all the questions, all the answers and how he scored each 
answer, thus affording Californians the possibility of deciding for themselves 
whether he had been fair in scoring the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's interview, Nader was critical of one leading candidate in the early 
polls in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination, state Sen. John 
Garamendi. And he was noncommittal on another candidate, television commentator 
Bill Press, who over the weekend received the official endorsement of the 
state's Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Nader said he is convinced that when Garamendi's voting record as a legislator 
becomes known, it will become clear that, by backing limits on medical 
malpractice and other lawsuits, Garamendi had frequently done "what the 
insurance industry wanted him to do." 
</P>
<P>
As for Press, he said: "He's sort of Mr. Bland so far. There are two things we 
have to ask about him, or any candidate, for insurance commissioner: what he 
believes in, and what determination and guts he's going to bring to the job." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Press said he would answer Nader's questionnaire. A spokesman 
for Garamendi had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Nader added, it is premature to predict a winner. "There's a huge 
undecided, and we're not down to the nitty-gritty yet," Nader said. "The 
campaign is going to heat up. . . . The issues will be joined. Right now, 
everyone's blowing his own horn without anything but an echo."

TEXAS DEMOCRATS END LURID CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ANN RICHARDS OR JIM MATTOX WILL BE THE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE AFTER 
TODAY'S RUNOFF. IT CAPS POSSIBLY THE DIRTIEST RACE IN STATE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the last month, Texans have witnessed what is widely regarded as the 
dirtiest campaign in the state's history. In Texas, that means it has been 
sordid indeed. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the runoff election today is the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination. Most recently, the two contenders -- state Treasurer Ann Richards 
and state Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox -- have dealt in accusations of illegal drug 
use, bribery and improper business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
When George Christian, Lyndon B. Johnson's former press secretary and now an 
Austin-based political consultant, was going through a receiving line in 
Washington the other day, First Lady Barbara Bush asked him if he had ever seen 
a worse campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I've never seen one as bad as this," Christian recalled replying. 
</P>
<P>
State Lands Commissioner Garry Mauro said much the same thing Monday: "What a 
terrible excuse for a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Mattox, who has a history of going for his opponent's jugular, is generally 
regarded as the candidate who started the campaign on its downward spiral, 
although Richards quickly responded once the attacks appeared to be working. 
</P>
<P>
After the March 10 primary, in which Richards and Mattox received 39% and 37% 
of the vote, respectively, Mattox began challenging Richards to divulge what 
illegal drugs she has used. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent television ad, Mattox insinuates, without proof, that Richards 
was a cocaine addict when she was a county commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"Did she use marijuana? Or something worse, like cocaine?" asks the ad. "Not as 
a college kid, but as a 47-year-old elected official sworn to uphold the law." 
</P>
<P>
Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused to discuss the matter, except to 
say that she has not used any "mood-altering chemicals" in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
She retaliated by running campaign ads pointing to Mattox's 1983 indictment on 
bribery charges, without including the fact that he was acquitted. She also 
questioned Mattox's business dealings, as well as loans received, but without 
offering proof that anything was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
Few expected her to stay above the fray. So scathing was her attack on former 
Gov. Mark White before the March primary election that he vowed never to 
support her and compared her to a Nazi. "What Ann Richards has done would make 
Himmler blush," said White, referring to Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler. 
</P>
<P>
The heat has been turned up dramatically in the last several days after reports 
surfaced in the media that Mattox had smoked marijuana while a state 
representative in the early '70s. Mattox vehemently denied the reports and 
accused the Richards camp of Watergate-style "dirty tricks" in spreading 
stories of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he said that Richards had been treated for cocaine addiction 10 
years ago. Richards responded by calling Mattox a "desperate man." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the race has been basically devoid of any substantive issues. 
All this, said Christian, has caused him to watch in "horrified fascination." 
</P>
<P>
A poll published Sunday in the Houston Chronicle placed Richards six points 
ahead of Mattox, with a four-point margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mean-spirited atmosphere to the race, there is a lot riding on the 
Texas gubernatorial election, both on a state and national level. Texas will be 
a major player in reapportionment after the 1990 census because the state is 
expected to score gains in the number of congressional seats. The party that 
holds the governor's office will be able to have a major influence on how the 
congressional districts are apportioned. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins in today's voting will still have a considerable task ahead in 
defeating Republican businessman Clayton Williams. Williams would have been a 
prohibitive favorite over either Richards or Mattox, but he told a tasteless 
joke that has opened the door a bit for the eventual Democratic nominee. 
Williams said ugly weather is like rape -- "if it's inevitable, just relax and 
enjoy it." He later said his remark was "insensitive."

Australian motorcycle racer Kevin Magee was listed in critical condition Monday 
after surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain sustained in an accident at 
the U.S. Grand Prix, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Magee crashed his 500cc Suzuki Sunday on the second lap of the 35-lap feature 
race at Laguna Seca Raceway. The race was restarted after Magee was airlifted 
to San Jose Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Christi Welter, public relations director of the hospital, said Monday that 
Magee had undergone a CAT scan earlier in the day. The results were not

NEWSWIRE: GEORGE ROGERS ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Rogers, former running back for the Washington Redskins and New Orleans 
Saints who was implicated in a drug scandal in 1982 and later underwent 
treatment at a drug rehabilitation center, was arrested on cocaine charges 
during a weekend raid, authorities in Columbia, S.C., said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who won the 1980 Heisman Trophy while at South Carolina and now works 
as a fund raiser for the school, had traces of cocaine in his right nostril 
when he was arrested Saturday at a Columbia apartment, Richland County Sheriff 
Allan Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested with Rogers were Melvin Metz, 31, and Marcus Gilliam, 28. Gilliam, a 
defensive tackle at South Carolina in 1983, was the target of a three-week 
investigation that culminated in the raid, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
All three were charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and 
possession of marijuana. All were released after posting $5,000 bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they face maximum fines of $5,000 each and five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Rogers admitted having used cocaine during his record-setting rookie 
season with the Saints in 1981.

Jim Kelly, Buffalo Bills' quarterback, has no intention of offering a 
settlement to a woman who claims he threw a beer-filled balloon at her, 
allegedly resulting in a mouth injury, Kelly's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Edbauer, 40, of Clarence, N.Y., is seeking $200,000 in damages from 
Kelly, who signed a $20-million contract last month that made him the highest 
paid football player. 
</P>
<P>
Edbauer testified in Buffalo city court that Kelly threw several balloons at 
her while they were both attending a picnic in suburban Tonawanda, N.Y., in 
1987, and that one of them hit her while she was drinking from a plastic cup, 
injuring her mouth.

SUTTER'S GOAL GIVES ISLANDERS A 4-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brent Sutter's power-play goal 59 seconds into the second overtime Monday night 
gave the New York Islanders a come-from-behind 4-3 victory over the New York 
Rangers and new life in the Patrick Division semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
The victory continued the Islanders' success in overtime playoff games. They 
are 25-7 in overtime games, 6-0 against the Rangers and 12-2 at the Nassau 
Coliseum. The trail the Rangers in the best-of-seven series, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter's goal came with the Rangers skating a player short because of a major 
penalty for boarding to Troy Mallette, who smashed defenseman Jeff Norton into 
the boards with eight seconds left in the first overtime. Norton left the ice 
with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders were playing without top scorer Pat LaFontaine, who sustained a 
concussion in Game 1 when he was checked by James Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders controlled the puck at the start of the second overtime and 
Sutter tipped Jeff Finley's pass from the left circle past goalie John 
Vanbiesbrouck, completing a rally from a 3-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, Buffalo 1 -- Brian Skrudland scored 12:35 into overtime at Montreal 
to give the Canadiens a 2-1 lead in their Adams Division semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
Skrudland took a pass from Shayne Corson at the right corner of the net and 
jammed the puck past goalie Daren Puppa for the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens tied the game midway through the second period when Uwe Krupp 
sent a blind pass through the middle that was intercepted by Stephane Richer, 
who broke in alone to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres opened the scoring at 7:15 when Phil Housley scored during a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 5, Boston 3 -- Dave Babych scored the tie-breaking goal 36 seconds 
into the third period and Pat Verbeek had two goals at Hartford to give the 
Whalers a 2-1 lead in the Adams Division semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford's Brad Shaw added a goal and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Babych snapped a 2-2 tie when he took a pass from Shaw, skated into the right 
circle and beat goalie Andy Moog with a slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
Verbeek took a pass from Shaw and slipped the puck under Moog to make the score 
4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, playing without defenseman Ray Bourque, who suffered a hip-pointer 
in Game 2, narrowed the score to 4-3 when Randy Burridge tipped Jim Wiemer's 
between-the-legs pass past goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
But the Whalers held on and Kevin Dineen scored an empty-net goal with 18 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Center Craig Janney returned to the lineup after missing two games with a 
sprained shoulder and contributed two assists. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 2, Washington 1 -- Ken Daneyko and Brendan Shanahan scored goals at 
Landover, Md., to give the Devils a 2-1 lead in their Patrick Division 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
Daneyko scored 4:51 into the first period and the Devils spent the rest of the 
game protecting the lead, taking only 10 shots. They held the Capitals to 21 
shots and killed seven of Washington's eight power plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils held the Capitals without a shot after being penalized for having 
too many men on the ice with 2:39 left in the third period. Washington did not 
pull goalie Mike Liut until 35 seconds remained and was unable to get a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Terreri made 20 saves to win his second game since replacing Sean Burke. 
</P>
<P>
Dino Ciccarelli scored Washington's goal with 2:14 left in the second period. 
Ciccarelli has scored six of Washington's 11 goals in the series.

THE PREPS: ST. ANTHONY TURNS AROUND SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early last week, there was not a high school baseball team in Southern 
California more dominant than El Segundo. In earning the top Southern Section 
2-A Division ranking, the Eagles had outscored their first four Camino Real 
League opponents, 108-4. 
</P>
<P>
And in scoring 194 runs in 13 games overall, El Segundo's offense had appeared 
unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Thursday, the Eagles traveled to Long Beach and faced pitcher Eric 
Mooney and a rejuvenated league rival, St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Mooney and his St. Anthony teammates beat the Eagles, 4-3, 
creating a three-way tie for first with St. Anthony, El Segundo and Playa del 
Rey St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
"(Defeating El Segundo) is by far our biggest win," said St. Anthony Coach Ron 
Tostenson. "They have way more talent than we do but somehow we kept ourselves 
in position to win. They had runners on second and third with two outs before 
Mooney struck out the last batter to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints have won their last six games but are only 7-7, mostly because of 
defensive problems early in the season. The main victim has been Mooney, who 
has a 0.857 earned-run average but only a 4-3 record to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"His record is a little misleading when you consider how well he has pitched 
this season," Tostenson said. "He's had an outstanding year." 
</P>
<P>
In 49 innings, Mooney, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound senior, has struck out 71 and has 
given up only six earned runs. In one early game, he pitched a two-hitter and 
struck out 13 but still lost, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really frustrated at first because we just were not winning," Mooney 
said. "However, I just kept pitching my game and things have started to come 
around. Having a ground ball hit now is not like flipping a coin anymore. I 
have a lot a lot more confidence in my defense than I used to." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, the perennial boys' track power, has had problems this season with 
injuries, which caused Coach Kye Courtney to withdraw his team from Saturday's 
Arcadia Invitational and contributed to ending the Cougars' nine-year dual meet 
winning streak on Thursday against Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
With sprinters Dave Smith, Erik Allen and Chris Alexander out with injuries, 
Beverly Hills defeated Hawthorne, 70-51. 
</P>
<P>
"We got them when they were down," Beverly Hills Coach Howard Edelman said. "In 
all fairness to (Hawthorne), their top two sprinters were out. However, you 
have to do what you can on the day of the meet and the bottom line is that we 
won. 
</P>
<P>
"We also had our top sprinter and long jumper (Darrin Smith) out with an injury 
for the meet so it ended up being our No. 2 sprinter against their No. 3. We 
did not know that we'd win the meet until Danny Edwards came through to win the 
100 (meters) for us. But I feel kind of bad because I would have liked to see 
both teams at 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Based on his record-breaking performances last week, it might be only a matter 
of time until Brent Noon of Fallbrook breaks the national high school shot put 
mark of 77 feet set by Michael Carter, the San Francisco 49ers' nose tackle, 
when he attended Dallas Jefferson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Noon broke his own state mark of 73-3, which he set March 22, with 
a throw of 73-5 3/4, reinforcing his hold as the No. 3 all-time performer in 
prep history. Then in the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday night, Noon 
obliterated the meet record of 66-10 1/4, set in 1975 by Dave Kurrasch of 
Newport Harbor, with a throw of 71-4 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Noon, who is California's first prep 70-foot thrower, has been over 70 feet in 
four meets. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is 77 feet and I think that I can get it every time I compete," said 
Noon, who also won the discus at Arcadia with a throw of 192-11. "I know I'm 
capable of throwing that far . . . it is only a matter of time. For me to get 
the record, I do not need more strength, I just have to have everything else 
right from my technique to the throwing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica is an another athlete chasing records.

Lipscomb, who won the state title in the 100-meter low hurdles last season and 
is the top returning hurdler in the nation, blew away last season's state 
runner-up, Kwani Stewart of Yuba City, in a time of 13.88 Saturday night at 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
She did not come close to the state record of 13.34, set by Janeene Vicker of 
Pomona, but running against a wind blowing at 1.87 meters a second, Lipscomb 
appeared stronger than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This season I am running the 300 (low hurdles), which I did not run last 
season," said Lipscomb, who finished third in that event at Arcadia behind 
Lompoc's Twila Sims and Christine Gray of Houston Sterling. "I feel that 
running them will make me a better and stronger runner. I didn't feel like I 
was pulling away from (Stewart), but I guess I was." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Southern California's top boys' and girls' senior basketball players 
will be showcased in the sixth College Prep Basketball Classic at the Forum 
Friday, when all-star teams from the City and Southern sections meet. The 
doubleheader will begin at noon with the girls' game, followed by the boys' 
matchup at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson, whose Toilers won the City 4-A Division 
title, will coach the City boys' team and will be assisted by Kevin Crider of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Players expected to represent the City, which has won four of the five meetings 
against the Southern Section, are: Dana Jones of North Hollywood, Aaron 
Atkinson of Lincoln, James Bacon of Dorsey, Damian Wilson of Westchester, John 
Woolery of Fairfax, DeWayne Lewis of Hamilton, Greg Vernon of University, 
Lionel Pandy of Fremont, Bobby McRae of Reseda Cleveland, Ijumaa Armstrong of 
Palisades, Bobby Kelly of Carson and William Celestine and Marcell Capers of 
Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, whose Monarchs won the boys' Division 
I state title, will coach the Southern Section team, assisted by Lou 
Cvijanovich of Oxnard Santa Clara and Jim Harris of Huntington Beach Ocean 
View. 
</P>
<P>
Expected Southern Section players include Willie McGinest and Roderick Hannibal 
of Long Beach Poly, Ryan Jamison of Loyola, James Williams of Compton, Jeffery 
Rogers of Compton Dominguez, Fred Haygood of Fontana, Tyrone Paul of Inglewood 
Morningside, Earnest Killum of Lynwood, Shon Tarver of Santa Clara, Greg Evans 
of Ocean View, Travis Boyd of Huntington Beach Edison, Terrence O'Kelley of

</P>
<P>
The City girls' team will be coached by Phil Chase of Washington, whose 
Generals won their second consecutive City 4-A Division title in March. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the 13-player team will be Detra Lockhart and Remitha (Missa) Houston 
of Washington, Sherlett Hendy of Dorsey, Laura Oki of Marshall, Lupe Cota of 
South Gate and Stacie Toon of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section girls' team will be coached by Frank Scott of Morningside, 
whose Monarchs won their second consecutive State Division I championship a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Playing on the Southern Section team, which has won four of the five meetings, 
will be All-American center Lisa Leslie of Morningside, Linda Watson of 
Lynwood, Sara Wilson of Newhall Hart, Amy Jalewalia of Westminster La Quinta 
and Aimee McDaniel and Tammy Blackburn of Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
The first day for high school basketball seniors to sign national letters of 
intent is Wednesday. Shon Tarver of Oxnard Santa Clara and Aaron Atkinson of 
Lincoln have already made unwritten commitments to Nevada Las Vegas and 
Colorado State, respectively, but All-American Ed O'Bannon of Artesia is not 
expected to announce his decision until the end of the month. O'Bannon, who 
scored 16 points and was voted most valuable player for the West team in last 
week's Dapper Dan prep all-star game in Pittsburgh, still has a scheduled visit 
to USC later this month. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will televise the Dapper Dan game April 14 and O'Bannon will also play in 
the McDonald's All-Star game in Indianapolis Sunday, which will be on televised 
live on Channel 7. . . . ESPN will feature the Arcadia Invitational April 30 
and May 2 on its Scholastic Sports America program.

REMARKS: At Keeneland, the horses are either working too fast or too slow. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for Saturday's Blue Grass Stakes, Florida Derby winner Unbridled 
worked six furlongs in 1:12. That was a second or two faster than trainer Carl 
Nafzger wanted. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pleasant Tap, another Blue Grass contender, worked seven furlongs in 
a slow 1:31. Trainer Chris Speckert would have preferred something faster. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, who ran sixth as the favorite in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa 
Anita on March 18, and Unbridled will be trying to knock off Summer Squall in 
the Blue Grass. Others running in the 1 1/8-mile race will be Shot Gun Scott, 
Land Rush, Slew of Angels and Top Snob, also trained by Nafzger. Home at Last, 
still another Nafzger colt, won the Preview at Gulfstream Park on Saturday, but 
he wasn't nominated for the Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret will ride Unbridled after one of his other Kentucky Derby 
hopefuls, Rhythm, ran himself out the picture Saturday with a fifth-place 
finish in the Gotham at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm, last year's champion 2-year-old colt, has run poorly in three races 
this year and the Gotham was his first start since undergoing throat surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"We will back off of him for a while," said Shug McGaughey, who trains Rhythm. 
"Perret said that if he had dropped his reins on the backside Saturday, Rhythm 
would have been content to drop back 20 lengths." 
</P>
<P>
The first three finishers in the Gotham -- Thirty Six Red, Senor Pete and Burnt 
Hills -- are expected to return for the Wood Memorial April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red, who moves into the ratings for the first time, had beaten only 
non-winners in eight previous races. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Wood list is undefeated Champagneforashley, most lightly raced of 
the Derby contenders. Champagneforashley, whose only start this year was a 
victory over mediocre opponents in the Tampa Bay Derby, is scheduled to run 
Friday in the DeWitt Clinton at Aqueduct. This is hardly a conventional prep, 
but Champagneforashley, being a New York-bred, is eligible for the stake and 
the timing of the race fits trainer Howie Tesher's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Rhythm from the Derby May 5 means that another champion 
2-year-old will fail to win the race. The last champion to come back and win 
the Derby was Spectacular Bid in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top nine horses on the Experimental Free Handicap -- a theoretical 
listing of the leading 2-year-olds -- only Summer Squall and Senor Pete are 
still considered Derby contenders. Those who have been eliminated are Rhythm, 
Grand Canyon, Adjudicating, Slavic, Roanoke, Secret Hello and Single Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Single Dawn, owned by Jack Kent Cooke, ran fifth as Mister Frisky extended his 
winning streak with a 4 1/2-length victory Saturday in the Santa Anita Derby. 
Asked Sunday where Single Dawn might be sent, Jack Robbins, Cooke's racing 
manager in California, said: "Someplace where he might put on about 200 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky is a small, light horse, slightly more than five feet tall and 
weighing about 1,000 pounds. "He's the American dream," says Mister Frisky's 
trainer, Laz Barrera. "He cost the owners only $15,000, which proves that you 
don't have to spend $2 million to get a good horse. He's come along at the 
right time, because this sport needs heroes." 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster, a sprinter who has won five of six starts, will run in the 
seven-furlong, $75,000 Lafayette at Keeneland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With only three opponents entered, Keeneland has made the Lafayette a 
non-betting race. Keeneland officials feared that there would too much betting 
on Housebuster, whose three rivals have won five of 23 starts and include a 
maiden and the colt who ran last in the Louisiana Derby. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lafayette, Croll says Housebuster will run in the mile Derby Trial at 
Churchill Downs the Saturday before the 1 1/4-mile Derby. It wouldn't be 
surprising, however, if Housebuster shows up at the 1 3/16-mile Preakness, the 
middle race in the Triple Crown, at Pimlico May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Advisory panel for The Times' Triple Crown Ratings: Lenny Hale, vice president 
for racing at Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga; Frank (Jimmy) Kilroe, vice 
president for racing at Santa Anita; and Tommy Trotter, racing secretary at 
Gulfstream Park.

Lorenzoni held off favored Eternal Flight in the stretch Monday to win the 
$31,000 Mr. Prospector Purse by 1 1/4 lengths at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Laurent Goossens rode Lorenzoni to his first victory in four starts this year 
and only the third in 14 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
One of those victories was over Easy Goer in a six-furlong sprint on Aug. 1, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Eternal Flight, with Chris Antley aboard, was second in the field of six 
3-year-olds and older, 1 3/4 lengths ahead of Clef. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzoni covered seven furlongs in 1:22 2/5 on the fast track to earn $18,600 
and returned $15.40, $4.40 and $3.40. Eternal Flight paid $2.60 and $2.60 and 
Clef was $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzoni's victory capped a record high Pick Six payoff of $767,998 for one 
Aqueduct patron. The largest previous pick six payoff in New York was the 
$666,735 paid to a single on-track patron on Oct. 26,1989.

MCI TO BUY TELECOM USA, CEMENTS ITS NO. 2 POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the biggest merger yet in the rapidly consolidating long-distance 
telecommunications business, MCI Communications on Monday strengthened its 
position as the nation's No. 2 carrier by agreeing to buy fourth-ranking 
Telecom USA for $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
By absorbing Telecom's estimated 1.4% share of the fast-growing $60-billion 
long-distance market, MCI will increase its share to nearly 15%, compared to 
the 8.6% share of third-place U S Sprint but still far behind American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph's 68.7%. The deal also will open new areas of 
technology and territory to MCI and could result in cost savings and improved 
quality of service for customers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal also may help spur additional consolidation in the long-distance 
market, which could reduce competition and eventually lead to higher rates, 
some analysts fear. 
</P>
<P>
The definitive agreement, already approved by the directors of both companies, 
calls for MCI to pay $42 a share for Telecom. Telecom's stock, the New York 
Stock Exchange's second-most-active issue Monday, spurted $16.25 per share to 
close at $38.125. MCI stock slipped $1.125 a share to end at $35.75 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies have grown rapidly in the past few years by buying competitors. 
Atlanta-based Telecom, formerly a regional carrier called SoutherNet, was 
formed in 1988 by merging with Teleconnect, a Midwestern carrier based in Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa. The merged company earned $36.9 million last year on sales of 
$713 million. 
</P>
<P>
MCI has grown by absorbing Satellite Business Systems, Western Union 
International and RCA Global Communications. It had 1989 revenue of $6.5 
billion and net income of $558 million. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the number of long-distance telephone companies, many of them catering 
only to specialty markets, totaled nearly 500 a few years ago but has dropped 
"into the 300s," according to the Competitive Telecommunications Assn., a trade 
group made up of many of AT&amp;T's competitors (including Telecom and Sprint 
but not MCI). 
</P>
<P>
Telecom serves 500,000 customers in 31 states and publishes phone books in 26 
Midwestern markets. It also offers voice messaging, telemarketing and a Voice 
News Network with more than 100 categories of information. Moreover, the 
company owns and operates a 3,000-mile optical-fiber network radiating from its 
twin hubs in Georgia and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Telecom has been "very aggressive in developing new products," said Stephen J. 
Shook, an industry analyst for Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. As 
part of MCI, he said, "they could get much broader exposure for these 
products." 
</P>
<P>
But the resulting consolidation troubles industry experts such as Paul Daubitz, 
president of ATI Telemanagement, a Newbury, Mass., consulting firm. "We're 
going to end up with three or four AT&amp;Ts," Daubitz predicted.

WARNER TO HELP FINANCE PATHE'S MGM/UA OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: UNDER THE $650-MILLION DEAL, WARNER WILL DISTRIBUTE MGM/UA 
RELEASES. THE MOVE ADDS TO TIME WARNER'S CLOUT IN THE CABLE-TV BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Time Warner Inc. emerged as a major backer of Pathe Communications Co.'s 
$1.2-billion bid for MGM/UA Communications Co., under a deal that will give the 
New York-based media giant substantial control over the distribution of MGM/UA 
movies in theaters, home video, cable and other media. 
</P>
<P>
In a complex arrangement, Time Warner's Warner Bros. film unit will loan MGM/UA 
$650 million in exchange for worldwide distribution rights to the 1,070-title 
United Artists film library and all future MGM/UA and Pathe films, the 
companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marked a giant step in the effort by Pathe's co-founders, Giancarlo 
Parretti and Florio Fiorini, to line up funding for the MGM/UA acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
But it also provoked expressions of concern about diminished competition in the 
movie industry, as Time Warner -- which owns theaters, cable systems and pay 
cable services HBO and Cinemax as well as a major movie studio -- continues to 
expand its reach. In effect, the deal would give Time Warner a rich new source 
of films. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously would look with grave concern upon anybody in the cable business 
acquiring further distribution rights," said Sidney Sheinberg, MCA president. 
"I'm very concerned about the antitrust implications as they impact on Time 
Warner in cable." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Fox, president of Fox Theaters in Reading, Pa., said he feared that the 
distribution deal would decrease the number of films available for his 
theaters. "Everybody needs to study this." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department routinely reviews large deals between companies for 
possible violations of federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
Warner and Pathe are expected to disclose in an amended Securities and Exchange 
Commission filing this week that Time Warner Inc. will get the right to acquire 
up to about 20% of Pathe's stock. Time Warner already owns 1.2% of Pathe's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe also said Monday that it paid the second of four $50-million deposits on 
its acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
But the company didn't say how it expected to raise the balance of the 
acquisition price, about $450 million. Pathe will also assume nearly $390 
million in MGM/UA debt in the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Under the complex financing arrangement, both Warner Bros. and Time Warner will 
guarantee the loan, which is secured by the UA film library. With that money 
MGM/UA will then purchase certain motion pictures from 780-title Pathe library 
of old European films and newsreels, which in turn will use those funds to help 
pay for its MGM/UA acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from both Pathe and Warner were careful to call the arrangement a 
"service agreement" and insisted that "technically" MGM/UA will remain in the 
distribution business while working through Warner Bros. marketing and 
distribution machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Isgur, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber, said Parretti will be able 
to take the distribution agreement to a bank and use that as collateral for 
loans to finance the remaining $450 million of the purchase price. "The banks 
will put up a significant amount of money," Isgur said. "But the real question 
is what happens to MGM/UA on an on-going basis?" 
</P>
<P>
"From Warner's point of view one would have to assume that Pathe is going to be 
able to (quickly increase) production on a full scale," said Jeffrey Logsdon, 
an analyst with the Los Angeles-based securities firm of Crowell, Weedon &amp; 
Co. Logsdon said that even though Parretti appears to be arranging financing, 
he still will face the problem of where to get capital for continuing operation 
of MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, a key bone of contention in the negotiations with Time 
Warner had been the fate of MGM/UA's domestic theatrical distribution system. 
MGM/UA employees fear loss of their jobs in a scaled-down division under 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the studio people) are obviously all fighting to maintain our separate 
identity," said one senior MGM/UA executive who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, do not expect Warner to absorb all of the 350 people 
involved in the domestic distribution of MGM/UA films and, instead, see the 
division operating more like a marketing unit working for Warner Bros. on 
MGM/UA releases. 
</P>
<P>
"People are nervous," acknowledged Richard Berger, president of MGM/UA Film 
Group. "Some people were hoping Pathe could pull it off and yet maintain the 
domestic distribution channels." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, since Warner Bros. would be taking over distribution of MGM/UA 
pictures overseas, MGM/UA would no longer need to be part of its overseas 
distribution company, United International Pictures, a joint venture with 
Paramount Pictures Corp. and MCA Inc. Sources said MGM/UA would remain part of 
UIP until its current partnership agreement expires in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. currently holds the overseas home video distribution rights on the 
UA library through its Warner Home Video unit, but that agreement is set to 
expire in Nov. 30, 1991. MGM/UA Home Video Inc., the studio's home video 
division, holds domestic distribution rights to the UA film library and about 
35 MGM motion pictures made since 1986 as well as home video rights to the 
Turner/MGM library of old MGM and Warner Bros. films now owned by Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Turner, which receives a royalty fee from MGM/UA Home Video 
for the distribution rights, expires in the year 2001. At that time the 
library, including home video rights to 2,950 pictures such as "Gone With the 
Wind," "Singing in the Rain," and "Casablanca," reverts back to Turner.

STATE REGULATORS REJECT AXA-MIDI'S BID FOR FARMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California insurance regulators on Monday rejected a plan to purchase Los 
Angeles-based Farmers Insurance Group, dealing a severe blow to a related 
$21-billion international takeover effort by British financier Sir James 
Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Two European firms -- Axa Midi Assurances and Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments 
-- had jointly sought to buy Farmers, one of the biggest insurers of cars and 
homes in California, which is now owned by BAT Industries of London. Their 
purchase was intended to clear the way for Goldsmith to acquire BAT, a 
sprawling conglomerate that also owns tobacco companies and retailers. The 
takeover would rank as one of the biggest ever in Britain, where such corporate 
raids are a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
But the California Department of Insurance, in ruling the bid as deficient and 
possibly harmful to policyholders, acknowledged that the decision could derail 
Goldsmith's takeover. Goldsmith had proposed to sell Farmers to Axa Midi 
immediately after acquiring BAT. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith and Axa Midi did not concede defeat, but BAT claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We are celebrating," said Jon Coles, a BAT spokesman in London. "You are 
talking to a very happy crew." 
</P>
<P>
Coles added: "We firmly believe that (the hostile takeover) is over, but we 
will have to see what the other side decides to do." 
</P>
<P>
BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a prepared statement: "We now look forward 
to being able to manage our business, of which Farmers is a key strategic 
element, without further distractions." 
</P>
<P>
BAT has been fighting Goldsmith's bid for nearly a year. Farmers was a key 
element in BAT's defense, but the conglomerate also launched a companywide 
restructuring plan last October and put many of its valuable retail franchises 
-- including Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's -- on the block in an 
effort to thwart Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the insurance department ruling was a severe impediment 
to the deal because no acquisition of BAT could go through without getting 
insurance department approvals for a change of control at Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Goldsmith said the group was "considering its position 
in light of the ruling" and would make no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi Chairman Claude Bebear vowed to continue his efforts to gain control 
of Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Axa fully intends to continue its efforts to receive approval from U.S. 
regulators for its acquisition of Farmers," Bebear said in a statement. "We are 
confident that we can successfully address the concerns expressed by the 
(insurance) department and ultimately receive approval in California." 
</P>
<P>
The differing reactions underscore the complexity of Goldsmith's bid, which is 
currently on hold in Britain while awaiting insurance department rulings in 
nine states over the acquisition of Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Goldsmith wants to take control of BAT and sell off all its assets 
with the exception of its tobacco business. However, because BAT owns Farmers, 
any buyout of BAT must be approved by insurance regulators in the states where 
Farmers does business. 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake has declined to give insurance regulators details about its acquisition 
of BAT because it said it planned to immediately sell the asset to Axa Midi, a 
French insurance concern roughly the same size as Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi consequently submitted its plan to buy Farmers, but regulators 
rejected the plan because of several concerns, said Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani M. Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was too highly leveraged and required Farmers to pay off a significant 
portion of the acquisition debt, Gillespie said. It also relied on getting 
companies affiliated with Farmers to go along with costly changes in their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Axa had not clarified a number of "loose ends" to the regulator's 
satisfaction, including how Axa would cover takeover-related debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Gillespie said, the department was not willing to overlook 
Hoylake's involvement in the takeover. Hoylake, an investment group controlled 
by Goldsmith, is the vehicle through which he is pursuing Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Axa not only needs to deal with the problems in its own offer, it also needs 
to cure the problems of Hoylake's offer," added Lorraine Johnson, senior staff 
counsel for the California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake's offer was rejected by regulators on a host of grounds, including the 
fact that there is currently no firm proposal on the table and there are no 
provisions for financing the deal. Goldsmith suspended his formal offer for BAT 
in London after getting an unprecedented go-ahead from British takeover 
authorities to put the deal on hold while Hoylake and Axa attempted to get 
regulatory approvals from U.S. insurance departments. 
</P>
<P>
California is the first and most important of the approvals necessary for the 
takeover since Farmers is not only headquartered here, more than 40% of its 
business is done in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Axa maintains it still has a chance to complete the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"This initial decision is the first step in a long process involving hearings 
and investigation by insurance departments in California and eight other states 
throughout the U.S.," Axa chief Bebear said. "It is critical in this situation 
to remember that BAT did not receive initial approval in several states before 
its eventual success in acquiring Farmers. In fact, BAT also received a 'no' on 
its first application in California" 
</P>
<P>
Bebear added that he believes that the insurance department's objections are 
"within reason" and that Axa will be able to successfully address those 
concerns.

PAT SAJAK SHOW CANCELED; CARSON, HALL HARD TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Pat Sajak Show," squeezed by the late-night competition of veteran Johnny 
Carson and new talk host Arsenio Hall, was canceled Monday by CBS, only 15 
months after its debut. 
</P>
<P>
A CBS announcement said the series will end Friday. Sajak, who will continue 
with his syndicated "Wheel of Fortune" series with Vanna White, made his final 
appearance on the late-night network show last Thursday and will not return, a 
CBS spokesman said. Guest hosts will fill in. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Sajak "is in Europe on a long-planned vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak, who rose to fame as "Wheel of Fortune" became a game show sensation, is 
the latest in a series of contenders who failed in an attempt to dethrone 
Carson, the host of NBC's "Tonight" series for more than 27 years. Others in 
the long line of would-be Carson successors included Dick Cavett and Joey 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
In ratings sweeps last February, one of four months during the year when 
competition helps determine advertising prices for stations, the "Tonight" show 
averaged a 5.6 rating and a 19% share of the audience. "The Pat Sajak Show" 
averaged a 2.6 rating and 10% share. 
</P>
<P>
But while many never expected him to defeat Carson, Sajak ran into the surprise 
success of Hall, the biggest new late-night talk-show attraction in years. 
Hall, whose Paramount series debuted only one week before Sajak's, not only 
triumphed over Sajak's CBS show but also drew the young viewers that the 
network had hoped Sajak would attract. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak, who debuted on CBS on Jan. 9, 1989, had said the strategy was to 
establish his show so that if and when Carson, 64, retires, he would be in 
place as the logical successor as king of late-night TV. 
</P>
<P>
But although Sajak won the first week of their head-to-head competition, Carson 
came back, and, along with Hall and other late-night hosts such as NBC's David 
Letterman and Jay Leno, substitute host of "Tonight," made it tough sledding 
for the new CBS hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak surprised many viewers by showing an adeptness at handling a comedy 
monologue when his show debuted. But soon he was criticized for being a Carson 
clone, complete with a sidekick, Dan Miller -- a former news anchor whom he had 
worked with in Nashville -- and a couch full of guests. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had hoped Sajak's original 90-minute length would help differentiate it 
from Carson and the other late-night shows. But as ratings slipped, it finally 
was cut back to an hour last Oct. 20. This past February, other changes were 
made -- Miller was switched from sidekick to announcer, Sajak substituted a 
round table for the couch and eliminated his desk amid adjustments of the set. 
</P>
<P>
Also in February, guest hosts began filling in for Sajak each Friday, leading 
to increased speculation that the show's days were numbered. The guests 
included radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, comedians John Mulrooney and Tom 
Parks, and film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had invested an estimated $5 million in a new studio for the Sajak show, 
and he reportedly had signed a two-year, no-cut contract. New CBS Entertainment 
President Jeff Sagansky had promised to stick with Sajak as the new format and 
adjustments were made to the show in February, but they brought few positive 
results. 
</P>
<P>
A new producer, Michael Weisman, formerly of NBC Sports, also was brought in, 
but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
CBS said Monday that new programming would replace "The Pat Sajak Show" 
starting Monday, and that it was "negotiating for off-network" shows to "fill 
the time period for the interim." It is understood that reruns of the CBS 
series "Wiseguy" were among the shows being considered for the time slot, which 
runs from 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's guest host is Jonathan Prince, co-star of the comedy series "Throb" 
and creative consultant for the CBS show "City." The guest host Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday will be comedian Paul Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"Original programming is in development and targeted for fall," said CBS.

A South African developer is hoping to find gold in them thar San Joaquin 
County acres by developing a Disneyland-style theme park based on the Gold Rush 
era. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Norman Jarrett, who immigrated to Northern California from 
Johannesburg in 1986, said Monday that he is in preliminary stages of 
negotiating to buy more than 4,500 acres of San Joaquin County farmland. 
</P>
<P>
If the necessary zoning changes and approvals can be secured, the land would be 
used for a $2-billion development encompassing the Gold Rush City theme park, 
as well as houses and apartments, time-share condominiums, hotels, a regional 
mall, a business park, a wild animal park and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Rush City, which the developers say could attract as many as 3 million 
visitors a year, would feature a re-creation of 1850s San Francisco, with 
horse-drawn vehicles, steam trains and boats. But it would also offer roller 
coasters and other rides. 
</P>
<P>
Approval for the project is by no means a sure thing. Jarrett and his financial 
backers will face strong opposition from land preservationists. Fast-growing 
San Joaquin County and other Central Valley areas already are seeing the 
encroachment of new "bedroom communities" housing workers who cannot afford to 
buy homes in San Francisco, the East Bay or Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right smack in the middle of some of the world's best farmland," Will 
Shafroth, Western regional director of the American Farmland Trust, said of the 
proposed development. "This puts the ball in the county's court" to determine 
whether such development will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Walker, senior planner for San Joaquin County, said the county generally 
is "in a pro-growth mode." Because of the seasonal nature of agriculture, the 
county's unemployment rate tends to be high and the county favors development 
as a way to provide jobs. The developers say this project would provide 20,000 
jobs and $15 million in annual tax revenue for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Preservation of agricultural land is still a high priority," Walker said, "but 
it's in conflict with our growth accommodation." 
</P>
<P>
However, she added that the Gold Rush City developers might be faced with 
"overwhelming" environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The farmland picked for development -- just east of Tracy on the San Joaquin 
River near where Interstates 205 and 5 meet -- is on a flood plain on reclaimed 
delta land protected by levees. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett and his backers are in the process of negotiating options to buy the 
land from several owners. The contracts would hinge on the developers' 
receiving the necessary zoning changes and approvals. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the backing for the project would be from Miami-based Tate &amp; Lyle 
Enterprises, which would be half owner. It is a subsidiary of Booker Tate Ltd., 
a British company with extensive sugar-processing facilities and landholdings 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pike, a San Francisco publicist for the project, cautioned that the 
negotiations are in very preliminary stages. Even if plans proceeded apace, the 
theme park would not receive guests until 1994 and other segments of the 
project would take as long as 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be an easy road," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles architect George Rester, who worked for 20 years as Walt Disney 
Co.'s chief architect, has been hired to assist in the planning.

PREFERRED HOLDERS WANT TO MAKE EASTERN INDEPENDENT

<P>
Eastern Airlines' preferred shareholders, who are near the bottom of the list 
of who gets paid in the airline's bankruptcy proceedings, proposed Monday that 
the carrier be reconstituted as an independent entity under new management. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protection a little more than a year ago, 
is owned by Houston-based Texas Air Corp., a holding company that also owns 
Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which the committee of preferred shareholders filed with federal 
bankruptcy court here, called for the reorganization of Eastern as an 
independent, stand-alone airline that would be owned by its unsecured creditors 
and preferred shareholders and operated by a new management team. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the plan came about because the preferred shareholders were upset 
about not being offered enough under the airline's own reorganization plans. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan is believed to have only a slim chance of being accepted. For one 
thing, Eastern still has the exclusive right to come up with its own 
reorganization plan. Judge Burton R. Lifland of the bankruptcy court will make 
a final ruling on the troubled airline's future. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred shareholders are near the bottom of the ladder when it comes to 
getting paid what is owed them in bankruptcy proceedings. Before them come 
payroll payments, settlement with secured creditors who hold collateral such as 
leased airplanes, and unsecured creditors such as engine makers, fuel suppliers 
and caterers. Only common shareholders stand behind the preferred shareholders 
in the debt-payoff pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is being proposed as an alternative to the liquidation scenario for 
Eastern suggested in a recent press report," a statement by the preferred 
holders said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Ross, an official of Rothschild Inc. and the financial adviser to the 
preferred shareholders, said Monday that the preferred holders were offered 10 
cents on the dollar some months ago when Eastern offered its unsecured 
creditors 50 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Eastern has told the unsecured creditors that it will not be able 
to pay them that much but, according to Ross, the airline has not modified its 
offer to the preferred shareholders. The unsecured creditors subsequently 
called for the liquidation or sale of the airline and appointment of a trustee 
to manage the carrier until that can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers said they believe that Eastern would be unable to stand alone as 
an independent carrier. As a subsidiary of Texas Air, Eastern would have an 
easier time financing such things as the purchase badly needed airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred shareholders "have something to gain and nothing to lose" in 
making their proposal, said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with the New York 
investment firm of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
John Mattis, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, another New York 
brokerage, said: "They have been squeezed in terms of what has been offered to 
them -- hardly anything at all. I think this is the way of posturing themselves 
to get a better deal from Eastern."

PENTAGON BUYS INTO HIGH-TECH FIRM, WILL SHARE FUTURE PROFITS

The Pentagon said Monday that it has made a $4-million investment in a small 
Santa Clara, Calif., high-technology company in return for a share of any 
future profits and a non-voting seat on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The investment is the first step in a unique experiment being launched by the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon's research and 
development arm, and will expand that agency's role in cultivating domestic 
industries involved in critical technologies. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Congress greatly expanded DARPA's mandate, enabling it to act more 
like a venture capital firm and in so doing to help pick critical companies and 
technologies. Previous efforts already have sparked a debate over what role the 
government should play in picking winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
The investment in Gazelle Microcircuits Inc., a supplier of gallium arsenide 
chips used in electronic and military applications, represents the first time 
DARPA will receive a percentage of the profits. In return for its $4-million, 
DARPA will get royalties from any products developed with the funds or payments 
calculated on the appreciation of Gazelle's stock.

NIKKEI DROPS 349.07 AFTER TWO DAYS OF HUGE GAINS

<P>
Following a two-day spurt in stock prices, the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
reverberated downward today, with the Nikkei average sliding below the 
30,000-yen level in the first minutes of trading before rallying later in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
After shedding almost 675 points at one stage of the morning, the 225-share 
Nikkei index ended the morning down 349.07 points, or 1.15%, at 30,048.86. In 
the previous two days of trading, the index had registered its fourth- and 
fifth-largest one-day gains ever. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar, meanwhile, opened at 158.15 yen, rebounding from a 1.02-point loss 
Monday that caused it to finish at 156.45 yen. 
</P>
<P>
During the early morning today, several reports came in that the central banks 
of the United States, Switzerland, Italy, Britain and West Germany were 
intervening in their markets in support of the yen. But the overseas 
intervention was mild and was conducted in dollars, not in the currencies of 
the European countries. As such, brokers here described it as a formality. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto just before trading began 
today, in which he welcomed the overseas intervention, appeared to have had 
little initial influence on the markets. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, stockbrokers had cautioned that Friday's and Monday's gains 
-- 1,029.72 and 1,119.15 points, respectively -- were bound to spur reaction 
from investors. On April 2, the market had hit bottom for the year with a 
closing of 28,002.07. 
</P>
<P>
The beleaguered Tokyo market for more than six weeks has been buffeted by a 
barrage of bad news. But it was cheered Monday by the successful conclusion 
Friday of U.S.-Japanese talks to remove structural impediments to trade and by 
a declaration Saturday in Paris by the finance chiefs of seven leading 
industrialized nations that a decline in the yen's value could bring 
"undesirable consequences." 
</P>
<P>
After the markets closed Monday, Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, 
said he thought the Tokyo markets were "settling down" and predicted that 
stocks were unlikely to decline further. 
</P>
<P>
Mieno also said Saturday's statement of concern about the falling yen had a 
positive effect on the exchange and stock market Monday. Without it, the 
markets would have been more volatile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has now developed a consensus that stocks bottomed out last week," 
Yukio Itagaki, a Kokusai Investment Trust Management Co. director, said after 
trading closed Monday. But he predicted then that fluctuations would continue, 
adding, "This is still a rebound phase -- not an advance." 
</P>
<P>
Traders on Monday said they were encouraged by two straight days of relatively 
heavy trading.

NBC NEWS MUST TRIM BUDGET BY $3.5 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC News is planning to make a $3.5-million budget cut throughout the news 
division, according to sources at the network. 
</P>
<P>
The budgets of both NBC News bureaus and individual programs such as "Today" 
and "NBC Nightly News" are being reduced. NBC News has an annual budget of 
about $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
No layoffs are planned at this point. The reductions, instead, are expected to 
be achieved through normal attrition of employees as well as through such 
measures as saving on satellite time and a reduction in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The news cutbacks -- which are part of a networkwide austerity move at NBC -- 
are said to be largely due to a shortfall in advertising revenue from the 
"Today" show, which has dropped from No. 1 to No. 2 in the ratings against 
ABC's "Good Morning, America." 
</P>
<P>
The news division also has faced some unanticipated costs of expansion such as 
the start-up of the unit producing Jane Pauley's prime-time specials and 
projected prime-time series. Pauley has received high ratings for her 
prime-time specials, but the "Today" ratings have fallen since her highly 
publicized departure for the early morning show in December. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the network, NBC News President Michael Gartner has 
told NBC President Robert Wright that the news division will break even this 
year. NBC News was over budget during the first quarter of this year. Among the 
three network news divisions, ABC is the only one that reports a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Gartner, a former newspaper executive with the Des Moines Register and Tribune 
Co., was one of the judges for the Pulitzer prizes on Monday and was 
unavailable for comment. But, in an interview published Monday in Electronic 
Media, a trade publication, Gartner said: "Wright has made it clear to me he 
expects NBC News to break even, and that's what I expect to do. . . . When 
you've got somewhere between $250 million and $300 million to manage, there are 
always corners and cubbyholes and other areas where you can find things to cut. 
It doesn't have to mean laying off people outright."

DATAMETRICS CO-FOUNDER TO RELINQUISH OPERATING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Asserting that his struggling company is on the road to recovery, Garland S. 
White says that he plans to leave his day-to-day responsibilities at 
Datametrics Corp. but will remain chairman of the Chatsworth concern. 
</P>
<P>
White, who in 1962 co-founded the manufacturer of rugged printers, 
printer/plotters and keyboards for the military, said he will leave April 27 to 
form a consulting firm but will return to Datametrics to serve as chairman at 
its board meetings. White already had turned over much of Datametrics' daily 
management to Sidney E. Wing, its president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"I can comfortably leave and go do something else," White said Friday on his 
62nd birthday, citing Datametrics' recent improvement. "I've been in this 
company for almost 28 years. I thought I'd do something else before I 
completely retire." 
</P>
<P>
White's departure comes after Datametrics chalked up modest profits in the six 
months that ended March 31. Before that, during the first nine months of 1989, 
the company piled up more than $2 million in losses, and closed 1989 with a 
$2.1-million loss on sales of $29.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
With Datametrics stemming its losses, its stock -- which stood Monday at $1.125 
a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading -- is up 29% so far this 
year. But it remains well below the $3.25 a share it reached in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Datametrics' showing over the past several years has been inconsistent. 
In the mid-1980s, Datametrics ran seriously short of cash until early 1986 when 
two venture capital firms -- Investments Orange Nassau Inc. in Boston and Alan 
Patricof Associates Inc. in Palo Alto -- invested $2.75 million in the company 
on behalf of three private investor groups. The groups remain Datametrics' 
biggest stockholders with a combined 33% stake. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the company recorded a $1.9-million profit to bounce back from a 
$1.3-million loss in 1985. The earnings then dropped to $1.44 million in 1987, 
jumped back to $2.1 million in 1988 and evaporated completely last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmer R. Bottoms, senior vice president of Alan Patricof Associates and a 
Datametrics director, remains upbeat about Datametrics despite its problems 
last year. "We are expecting that the company will continue to show the kind of 
improvement that we've had over the last three quarters," he said. And that, 
according to Bottoms, means "the stock is unrealistically low." He declined to 
project what price the shares should trade at, but said, "I'm not willing to 
sell my stock." 
</P>
<P>
Several factors led to the company's slump in 1989. The slowdown in defense 
spending "stopped the growth" in the company's sales, leaving Datametrics 
over-staffed relative to its incoming orders, White said. (Between 1985 and 
1988, its sales had more than doubled.) Meanwhile, some of its existing 
contracts -- most are "fixed cost" in which Datametrics agrees to make the 
product for a set price -- ran over budget. 
</P>
<P>
The company's interest costs more than doubled -- to $714,600 from $372,000 -- 
because of higher interest rates and Datametrics' increased borrowing. Higher 
research and development spending -- to $2.3 million from $911,000 in 1988 -- 
also contributed to last year's loss. Among other things, Datametrics is 
developing color printers to augment its traditional line of black and white 
printers. 
</P>
<P>
White said some of these problems are being fixed so that Datametrics can be 
profitable even if its sales remain flat. The company has slashed its work 
force by 30% since the end of 1988, to 255 employees from 365. It also improved 
its computer system, enabling managers of each of Datametrics' programs can 
keep closer tabs on how money is being spent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is more streamlined than it has been in the past," Bottoms said. 
</P>
<P>
White plans to help companies develop and market new products in the 
telecommunications, space and military industries. Without naming specific 
products, he said he wants to link small firms that have promising products 
with big companies that can finance development of those products in return for 
future sales royalties. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, White said, he'll draw a "deferred" salary from Datametrics of 
$60,000 a year for the next five years, and $30,000 a year for the five years 
after that. He earned $158,000 in 1989. White also retains a 5% stake in the 
company.

HOUSE PRICES END 3-MONTH FALL, RISE 5%

After falling for three straight months, the average resale price of a 
single-family house in the San Fernando Valley rose 5% in March to $307,100 
from $293,800 in February, the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The average was 11% higher than in March, 1989, when the average single-family 
house was resold for $276,600. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of single-family homes picked up markedly in March, rising 23% to 739 
from 602 in February. But the total number of sales was still 38% under the 
level of March, 1989, when 1,192 single-family houses were resold. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of a condominium, meanwhile, rose less than 1% in 
March, but hit a record high of $156,500, up from $156,000 in February. 
</P>
<P>
The new average marked a 16% increase since March, 1989, when the average 
resale price of a condominium was $134,900. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales rebounded 23% in March to 341 from 277 in February. But 
there were still 22% fewer condominium resales than in March, 1989, when 439 
condominiums changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this month's price increases, the Valley realty board said the large 
inventory was curbing prices, as reflected in the record number of 11,682 
condominiums and houses available for sale in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory of supply and demand is taking over because there are more homes 
for sale and buyers have more bargaining power on their side," Jim Link, the 
board's executive vice president, said in a statement. "That's forcing many 
sellers to negotiate and take a little less profit." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board is California's largest, and it reports on the resales 
of houses and condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to 
Agoura.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CAMERA PLATFORMS CUTS LOSS FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camera Platforms International reported a fourth-quarter loss of $798,000, 
compared with a year-earlier loss of $884,000. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly narrower loss for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, came on a 43% 
increase in revenue, to $370,000 from $259,000, said Camera Platforms, a 
Valencia-based concern that makes production equipment for the movie and 
television industries. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Camera Platforms lost $3.03 million on revenue of $1.5 
million. In 1988, the company lost $4.71 million on revenue of $902,000, which 
included a $1.5-million charge related to a writedown in the value of certain 
assets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Litton Industries Inc. of Beverly Hills sold its encoder business in Chatsworth 
to a subsidiary of BEI Electronics Inc. of San Francisco, an electronic 
components manufacturer, BEI said. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, which included the sale of Litton's ITEK Measurement Systems 
operation in Newton, Mass., was for an undisclosed amount of cash, plus the 
assumption of debt, according to BEI.

CANCERWATCH: News that the state is unveiling a tough anti-smoking campaign 
(A3) got a warm reception in Orange County. "It's tremendous!" exulted local 
American Cancer Society spokesman Kirk Wilks. Already, he noted, fewer people 
are believed to be smoking here (20%, down from 50% three decades ago). . . . 
Even so, lung cancer deaths here are up from 645 in 1979 to at least 878 last 
year. Lanie Jones and Eric Bailey

KAISER WALKOUT ENDS; CLINICS IN O.C. TO RE-OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a radical turnabout, striking technicians, maintenance workers and licensed 
vocational nurses at Kaiser Permanente's Southern California hospitals and 
clinics voted Monday to accept a new contract offer and return to work 
beginning this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The vote -- 4,118 to 2,592 in favor -- ended an eight-day walkout over wages 
that began after a smaller number of workers voted overwhelmingly on March 30 
to reject a nearly identical contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser spokeswoman Janice Fowler Seib said workers at seven hospitals and 45 
clinics in Los Angeles and Orange counties would be asked to report back over a 
staggered three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 supervisory and management personnel, including many from Northern 
California Kaiser hospitals, have filled in since 11,200 members of Service 
Employee International Union Local 399 went on strike April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's 2 million Southern California members were forced to cancel or 
postpone most elective surgery. The number of patients in Kaiser hospitals was 
45% of normal Monday and doctor office visits were 17% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred seriously ill patients were transferred to other Kaiser 
facilities during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente officials in Orange County plan to re-open today four clinics 
that were closed when the strike began, spokeswoman Donna Drasner said. Six 
other clinics and the Kaiser hospital in Anaheim had continued operating during 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Local 399 President Jim Zellers attributed Monday's sharp reversal of opinion 
to the fact that Kaiser provided far more detailed wage data to workers than it 
had given before the March 30 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Zellers praised his members for their "solidarity." However, he also noted that 
the workers who made the difference in Monday's election were primarily 
stay-at-home union members who had not participated in the first vote or in 
picketing and were far less willing to risk a strike. Nearly 50% more employees 
participated in Monday's vote, compared to March 30 -- many after being urged 
to do so by Kaiser supervisors who telephoned them at home. 
</P>
<P>
Seib called the ratification "a true victory for all concerned" and said it 
balanced Kaiser's concerns for its employees with pressure to keep soaring 
health costs in check. 
</P>
<P>
News of the ratification stunned a sizable number of angry rank-and-file 
members of Local 399, who had defied their leadership's recommendation to 
accept Kaiser's initial contract offer and had voted against the second offer 
just as vehemently in the hope that a longer strike could make an economic 
dent. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have held out longer," said Dawn White, an ultrasound technician at 
the Kaiser hospital in Anaheim who voted against the contract. "I was not happy 
with it. But it's history now." 
</P>
<P>
White and others who voted against the agreement complained that the new 
contract did not include additional money. 
</P>
<P>
Seib acknowledged that the new offer, in essence, shifted some of the $44 
million in raises proposed in the first offer to the second and third years and 
provided more specifics about raises for patient-care and technical employees, 
who are in demand throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will receive raises ranging from 5% to 6% in the first year and 3% to 
7% in each of the last two years of the contract. The new contract added 
"longevity compensation" for longtime employees and a guarantee that workers 
could use a floating holiday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote came after Kaiser and the strikers bargained several days last 
week with little apparent progress. On Friday night, Kaiser offered a the new 
proposal. At the request of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, 
which oversaw negotiations during the strike, the union agreed to submit the 
offer to employees. However, it declined to make a recommendation to members on 
how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the pressure on hospitals throughout the nation to find and keep 
patient care and technical employees, the new proposal offered a 34% increase 
over three years to radiation-therapy technicians, paying them nearly $21 an 
hour by 1992, and a 31% increase to licensed vocational nurses, bringing them 
to $13.80 an hour by the last year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a housekeeping attendant's pay would increase only 17% over three 
years, to $9.33. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaiser offer was superior to the average collective bargaining agreement 
now being negotiated by American labor unions. However, according to union 
health-care experts, it was less than the average raise being extended to 
health-care workers. And according to many rank-and-file members, the contract 
was unacceptable because it failed to make up for the 1987 contract. 
</P>
<P>
Union members talked bitterly Monday about having accepted a three-year wage 
freeze in 1987 after Kaiser officials insisted that the company -- the nation's 
oldest and largest health maintenance organization -- was in danger of losing 
its domination of the HMO market and needed to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"You work so hard for the company because they're so far behind," said Ardy 
Washington, a senior membership clerk at Kaiser Sunset, who said she voted 
against the contract Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser subsequently increased its market share -- it now has 55% of the HMO 
members in California -- and is still generally regarded as among the 
best-paying health-care organizations in the country, according to Cathy 
Schoen, a national health-care consultant for the union. She said the 1987 wage 
freeze in Southern California and a two-year wage freeze imposed by Kaiser's 
Northern California facilities in 1986 represented a departure from Kaiser's 
national pay patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Local 399 spokesman Tom Ramsey said that after the 1987 contract, many 
employees felt betrayed by Kaiser when it embarked on a $5-billion capital 
expansion program to open 40 additional medical clinics and 10 new hospitals in 
Southern California over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Workers said they also were upset by what they referred to as a "speed-up" by 
supervisors bent on further reducing labor costs and coping with personnel 
shortages. In 1988, Kaiser officials formally apologized to Southern California 
employees for an unpopular demerit system that was intended to curb tardiness 
and absenteeism. The system automatically doled out demerits based on time-card 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
"The cynicism you hear from workers now -- that's a real qualitative change I 
have seen," Ramsey said. "Especially the people in the center -- the solid, 
stable, family kind of people."

CAR-POOL BACKERS, PROTESTERS FACE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A protest group angry about the delayed opening of car-pool lanes on the San 
Diego Freeway, and another group being blamed for the delay, met Monday in a 
showdown demonstration at a pedestrian overpass in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But their standoff was cut short when a California Highway Patrol car pulled 
into the diamond lane below and told the protesters that they were disrupting 
traffic and would have to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
The first group, made up of corporate car-pool advocates, held up a sign that 
read: "Orange County employers say: Open the car-pool lanes." 
</P>
<P>
They were transportation coordinators from AVCO Financial Services, McDonnell 
Douglas Space Systems, Burlington Air Express and others. They said they 
represent about 13,000 employees who are upset about the delayed opening of 14 
miles of car-pool lanes on the northbound and southbound 405 Freeway between 
the Santa Ana and Corona del Mar freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Newton, transportation coordinator for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, 
said that about 2,000 of the company's 8,400 employees participate in car pools 
or van pools, or use an alternative form of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls from our employees daily saying, 'When are they going to open the 
lanes?' " Newton said. Opening the car-pool lanes could trim commute times by 
about half an hour for some employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the overpass at Yale Avenue and Michelson Drive, the car-pool advocates met 
an eight-person counterprotest organized by Drivers for Highway Safety, the 
group that the transportation coordinators blame for the delays because of a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Santa Ana, contends that Caltrans did 
not conduct the state-required studies to test the diamond lane's effect on 
"safety, congestion and highway capacity" before beginning construction, said 
Bill Ward, DHS co-chairman. DHS also contends that car-pool lanes increase 
accident rates and do not alleviate traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
But Albert Miranda, Caltrans spokesman, said that all necessary studies had 
been conducted for the new diamond lanes and the results were included in a 
preliminary environmental impact report filed before construction began. 
Miranda added that the DHS suit, which goes to court April 19, has not delayed 
the lanes' opening. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Miranda said the northbound car-pool lane on the 405 could open as 
early as this Friday. The southbound lane should open in late April. MARY HELEN

ACCUSED SENIOR DISMISSED FROM UCI

<TEXT>
<P>
A UC Irvine senior who was accused of involvement in a scam to steal written 
exams has been dismissed from the school after refusing to appear before a 
disciplinary hearing, university officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But the student's attorney said his client was improperly dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
In order to be readmitted, university spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler said, 
Amir Bagherzadeh, 22, will have to formally apply and receive specific approval 
from the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
But Bagherzadeh's attorney, Lawrence Ecoff, said that while his client declined 
a formal hearing before a faculty and student board, he filed notice of appeal 
within seven days as specified by the university's rules. He also said his 
client informally met with Sarah Johnson, the assistant dean of students, and 
with university ombudsman Ron Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, he's being dismissed without being given an opportunity to present 
the facts," Ecoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagherzadeh, a biological sciences major, and another student were arrested in 
February after they used a key to enter the office of the chairman of the 
molecular biology and biochemistry department, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagherzadeh has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed at Municipal Court in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after their arrests, the second student accused in connection with the 
thefts shot himself once in the chest and died in a Tijuana hotel. DANICA KIRKA

21 SOCIAL PROGRAMS ENDORSED FOR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county advisory group has recommended that more than $5 million in state 
money be used to support 21 programs for preventing crime and for counseling 
juvenile offenders, according to a draft copy of its final report obtained 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the County Justice System Advisory Group, endorses 21 
programs for available state funds, ranging from probation services to youth 
shelters, from drug prevention agencies to foster home programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some very tough decisions were made across a wide variety of programs, but I 
think the process worked very well, and these programs will go a long ways 
toward addressing the needs of the county," said Mike Schumacher, the county's 
chief probation officer and a member of the advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group have been meeting for months and reviewing programs that 
requested money through state crime prevention and juvenile justice funds. That 
money is allocated by the county, but the recommended expenditures have to be 
submitted to the state for final approval.

<P>
This year, as in previous ones, the requests for funds far outpaced the supply, 
leaving many groups short of their need. In the area of juvenile delinquency 
prevention, for instance, thirteen organizations made requests totaling 
$644,410. Of those, only eight were recommended for funding and they would have 
to split $218,021. 
</P>
<P>
Although representatives of the panel and several of the groups selected for 
funds commended the list of recommended programs, some intend to appeal the 
recommendations when they come before the Orange County Board of Supervisors on 
April 25. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups that is not recommended for funding is Programa Shortstop, a 
proposed Spanish-language extension of the highly touted Shortstop Program, 
which steers youth offenders into classes run by judges and locks the 
youngsters in holding cells to scare them out of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scared-straight, reality program," said Kathy Bonner, Shortstop's 
program director. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher agreed that the program has compiled a commendable record and said 
it was left off only because the group had a limited budget to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of simply not having enough money to go around," he said. 
"There's still much more that needs to be done, that goes without saying." JIM 
NEWTON

At one time, all three buildings in the 24500 block of Del Prado Avenue housed 
thriving businesses. But Dana Point Glass moved several blocks away, Windsurfer 
magazine drifted to the Los Angeles area and the Captain's Anchorage restaurant 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The 73,000-square-foot site is the future home of the Dana Point Post Office. 
But in the meantime, the buildings sit unattended, attracting vagrants and 
prompting complaints from area residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern for us because they're almost inviting for anybody who's 
transient," said Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "We 
can't really prevent people from going inside, and the potential for danger is 
very high. . . . I've been inside some very poor-conditioned businesses and 
residences in my time with the department, but this was the absolute worst." 
</P>
<P>
Martini said sheriff's deputies have arrested several trespassers using the 
place as temporary living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government bought the five lots of property about two years ago, 
according to Terry Luccarelli, who owned the restaurant and glass company, and 
Arlene Pierce, who owned the magazine building. Demolition of the structures 
has been held up because there is asbestos in the restaurant and magazine 
building, said Joe Breckenridge, manager of communications for the U.S. Postal 
Service's Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
"Asbestos is such a hazardous material that it has slowed us down there," 
Breckenridge said. "It is something that has to be treated very carefully. We 
can't just bulldoze it until the asbestos has been removed." 
</P>
<P>
Breckenridge estimated that the glass and magazine buildings will be destroyed 
within three months and that the old restaurant will be gone within three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After that, a post office of about 20,000 square feet -- to be designed by 
Gilbert Aja Associates of Irvine -- will be built on the property, Breckenridge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
None of that will be done too quickly for merchants and residents of the 
neighborhood, however. 
</P>
<P>
From his kitchen window across Coast Highway, Jim Hayton can see the 
boarded-up, abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even begin to describe what it's like in those buildings," Hayton 
said. "The smell and the flies -- it's incredible." LEN HALL

SOLUTIONS SOUGHT TO SCHOOL CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing increasing enrollment at a number of its westside schools, the Orange 
Unified School District is considering a variety of options to accommodate more 
students that range from condemning property for construction of new schools to 
establishing year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
This week, principals, administrators and parents are being asked for their 
input on the plans presented to the Board of Education last week by Skip 
Roland, the assistant superintendent for elementary school education. 
</P>
<P>
Among the long-term solutions are proposals to shift some schools to a 
year-round schedule, construct additions or add portable classrooms to some 
schools, move sixth-graders to a middle school in selected areas, bus students 
to currently closed sites, redraw district lines and condemn property to build 
new schools where there is no open land. 
</P>
<P>
Roland said portable classrooms must be added or renovated at eight elementary 
schools. These include Cambridge, Chapman Hills, Fairhaven, Fletcher, Lampson, 
Panorama, Sycamore and West Orange elementary schools. Estimated total cost for 
renovations is close to $500,000, he said but added that the cost could be 
reduced by moving existing portables from other sites. 
</P>
<P>
Roland said enrollment is growing because of the increasing number of young 
families moving into the Orange area. LAURA MICHAELIS

POLICE DETECTIVE FACES THEFT CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
A Buena Park police detective was charged Monday with one count of felony grand 
theft in connection with the theft of $970 from a Garden Grove house he had 
searched while on duty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Mallos, 30, of Ontario, has been placed on paid administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
He has agreed to surrender at his arraignment hearing, scheduled for Friday in 
West Orange Municipal Court in Westminster, Buena Park Police Chief Richard 
Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
Tefank and district attorney's officials said Mallos had a warrant to search a 
house owned by Dorothy Smith on July 22, 1989. Officials would not provide 
details of the search beyond saying that several items were seized. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 21, 1990, Smith complained to Buena Park police that Mallos had cashed 
a $660 money order taken from her house. Another $310 in cash was also missing, 
Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
Tefank said the department referred the report to the district attorney's 
office, which routinely investigates complaints against police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Tefank said the department will perform an administrative investigation to 
determine the "level of additional action to be taken." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Mallos, who has been with the department for four years, nor his 
attorney was available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Crandall said that Mallos has denied stealing anything 
but that she could not comment on details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"He served the search warrant and he cashed the postal money order," Crandall 
said. "The fact that we filed charges speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
If he is found guilty, Mallos could face a sentence of up to three years in 
prison. DAVAN MAHARAJ

MISS BUENA PARK STRIPPED OF CROWN OVER HER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Local pageant officials announced Monday that the reigning Miss Buena Park, 
crowned only two months ago, will be stripped of her title because of a breach 
of contract. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, who concurred with the decision, said the 26-year-old winner 
apparently provided misleading information about her school attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Merlyn Lans, executive director of the Miss Buena Park Scholarship Pageant, 
made the announcement during a press conference but refused to say why April 
Lynch of Huntington Beach had been disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
After making her announcement, Lans officially handed over the title to first 
runner-up Deborah Donnelly, 25, of La Palma, who will now receive the $1,000 
scholarship originally set aside for Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after conferring hastily by conference calls, officials of the Miss 
California Pageant said they had to go along with Lans' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Arnhym, president of the Miss California Pageant, said Lans presented 
them with enough evidence to show that, while Lynch had registered as a student 
at Cypress College, she had not been attending classes. Pageant rules say 
contestants must live or attend an accredited school in the cities of Buena 
Park, La Palma, Cypress or Fullerton in order to be eligible. The winner enters 
the Miss California Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any information to the contrary to the information provided by 
Mrs. Lans," Arnhym said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous disappointment to us," he said, adding that Lynch had 
entered local beauty pageants before. "She has never qualified to the state 
finals until this year. Unfortunately, we don't have any alternative." 
</P>
<P>
One of the pageant contestants said that after Lynch won the crown in February, 
some of the other contestants and their parents told Lans that they suspected 
Lynch was not actually a student at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The Miss Buena Park Pageant is a preliminary to the Miss California and Miss 
America pageants. Up until three years ago, the pageant was sponsored by the 
Buena Park Chamber of Commerce. It is now a privately run, nonprofit franchise 
that was started by Lans in December of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Monday night that Lans was aware that she was not actually attending 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"From day one, Merlyn was aware of every situation. She told me I could enroll 
full time and later drop the classes," Lynch said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
She said if she had known that she wasn't eligible to be Miss Buena Park, she 
would have gone to another pageant where she was eligible. Lynch said she has a 
bachelor's degree from the University of California at San Diego, and that she 
will begin classes at UCLA in September to get a certificate in radio and 
television broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my dream," she said. She has competed for six years in a variety of 
local pageants, taking first runner-up five times, "This was my only 
opportunity to go to Miss California." 
</P>
<P>
Because she is 26, she is not eligible next year. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that trouble has visited the Miss Buena Park pageant. 
Last year several contestants threatened to take then-executive director Maria 
Sorensen to court because they said they did not receive their scholarship 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen, who now resides in San Diego, said one of the contestants failed to 
attend the annual Silverado Days festivities as stipulated in her contract, so 
she was not entitled to the money. The other contestant, she said, did not fill 
out her paper work correctly for the scholarship funds. Sorensen said the 
contestants have since received their money.

<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Gonzales' first hit of the season gave relief pitcher Ben Strack his first 
win of the year in Tustin High School's 4-3 victory over Ocean View Monday at 
Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
The game pitted Ocean View, the top-ranked team in the Orange County 
Sportswriters' Assn. prep baseball poll, against the second-ranked Tillers in 
the second round of the 26th Santa Ana Elks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played a quality game that didn't end until Gonzales' pinch-hit in 
the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (14-1) held a 3-1 lead after five innings, but Ocean View tied the score 
with runs in the sixth and seventh innings. Tustin starter Bill Courtney 
allowed only six hits through 8 1/3 innings but left the game after he twisted 
his left ankle fielding a bunt in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (13-3) had its share of early scoring opportunities, getting six 
walks in five innings. But the Seahawks failed to get a timely hit against 
Courtney until they tied the score in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's Duane Page (6-1) pitched four scoreless innings in relief of 
starter Jim Gwaltney, but the right-hander gave up a single and then walked two 
to load the bases in the 10th, setting up Gonzales' winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales squibbed a short fly ball over a drawn-in infield to drive in Ben 
Munoz. Gonzales said he hit a pitch "that sort of wiggled" for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to get Andy's confidence back in the situation," said assistant 
coach Bruce King, who was filling in for Vince Brown. Brown is visiting his 
younger brother, Gerran, who serves in the Peace Corps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy hurt his shoulder in the first week of the season and hasn't done 
anything for a month. He's a good contact hitter who just needs to get his 
confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
Strack (1-1) escaped a jam in the 10th when Tustin left fielder Brett Hardy 
made a fine running catch and doubled a runner off second to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the ball was going to fall in there, but the kid made a great play," 
said Steve Barrett, Ocean View coach. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 6, Diamond Bar 0 -- Todd Wilson (3-2) pitched a three-hitter and 
struck out nine and Jason Martian drove in two with a single in the seventh for 
Villa Park (9-5-1). Mike Stephens stole home in the fourth inning for the 
Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 11, Orange 9 -- The Griffins rallied from a 9-5 deficit with three 
runs in the fifth inning and three more in the sixth. Tony Napolitano hit a 
two-run homer in the second for Los Alamitos. Jeff Peterson had three hits and 
four RBIs for Orange. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 1, Pacifica 0 -- Greg Pearce pitched a five-hitter, striking out one, 
to lead El Toro at Santa Ana. Tim Powers had an RBI single in the third for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley 8, Foothill 1 -- Scott Crosby had three hits, including two 
home runs, to lead Santa Ana Valley (6-8) at Tustin. Crosby also pitched six 
shutout innings, allowing three hits and striking out five, for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr 4, Santa Ana 3 (12 innings) -- Jose Betran's sacrifice fly with one out in 
the 12th inning gave Gahr the victory at Santa Ana. Bill Bergeron had three 
hits for Gahr. Jose Morales had three hits and two RBIs for Santa Ana (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 6, Saddleback 5 (12 innings) -- Don Bisbro led off the bottom of 
the seventh with a solo home run to tie the score, 5-5, and Tim Snowden's 
one-out single scored Lee Williams from second in the 12th. Snowden was four 
for seven.

LLOYD RETURNS TO TURN CHAPMAN'S SOFTBALL PROGRAM AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lisle Lloyd was faced with quite a task when he returned to Chapman College to 
coach women's softball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he taking over a team that finished last in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. the season before, but the college also had decided 
to drop softball scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who was with Chapman for six years before being replaced by his 
assistant, Gary Haning, last season, persuaded all 13 of the returning players 
to stay -- though only the three currently on partial scholarships would 
continue to receive funding. 
</P>
<P>
So what has Lloyd been able to accomplish? Well, the Panthers (33-13, 6-6) are 
ranked 14th in the NCAA's latest Division II poll and are third in the 
conference behind Cal State Bakersfield (ranked No. 1) and Cal State Northridge 
(No. 4). Chapman is ranked fourth in the Western Region, and four teams qualify 
for the NCAA playoffs from each of the four regions. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is led by junior pitcher Jacki Blake, who has a 17-3 record, a 0.16 
earned-run average and 112 strikeouts. Sophomore third baseman Sandy Olivas is 
batting .466 with 12 home runs and an .831 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"The team just really clicks this year. Everybody gets along with everybody," 
said Lloyd, who coached last season at Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's softball team isn't the only nationally ranked team on campus. The 
men's tennis team is ranked third in the latest Division II poll and the 
baseball team is ranked 16th. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis team is led by the fifth-ranked doubles team of David Seline and 
Darren Capik. The baseball team, led by first baseman-outfielder Mike Guiseffi 
(hitting .459), will face UC Riverside, which is leading the conference, in a 
three-game series beginning Thursday in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't blame the Southern California College baseball team for feeling a 
bit left out. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards are tied for the lead in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
with Cal Baptist (24-8, 9-3), which was ranked 12th in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics poll released Monday, and Azusa Pacific (20-10, 9-3), 
which was unranked but among teams receiving votes. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Christian (23-13-1, 9-3) received no mention at all in the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who does the rankings, but we should be ranked," SCC Coach 
Charlie Phillips said. "But that's OK. It's who's on top at the end that 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
SCC plays host to Cal Baptist today. Jim Dedrick, who has an 8-1 record and a 
1.80 ERA, will start for SCC. 
</P>
<P>
Christ College Irvine's baseball team has already won more than twice as many 
games as it did last season, but Coach Scott Sarver says the Eagles' record 
should be better. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost 11 one-run ballgames and that's terrible," Sarver said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sarver's first as coach, the Eagles were 6-33 and had to forfeit a 
number of games because of a lack of players. This season, Sarver has filled 
the squad with new recruits -- designated hitter Mike Johnson is the only 
returning starter -- and Christ College is 16-18, 4-8 in conference. Saturday, 
Christ College split a doubleheader with conference co-leader Azusa Pacific.

10 FEDERAL SUITS IN THRIFT CASE SENT TO PHOENIX; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LEGAL ACTION BY BONDHOLDERS IN LINCOLN SAVINGS' PARENT FIRM ARE 
CONSOLIDATED UNDER ONE JUDGE. ORANGE COUNTY CASES AREN'T AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 10 federal lawsuits filed by bondholders who lost their investments with 
the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent firm are being transferred 
from U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A court order by a U.S. administrative panel consolidates the cases before 
Judge Richard M. Bilby, who has been overseeing the government's civil 
racketeering case against former Lincoln operators as well as the bankruptcy of 
the S&amp;L's former parent, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidating the cases before Bilby for all pretrial purposes is necessary "to 
avoid duplication of discovery, prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings" and 
conserve resources, according to the order issued Friday from the seven-member 
Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Moving the cases to Arizona made sense, the panel said, because American 
Continental is headquartered there, many defendants and witnesses are located 
there and a document depository holding more than 20 million pages of material 
has been set up. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 22,000 small investors purchased almost $200 million in American 
Continental bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. The bonds 
became worthless after the company filed for bankruptcy last April 13. Federal 
regulators seized Lincoln the following day, and the S&amp;L is expected to 
become one of the nation's costliest failures, with a taxpayer bill of $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders filed 10 lawsuits in federal court and seven actions in Orange 
County Superior Court. Their lawyers have been divided over the issue of where 
the federal litigation should be consolidated. The Orange County cases are not 
affected by the panel's order. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Cotchett Jr. of Burlingame and Ronald Rus of Orange had argued before 
the panel to keep the federal bondholder cases before U.S. District Judge 
Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles. They also have taken the lead in the state 
court cases in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a tragedy for the investors," Cotchett said. "Many of them are 
old and disabled, and all this is going to do is build in further delay. It 
appears the investors' only recourse now is the Superior Court, where they can 
invoke state statutes to get to trial quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Other bondholder lawyers took a softer approach. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we fought about it was because we didn't want to lose our 
trial date of Aug. 13," said Kevin P. Roddy of Los Angeles, another bondholder 
lawyer. "We didn't want wheels of justice slowing down." 
</P>
<P>
The request to move the cases to Phoenix came from David B. Gold of San 
Francisco, who filed a suit on behalf of bondholders last fall. He said Bilby 
was a logical choice to hear the cases because he already is familiar with the 
issues and has handled other massive, complex litigation, including bondholder 
litigation over the failure of the Washington Public Power &amp; Supply System. 
</P>
<P>
Most defense lawyers favor the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good because it will put pressure on people to settle the issues," said 
James J. Feder of Los Angeles, a lawyer for American Continental. "It's also 
good to get this litigation in one place so lawyers can't play one judge off 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Feder said he expects other related litigation, including the state Department 
of Corporations suit against three American Continental officers, to be 
transferred to Bilby also. 
</P>
<P>
In another legal matter involving Lincoln, accountant Jack D. Atchison invoked 
his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify 
on behalf of American Continental in a hearing challenging the regulatory 
takeover of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Atchison was an Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting partner who was the chief 
auditor of Lincoln and American Continental in 1987 and 1988. He was later 
hired by American Continental for more than $900,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., wasn't hesitant to 
testify before the federal court in Washington, however. He testified, as he 
has before, that government regulators, not he or his executives, ruined 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran a perfectly legitimate savings and loan," he said. "It's hogwash to say 
otherwise.

Delta II Launch: McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington Beach plans 
to launch a Delta II rocket for the government of Indonesia at 6:28 p.m. 
Thursday from Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket's mission is to deliver a Palapa B-2R communications satellite to 
geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite will join two Palapa satellites already in orbit and 
electronically link the people of Indonesia with their island neighbors through 
high-speed data relays and telephone and television signals. Each Delta II 
rocket launch generates about $50 million in revenue for McDonnell Douglas, 
said Anne McCauley, a company spokeswoman. The company plans 12 launches in 
1990.

HUGHES AIRCRAFT TO TRADE IN 1,000 OLD PCS FOR NEW APPLE, IBM COMPUTERS

Hughes Aircraft Co.'s Ground Systems Group in Fullerton said Monday that it 
will trade as many as 1,000 aging personal computers for discounted new Apple 
Macintosh and IBM systems in a buyback program with Businessland, a computer 
retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
"This buyback program offers us a cost-efficient way to replace 30% of our 
current systems, which are over 4 years old, with new systems at a potential 
savings of close to $500,000," said Mary Howlett, Hughes manager of management 
information technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is one of the country's largest Macintosh users, and the Ground Systems 
Group has about 2,500 Macintoshes currently in use. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes unit imposed a moratorium on computer purchases in May, 1989, after 
an internal review showed that it had two PCs for every employee. The company 
concluded that it had the right ratio of computers to employees, but it decided 
to upgrade its computers after a study indicated that obsolete equipment was 
taking a toll on employee productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Apple officials said they are aggressively pursuing buyback clients who would 
like to replace older PCs with newer models. Hughes said it will save more than 
50% off the retail price of the PCs it purchases because of credits for used 
equipment and volume purchase discounts.

Sculptors are invited to submit slides of their work for possible placement in 
the city of Brea's consignment art program, which installs pieces for one-year 
periods on publicly owned property. One location awaiting art is a newly 
landscaped area at the intersection of Lambert Road and the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Work will be selected by the city's Cultural Arts Commission, which makes 
recommendations to the City Council. The city will pay for transportation and 
installation costs, as well as insurance. The rationale for the project is that 
developers required to purchase works of art in accordance with the city's Art 
in Public Places program would be exposed on a regular basis to a range of 
potential selections. For more information, call Scott Riordan, program 
coordinator in the Brea Community Services Department: (714) 990-7723.

THREE SCULPTORS DISCUSS THE ART OF 'OBJECTIVES';

"The thing that I'm preoccupied with is the whole idea of change and the issue 
of ambivalence," said artist Haim Steinbach. "You know that song by the Rolling 
Stones, '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'? Well, I think that's about 
ambivalence. There are so many options that you find you can't make a decision. 
So in a sense, you have fewer options. 
</P>
<P>
"(We have a) 'hover-culture.' Something is hovering over us, which has to do 
with this fear that everything's going to fall apart. There are sudden 
explosions of this, like the Ayatollah in Iran. Or the history of what happened 
(under Nazi rule) in Germany, in the middle of Western culture. . . . There's 
this desire to crawl back into your shell and just be happy in your home, but 
you turn on the TV and you're invaded. You won't be able to live in your own 
little world and be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach, the most articulate of the three artists in a Sunday afternoon panel 
discussion at Newport Harbor Art Museum, was talking about some of the ideas 
that underlie his work in "OBJECTives: The New Sculpture." The exhibit, through 
June 24, showcases the work of eight American and European conceptual artists 
who are concerned with the psychological, sociological, perceptual and 
intellectual roles of objects in contemporary society. 
</P>
<P>
Working with objects drawn from many contexts -- from mass-produced items to 
one-of-a-kind crafts pieces -- Steinbach organizes them in ways that suggest 
new points of reference. His piece in the show, "Untitled (daybed, coffin)," is 
a massive, two-sided box that contains a folk art coffin with a papier-mache 
skeleton on one side and a sleek daybed by modernist architect Ludwig Mies van 
der Rohe on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Moderator Paul Schimmel, the museum's chief curator and organizer of the 
exhibit, asked how it happened that three-dimensional conceptual work came to 
occupy such a prominent position in today's art world, as opposed to the glory 
days of painting during the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with a place, it has to do with a way of thinking, it has to do 
with a particular culture and the way things change," Steinbach said. "It's 
like the advent of computers -- where were they in the '70s? Or jet planes -- 
where were they in the '50s? 
</P>
<P>
"There was a kind of 'cover-up' -- I'm being playful when I say 'cover-up' -- 
in terms of the market, in terms of the media, in terms of really active 
promotion of a kind of art that (actually) was going on (in the late '70s and 
early '80s). There is work being done right now by artists who are just not 
seen. A project (happens) because you come to certain conclusions. It doesn't 
necessarily go along with what anybody else is looking at." 
</P>
<P>
What Steinbach was looking at a decade ago was the strange fact that conceptual 
artists were fiercely interested in connections between art and life, yet they 
weren't using objects from the real world in their art.

"Does the art experience only reside in work made by an author, an artist who 
uses his hands?" he asked rhetorically. "Or can one have this incredible 
(impression) left by objects arranged in an unusual way? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to find out something about them. We take for granted that we 
understand them. What interests me is that there are cultural situations that 
cause things to be the way they are: this microphone, this pen, this pad, this 
plastic cup. What does it mean that in a home, there's an arrangement of 
objects? I want to stop and reexamine that relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I thought the exhibition had a lot to do with distance and 
coolness," Schimmel said. "I was wrong. Some very human issues are being 
addressed in the work, like a pervasive theme of death. . . . I've ended up 
organizing an exhibition that deals with realism." 
</P>
<P>
"I think abstract art has become realistic," Steinbach said. "One of the big 
debates in '80s in art is about representation. It's (a) much bigger (field) 
than the, quote, traditional representational image. . . . There's abstract 
thinking, and it could be applied to all kinds of representation." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a man in the audience how a realist painting could be an abstraction, 
Steinbach gave as an example the paintings by Ronald Jones: attractive 
geometrical designs that are in fact reproductions -- done to scale and reduced 
-- of the plans of buildings in Berlin where the Nazis tortured their captives. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel asked whether the panelists felt their work had a specifically 
nationalistic character. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an artist had to do with being sensitive to your environment, your 
experience," Steinbach said. "It's not easy. It's easier to fall into a pattern 
of mimicry, to have role models for approval, then to respond to your immediate 
situation -- what's happening in front of your nose. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you have your sense of place and experience. But (thanks to the media) 
you know every place where someone is being brutally murdered or where the 
latest advance in technology is going on. That's an international effect 
changing the whole notion of an artist with a national identity." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the question-and-answer session, after Steinbach left to catch 
a plane back to New York, that the other two panelists -- Spanish artist Juan 
Munoz and British artist Grenville Davey -- came into their own. The topic that 
enthralled them, with a certain bizarre logic, was the lobby of the Marriott 
Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz's piece in the show features an optically distorting, patterned floor, 
guarded by two demons on pedestals. As the viewer walks across the floor, it 
seems to change slightly. 
</P>
<P>
But with a straight face, he claimed to find the hotel lobby "a far superior 
artwork" to his own. "It's about a mile walk, really well done. People will 
feel desolated. There are completely unnecessary turnings. The (designs on the) 
carpets change directions. There is Mozart (playing) in the background, making 
you feel as though you're in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the deepest admiration for it. I wish I could do a long corridor. Haim 
and I could spend the next two days without finding the elevator." 
</P>

PERFORMING ARTS CENTER TO OFFER MODERN DANCE PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SEASON: THE APPEARANCE BY THE MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK WILL 
BE A FIRST FOR THE CENTER, WHICH IS EXPLORING THE EXTENT OF INTEREST HERE IN 
THE GENRE.

In a departure from its past emphasis on ballet, the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center will for the first time present a modern dance troupe, Center 
officials said Monday in announcing their 1990-91 dance season. 
</P>
<P>
The Martha Graham Dance Company of New York will make its only Southern 
California appearances Jan. 4-6, 1991, at the Center. The Graham company 
programs will be offered in addition to a subscription package of three ballet 
companies that includes the previously reported engagements of the Australian 
Ballet Aug. 7-12; and the New York City Ballet, Sept. 25-30, 1990, in its first 
return engagement at the Center since 1986. Rounding out the season will be the 
fifth appearance at to the Center by the American Ballet Theatre, March 12-24, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Graham dates represent an experiment for the Center, and they will be 
offered as an option for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We will find out what interest there is for modern dance" in Orange County, 
Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. "If the Graham experience is 
good, I think there are certain other companies that we might be able to 
handle" as options for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from the list is the Joffrey Ballet, which has been part of 
the Center's ballet series three times over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the very beginning that we are not committed to any one 
company on an annual basis," Kendrick said. "Our goal is to provide a range of 
companies over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the decision not to bring the Joffrey next season was "absolutely 
not" related to the collapse of negotiations between ABT and the Los Angeles 
Music Center Operating Company in December, something that ABT Executive 
Director Jane Hermann attributed to the Joffrey's residency at the Music 
Center. (Officials at the Music Center, however, denied Hermann's charge.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have had (the Joffrey) several times and anticipate having them again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham will be represented by two programs of mixed repertory: One will include 
her classic "Appalachian Spring," set to Copland's score, and the other, her 
"Errand Into the Maze." 
</P>
<P>
For its exclusive West Coast engagement, the New York Ballet will lean heavily 
upon repertory by founding artistic director George Balanchine. "La Source," 
"Stars and Stripes," "Four Temperaments" and the infrequently toured "Vienna 
Waltzes" will be among the works danced. 
</P>
<P>
The run by American Ballet Theatre will be split between mixed repertory (to be 
announced) and either Natalia Makarova's staging of "La Bayadere" or a new 
production of "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the Australian Ballet will dance "Giselle," Lichine's 
"Graduation Ball," Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" and others to be announced by 
Australian and New Zealand choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for subscription tickets will range from $57 to $190; they will include 
four events -- one each by the Australian and New York City ballets, and two 
performances by ABT. Tickets for the Graham programs will be offered as an 
option for subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Subscription tickets will go on sale May 20. Tickets for individual programs 
will go on sale about six weeks before each engagement. Information is 
available at (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
The season: 
</P>
<P>
* Aug. 7-12: Australian Ballet: Maina Gielgud's staging of "Giselle," 
"Graduation Ball" (Johann Strauss); Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" (Lalo); other 
works to be announced. 
</P>
<P>

Lehar, Johann and Richard Strauss); "Stars and Stripes" (Sousa), "Four 
Temperaments" (Hindemith), "Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3," "Concerto Barocco" 
(Bach); "La Source" (Delibes); "Chaconne" (Gluck); Jerome Robbins' "Dances at a 
Gathering" (Chopin); and Peter Martins' "Ecstatic Orange" (Michael Torke). 
Other works by Balanchine and Martins are being considered. 
</P>
<P>

Surinach); "Deep Song" (Henry Cowell); "Appalachian Spring" (Copland);

LEONARDO TRIO IN SOUTHLAND DEBUT AT SUNNY HILLS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Chamber ensembles, like fine wines, generally require a certain maturation 
before their full potential comes to fruition. At the tender musical age of 
five years, the Leonardo Trio not only bestows sweet pleasure but hints at even 
more delectable music-making in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Martin's rarely heard "Trio on Irish Folk Tunes" opened the group's 
Southland debut concert Sunday at the Sunny Hills Performing Art Center. 
Whether the piece was programmed in honor of the Swiss composer's centennial or 
not, the group convincingly captured the requisite flavor of the title without 
short-changing the nuances inherent in the 1924 work. 
</P>
<P>
Even when it came to familiar composers, the Leonardo chose musical roads less 
taken: for Beethoven, not the "Archduke" or "Ghost" trios, but Opus 70, No. 2 
in E-flat. Its four movements (all in moderate to quick tempos) emerged 
dominated by the least likely characteristic associated with the composer's 
music: unabashed lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a Baldwin piano that stubbornly refused to produce any songful sounds 
in its upper register, Cameron Grant compensated with discreet pedaling and 
subtle voicing. Cellist Jonathan Spitz displayed nothing but the richest tone 
in all registers, particularly burnished in the lower range. And if an 
occasional thinness of sound blemished the violin artistry of Erica 
Kiesewetter, her gift for persuasively blending with her colleagues proved the 
more lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
Only judiciously gauged tempos will allow this work to make a cohesive whole, 
and it was here the ensemble revealed a special quality. By turns dance-like in 
the first movement, relaxed in the second, tender in the third and 
full-throttle in the finale, the trio took full measure of the piece and 
consistently supplied sensitive touches to motivic details. 
</P>
<P>
But in Mendelssohn's Trio in C-minor, the group failed to convey such a 
consistently rarefied atmosphere. Certainly the composer's instructions 
regarding energico and con fuoco were never in short supply, and the Scherzo 
provided the mercurial element one expects; yet, in the end, the whole was not 
greater than the sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity audience received one encore: a vivacious romp through the 
"Pantoum" movement of Ravel's Trio in A minor.

Lech Walesa said today that he will run for the office of Polish president and 
a top aide said the Solidarity leader was ready to force President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the official news agency PAP to comment on a weekend statement by one 
of his senior collaborators that he wanted to replace Jaruzelski soon, Walesa 
said: "I confirm." 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but said: "We have a lot of wise and valuable people in 
the government and other positions but one has to speed up the pace of reforms 
and remove the old set-up." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Walesa's chief of staff, Krzysztof Pusz, said Walesa was ready to 
force Jaruzelski to resign and take over the presidency himself. 
</P>
<P>
Pusz, chief of Walesa's secretariat, told reporters that Walesa should become 
president soon because Jaruzelski was doing nothing to speed up reforms at home 
or win help for Poland from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going too slowly. We just need someone with a whip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pusz said Walesa should first win reelection as chairman of Solidarity when the 
union holds its first national congress since 1981 in Gdansk next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he has to be chairman for a month or two. Perhaps it won't be two months. 
It depends on the situation. There may be a possibility that Jaruzelski will 
resign himself," Pusz said. 
</P>
<P>
Pusz is Walesa's closest collaborator in day-to-day affairs and never speaks 
out to journalists without the Solidarity leader's authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expected Jaruzelski, a longtime communist, to make way for Walesa, 
Pusz replied: "Yes, either resignation or force him to resign. One of the two." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's advisers wanted him to take over quickly but were divided about 
whether he should wait until fully democratic parliamentary elections, expected 
before May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should run and as soon as possible and not wait for parliamentary 
elections," Pusz said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski was elected last July by Parliament to act as a stabilizing 
influence during Poland's trailblazing transition from communism to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
But the democratic revolution sweeping Eastern Europe has since speeded up and 
he is now one of the last senior members of the former Communist Establishment 
still in office in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Pusz was the second top Walesa collaborator in a few days to say the Solidarity 
leader should replace Jaruzelski quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, editor of the Solidarity weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc, 
said last weekend Walesa should take over to invigorate the Solidarity-led 
government and speed up Poland's transition to full democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Pusz's remarks followed reports from Solidarity sources that Jaruzelski was 
having second thoughts about resigning after expressing readiness in January to 
do so. "We need someone who would be able to get something for Poland. Walesa 
would travel, arrange things, and at home he would get things moving," Pusz 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A robber fired three shots inside an Orange convenience store this morning 
before escaping with $25, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Gustafson said the robber entered the Qwik Market in the 4000 block of 
Garden Grove Boulevard at about 1 a.m. and demanded money from a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
After the clerk handed over $25, the robber demanded beer, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
"The clerk pointed to cooler saying, 'It's over there,' " Gustafson said. "But 
the suspect fired two rounds from his (handgun) into the counter and directed 
the clerk to get the beer for him." 
</P>
<P>
As the clerk walked over to the cooler, the robber fired a third round and ran 
out of the store. 
</P>
<P>
The gunshot missed the clerk, who then called police. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said the man is 25 to 30 years old, 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 
about 190 pounds. He is clean-shaven, has short dark hair and was wearing a 
royal blue short-sleeve T-shirt and blue pants. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is continuing.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the Air Force to explain why it 
incorrectly told him that both 2,000-pound bombs dropped on Panama by F-117A 
Stealth fighters had hit their targets, the Pentagon said today. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney learned that one of the two bombs dropped in the Dec. 20 invasion fell 
"way off target" only after making inquiries to the Air Force based on a 
reporter's photographs of the bomb craters, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the secretary was initially told (by the Air Force) in a good-faith 
manner that both bombs had hit their targets," Williams said when asked at the 
Pentagon briefing whether the Air Force had deliberately lied to Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there was any -- as far as I can tell -- any intent to mislead 
the secretary," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the U.S. invasion, Cheney had defended the use of the 
high-technology F-117As Stealth fighters in the attack, saying the pinpoint 
bombing accuracy of the $106-million planes probably saved both American and 
Panamanian lives. 
</P>
<P>
Two F-117As were assigned to drop a 2,000-pound bomb each near the military 
barracks at Rio Hato to stun the Panamanian Defense Forces before a parachute 
drop by U.S. Army Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said one of the bombs was on target, hitting about 55 yards from the 
barracks, but the other was "way off target" and the miss, "as far as we can 
tell, is (due to) pilot error."

NASA SCRUBS LAUNCH OF DISCOVERY;

SHUTTLE FLIGHT: PROBLEM IN AUXILIARY POWER UNIT PUTS HUBBLE TELESCOPE FLIGHT ON 
HOLD FOR ONE OR TWO WEEKS.

<P>
NASA scrubbed the launch of Discovery with the $1.5-billion Hubble Space 
Telescope today when a problem developed four minutes before liftoff in a unit 
that supplies power to the shuttle's wing and tail surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The launch will be attempted again in one to two weeks, said launch director 
Bob Sieck. A more precise time will be determined on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sieck said a preliminary review indicates a valve on the auxiliary power unit 
did not respond properly, allowing too much fuel to go through the power 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers were working to determine the extent of the problem even before the 
five astronauts emerged from the cockpit where they had lain on their backs for 
more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
NASA said at an early afternoon briefing that the faulty APU will have to be 
removed from the launch vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The scrub was a disappointment to the hundreds of astronomers who had gathered 
at Kennedy Space Center to watch the launch of Discovery and the telescope that 
it carries in its cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 relatives of Edwin P. Hubble, the astronomer for whom the telescope 
is named, headed for a pool party following the scrub. 
</P>
<P>
"These things have happened. It's part of the game," said Harvey Hubble IV, a 
60-year-old retired businessman from North Palm Beach who organized the family 
gathering. "We would much rather you stop the count than do something foolish." 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble Space Telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built, 
has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983 -- delayed by technical 
problems and the 1986 Challenger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said NASA was disappointed at the latest delay "but the stars will be 
here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Two other shuttle launches have been delayed because of auxiliary power units. 
</P>
<P>
All the other worries, about weather at the launch site and at emergency 
landing sites overseas had been swept away and the countdown proceeded without 
a hitch to the four-minute mark pointing toward a launch at 8:47 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
But then Commander Loren J. Shriver noticed that one of the APUs was running 
erratically and reported the fact to launch control. 
</P>
<P>
The three APUs steer the ship's three engines, control the movements of flaps 
on the wings and the rudder, lower the main and nose landing gears and provide 
the hydraulics for the main landing gear brakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is 
expanding. His findings gave rise to the theory that the universe was created 
about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion known as the Big Bang. He 
died in 1953.

Rescuers said that the total number of people burned to death and drowned in 
the Scandinavian Star ferry fire disaster may never be known, and police 
expressed confidence today that they will find the arsonist believed to be 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The ferry, sailing from Oslo to Denmark, caught fire early Saturday south of 
the Oslo Fjord with about 500 passengers and crew aboard. Police in Oslo 
confirmed that 176 people had died but suggested that the toll may eventually 
top 200. 
</P>
<P>
In Copenhagen, officials were preparing for Wednesday's opening of a board of 
inquiry to explain Saturday's disaster, working on the "concrete theory that it 
was arson."

Reader's Digest Assn. Inc. said today it will launch a new monthly magazine in 
France this fall as part of the publishing company's strategy to expand 
operations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Budgets Famille (Family Budgets) will contain news, feature articles and tips 
on topics ranging from savings and borrowing strategies to the best ways 
families can budget for their children's education as well as leisure 
activities like vacation," said Reader's Digest, the publisher of the most 
widely read magazine in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Budgets Famille, to debut on French newsstands in October, will target the 30- 
to 45-year-old parents in upper- and middle-income families, the publisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Budgets Famille is Reader's Digest's first foreign start-up publication since 
the company announced last year a plan to expand its operations overseas 
through acquisitions and the launching of new special interest magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to disclose sales or advertisements projections for Budgets 
Famille at this stage," said spokesman Bruce Trachtenberg. "But we are 
confident the publication will meet the demand." 
</P>
<P>
Henri Capdeville, managing director for the publishing group's French division, 
noted that while there are a number of French business magazines focusing on 
personal finances, none cover specific family issues. The French edition of 
Reader's Digest, called Selection, has a monthly circulation of 1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Budgets Famille will provide an ideal target market for advertisers," 
Capdeville said.

United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber, denouncing another year of 
exorbitantly high pay for top auto executives, called today for fundamental 
changes between management and labor to put UAW workers on a more secure 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
In opening a three-day conference in Detroit for the union's skilled trades 
workers, Bieber said the nation's auto makers -- not the auto workers -- are 
responsible for improving product quality and bolstering the competitive 
position of U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"America's industrial challenge is not a little bit management's fault and a 
little bit the union's fault," Bieber told the about 1,200 union delegates at 
the Westin Hotel. "It's management's failures, plain and simple, that have put 
us in the precarious situation we face in so many sectors today. 
</P>
<P>
"The big buck syndrome in Detroit is a disease that's still in need of a cure," 
union leader said. "The auto industry has real and pressing problems, but the 
companies signal only arrogance and business-as-usual attitudes through these 
excessive payments to senior executives."

Boone Co., an investment company owned by U.S. takeover specialist T. Boone 
Pickens, asked Japan's Fair Trade Commission today to investigate possible 
violations of the anti-monopoly law by Japanese auto makers and parts 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
A commission official, Yoshiro Sekine, said the panel will study Boone's claims 
and decide what action to take. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens has been seeking greater participation in the management of Koito 
Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts maker, after becoming its largest 
single shareholder in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sekine said Boone claimed that Japan's 11 auto makers put unfair pressure on 
parts suppliers to lower the prices of their products. 
</P>
<P>
He said Boone also claimed that the auto makers' close relations with parts 
makers limit free competition among the parts suppliers and hinder entry by 
outside companies, especially foreign makers, into the Japanese market.

Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and their famous thumbs again are 
welcome at previews of 20th Century Fox films. 
</P>
<P>
The studio Monday dropped its indefinite ban that had prohibited the pair from 
attending the screenings. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed three weeks ago after the critics gave "thumbs down" to the 
film "Nuns on the Run." Siskel, a movie critic for the Chicago Tribune, and 
Ebert, a movie critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, said on the "Live -- Regis 
&amp; Kathie Lee" television show they hadn't found a single laugh in the 
movie. The two also have their own television movie review program. 
</P>
<P>
Another Fox movie, "Vital Signs," was shown Monday in Chicago to a preview 
audience, the first Fox screening since "Nuns." Ebert was out of town on 
another assignment, but Siskel called Fox's Chicago office to ask if he could 
attend. A company spokesman said the ban was lifted, and Siskel attended the 
preview.

Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, accepted libel damages at 
a London court today from the publishers of a North American movie magazine 
that suggested he was to be replaced in the role. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe magazine that the 
actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from financial disaster 
were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's 
performances as Bond in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill" and with 
the financial return from them. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of damages paid by publishers Globe International was not disclosed. 
Their lawyer, Timothy Atkinson, told the court they welcomed the opportunity of 
setting the record straight.

FAME MUTATES FOR HUMAN 'TURTLE' STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elias Koteas is fortunate to be one of the few recognizable characters in 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," except that anyone who sees him is likely to be 
under 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The shy, quiet, introspective actor was an unknown until this month. Now he is 
very well known indeed, thanks to his starring role in the biggest hit of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Koteas' involvement with the phenomenally successful action-comedy is a mixed 
blessing. He may become familiar to every kid in the world -- and a major hero 
to his little sister -- but remain a nonentity to everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Koteas, whose quick brown eyes, shaggy black hair and funky 
clothes give him the look of a young rebel himself, is pleased to be part of 
the resounding smash. 
</P>
<P>
His is one of the few recognizable characters in the film. The other principals 
-- excepting co-star Judith Hoag -- are giant, sewer-dwelling turtles. 
</P>
<P>
For those too enraptured with the turtles to remember anything about the 
picture except the hard-shelled crime fighters, Koteas is the guy who plays 
Casey Jones, the vigilante and martial arts expert who first challenges turtle 
Raphael and then joins the Ninjas to help stop the Foot Clan. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel, Koteas looked as much 
at home as a Ninja Turtle in the Court of St. James. 
</P>
<P>
When first approached to star in the film, he had never heard of the Ninja 
Turtle comic books or the kiddie TV cartoon series on which the picture is 
based. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't even remember the title for a long time," he admitted with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
What Koteas and many another adults may not know is that "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" is the No. 1-selling comic book in the country and the No. 
1-syndicated children's cartoon show on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Koteas is a man who finds himself beset by a publicity hurricane, a whirlwind 
of madness he was not prepared for and over which he has no control. 
</P>
<P>
He is, after all, a dedicated, serious young dramatic actor. A graduate of the 
American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he has appeared on stage in "The Cherry 
Orchard," "Bent," "Death of a Salesman" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
His movie credits include "Full Moon in Blue Water," "Tucker," "Gardens of 
Stone," "One Magic Christmas" and "Some Kind of Wonderful." His performance in 
"Malerek" won him a nomination for Canada's coveted Genie Award. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Montreal, Koteas starved in New York for years, delivering pizza, 
driving a cab, busing tables and working at other menial jobs to scrape a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
He met the challenge of playing Casey Jones head on, taking the part as 
seriously as he would any other role. 
</P>
<P>
"I accepted the part the minute they offered it to me," he said. "I wanted the 
chance to be 10 or 12 years old again. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my younger sister about the job and she went crazy. All kids know about 
the Ninja Turtles. They love 'em. And now they love Casey too. They may make a 
sequel or two from this picture because it's so popular. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a serious actor, but I wouldn't mind playing Casey again. When Harrison 
Ford played Han Solo in the 'Star Wars' pictures it didn't hurt his career. He 
went on to make some fine dramatic pictures. He wasn't type-cast."

ACTOR VARNEY COMFORTABLE AS ERNEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Varney walked into the room at the Jefferson Hotel here looking a little 
more worldly than he does as Ernest, the character he has portrayed in hundreds 
of commercials and in three movies. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably the hair. As Ernest, Varney's hair is secondary to his 
features. As Ernest, he usually wears a hat, one that hides his hair, and when 
the hair is showing, it is slick with mousse. In person, Varney's hair is dry, 
full and just a little bit wind-blown. In person, he is a funny man. Asked what 
he would like to have for lunch, he said he wouldn't be eating, that he had 
already done that. 
</P>
<P>
And what did you have to eat? 
</P>
<P>
"Red meat," said Varney, sounding like Ernest, "It's the Amurrican way." 
</P>
<P>
He's been playing Ernest for a number of years now. Some people think of Varney 
and Ernest as the same person. He doesn't bother to fight that. 
</P>
<P>
"Do something else? Stretch? We're having a whole lot of fun," he said. "I 
guess I don't want to do Ernest as a steady diet, but then I wouldn't want to 
play villains all the time, either." 
</P>
<P>
He says he hasn't tired of playing Ernest. "We have a few more ideas for 
films," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have Ernest stay away from alcohol, tobacco and fire arms, anything 
that is adult and dangerous," Varney said. "Basically, our audience is very 
young." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that Ernest has changed since he was invented. "He had a harder edge 
in the beginning," Varney said. "He was more realistic. He's become more silly 
as he's moved along." 
</P>
<P>
As happens to many movie and television characters, Ernest was part of the 
Saturday morning line-up for a time. Varney, as Ernest and other characters, 
was live. "We took a look at the Saturday shows, and it was wall-to-wall 
cartoon, and in every one, the kids were wondering how they would blow up the 
robots," Varney said. "That's all it was, kids blowing up robots. We wanted 
something else. We wanted something adults could watch, too." 
</P>
<P>
Is Varney in danger of becoming one with Ernest? Will their personalities blur? 
Will one begin to take over the life of the other? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Varney said. "He's really an 8-year old kid. We talk of him as a 
separate person." 
</P>
<P>
He did his very first Ernest commercial for scale. "That was local scale," he 
said. "I got $300." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he lives on a 10-acre farm. "I have a dog and a cat and a wife named 
Jane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does Ernest have any political views? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Varney said. "He's Amurrican." 
</P>
<P>
Varney knows that Ernest gets laughs because he isn't very bright. He doesn't 
know if people transfer this to the actor. "I don't know," he said, "but some 
people do ask me to look at their power tools. I don't know what they expect, 
something dumb, but I don't know what it is. It doesn't bother me."

LIZ SMITH: OF HURT'S BABY, 'BATMAN II' AND ELEPHANT SAVIOR

THE TRAUMA of William Hurt's "palimony" trial last year and the possibility of 
a second go-round in court hasn't hurt the actor's marriage to Heidi Henderson. 
Bill and Heidi, who live in the East, are expecting their second child. This 
time they hope for a girl to go with their Sam, age 7 months. But neither 
parent believes in finding out a baby's sex in advance, so they just have to 
wait and see what happens in August. And so do we. 
</P>
<P>
AS IF THERE isn't enough turbulence in Great Britain these days, now the movie 
industry of Blighty is up in arms over news that the "Batman" sequel will be 
shot in Mexico instead of in England. The fantastic, $5-million "Gotham City" 
set has been kept intact at Pinewood Studios for more than a year, at a cost of 
$100,000-a-month storage. And that, of course, is in anticipation of Michael 
Keaton's "doing it again." But perhaps Warner Bros. doesn't feel obligated to 
honor commitments made by their ex-Batmoguls, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who 
now do their stuff for Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
MARLENE SANDERS was the first woman to cover the Vietnam War close up, so she 
is no stranger to the vicissitudes of foreign travel. And it's a good thing, 
too, because her recent trip to Nepal, for the Discovery Channel's "Profiles in 
Progress" series, had Marlene traveling both by Land Rover and by elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The elephants were just wonderful, Marlene says, but the Rover got stuck in the 
middle of a raging river, and the plucky correspondent had to be rescued by 
canoe. The Land Rover was then brought out by elephant. 
</P>
<P>
ON MONDAY Sotheby's in New York will be the site for the Manhattan Center for 
Living's gala benefit "Fantasy Auction." (The MCL helps people with 
life-threatening diseases.) Mike Nichols and Steve Sondheim of the Broadway 
theater are co-chairing this event, which offers about 40 fantasies donated by 
stars of entertainment, music, fashion and sport. 
</P>
<P>
You'll be able to bid for tickets to see the great Maggie Smith in "Lettuce and 
Lovage," then meet and sip Champagne with her backstage, and go on to dine with 
"L&amp;L" playwright Peter Shaffer at Orso's. (I have dined myself with this 
writing giant who created "Amadeus," and whoever wins him will be in for a 
treat.) 
</P>
<P>
The sports-minded might land the right to go with Susan Sarandon, her "Bull 
Durham" cutie, Tim Robbins, and TV sports commentator Tim McCarver to lunch at 
the Regency, take in a New York Mets game, and meet the team. (We are not 
talking cheesy little fantasies here!) 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's expects bidding to go through the roof for one particular fantasy 
Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn. The highest bidder, plus a guest, 
will enjoy a private fast-breaking with the star in the executive offices of 
the jewelry emporium. So two lucky people get to discover whether food ever 
passes those elegant Hepburn lips.

The black comedy "I Love You to Death" about Frances Toto's efforts to kill her 
husband, Tony, is no laughing matter for a hit man portrayed in the film by 
River Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Toto spent four years in prison for the attempts on her husband's life. 
</P>
<P>
The Totos then reunited and sold the rights to their story to a production 
company for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Ullman and Kevin Kline star as the Totos. Phoenix plays a character 
based on the hit man, Anthony Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have with it is I have to live every day of my life knowing I 
tried to hurt someone. To me, that is no joke," Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno, 28, was released on parole Jan. 1 after serving 5 1/2 years in prison 
for trying to murder Toto, a former pizza shop owner from Allentown. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is angry that the Totos seem to be capitalizing on the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Frances is going on talk shows now. She sits there and laughs. This has ruined 
my life," said Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely a different person," Bruno said. "I've matured a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"After spending 5 1/2 years in prison, you realize things aren't a joke," he 
said.

Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson says drug and sexual-assault charges filed 
against him are part of a "witch hunt" because of his anti-Establishment views. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 52, was charged Monday with five felony drug charges and three 
misdemeanor counts, including sexual assault, stemming from a Feb. 21 incident 
at his Woody Creek home. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson pleaded not guilty to the three misdemeanors. No pleas were entered on 
the felony charges, but a court date of April 23 was set for a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, a former pornographic movie actress and producer, 
claimed Thompson took drugs in her presence and touched her breast while 
roughing her up. She told authorities she had gone to his home to discuss a 
business enterprise and he became angry when she refused to conduct the session 
in the hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson claimed the woman was drunk and was pressuring him to have sex when he 
pushed her. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer-Slater's allegations led to an 11-hour search of Thompson's home, in 
which authorities seized drugs and explosives.

Britain's Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, has angrily denied 
that he is homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not gay," the 26-year-old prince told the mass-circulation Daily Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the prince spoke to one of its reporters in New York at a 
party Sunday after the Broadway premiere of British composer Andrew 
Lloyd-Webber's musical "Aspects of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Prince Edward has worked as a production assistant in Lloyd-Webber's theater 
company since dropping out of the marines. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirror said the prince was angered by rumors about his friendship with 
British actor Michael Ball, 27, who stars in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just outrageous to suggest this sort of thing," the prince was quoted as 
saying. "It's so unfair to me and my family. How would you feel if someone said 
you were gay?" 
</P>
<P>
By speaking out on such a sensitive issue the prince has broken a tradition of 
silence surrounding the private lives of the Royal Family.

GRAF SHOWS NO EFFECTS OF LAYOFF

Steffi Graf ended a 2-month layoff today with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Petra 
Langrova in the second round of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked women's player showed no signs of rustiness in returning 
from a broken right thumb that had sidelined her since early February. 
</P>
<P>
She needed only 45 minutes to defeat Langrova, ranked No. 65, and extend her 
winning streak to 53 consecutive matches, including a 12-0 record this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right from the beginning I felt pretty good," said Graf, who was injured Feb. 
6 in a fall on skis. "I thought it was the perfect first match for me." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the match for Langrova was breaking Graf's serve in the third 
game of the first set. She struggled with her own serve, however, and 
attributed that to the strength of Graf's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I had any chance," said Langrova, who defeated Penny Barg Mager 
6-0, 6-0 in the first round. "She played with great confidence and I made a lot 
of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, injured when she fell on her hand while filming a movie in Switzerland, 
originally planned to launch her comeback in a tournament in Hamburg, West 
Germany, later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The injury healed faster than expected, though, and she decided to put her 
winning streak on the line here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," said Graf, who has won eight of the last nine Grand Slam titles 
and compiled a 158-5 record the last two seasons. "I didn't think I had any 
chance to play a tournament before Hamburg." 
</P>
<P>
The Amelia Island field includes three other top-10 players. Gabriela Sabatini, 
who beat Graf in the finals a year ago and in the semifinals in 1988, is the 
No. 2 seed. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario is seeded third and Zina Garrison is No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Langrova said she took one look at the draw and all but conceded that she 
didn't have much of a chance to survive past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I'll try to win the first (round) match and then," Langrova said, 
hesitating before shrugging her shoulders, "what can you do? . . . She's No. 1 
in the world, and I have nothing to lose. All I can do is play my game." 
</P>
<P>
Like Graf, the tournament's other high seeds drew first-round byes and were 
scheduled to play today.

uniforms as agents continued to investigate the theft of memorabilia from James 
(Cool Papa) Bell, one of the all-time greats of the former Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stolen items -- which include photographs, baseball equipment and 
uniforms -- were recovered when Robert D. Retort, 38, and Ed Grybowski, 65, 
were arrested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three uniforms still were missing today, according to FBI spokesman Jeff 
Kimball. The uniforms were from the St. Louis Stars, Kansas City Monarchs and 
Memphis Red Socks.

Tony Pena had three hits and two RBIs, and Wade Boggs was walked intentionally 
a record-tying three times today as the Boston Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers 
for the 10th straight time, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs' three intentional walks tied a major league record for a nine-inning 
game, shared by many. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Maris and Garry Templeton share the record of four in extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit manager Sparky Anderson's strategy worked as the Red Sox were unable to 
capitalize on the intentional walks. The Red Sox left the bases loaded in the 
second and third innings and left two runners on in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
That left Pena to do the damage. Pena lined a single in the first, drove in two 
runs with a bases-loaded single in a four-run third and ripped a double in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker, beaten by Detroit last June 14 before Boston began its winning 
streak, allowed two runs and five hits in five innings, then got the victory 
with relief help from Dennis Lamp, Rob Murphy and Lee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit starter Kevin Ritz lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving way to Dan Petry 
after allowing seven hits and four runs. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third, Ellis Burks and Dwight Evans singled, and Billy Jo 
Robidoux walked, filling the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, signed as a free agent during the off-season, poked a single to right, 
scoring Burks and Evans, and Jody Reed followed with a double to left, scoring 
Robidoux. Petry replaced Ritz, and Pena scored as Kevin Romine grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker blanked Detroit on three hits for four innings. Then he gave up two 
runs in the fifth.

After overnight occult rituals in the "very magic moment of the Aries 
plenilune, (full moon)" Italian clairvoyants today predicted that the World Cup 
final will pit Italy against defending champion Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made by wizards, astrologers and clairvoyants who are 
members of the Italian Wizards Assn. Some said they see an Italian victory. The 
clairvoyants also predicted that Cameroon and United Arab Emirates, both 
considered underdogs by experts, will do unexpectedly well. 
</P>
<P>
A dissident group, the "Wizards of the Hut," made different predictions. Its 
members see Brazil as the World Cup winner and Romania coming up with very 
interesting surprises.

OHIO FARMER'S 'FIELD OF DREAMS' 
</P>

<P>
Unlike the character played by Kevin Costner in "Field of Dreams," the voice 
that summoned Curtis Drummond didn't come from a cornfield but from his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"There's baseball in every little boy," said Drummond. "I never got to find out 
if I could hit the fastball or make the diving catch. My dad and the farm had 
other plans for me." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond grew up on the family farm half an hour south of Columbus. His father 
looked with disdain on sports. From the moment they awakened until the sun went 
down, the lives of Curtis and his five older brothers revolved around the farm. 
Only when he listened to the Cincinnati Reds games at night was he able to 
continue his flirtation with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I never got to play Mosquito League or Little League or high school baseball 
because there was always work to do on the farm," said Drummond. "Hearing all 
my little chums or buddies talking about the big game -- never being a part of 
that -- it hurt. It hurt a lot." 
</P>
<P>
When Curtis' father retired in 1970, Curtis took over the grain farm. The 
summers were filled with planting, cultivating and harvesting the 1,400 acres 
owned and rented by the family. In the winters, no longer tethered to the 
day-to-day routine of the farm, Curtis would finish his work and drive a few 
miles to a nearby small town to play pickup basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, at age 35, Curtis Drummond realized that he could do something 
about the years he had lost shagging flies and taking batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
He built his own field. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to put a field right here on the farm so when I did get time to play 
ball I could," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First he picked a location, out near a shelter house his father had built. 
Other brothers had brought their dreams to reality nearby. One brother was an 
outdoorsman, so he built a lake and stocked it with fish, right next to a 
30-acre woods. He had his own hunting and fishing area. 
</P>
<P>
Another tinkered with miniature steam-driven trains. He built a mile-long 
railway around the farm, complete with a steam-driven locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis carefully graded the land and crowned it to lessen the effects of summer 
thunderstorms. "We could get a two-inch rainfall and we could play on it in a 
couple hours," he boasted. 
</P>
<P>
The field was laid out to regulation softball dimensions with a dirt infield 
and grass outfield. One friend donated a home plate. Another gave an extra set 
of bases not needed by a local Little League team. Yet another provided an 
orange barricade fence for use as a home-run fence. 
</P>
<P>
The final touch was a large metal scoreboard with slide-in numbers, a piece of 
Fenway Park in rural Pickaway County. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent a lot of time and effort establishing a really good field," Curtis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Players were not a problem: If you build it, they will come. Curtis invited 
friends and relatives, neighbors and acquaintances over for a few innings of 
slow-pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Around 20 people -- auto salesmen, city utility workers and farmers -- meet at 
the field at 6 p.m. a couple of nights a week. They usually can play a couple 
of games before darkness falls. Afterward, they "drink a couple beers, sit 
around and just blow off steam," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
The games proved to be good preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis got married last September and for a wedding gift, his new wife Alice 
made arrangements for him to participate in the Reds' fantasy camp. Maybe it 
was 20 years later than he might have preferred, but Curtis still got to meet 
and play baseball with such former Reds as Tommy Helms, Jim O'Toole and Joe 
Nuxhall.

ARTS EXECUTIVE HIRED FOR IRVINE CULTURAL AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Henry Korn, Santa Monica's arts administrator for the past five years, will 
come to Irvine on May 7 to take charge of the city's newly formed Cultural 
Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
In his new job, Korn will oversee the Irvine Fine Arts Center and the city's 
public arts program and will work with the city's Cultural Affairs Commission 
(formed in January) to create a cultural plan for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Korn, 44, announced his resignation from the Santa Monica job in March, telling 
reporters that he was taking a "similar post" in Irvine. But the Irvine offer 
was not formalized until last week, Korn and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving a thriving arts scene for Irvine -- a young city with fledgling 
cultural aspirations -- is a challenge that Korn said he found attractive. 
"That's what's exciting to me," he said by phone Monday. "It was obvious to me 
that Irvine was serious about establishing a cultural-arts community." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine formed its Cultural Affairs Division on the recommendation of a report 
published last May by the Cambridge, Mass.-based Wolf Organization. Korn was 
chosen to manage the division from among nearly 80 applicants in a national 
search. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Korn oversaw the creation of a foundation to raise private 
arts funds and headed an active public arts program. Both areas will figure 
into his Irvine responsibilities, according to Patricia Fierro, the city's 
Community Services manager. 
</P>
<P>
Public art eventually will play a vital role in master-planned Irvine, Korn 
said. "Public art will have a real function, to create a sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
Before his Santa Monica job, Korn served as executive director of the Lower 
Manhattan Cultural Center, chief administrator of the Jewish Museum of Art in 
New York, public affairs officer for the Staten Island Institute and curator of 
the Brooklyn Museum. He has been a columnist for magazines and newspapers and 
has written six books. 
</P>
<P>
Korn said he will continue to live in Los Angeles.

PLAYWRIGHT SLIPS IN A WINNER AFTER MYRIAD REJECTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH COAST REPERTORY IS ABOUT TO STAGE 'ONCE IN ARDEN,' THE FIRST MAJOR 
PRODUCTION FOR AN ORANGE COUNTY PLAYWRIGHT WHO NEVER QUIT WORKING.

Given a choice between acting and writing, Richard Hellesen decided it was no 
contest. "Writing, at least, I could do at home," he says. "And the rejections 
come by mail." 
</P>
<P>
As proof of his wisdom, the 33-year-old playwright not only has a collection of 
75 rejection slips dating back 14 years "on letterheads from some of the best 
theaters in the country" but one of those theaters, South Coast Repertory, is 
about to stage his first major production. 
</P>
<P>
Hellesen's "Once in Arden" -- a historical drama about a renowned 19th-Century 
actress facing a classic conflict between her artistic ideals and her material 
needs -- begins previews Friday on the SCR Mainstage in Costa Mesa. It opens 
April 20, with Martin Benson directing, and represents a first for the 
26-year-old theater as well: an original work by an Orange County writer with 
an Orange County subject. 
</P>
<P>
Nan Martin plays Helena Modjeska, a touring star of the American stage who made 
her home in the county more than a century ago after an illustrious 
Shakespearean career in her native Poland. Kay Kuter plays her husband. Patrick 
Husted portrays Modjeska's friend and former protege, the pianist-composer 
Ignace Jan Paderewski, who arrives at her farm in 1904 to urge her to come out 
of retirement. Charles Hallahan is featured as the celebrated actor James 
O'Neill, who played Macbeth to her Lady Macbeth in New York. And Ron Boussom 
portrays a vaudeville agent. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing all those rejections taught me is that whether you make it or you 
don't, you just have to keep working," said Hellesen, who has written seven 
other full-length plays and a dozen one-acts. "You can't take the rejections 
personally. I guess I got so many, they stopped hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a cubbyhole office at Cal State Fullerton, where he teaches an 
introductory course in theater appreciation, Hellesen maintained in an 
interview last week that being an agentless playwright with a drawerful of 
manuscripts is like being a cottage-industry distributor seeking a market. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the creative side, which is writing," he said. "Then there's the 
business side, which is licking the envelopes and sending them out. The 
customers either want to buy your product or they don't. If they don't, it's 
not because they hate you and your children." 
</P>
<P>
Such a well-adjusted attitude results, in no small measure, from the fact that 
Hellesen spent two years in the mid-'80s reading scripts part time for Berkeley 
Repertory Theatre, and a third year from 1986 to 1987 as its full-time literary 
manager. He recounted, ironically, that he often wrote the sort of polite 
rejection letters that he found waiting for him at home from other literary 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
Hellesen also is a realist with a sense of humor and no illusions about the 
meaning of success in the American theater. "About 2% of the population goes to 
plays," he noted. "So what I do is irrelevant to the other 98%. More kids went 
to see 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' last weekend than will ever see anything 
I write for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Hellesen never sounds more serious than when talking about "Once 
in Arden." He recalled, for instance, that SCR's response to his play made him 
"sweat bullets." It arrived on a pin post card -- no letterhead this time -- 
and was addressed to one Tom McKillop, the pseudonym Hellesen had used. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Mr. McKillop," SCR dramaturge Jerry Patch wrote, "Your play is a finalist 
in the California Play Competition. Please contact me by telephone as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Why the pseudonym? Because by then, in the fall of 1989, Hellesen was working 
as a part-time script reader at SCR to supplement his income from Cal State 
Fullerton. He wanted an impartial verdict, and he was in a ticklish position. 
His main task, after all, was to read 360 of the nearly 600 plays that had been 
submitted to SCR's first annual contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, they never gave me my own to read," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Patch nor SCR literary manager John Glore, nor anyone else at SCR, had 
the slightest inkling that Hellesen had written "Once in Arden" -- then titled 
"Pani Helleni" -- until he showed up with the post card. But once his identity 
was revealed, he withdrew from the competition to avoid any appearance of 
unfairness. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hellesen gave up the chance to win prize money of as much as $5,000 -- 
the top award last year went to Marlane Meyer's "The Geography of Luck" -- he 
feels he got "a better deal" with a full-blown production. By comparison, 
"Geography" received a smaller staging at SCR last spring (before going on to 
second version at the Los Angeles Theatre Center), and this year's competition 
winner -- Mark Lee's "Pirates" -- will receive a staged reading at SCR in May. 
</P>
<P>
While "Once in Arden" is Hellesen's first major production, he has had previous 
plays staged professionally. The Sacramento Theatre Company has produced his 
adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" for the past three years. 
And last year StageWest in Ft. Worth, Tex., mounted a small production of his 
original play "Moonshadow," which takes place on the day of the first U.S. moon 
landing in 1969. This season, too, SCR toured his children's play, "Gift Rap," 
to county schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is "Once in Arden" Hellesen's first historical drama. He has written two 
others, both unproduced: "Lower Than the Angels" (about 11th-Century religion 
in Constantinople) and "Gold's Fool" (about James Marshall, who discovered gold 
in California). But if the genre clearly appeals to Hellesen, the term 
"historical drama" does not. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to emphasize the word 'historical,' " he explained. "I'd rather 
emphasize the word 'drama.' My concern is whether the play works. With 'Once in 
Arden' I'm not trying to present the audience with a biographical lesson. I 
don't want people to leave the theater saying, 'Gee, it was boring, but I 
learned a lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he sees no great virtue in being called an Orange County playwright. 
Hellesen guessed that SCR's interest might be whetted by a drama with local 
significance. (Modjeska has a canyon and a mountain named for her within 20 
miles of the theater. And her farmhouse has been restored as a minor tourist 
attraction.) Yet, he contends, it would be parochial to consider him or his 
play in strictly local terms. 
</P>
<P>
"My sensibilities were developed here," said Hellesen, who was born in Lynwood 
and grew up in Orange. "You can't divorce yourself from that. But this play 
transcends the confines of the particular. It's about theater and artists 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added with a sly smile, "half of it is set in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Previews of "Once in Arden" begin Friday at 8 p.m. on the South Coast 
Repertory Mainstage, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $15-$22. After 
the opening on April 20, tickets: $17-$28. (714) 957-4033.

LEGACY: THROUGH HIS EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, AN ORDINARY YOUNG BOY INSPIRED 
THOUSANDS OF AIDS SUFFERERS AND TAUGHT A NATION SOME LESSONS IN COMPASSION.

<P>
He was an improbable American hero, a slight, physically fragile youngster from 
a place called Kokomo. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan White was only 12 in 1984 when he was told that he had AIDS, contracted 
through blood clotting treatment to combat his hemophilia. It was a death 
sentence, but the grade schooler chose not to see it that way. To him, what 
counted was what he did with what he was given. 
</P>
<P>
People were always asking him if he was afraid of dying and, with a wisdom 
beyond his years, he would answer, "I'm not afraid. Someday you'll die, too. 
I'm just not ready yet." 
</P>
<P>
He never was ready. At the end, Ryan White, 18, clung to life, hooked up for 
seven days to a life support system and in a coma induced by painkillers and 
the sedatives that allowed his body to tolerate the intrusive equipment. If 
there was any chance, he wanted to live, said his physician, Dr. Martin B. 
Kleiman. "He loved life." 
</P>
<P>
There had been earlier medical crises for Ryan but, all in all, he had had five 
good years. With AIDS, Kleiman said, as he announced Ryan's death, "some will 
do better than others, but you're not going to beat it unless you don't catch 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the short time he had, Ryan White taught the nation a few other 
things about AIDS: that anybody can get it and that those who do deserve to be 
treated with love and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a young hero of the '80s, he really was," said Barbara Cleaver of 
Torrance, president and co-founder of Mothers of AIDS Patients -- Los Angeles. 
"I wish all PWAs (Persons With AIDS) would just come out and stand up, and 
their families for them, and with them. I wish all parents could stand with 
their heads high and not be ashamed. There's nothing to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
Cleaver, who lost a gay son to AIDS in 1984, added, "Perhaps this will make 
parents realize they should be there for their kids." Maybe, she said, "there 
will be some family healing" and that will be part of Ryan White's legacy. 
</P>

Ryan and his mother, Jeanne White, who'd been divorced from Ryan's father, 
Wayne, since the boy was 4, were among the first in the nation to stand up. In 
1985, they went public with their tragedy, taking on their local school system 
in a discrimination suit after Ryan was barred from attending classes at 
Western Middle School near Kokomo. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan's fortitude and perseverance and never-say-die attitude caused all of us 
to be educated," said Charles Vaughn Jr. of Lafayette, Ind., whose law firm 
brought the suit that led to Ryan's being readmitted to school. "We found out, 
'My gosh, this could happen to anybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Kokomo at that time, Vaughn said, "They didn't want to hear about how AIDS 
was transmitted. The fears and anxieties of the public were at an all-time 
high." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn remembers, "He said, 'I'm Ryan White. I want to go to school.' We said, 
'Ryan, it's not going to be easy.' He said, 'That's fine. Once people 
understand I'm no threat, it will be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He saw so much in his short life, and he dealt with it so well," Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hess, an associate professor of social work at Indiana University who is 
investigating the needs of AIDS patients and their families in the state -- and 
the extent of discrimination against them -- spoke of Ryan White's "magnificent 
struggle." While standing up for their rights when they were "quite alone," he 
said, Ryan and his family made the people of Indiana "re-examine their 
attitudes" about the disease. "They provided for us in this state a kind of 
rallying point." But, added Hess, who is affiliated with the Damien Center, an 
Indiana organization assisting persons with AIDS, "discrimination of the kind 
Ryan had is still happening in cities all over the state. You're still getting 
people in our cities who can't find dentists, can't find physicians outside of 
Indianapolis." 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 Indiana residents who now have tested 
HIV-positive, Hess said, "you're seeing the tip of the iceberg" in the state, 
even though the Indiana Board of Health has recorded only 768 AIDS cases since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
In attitudes toward AIDS, he added, there's still a tendency to separate the 
"innocent" from the "guilty," the former being the Ryan Whites, the latter 
those who contracted the disease through their gay or bisexual lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hess said, "one of Ryan's major contributions was the idea that 
you can remain a vibrant, living, healthy person for a long period of time. 
That fight and that spirit have created a very important model." Hess pointed 
out that AIDS patients now are living up to 15 years after being infected and 
that the onset of symptoms can be delayed for years if HIV-positive people get 
medical care early. It is the Ryan Whites, he said, who encourage people to 
come forward. 
</P>
<P>
As he fought for his life in the intensive care unit of Riley Hospital for 
Children at Indiana University Medical Center, the hospital switchboard fielded 
thousands of calls daily for, or about, Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Those who called, or came to see him, included Vice President Dan Quayle, Paul 
McCartney (who couldn't get through), Willie Nelson, Elton John, Michael 
Jackson, Tom Selleck, Phil Donahue, Joe Montana, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and 
Greg Louganis, who once gave Ryan one of his diving medals. 
</P>
<P>
There were calls from Mothers of AIDS Patients, from communities that were 
holding prayer vigils, from a woman who wanted to send Ryan an anointed 
handkerchief. The Boston Bruins were sending hockey sticks and shirts. Others 
wanted to give Ryan skateboards, blood, money. People dropped by the hospital 
media relations office with $5 or $10 bills "for Ryan." 
</P>
<P>
The money will go to the Ryan White Fund to defray costs of medical care for 
children with AIDS. The fund address is P.O. Box 40, Noblesville, Ind. 46060. 
At Ameritrust National Bank in Noblesville, where the trust fund is set up, 
employees had been wearing red ribbons to show they were pulling for Ryan 
White. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan, in terms of his impact on AIDS patients, has been phenomenal," said 
Riley Hospital administrator James Shmerling. Ryan had been a patient at Riley, 
off and on, for five years, and, Shmerling said, "the kids knew him very well." 
Shmerling and the hospital staff worked hard to avoid a media "circus" at 
Riley, where the sickest of the sick children are cared for. Extra security had 
been put on (several unauthorized visitors had tried to sneak into the ICU). 
And he was cognizant of the feelings of other parents who also had desperately 
ill children. 
</P>
<P>
No one was discussing the costs of Ryan White's 10-day, round-the-clock care in 
the ICU. He had insurance and, Shmerling said, "whatever is not paid for, we 
certainly will absorb." Jeanne White has been on leave of absence from her job 
at General Motors in Kokomo since December. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital lobby, a fanciful atrium with glass and chrome bubble elevators 
and oversized stuffed animals perched in unlikely places, Emily Blauvette, 8, 
tossed pennies into the pool, each with a get well wish for Ryan. Emily had 
come to the hospital with her mother, Chris, to see the White family. Chris 
Blauvette, who still lives in Kokomo, grew up with Jeanne White. She's upset 
that Kokomo has taken a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Western School, like the rest of the country, was uneducated about what AIDS 
meant," she said. "They acted out of concern. But if Kokomo had to get a black 
eye to give this national attention, maybe that's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
Mothers pulling their children through hospital corridors in the little red 
wagons that are Riley's answer to wheelchairs exchanged the latest rumors about 
Ryan and which celebrities were alleged to have visited on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
In the tiny chapel, an unsigned letter written on school paper with a red 
ballpoint pen asked, "Dear Lord, help Ryan get better. He has suffered enough 
pain. Please send a miracle. He really needs one. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, in a small dark room decorated with balloons and stuffed animals 
where Ryan lay hooked up to machines, Elton John busied himself putting up 
get-well cards and changing tapes so that Ryan would have music continually -- 
music by John, Janet Jackson, George Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after one of his daily briefings to the media, Kleiman, who is 
director of the hospital's infectious disease section, described Ryan as "an 
unassuming young man" who "communicated with Presidents as well as he 
communicated with his colleagues at school." 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, he said, "He was well aware of the consequences of his illness 
but he did not dwell on them. He knew what it was and fully accepted that he 
had it. And he chose to live healthy and well and enjoy himself." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's legacy, he said after his death, "was to bring attention to the fact 
that this is an infection, it's not a lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Kleiman, a man who wears a photo button of his own two children on the lapel of 
his white lab coat, called Ryan's death "a deeply felt personal loss." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Weisser, spokesman for AIDS Project Los Angeles, pointed out that there is 
considerable discrimination in the Los Angeles workplace against persons with 
AIDS and said Ryan's story may "let people know that, in many cases, it is OK 
to talk to their co-workers about their diagnosis," to know also that "they can 
continue to work and they can make very valuable contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan "took the risk," Weisser said. 
</P>
<P>
He does not believe that Ryan's impact was diminished by his being a so-called 
"innocent victim. Every person with AIDS is innocent," he said. "There's not 
one person who has intentionally gone out to get infected." Ryan understood 
this, Weisser said. "He stressed the humanity of the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Glaser, who founded the Los Angeles-based Pediatric AIDS Foundation 
to raise money for research and education, said in a statement that Ryan White 
has been an "inspiration" to the foundation through his courage in bringing 
national attention to the isolation facing every family with a child infected 
with the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser started the foundation after she and her husband, actor Paul Michael 
Glaser, lost their daughter to AIDS as a result of a blood transfusion 
Elizabeth required after childbirth. She herself is HIV-positive, as is the 
couple's son. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Glaser said, "Ryan White has shown the world that children infected 
with HIV can carry on normal lives, attend school, skateboard and play with 
their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"His battle reminds us of the value of each and every day. It points out how 
important it is that our federal government commit the necessary money today 
because tomorrow is too late." 
</P>
<P>
According to AIDS Project Los Angeles, there have been 8,891 cases of AIDS, 
including deaths, recorded in Los Angeles County since June of 1981. In 
California, that number is 25,035. Nationally, the figure is 121,645. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, 48 of the AIDS cases have been hemophiliacs, four of 
these children. Another 210 persons contracted the disease through blood 
transfusions, 34 of these children. 
</P>
<P>
There are 500 hemophiliacs born each year in the United States and, according 
to Alan Brownstein, executive director of the National Hemophilia Foundation in 
New York, about 52% of the nation's 20,000 hemophiliacs are now HIV-positive, 
infected with tainted blood products before 1985 when better cleansing methods 
made the blood clotting protein they need HIV-free. About 1,300 of these 
hemophiliacs have, like Ryan White, been diagnosed with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Through Ryan White's courage in speaking out, Brownstein said, the public now 
understands "there is no scientific basis for discrimination. Ryan was really 
an inspiration to the entire hemophiliac community, the entire AIDS community." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Ryan was once asked by a reporter what he'd say to scientists 
seeking a cure for AIDS and he replied, "I'd tell them to hurry up." 
</P>
<P>
Brownstein asked, "How could it be said better than that?" 
</P>
<P>
Christopher MacNeil of Ft. Wayne, Ind., who was a reporter for the Kokomo 
Tribune, first told the story of Ryan White in April 1985 and later covered the 
legal case. "I had a lot of problems (for befriending Ryan)," he recalled. "I 
was called (homosexual pejorative). People even said I must have been having an 
affair with his mother." 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil, whose newspaper editorially supported Ryan's right to attend school, 
said he received middle-of-the-night phone calls and had obscene messages spray 
painted on his apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil, who developed a close friendship with Ryan and his family, sized up 
Ryan's impact on the AIDS battle: "He said, 'I am a people and if it was a 
homosexual who gave this to me, he was a people, too.' Ryan put a face to the 
disease, and it scared us all." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, MacNeil said, "Ryan was always an adult. When he was diagnosed, and 
got thrust into the spotlight, he had to grow up. It robbed him of his 
childhood. He was an adult trapped in a little boy's dying body." 
</P>
<P>
But, throughout his ordeal, MacNeil said, Ryan's attitude was, "Hey, this is 
it. This is what life has given me. Let's make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taught me so much." 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil has spent a great deal of time pondering the Ryan White phenomenon, 
trying to pinpoint just what it was that made him special, that attracted the 
rich and the famous and, in so doing, helped to change a nation's attitude 
toward people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, MacNeil said, it became clear to him: "Maybe it's just that people do 
give a damn. Maybe people care. That just blows my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Kleiman expressed some of the same feelings. Of the celebrity parade at the 
hospital, he said, "their concern has been Ryan and Ryan's family, not to 
glorify their own careers. I've been greatly impressed by the sincerity of the 
people who have come to see him, caring, nice people." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Van Dyke, the family spokeswoman, quoted Jeanne White: "All this time I 
wasn't sure what we were doing was having an impact. Now I know it has." 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange gathering Sunday afternoon, the day of Ryan's death, at the 
White home on Overlook Circle, a loop of newer houses rimming Morse Lake in 
Cicero, a pleasant town of 4,500 about 45 minutes north of Indianapolis. It was 
in Cicero that Jeanne White, Ryan and Ryan's sister Andrea, now 16, found a 
warm welcome after deciding to leave Kokomo about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, her long vigil at her son's bedside over, Jeanne White had returned 
home and was reminiscing about Ryan with those who had come by to pay their 
condolences. Jeanne White, General Motors plant worker, greeted developer 
Donald Trump with a kiss, embraced Michael Jackson and Elton John. 
</P>
<P>
These were Ryan White's friends. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Dillon, principal of Ryan's school, Hamilton Heights High, home of the 
Huskies, came by, too. There would be school, as usual, on Wednesday, the day 
of Ryan's funeral, he said, but "any student who wishes to attend will be 
excused." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Ryan will be at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Second Presbyterian 
Church, 7700 N. Meridian, Indianapolis. Burial, which will be private, will be 
in Cicero. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan White wanted to be buried in Cicero, at the cemetery on a bluff 
overlooking Morse Lake. He loved Cicero, a place where cars brake for geese 
crossing the bridge, where there are front-porch swings on old frame houses and 
Purkey's two-chair barbershop is a fixture on the main street.

FOUNDING CHANCELLOR OF UC IRVINE CAMPUS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., founding chancellor of UC Irvine and the only person in 
the University of California's history to head three of the system's campuses, 
died Monday at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, following a prolonged battle 
with intestinal cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
An athletic man with a strong, resonant voice, Aldrich started UC Irvine 
literally from the ground up. He picked the site for the campus in December, 
1961. And he is credited with making the new campus, currently with an 
enrollment of about 16,000, into one of the nation's premier research 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to heading the Irvine campus until 1984, Aldrich served as interim 
chancellor at UC Riverside and UC Santa Barbara. UC President David P. Gardner 
often called Aldrich his "utility chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday, Gardner said that Aldrich "will be remembered above all 
by those of us who knew him well for his personal integrity, moral values, 
unimpeachable character and the dignity and courage with which he bore his 
illness the last several years." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich's 22-year tenure as head of UC Irvine is the longest of any chancellor 
in the nine-campus UC system. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Kerr, who was UC president from 1958 to 1967, on Monday described Aldrich 
as "one of the great and most successful builders of a new university campus." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Peltason, who worked with Aldrich during the early UC Irvine days and who 
succeeded him as chancellor in 1984, praised his friend's courage in the face 
of a terminal illness. Said Peltason, "His whole life was an example, his last 
few years an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason also said that Aldrich was "a man of courage, vision, commitment and 
kindness. His concern was always what was best for others. His memorial is all 
around us: it is UCI." 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents, in a formal resolution in 1985, praised Aldrich as "an 
institution in himself, a man whose values are as rock-ribbed and solid as the 
hills of his native New England." 
</P>
<P>
Although he spent most of his adult years in California, Aldrich retained the 
accent of a New England Yankee. And he proudly said his roots remained in 
agriculture, where he began his academic career. "I am an aggie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich had planned to retire in 1984, after stepping down as UC Irvine's chief 
executive. But after the death that year of UC Riverside Chancellor Tomas 
Rivera, Gardner persuaded Aldrich to become interim chancellor at Riverside 
until a full-time administrator could be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich left the Riverside campus in July, 1985, but in July, 1986, Gardner 
again summoned him, this time to be interim chancellor at UC Santa Barbara. 
Aldrich took over the Santa Barbara campus following the resignation of 
Chancellor Robert A. Huttenback, who was accused of misusing UC funds. 
Huttenback was convicted of embezzlement and tax fraud in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving UC Santa Barbara in June, 1987, Aldrich assumed the postion of 
chancellor emeritus at UC Irvine, maintaining an office on campus there. He and 
his wife, Jean, lived in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich was born in Northwood, N.H., on July 12, 1918. He received his bachelor 
of science degree from the College of Agriculture at the University of Rhode 
Island in 1939. He earned his master's degree from the University of Arizona in 
1941, and his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich took his first academic job in the UC system in 1943, becoming a junior 
chemist at the UC citrus experiment station at Riverside. Except for three 
years in the Army during World War II, Aldrich stayed at Riverside until 1958, 
when he was appointed as the UC system's dean of agriculture, presiding over 
programs at UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UC Riverside and UCLA. He remained 
agriculture dean until 1962, when he was named chancellor of UC Irvine, which 
was then its planning stages. The campus did not open for classes until 
September, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1961, shortly before becoming chancellor, Aldrich and an 
internationally famous architect, the late William Pereira of Los Angeles, 
walked over the treeless hills of what was then part of the sprawling Irvine 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira, in a 1984 memoir, recalled that Aldrich spotted a bowl-shaped area of 
land that had a rocky outcropping. Pereira said that Aldrich pointed to the 
rocks and said, "This should be the center." The architect agreed, and he used 
a concentric circle design for the university campus, with the land that 
Aldrich pointed out serving as a park and the school's geometric center. 
</P>
<P>
When Aldrich left the campus in 1984, the UC Board of Regents named that 
central area Aldrich Park. Aldrich said the park had special meaning to him. It 
was, he said, a place "where those of us, in one capacity or another, have had 
occasion to come and to dream and to build." 
</P>
<P>
Private funeral services, with burial at sea as Aldrich requested, will be held 
on an undisclosed date, UC Irvine officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife and three grown children, Daniel G. III of Santa 
Cruz, Stuart of San Diego, and Elizabeth Toomey of Irvine, and seven 
grandchildren.
