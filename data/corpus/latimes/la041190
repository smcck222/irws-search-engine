BUSH, MULRONEY HAVE A BALL AT BASEBALL SUMMIT

<P>
President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada met in a summit 
conference Tuesday that will go down in history -- if it goes down at all -- 
far less for what was declaimed and decided than for where it took place -- the 
newest, most high-tech baseball park in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Although no records are kept on such matters, it is probably safe to assume 
that two powerful leaders have never met in a locale so oddly suited for 
political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Mulroney met and dined and talked to the press at various lounges and 
rooms of the SkyDome, home of the American League's Toronto Blue Jays, for four 
hours before the game with the Texas Rangers began. 
</P>
<P>
Several significant issues were raised, among them the upcoming summit between 
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Canadian-American 
free-trade agreement, acid rain and this summer's economic summit in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no real divisive issues between the two neighboring countries or 
between the two politicians, and it was hard to imagine that anything of great 
moment had been settled. It was a chance for review rather than pronouncement. 
</P>
<P>
And baseball, as might be expected from the site of the sessions, seemed to 
intrude everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney, for example, could not keep from boasting at a joint news conference 
that the Blue Jays would "inflict terrible damage" on the Rangers in their home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in mock retaliation, told everyone in the Texas locker room later that, 
in view of what Mulroney had said, he was rooting for the Rangers, a team owned 
in part by the President's eldest son, George Walker Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The President wore a Texas jacket and Mulroney a Toronto jacket as they threw 
out the first balls, lobs that hit the catchers' mitts but had little power or 
spin on them. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic Canadian politics intruded on the opening game ceremonies twice. The 
Toronto crowd booed lustily when a trio of singers known as Blue Rodeo sang a 
verse of the Canadian national anthem in French. The bilingual policy of the 
Canadian government has provoked an English-language-only campaign in parts of 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd booed even more when Mulroney was introduced. The garrulous prime 
minister with a gift for silken speech has reached the nadir of his popularity 
in public opinion polls in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Mulroney then settled in to watch the game. They left after five 
innings of an eventual 2-1 Toronto victory. The President returned to 
Washington late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There were some serious moments at a joint news conference before the game. 
Bush, for example, said that while the foreign policy of a country does not 
depend on one individual, it is important to keep in mind that Gorbachev has 
"demonstrated an openness and a commitment to reform and openness inside that's 
remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi's intervention to help gain 
the release of a French-Belgian couple and their child could presage an 
improvement in U.S.-Libyan relations, Bush said: "If, indeed, a person deserves 
credit for facilitating the release of people held against their will -- anyone 
in the world -- I would certainly say, fine, give the person credit. I don't 
know enough about the facts of this release." 
</P>
<P>
But, at least publicly, the day belonged to baseball. The President was 
grinning as Texas Manager Bobby Valentine led him and the prime minister 
through the visitors' locker room before the game. 
</P>
<P>
The President shook everyone's hand and stopped to chat with ace pitcher Nolan 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"Good start," he told Ryan, who gave up no hits in five innings in his victory 
over Toronto in the Rangers' home opener Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The President also grabbed the night's starter for Texas, knuckleballer Charlie 
Hough, and announced, "I've got to talk to him about my pitch." But, if Hough 
gave him any pointers, it was not evident in Bush's opening throw a few minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
In the Toronto locker room, Bush came upon players holding baseballs for him to 
autograph. The President signed for all who asked but warned, "I hope you have 
some balls left to play with." 
</P>
<P>
When photographers asked Bush and Mulroney to pose with Toronto slugger George 
Bell, the Dominican player turned to the President and said, "You're used to 
cameras, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Long before the President arrived in Toronto, he had baseball on his mind. 
Talking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Bush, accompanied by Commissioner 
of Baseball Fay Vincent, fielded questions about Lithuania and nuclear 
disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
And he even offered a bit of news when he told them that, unlike Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III and White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, he 
was not disappointed by the results of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze's visit to Washington last week. But the impatient President 
finally wondered aloud if anyone was ever going to ask him questions about the 
great national pastime. That immediately elicited a flurry of questions about 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Should we call it the national pastime in Canada? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think we want to get them to buy into that definition," the President 
replied. "That's why we're going." 
</P>
<P>
Are you going to throw a curve? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go with a slider this time," Bush said. "I've had such good luck 
in the last couple of years. The catcher let me down one time when he couldn't 
get into the dirt and grab it properly." 
</P>
<P>
Are you working on your stuff, Mr. President? 
</P>
<P>
"No, no. Nolan will handle the fast one, and I'll go with the stuff." 
</P>

Mulroney held a summit most notable for its location: a baseball stadium. The 
two talked at the SkyDome, home of the Toronto Blue Jays, for four hours before 
the game with the Texas Rangers. Then both leaders threw out the first pitches, 
right. There are no real divisive issues between the nations, so sports took 
precedence. Mulroney boasted that the Blue Jays would "inflict terrible damage" 
on the Rangers. Bush, in mock retaliation, said he was rooting for the Rangers 
-- not surprising, since his eldest son is part owner of the team. The Blue 
Jays won, 2-1. United Press International; Photo, (Southland edition) Secretary

3 EUROPEANS RELEASED BY ARAB CAPTORS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGES: FRENCH WOMAN, DAUGHTER AND BELGIAN BOYFRIEND ARE FREED IN BEIRUT.

Three European hostages -- a French woman, her Belgian boyfriend and their 
2-year-old daughter -- were freed Tuesday in Beirut by their radical 
Palestinian captors. 
</P>
<P>
They had been held for 29 months by guerrillas of the Revolutionary Council of 
Fatah, headed by the shadowy terrorist Abu Nidal. The group is believed to 
still be holding four other Belgians captured with them. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Jacqueline Valente, 32, Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their 
daughter, Sophie, on Tuesday followed an appeal for compassion last week by 
Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
France appeared to have paved the way for the release in November, when it 
approved the long-delayed delivery of three Mirage jet airplanes to the Libyan 
armed forces. The aircraft were delivered last month, news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy spokesman Francois Abi Saab told reporters that the freed hostages 
"were smiling and appeared to be in good health." 
</P>
<P>
"I embrace all my family. I am well, and the little one also," AP quoted 
Valente as telling French reporters who were given exclusive access to the 
three at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
A chartered jet flew the three from Beirut to Villacoublay military airport 
near Paris. There, after arriving at 10:12 p.m., they got into a car and were 
driven away to an unspecified destination without making any public statement. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and supporters of eight American hostages and other Westerners held 
in Lebanon drew little solace from Tuesday's release. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping of Valente, Houtekins and their companions off a vessel in 
Mediterranean waters south of Israel has never been directly connected with the 
Beirut hostage situation, in which the captors are Shiite Muslim militants. The 
longest-held hostage, American Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East 
correspondent for the Associated Press, last month marked his fifth year as a 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite indications of activity over the last two months, the observers said, 
there is no sign that there will be any sudden release for any of these 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in Canada for talks with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, said he 
does not know whether the release "has any implications at all" for the U.S. 
hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks ago, there was a flurry of understandable excitement about the 
release of these people," Bush said. "And I had difficulty understanding where 
was all this coming from? What's driving this news flurry? 
</P>
<P>
"And I still don't know the answer to that." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I would just repeat that goodwill begets goodwill. And a 
manifestation of goodwill would be the release of these American hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Pearson, president of the group Friends of John McCarthy, a television 
cameraman who is one of three British hostages, said of the Valente party's 
release: "Given the nature of their kidnaping -- that they were taken by the 
Abu Nidal group . . . I don't think it means the Western hostages in Beirut are 
any nearer release." 
</P>
<P>
"The release of hostages of any nationality by any group is always very welcome 
news," said a spokesman for Anglican Archbishop Robert A. K. Runcie, for whom 
British hostage Terry Waite worked. "But the captors in this case are quite 
different to those holding the British hostages in Lebanon, so their release 
brings little direct comfort . . . beyond the hope that it might loosen up the 
situation of hostages in Lebanon generally." 
</P>
<P>
Deliverance for Valente, Houtekins and their daughter came in typical Beirut 
fashion: 
</P>
<P>
According to an Associated Press report from the Lebanese capital, a convoy of 
three cars, curtains drawn, rolled up to the main gate of the French Embassy in 
the Muslim-populated western sector of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting just inside were Ambassador Rene Ala and other French officials, 
apparently forewarned that the three hostages were being released. Nearby, two 
other cars filled with gunmen kept watch as the European couple and the child, 
who was born in captivity, were turned over. 
</P>
<P>
Valente, Houtekins, four other Belgians and two daughters of Valente by her 
divorced husband were seized by Abu Nidal's guerrillas aboard the Silco, a 
converted trawler, off the Gaza Strip coast on Nov. 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian captors said that Valente and the other passengers aboard the 
Silco were Jews and Israeli spies. Their families in Europe insisted they were 
Roman Catholics and simply adventurers and that the French woman had hoped to 
work her way to Australia and begin a new life there after her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Those captured along with Valente and Houtekins, and apparently still in 
captivity, are Houtekins' brother Emmanuel, 44, his wife, Godelieve Kets, 39, 
and their children, Laurent, 19, and Valerie, 18. Houtekins told French 
reporters that his relatives were well. 
</P>
<P>
"They have morale. They are holding firm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Hollants Van Loocke, a Belgian Foreign Ministry official, told reporters in 
Beirut on Monday that he was seeking their release. Walid Khaled, a Fatah 
Revolutionary Council spokesman, linked their freedom to an Arab sentenced to 
life imprisonment in Belgium for a 1980 grenade assault on some Jewish youths. 
A 15-year-old was killed and 20 people injured in the attack in Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Valente's second hostage-born child, another daughter, born last 
year, was uncertain. Wire service reports, quoting unidentified French sources, 
said the child died in captivity of a digestive illness. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the Silco captives has never been known, and the release of 
Valente in Beirut was a mild surprise, since the Abu Nidal faction is 
reportedly now based in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi took an early hand in the fate of the captives. In response to appeals 
by Valente's ex-husband, Pascal Betille, and direct French-Libyan negotiations, 
the Libyan leader personally -- and with fanfare -- arranged the release of the 
couple's daughters, Virginie, then 5, and Marie-Laure, then 6. They were freed 
in Tripoli in December, 1988. Details of those negotiations have never been 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls were returned to their father. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kadafi, who for the past two years has been trying to bury his image 
as an Arab radical and promoter of terrorism, called on Valente's captors to 
free her and "her family" as a humanitarian gesture during the Muslim holy 
month of Ramadan. In less than a week, his suggestion was carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Libya's official news agency Jana quoted Kadafi as saying that Abu Nidal's 
group was "distancing" itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
French officials in Paris were quick to praise Kadafi on Tuesday for his role 
in releasing the hostages. A spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand said 
the French leader personally thanked Kadafi for his "key role in this happy 
development." 
</P>
<P>
France approved the delivery of three Mirage warplanes and radar equipment to 
the Libyan military last November. Weapons deliveries to Libya were banned 
under a 1986 embargo established by the 12-nation European Community. But 
French officials said that the weapons sales had been made before the ban and 
therefore did not fall under the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"Their release is part of the warplane deal," a Palestinian source in Beirut 
said of Valente, Houtekins and their child. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry denied Tuesday night that the 
release was linked to the supply of fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mirage jets that we supplied to Libya already belonged to them before the 
embargo," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The three planes -- a Mirage F-1 and a two Mirage 5 aircraft -- were delivered 
to Libya last month. Kadafi himself indicated at the beginning of March that 
relations between France and Libya had been "normalized" and that the 
"differences between the two countries are over." In addition, France recently 
announced the resumption of grain sales to Libya and restored shipping and 
telecommunications links. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Rone Tempest, in Paris, contributed to this report.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Banna, heads the Revolutionary Council of 
Fatah, one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world. His faction broke 
with Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in 1974 after a PLO court convicted him of embezzling funds, 
sedition and murder and sentenced him to death. Over the years, Abu Nidal's 
(his nom de guerre means Father of Struggle) group has been blamed for more 
than 100 terrorist raids including the December, 1985, attacks on airports in 
Rome and Vienna in which 20 people, including five Americans, died. His group, 
thought to be backed primarily by Libya, is believed to have as many as 500 
members.

HYDRAULIC FAULT DELAYS SHUTTLE, SPACE TELESCOPE 
</P>

<P>
Failure of a hydraulic system aboard the space shuttle Discovery Tuesday forced 
NASA to delay the launch of the long-awaited Hubble Space Telescope for one to 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle was within four minutes of blasting off when the mission was 
scrubbed to the profound disappointment of scientists who have waited for years 
to see the revolutionary telescope launched into orbit 380 miles above the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many days of this we can take emotionally," said Edward J. 
Weiler, project scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. Like other scientists who have lived through years of delays in 
launching the $2-billion telescope, Weiler seemed depressed but resigned to the 
uncertainties of space flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We've waited 13 years," he said. "We can wait a few more days." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began when the Discovery's three "auxiliary power units" were 
turned on five minutes before the shuttle was scheduled to lift off at 5:47 
a.m. PDT Tuesday. The units drive the hydraulic system that runs nearly all the 
mechanical parts of the shuttle, including all aerodynamic controls and even 
the landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
"The units are used to steer the orbiter," said launch director Robert Sieck, 
who ordered the scrub. "They are obviously mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
Only one unit indicated it was malfunctioning, so the crew would not have been 
in danger even if the problem had occurred during liftoff because redundancies 
in the system would have prevented disaster, Sieck said. But NASA regulations 
do not permit a launch without that added margin of safety. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have problems, we do like to find them on the ground," Sieck said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will have to remove the failed unit from the shuttle and either fix it 
or replace it, a procedure that will take about a week. In addition the 
batteries inside the space telescope will have to be recharged -- an involved 
process that could take up to eight days. 
</P>
<P>
The six nickel hydrogen batteries slowly discharge themselves while the shuttle 
sits on the launch pad, and NASA had only four days to launch the Discovery 
before it would have been necessary to delay the launch for eight days so the 
batteries could be recharged. 
</P>
<P>
While on orbit, the batteries will be charged continuously by the telescope's 
solar arrays. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were hoping to set a new launch date today and it was not clear 
whether the delay will force a postponement in other launches now set for the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the all veteran crew of the Discovery was expected to return to 
Houston to wait for further orders. The Discovery is commanded by Loren 
Shriver, 45. The pilot is Charles F. Bolden, 43, and the mission specialists 
are Bruce McCandless, 52, Steven A. Hawley, 38, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In California -- the richest state in the richest nation in the world -- more 
than 5 million people are living without health insurance, risking financial 
ruin if they fall ill or suffer injuries in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
If they are hospitalized, most of the uninsured must depend on public programs 
or charity from private hospitals to pay for their care, adding to the tax 
burden and medical bills of the rest of the state's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Under that weight, much of California's health care system is sagging. Soaring 
costs threaten to price middle-class working people out of high-quality care, 
and the rich and poor alike run a greater risk of dying in accidents because 
emergency rooms and specially equipped trauma centers are closing their doors. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has been evident for some time to ordinary Californians. Many have 
gone bankrupt paying for health care. Others who are still healthy but cannot 
afford insurance live in fear of an illness that could send them into a 
financial tailspin. People with insurance through their jobs find themselves 
paying more for less. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people have understood that this thing is dead serious and it's 
not going to go away," said Jim Krause, a San Dimas owner of a small print shop 
who was saddled with more than $40,000 in medical bills after a heart attack. 
"Basic health care is a right, not a privilege." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of its growing impact on the middle class, the issue now has 
caught the attention of lawmakers, the governor and special interests in the 
state Capitol, who have vowed to find a solution before the year is out. In a 
state with one of the 10 most-productive economies in the world, they say, 
there must be a way to provide basic medical services to the entire population. 
</P>
<P>
If these efforts fail, three groups stand ready with proposed initiatives to be 
placed on the ballot beginning in 1992, including one that would create a 
system of universal, tax-supported health care. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of every philosophical stripe and special interest groups from all 
sides seem to agree on this basic outline of the problem: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 21% of state residents under the age of 65 lack insurance, up from 
17% in 1979, according to a recent UCLA study. Although most of those people 
are poor, about one-fourth of them come from families earning at least three 
times the federal poverty level of $12,100 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
* Another 3.5 million poor people get their only health care through the 
Medi-Cal program, which doctors and hospitals say covers only 35% to about 60% 
of their costs. Fewer and fewer doctors and hospitals are willing to treat the 
poor at these rates, so the needy often defer medical care until they have an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
* Health care costs not paid by patients are covered by the taxpayers or 
shifted to customers who pay in full. Hospitals provided $3.1 billion in 
charity care in 1989, about 17% of their overall costs, according to an 
industry group. Most of this shortfall was passed on to paying customers in the 
form of higher room charges and higher insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
* Insurers are caught in a vicious competitive spiral, with every company 
seeking to cover only the healthiest customers, leaving the chronically ill who 
cannot afford exorbitant rates to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
* Employer costs are soaring: A recent survey found that health care expenses 
for California businesses climbed by nearly 25% in 1989. In Los Angeles, a 
worker's health insurance typically costs his or her employer about $250 a 
month, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Small businesses are even more vulnerable because insurance companies charge 
them higher rates and adjust premiums frequently to reflect the health 
histories of their employees. If one worker gets seriously ill, the costs for 
the entire firm can escalate. 
</P>
<P>
* Even employees who have health insurance are feeling the pinch, as companies 
try to shift their increasing costs onto the work force. Employees are paying 
higher premiums, deductibles and co-payments. And health benefits were a 
central issue in five of the six major strikes in California last year, 
according to the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
But that is where the agreement ends. Each interest group is pushing its own 
solution, and many of the ideas are in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Employers tend to favor methods that would contain the costs of insurance and 
medical care without requiring any additional commitment on their part. Doctors 
and hospitals want to require companies to insure their workers, but they 
oppose the more onerous efforts to control medical fees, such as direct 
government regulation of their rates. 
</P>
<P>
Two influential consumer-advocate groups have proposed eliminating the current, 
employer-based system and replacing it with universal, tax-supported coverage. 
Much of organized labor supports a plan to tax those businesses that do not 
provide coverage for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of byplay has led to legislative paralysis in the past, and it could 
again this year. But if most or all of those groups could agree on a single 
approach, it could well breeze through the Legislature and into law. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is also wrestling with the issue. A federal commission on March 2 
recommended an expanded, employer-based system. But the proposal already has 
been attacked as too costly by the Bush Administration, and most California 
observers believe no solution will be forthcoming from Washington. So state 
lawmakers, like their colleagues in Hawaii, Massachusetts and Oregon, intend to 
try to solve the problem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
So far, three major proposals have been floated in the state Capitol, and each 
would place most of the burden for providing insurance on employers. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's top administrators of health and business programs 
have offered a plan -- not endorsed by the governor -- that would require all 
California businesses to insure their employees and their workers' families. 
Companies would pay at least 75% of the premiums for the workers and half the 
cost for their families. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes subsidies for low-wage workers and low-profit businesses, 
allowing them to buy cheaper insurance through the Medi-Cal program, which now 
is limited to the poor. Also included in the proposal is a provision that would 
require insurers to accept everyone who applied, regardless of their health 
history, and limit differences in their rates to about 40%. This proposal is 
backed by much of the insurance industry as a way to head off more Draconian 
notions calling for state regulation of insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration proposal, now contained in a bill authored by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), has been attacked on several 
fronts. Business groups say the mandate is an unfair imposition on employers, 
while advocates for the poor complain that the plan would cost more than the 
Administration is prepared to spend and leave uncovered more than 1 million 
people who need care the most. Doctors and hospitals have criticized the 
proposed expansion of the Medi-Cal program, which they say already is moribund. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan is remarkable only in its ability to draw fire from 
virtually every side of the health care debate, said Dr. Charles Plows, 
president of the California Medical Assn. "This is California's first consensus 
on health insurance in years," he said, referring to the nearly unanimous 
condemnation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The CMA's own plan, which will be carried in the Legislature by Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, also would require every employer to 
provide insurance. But the doctors' proposal couples that requirement with 
significant new taxes to raise at least $1.5 billion annually for subsidies to 
low-income employees and businesses. Maddy originally considered carrying the 
governor's proposal but recently has criticized it as unworkable without new 
taxes, which Deukmejian opposes. 
</P>
<P>
A third measure, advanced by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), would 
cover all Californians, not only workers and their families. Like the others, 
the Margolin bill depends largely on employers to provide coverage, but it 
would impose an 8% payroll tax on those businesses that do not participate, 
using this money to provide coverage for people who cannot obtain it in the 
private market. This is known as a "play or pay" system. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would create a state commission that would negotiate with private 
doctors, hospitals and insurers to care for all those who could not get 
insurance on their own. Workers not covered by their companies would get this 
state-sponsored coverage but would have to pay a 2% tax on their earnings. The 
plan also includes subsidies for low-wage workers and start-up businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promise of subsidies or tax breaks in all of these plans, many 
employers remain deeply suspicious of any scheme that requires them to provide 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Business groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce and the National 
Federation of Independent Businesses, are working on a proposal that seeks to 
bring down insurance rates so that more employers can afford to buy coverage 
without a government mandate that they do so. If that approach fails, some 
business leaders are saying that improved health care would be better funded by 
broad-based taxes than by an added burden on companies. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Linda Thompson, counsel to the California Restaurant Assn., said her members 
are "absolutely, totally focused on" the health insurance issue. She said the 
various employer mandate proposals would be particularly tough on restaurants, 
a large proportion of which do not provide insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We as employers are not the solution to the health care problem in 
California," Thompson said. "A tax on jobs is not a solution to access or cost 
containment." 
</P>
<P>
But a leading labor lobbyist in Sacramento said employers who contend that 
providing insurance would bankrupt them are crying wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to put them out of business," said Tom Rankin, a lobbyist 
for the California Labor Federation. "They will pass it on. I don't think 
anybody should be deceived by these dire predictions." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the business community does not speak with one voice on the issue. 
Companies that are already providing insurance, particularly large, 
self-insured corporations, would probably benefit from a mandate requiring 
their competitors to offer insurance as well. And others believe that an 
expanded role for employers is inevitable and want to shape the final product 
to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation to society at large," said Larry Kaplan, president of 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. "The political reality is that there is 
going to be some kind of mandate for health insurance. It behooves us to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
Health insurance has been linked to the workplace since the 1930s, when 
companies and labor unions began providing hospital coverage for their 
employees and members. This was done primarily through nonprofit Blue Cross 
plans, which dominated the market and charged every enrollee a flat fee -- a 
practice known as "community rating." 
</P>
<P>
But after World War II, when more and more workers obtained insurance as a 
tax-free fringe benefit, commercial insurers began to capture a larger share of 
the market. They did so by offering lower rates to groups, like large employers 
or unions, which from their health histories could be expected to pay more in 
premiums than they would use in medical care. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of competition among insurers set off a vicious spiral that continues 
to this day. As more and more healthy, low-risk people were insured at 
comparably lower rates, insurance companies would only offer to cover the sick 
at prices high enough to justify the increased financial risk. Today, rates for 
the chronically ill are so high that almost no one can afford them. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is no insurance out there anymore," said Brent A. Barnhart, 
secretary of the Assn. of California Life Insurance Companies. "It is a game to 
make sure your opponent ends up with all the bad risks and you end up with the 
good risks. It's like sharks in a feeding frenzy. Nobody can afford to be a 
good guy without going under." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the sick were being excluded from health insurance, so 
were the poor. Throughout the 1980s, the fees doctors and hospitals collect 
from Medi-Cal for treating the needy fell further behind inflation. Now, 
according to Plows of the CMA, Medi-Cal pays physicians only about 35% to 60% 
of what they can earn treating privately insured patients. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Plows said, Medi-Cal pays pediatricians $12 for a $35 patient 
visit, and pays obstetricians $1,000 for delivering a baby, a procedure that 
would cost a private patient $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state in 1982 cut more than 250,000 people from the Medi-Cal 
rolls and gave the counties the responsibility of caring for them. Although the 
Legislature promised to pay the counties 70% of what it had cost the state to 
provide the care, lawmakers and the governor have not lived up to 
</P>
<P>
that pledge. This funding gap has left more of the working poor with no access 
to care. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are not required to accept Medi-Cal patients or the uninsured, and many 
do not. But hospitals by law must treat everyone who arrives in need of 
emergency care. Last year, according to the California Assn. of Hospitals and 
Health Systems, hospitals spent $1.3 billion treating non-paying patients and 
lost another $2.8 billion providing care to government-funded patients. 
</P>
<P>
The shortfalls have prompted some hospitals to shut down their emergency rooms 
rather than continue losing money on charity cases. Particularly hard-hit have 
been the specially equipped and expensive trauma centers, which hospitals 
around the state established in the early 1980s, only to discover soon after 
that as many as half of their patients could not pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
The same centers that had opened with great fanfare -- they were set up to save 
lives by having medical specialists on duty and sophisticated equipment on hand 
-- began closing their doors. In Los Angeles County last month, Huntington 
Memorial Hospital abandoned the trauma care network, leaving just 12 of the 23 
hospitals that were part of the county program when it began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is trying to avoid being stuck with the government's 
</P>
<P>
underpayments and the cost shift from the uninsured," said Duane Dauner, 
president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Medical providers have tried to make do by charging different fees to different 
customers. An identical procedure can be billed at one price if the patient is 
on Medi-Cal, and another if the customer is paying for it. One rate applies to 
patients with indemnity insurance, which reimburses them for their costs, while 
another price is quoted to members of group plans, which are able to negotiate 
substantial discounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense for doctors and hospitals to have five different rates 
depending on who approaches them," said Gene Preston, general manager of the 
California State Employees Assn. "It doesn't accomplish anything except 
squeezing one place and pushing it out somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that policy-makers are simply chasing their tails by grappling 
with various approaches that are based on the status quo. They argue that no 
reform will be effective unless it scraps a large part of today's health care 
structure and replaces it with something completely different. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be willing to start out with a clean sheet of paper, to throw out 
a lot of assumptions, a lot of sacred cows," said Assembly Republican Leader 
Ross Johnson of La Habra. "The system cannot work as it is designed today. 
Eventually, no matter how many additional bells and whistles we add, it is 
going to fall of its own weight." 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the political spectrum from Johnson but holding a similar 
viewpoint about the flaws in the current system is Lois Salisbury, president of 
Health Access, a consumer and labor coalition preparing a possible ballot 
initiative for 1992 to require basic health coverage for every California 
resident. The plan would be financed in part by raising the sales tax one-half 
cent and increasing income taxes on the affluent. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Health Access plan, everyone would be entitled to basic benefits, 
with little or no out-of-pocket expenses to the patient. The state would 
collect all health care premiums now paid to insurers and channel those dollars 
to private doctors and hospitals chosen by patients. The health care providers 
would be paid from annual budgets that would give them an incentive to maximize 
efficiency, Salisbury believes, much as the universal system in Canada allows 
that country to provide broad-based care for all its citizens at a per-capita 
cost that is 40% below what the U.S. spends. 
</P>
<P>
Without significant change, Salisbury said, the outlook for health care in 
California is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have many people sick and many people dying needlessly," she added. 
"We have it now. We'll have more." 
</P>
<P>
PROFILING THE UNINSURED 
</P>
<P>
The more than 5 million Californians without health insurance come from every 
age and ethnic group and include the working and non-working alike. They live 
in every corner of the state. In two recent reports to the Legislature, UCLA 
professor of public health E. Richard Brown and associates provided a 
comprehensive profile of this population. The graphs below provide some 
highlights : 
</P>
<P>
BY RACE 
</P>
<P>
Non-Latino Whites: 15.1% 
</P>
<P>
Blacks: 25.2% 
</P>
<P>
Latinos: 37.1% 
</P>
<P>
Others: 19.9% 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are twice as likely as Anglos to be uninsured. More than 37% of Latino 
adults are without insurance, compared with about 15% of Anglos and 25% of 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
BY POPULATION 
</P>
<P>
1.1% Retired 
</P>
<P>
1.4% Unemployed 
</P>
<P>
1.8% Others 
</P>
<P>
2.2% Ill or disabled 
</P>
<P>
6.3% Students 
</P>
<P>
7.2% Homemakers 
</P>
<P>
27% Children (Under age 16) 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 80% of California's uninsured are working adults and their families. 
Non-working adults constitute 20% of the uninsured population. Among the 
non-working adults, more than half are homemakers and students. 
</P>
<P>
BY AGE 
</P>
<P>
Under 6: 21.2% 
</P>
<P>
6-17: 21.9% 
</P>
<P>
18-29: 30.1% 
</P>
<P>
30-44: 15.7% 
</P>
<P>
45-54: 15.8% 
</P>
<P>
55-64: 17.7% 
</P>
<P>
Men and women in early adulthood are more likely to be without insurance than 
children or older people. About 31% of men and 27% of women aged 18 to 29 do 
not have insurance. Although children are more likely than adults to be 
insured, they still account for about one-third of the state's uninsured 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
BY AREAS OF STATE 
</P>
<P>
Fresno: 29.9% 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield: 26.4% 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles / Long Beach: 26.3% 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim / Santa Ana: 23.1% 
</P>
<P>
San Diego: 22.1% 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco: 21.3% 
</P>
<P>
Riverside / San Bernardino: 18.4% 
</P>
<P>
Oakland: 14.3% 
</P>
<P>
San Jose: 13.9% 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento: 12.8% 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard / Ventura: 12.5 
</P>
<P>
People in the Fresno, Bakersfield and Los Angeles/Long Beach metropolitan areas 
are less likely to be insured than residents in other parts of California. 
Nearly two-thirds of California's uninsured live in the Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego County areas alone. People living in the Oxnard/Ventura, Sacramento 
and San Jose areas are most likely to have some kind of medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The above figures represent the non-elderly population, those less than 65 
years of age for 1986. Relatively few people over 65 years of age are 
uninsured. This is primarily because of Medicare, a national acute health care 
insurance program for the elderly.

REPORT ASSAILS CONDITIONS AT STATE PRISON FOR WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: DRUG DEALING BY INMATES AND STAFF, FRIGHTFUL MEDICAL CARE, SEXUAL 
ABUSE AND CROWDING ARE AMONG PROBLEMS CITED BY LEGISLATIVE PANEL.

FRONTERA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Institution for Women, the most overcrowded prison in the state, 
has been plagued by poor medical care, drug trafficking and charges of sexual 
assaults by inmates as well as staff members, according to a legislative 
committee report on prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Although improvements were noted at the Frontera correctional facility, the 
preliminary report released this week called the prison the worst in the state 
for drug abuse and detailed a host of problems ranging from security breakdowns 
to mistreatment of pregnant inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that one pregnant prisoner who was bleeding heavily could not 
get help for at least eight hours. She later delivered prematurely and was not 
notified for two weeks that her child had died, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said another prisoner suffered a miscarriage and was told by 
infirmary staff to store her dead fetus in a tissue box in her cell before 
reporting back with it the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Joint Legislative Committee on Prison Construction and 
Operation, chaired by state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), is the result of 
an investigation into inmate complaints, allegations by the warden and news 
stories about prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The scathing document describes the women's facility as the state prison with 
"the worst reputation for drug trafficking" and mentions that a high-ranking 
correctional officer might be involved. 
</P>
<P>
No details about the officer or the type of wrongdoing were disclosed, and the 
report only made general reference to allegations of sexual abuse and 
harassment by inmates and members of the prison staff. 
</P>
<P>
In the commissary, state investigators noted filthy conditions, chronic 
cockroach infestation, dangerous conditions and constant complaints from 
inmates about spoiled food. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some changes out there," said Robert E. Holmes, chief 
consultant to the legislative committee. "But I think there hasn't been an 
appreciable drop in complaints about sexual abuse, harassment and drug dealing 
by staff and inmates." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Corrections say the California Institution 
for Women, with 2,100 inmates, is the most overcrowded prison in the state. The 
facility, off California 71 in San Bernardino County, was built for 926 
prisoners in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to the report, Prison Supt. Susan E. Poole said Tuesday, "My 
intent is to investigate anything that appears improper or illegal. My 
reputation is that I am a fair and conscientious person. I intend to keep it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Poole primarily blamed the prison's problems on severe overcrowding that has 
made it a struggle just to make sure there are enough beds for the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its criticism, the report described Poole as a "a caring person" and 
said that conditions had improved since she took over the prison. But the 
findings stated that Poole might not always be fully informed about prison 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the committee's report coincides with the recent escape and 
capture of Jeanette Lynn Hughes, 36, formerly of Huntington Beach, who was 
serving a 25-year-to-life sentence at the women's prison for murdering her 
husband. Hughes is fighting her extradition from El Paso, where she was 
captured last week with Cindy Marie Coglietti, a prison guard accused of 
helping her escape.

GILLESPIE WILL OPPOSE PLAN TO LIMIT ASSIGNED RISK ELIGIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Tuesday she will seek a court 
injunction to prevent the insurers who run the California Automobile Assigned 
Risk Plan from refusing to sell policies to hundreds of thousands of "good 
drivers" who cannot buy through the regular market. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, speaking at a San Francisco news conference, also said she intends 
to institute after public hearings in June a two-tier assigned risk sales plan 
under which drivers from families earning less than $26,000 a year would be 
permitted to buy liability coverage required under the state's mandatory 
insurance law for $700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of her announcements, the insurers -- who had earlier refused 
entreaties from the commissioner to make such a special provision for 
low-income groups -- responded that Gillespie has no authority to take either 
step and said the assigned risk board will fight her in court. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Gillespie said papers seeking the injunction will be filed by the 
end of the week. A hearing is expected before the May 1 deadline, when insurers 
say they will stop selling the assigned risk policies to new applicants who are 
"good drivers." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange between Gillespie and the insurers marked the latest in a series 
of disputes in which the commissioner has insisted that the industry assume 
some social responsibility for keeping insurance prices down for those who can 
least afford them, and the insurers have answered that the law requires only 
that they keep the assigned risk system solvent. 
</P>
<P>
Under the assigned risk plan, drivers who cannot obtain insurance -- either 
because of poor driving records or because insurance is unavailable in their 
areas -- are assigned to various insurance companies in proportion to the 
business the companies do in the state. "Good drivers" are defined as those 
with no more than one traffic violation in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has refused requests by the insurers for a 112.3% rate increase in 
the assigned risk system. The insurers, who say the plan lost $600 million in 
1989, have responded with court appeals and a new request for a 160.5% hike. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner said Tuesday, "California has an insurance emergency 
because automobile insurance, especially for low- and moderate-income drivers, 
is becoming scarcer due to its high cost. This emergency affects the state's 
public welfare, criminal justice system, transportation system and overall 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Feely, vice chairman of the Assigned Risk Plan and an executive at 
the Farmers group of companies, challenged Gillespie's right to do anything 
about this. He said that to institute a low-income sales plan, the commissioner 
would first have to seek approval from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way of knowing how many people might be made eligible under (her) 
proposal, but we have grave concerns about any proposal which would 
substantially increase the number of drivers in the plan who would be paying 
inadequate rates," Feely said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, meanwhile, also announced that she will hold hearings later this 
spring into alleged "redlining" of minorities and other low-income groups by 
insurance companies in violation of Proposition 103, which bars such 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's announcements were hailed by consumer leaders at her news 
conference. "We're encouraged," said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates, 
"because we believe the assigned risk governors are in violation of the law on 
several counts."

REPORT ON MERGER PLAN STIRS CONCERN IN SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
SMOG: THE JOINING OF EDISON AND SAN DIEGO GAS &amp; ELECTRIC COULD INCREASE 
POLLUTION IN L.A. AND HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON ITS SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR'S 
SKIES, THE STUDY CONCLUDES. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City administrators and air quality officials here expressed concern Tuesday 
about a state report saying that if San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. merges 
with Southern California Edison Corp., Los Angeles' pollution could have an 
immediate effect on San Diego's skies. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report, released by the state Public Utilities 
Commission on Monday, found that the merger would significantly increase Los 
Angeles' smog. The increase in pollution, however, could be offset in part by 
using San Diego-area power plants when smog alerts forced a slowdown at plants 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, bridled at the 
implied linking of San Diego's and Los Angeles' fate. The use of San Diego as a 
backstop, he said, would place the city where it doesn't want to be -- squarely 
in the shadow of its larger and more polluted northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"This has long been a fight for local control over our utility's future. But 
this takes it a step further and links us environmentally to what's happening 
in L.A.," Downey said. "Basically, San Diego would become a suburb of Los 
Angeles and would be subjected to the whims of (Edison's) bureaucrats sitting 
up in Rosemead. It's saying, 'If L.A. has a smoggy day, so will San Diego.' " 
</P>
<P>
Downey was among several politicians and air quality advocates in San Diego and 
Los Angeles who expressed renewed opposition Tuesday to the proposed 
$2.5-billion merger, which would create the nation's largest utility company 
with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Some agencies, including the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
reserved comment until they could fully examine the 900-page report. But others 
said the report's highlights alone supported their worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goggin, a spokesman for the San Diego County air pollution control 
district, agreed with Downey. He said that permits issued to San Diego plants 
in the 1970s would allow them to burn dirtier fuels -- oil instead of natural 
gas. In addition, Goggin said, San Diego plants operate at only 38% of the 
capacity they are allowed. If a merger took place, Goggin said, Edison could 
legally stoke up San Diego's plants to full capacity on smoggy Los Angeles 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were to take place," Goggin said, "it would require tighter 
restriction on other industry. It lays it on everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials deny that this could happen, arguing that it is in their own 
economic interest to boost operations at Los Angeles plants, not at the older, 
less efficient San Diego plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil is more costly than gas, so we wouldn't use oil instead of gas if gas were 
available," said Lewis M. Phelps, a vice president at Edison, who said San 
Diego plants "would never have to run more than they do now." He repeated his 
claim that the merger would be "environmentally positive." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Soto, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air, 
disagreed. He said a merger would be "a disaster" for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very inconsistent with local policy and it's certainly inconsistent with 
the goals of the 20-year plan," Soto said, referring to the far-reaching clean 
air plan that aims to bring the four-county Los Angeles Basin into compliance 
with federal standards by 2007.

An accident that pulled nine United Airlines passengers out of a Boeing jumbo 
jet over the Pacific Ocean resulted from failures by the airline, manufacturer 
and FAA to correct problems in cargo doors on 747 airliners, federal 
investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3 to 0 to accept the results of 
a more than 13-month investigation despite the fact a key piece of evidence in 
the Feb. 24, 1989, incident remains three miles under water: Flight 811's cargo 
door. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said United failed to properly inspect the door after its electrical 
system failed in December, 1988, and mechanics had to operate it manually. The 
door had been operated electrically since then, however. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration were cited for failing to order 
timely corrective measures after another cargo door partially popped open on a 
1987 Pan American jet flying from London to New York. That plane returned 
safely to London. 
</P>
<P>
On Flight 811, the door ripped off at 22,000 feet. A piece of the fuselage was 
ripped off and the passengers and their seats were sucked out through the hole 
in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, en route to New Zealand, returned to Honolulu. Five other passengers 
were seriously hurt and 33 had minor injuries. The plane carried a crew of 18 
and 337 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
United spokesman Robert Dowdy said the airline had complied with all FAA 
requirements except in one instance. That occurred after six words mandating an 
inspection were left out of an FAA regulation when it was copied into the 
company's system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dowdy said that despite the oversight, the door had undergone three inspections 
since the December, 1988, problem was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the board has done a good job with the evidence and data available," 
Dowdy said, adding that a better investigation and probable cause could be 
determined if the door is recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable cause of the 
incident could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the company had no comment on the 
NTSB finding "except to say we feel, No. 1, those cargo doors are safe." 
</P>
<P>
"There were subsequent changes made as a result of the accident, changes and 
inspection processes. All of the necessary actions have been taken to ensure 
integrity of that door's operation in flight," Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
The board said the current cargo door system on 747s can indicate to the pilot 
that the door is locked when it is not. That's expected to be changed with an 
imminent FAA order that would require detectors on the locks, said Ron Schleed, 
investigator in charge for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Schleed said efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from the ocean would 
continue. He said a Navy vessel and sophisticated probe device would be 
available in June to conduct a search that would be limited to about two weeks.

HUNGARIAN PATRIOTISM CARRIED CONSERVATIVES TO VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: PRIDE AND NOSTALGIA WON OVER VOTERS. BUT THE RULING FORUM STILL FACES 
A STRONG LEFTIST OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT.

<P>
The politics of national pride that carried Joszef Antall and his Hungarian 
Democratic Forum to victory reflect a conservative sweep across Eastern Europe 
as Moscow's former satellites realign themselves toward the West. 
</P>
<P>
But the center-right Forum's success in striking an anti-leftist chord in an 
electorate long suppressed by socialism may prove difficult to duplicate among 
the strong liberal and leftist opposition it will face in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Radio announced Tuesday that the nation's first democratically 
elected legislature will convene May 7 or 8 to swear in the next prime 
minister, widely expected to be Antall, and a new Cabinet to replace the 
Socialist caretakers who won less than 10% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist parties that had dominated Eastern Europe since the end of World 
War II suffered similarly in elections in Poland last year and in East Germany 
last month, showing a pronounced desire among the newly liberated to break with 
the ideology of the left. Conservative parties are also expected to do well in 
Romania and Czechoslovakia when free elections are held there later this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians were swept by the rightist tide, but their reasons for choosing the 
Forum and its even more conservative allies differ somewhat from those in other 
states recently cut loose from the Kremlin's tether. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian conservatives won favor by stirring up nostalgia for the agrarian 
past and feelings of national pride that were stifled under communism. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed their strongest support in rural regions, especially in the 
eastern part of the country, where promises of land reform and a return to 
"Christian democracy" appealed to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar workers also preferred the party led by Antall, a stern but 
fatherly figure who advocates a measured reform pace that may prevent or delay 
mass unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Among Hungarian intellectuals and professionals, however, the Forum raises 
concern about a rise of nationalism that could touch off further ethnic 
conflicts abroad like the mid-March clashes with Romanians in Transylvania that 
killed at least eight and injured hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Antall told a cheering crowd Monday that his government will champion the 
causes of 15 million Hungarians, referring to the ethnic minorities in 
neighboring countries as well as the 10.5 million who live in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both the Forum and the Free Democrats, who finished a distant 
second in the vote, have promised to bury the campaign hatchet and work 
together for the good of a democratic Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"All those passions and feelings of injury and hurt and insult will belong to 
the past, and those who have come out as winners can behave moderately from 
their victorious position," Antall told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the best of intentions, the parties have emerged from a hotly contested 
and often negative election battle with wounds and grudges that may need more 
than words to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Free Democratic opponents charged that Forum candidates engaged in a smear 
campaign against them which they said took on an anti-Semitic tone at times. 
</P>
<P>
Several election posters depicting Free Democratic leader Janos Kis and other 
Jewish candidates were defaced with swastikas, and deputy Forum leader Istvan 
Csurka was accused of making openly anti-Semitic remarks during campaign 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Antall and other Forum leaders have denied that any anti-Jewish sentiment 
permeates their party. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary election results show the Forum with 165 seats and its likely 
coalition partners, the Independent Smallholders Party and the Christian 
Democrats, with 43 and 21 mandates respectively. That gives the 
coalition-in-the-making a comfortable majority in the 386-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
(The release of official final results will be delayed by voting irregularities 
in several districts, Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral 
Committee, told reporters Tuesday. An announcement of final results had been 
expected by Tuesday. Nemeth said they would be released later, but did not say 
when. He said the irregularities would be investigated.) 
</P>
<P>
The conservative alliance that Antall said Tuesday would take at least a couple 
of weeks to iron out will face a sizable, if fragmented, opposition force. 
</P>
<P>
The left-leaning Alliance of Free Democrats will have 92 deputies, their allied 
youth group Fidesz 21 and the Socialists 33. 
</P>
<P>
Antall's party advocates a slow but sure pace of reform to bring about a market 
economy without inflicting too many hardships on the nation already suffering 
20% annual inflation and rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Antall, 58, rose from virtual obscurity to head Hungary's new political 
vanguard on the strength of his role in talks last year between the Socialist 
government and opposition groups, which ushered in the peaceful transition to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
He was courted by the Small-holders and the Christian Democrats for their party 
leaderships, but chose to head the Forum's election drive because he said it 
best combined Hungarian patriotism, economic liberalism and Christian values. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders, whose support is vital to the Forum's effort to control 
Parliament, appear eager to play a role in government. Party leaders said they 
expect to be given the Agriculture Ministry among its Cabinet assignments, to 
make good on a campaign promise of land reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only meet these promises if we take part in the government," 
Smallholders campaign manager Joszef Torgyan told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Antall said the two parties basically agreed on land policy but that details of 
the plan were among the issues that would take a few weeks to resolve in 
coalition talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders have proposed restoration of private property according to 
1947 land registers, but the Forum and other parties have deemed their idea 
unworkable.

SOVIET PARTY'S TOP LEADERS CRITICIZE RADICAL REFORMERS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNISTS: AN 'OPEN LETTER' INSISTS ON GREATER POLITICAL DISCIPLINE. IT CALLS 
FOR EXPULSION OF THOSE FORMING FACTIONS.

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party's top leadership sharply criticized radical 
reformers within the party Tuesday, accusing them of dividing it into factions 
and undermining its authority, and it called for their ouster in what some of 
them fear could become a purge of liberals. 
</P>
<P>
The principal target of the attack is the six-month-old Democratic Platform, 
which groups many of the party's most original and radical thinkers and which 
was campaigning from within for the party's transformation, but the far right 
could also be included in the likely dismissals of dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
In an "open letter" to the country's 18.8 million Communist Party members, the 
leadership called for the expulsion of those who are "working toward a split 
and creating organizationally formed factions within the party, who reject the 
Soviet people's socialist choice, who by their views and conduct have actually 
placed themselves outside the party." 
</P>
<P>
Read at the outset of the evening news on Soviet television Tuesday and 
published in the central Soviet newspapers today, the letter undoubtedly 
heralds a period of intense political struggle before a pivotal party congress 
planned for early July. 
</P>
<P>
The declared goal is to purify the party's ranks and to insist on greater 
political discipline from its members. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the delegates to the congress are convinced Communists," 
the letter said, reflecting the fears of top leaders that the party could split 
at the congress itself. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, addressing delegates to the Communist Youth 
League's congress here, sought to assure the country that this is not the start 
of a purge in the old Stalinist sense, for the campaign would be carried on 
through review of individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev argued that perestroika, or restructuring, as his program of 
political, economic and social reforms is known, has become virtually a 
revolution. Thus, he contended, the country needs a much stronger party, all of 
whose members would be committed to its goals. 
</P>
<P>
But Vyacheslav Shostokovsky, rector of the Moscow Higher Party School and a 
leader of the Democratic Platform, said the campaign would be shaped almost 
entirely by local and regional party officials, most of whom are still 
conservatives, and that for this reason he feared that it would become a purge 
of liberals. 
</P>
<P>
"This unties the hands of party functionaries on the spot to get rid of those 
members who, through their ideas and the support they consequently win, have 
become the most powerful critics of the party," Shostokovsky said in an 
interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he is among those likely to be forced to choose between his 
political principles and continued party membership, Shostokovsky predicted 
that many of those forced out would seek to form their own left-of-center 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Platform had already recruited about 60,000 supporters in 162 
branches in 102 Soviet cities, according to its organizers, who were predicting 
last week that their expulsion, when it came, would bring it even greater 
backing from within and outside the party. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted by the party's ruling Politburo, endorsed by members of the Central 
Committee and reviewed by regional first secretaries, the letter represents a 
considerable political victory for Yegor K. Ligachev, the senior Politburo 
member who supports traditional beliefs within the party's top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev had spoken out forcefully during last month's Central Committee 
meeting for such a "cleansing" and "demarcation" to restore party discipline 
and revive its past strength. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, as published, is said to be more conciliatory on some points than 
the first draft. While many conservatives within the leadership applauded the 
original letter, a number of local party leaders argued forcefully for clear 
limits on who would be asked to leave, according to informed political sources, 
and the final letter was said to be rewritten to make it softer. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Democratic Platform and other radicals, the letter said, "Under 
the banner of perestroika, some party members unleashed a struggle within the 
party with pseudo-radical positions," and that the Democratic Platform 
specifically "lacks answers on the principal questions our society is concerned 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The party leadership objects most strongly to the Democratic Platform's 
attempts to organize a small party within the larger party's ranks and to 
efforts to make it a federal party in which each of the Soviet Union's 
constituent republics would have an independent Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Such moves, the letter said, would quickly weaken the party and ultimately 
bring its breakup. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Platform, organized initially in Moscow last October and as a 
national group since January, has been campaigning for the transformation of 
the Communist Party into one based on parliamentary politics -- and one that 
would have a liberal philosophy close to that of Europe's Social Democrats.

SOVIETS SEEK WEST'S TECHNOLOGY TO SPEED FREE-MARKET REFORM

<P>
The Soviet Union made a strong pitch Tuesday for Western help in its 
free-market reform by asking for talks to ease restrictions on the sale of high 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan Sitaryan, chairman of the State Foreign Economic Commission, said such 
Western limits "should no longer remain a sacred cow." 
</P>
<P>
Sitaryan also hailed an international accord, reached Monday in Bonn, that 
commits the Soviets to backing free-market economic reform. He said the pact 
conforms to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program, known as 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the Bonn document . . . 
have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the Soviet Union," Sitaryan 
said in a speech to the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. The conference ends today. 
</P>
<P>
Sitaryan said the West's so-called COCOM restrictions on high-technology sales 
to Eastern Europe present "certain complications" to restructuring the Soviet 
economy. COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose that East-West consultations begin on rules to govern the transfer 
of dual-purpose technology," Sitaryan told reporters after his speech, 
referring to products and equipment that can be used for civilian or military 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet Union is willing to agree to inspection procedures so the 
West can verify that high-technology equipment is not being used for military 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The COCOM nations are already working on proposals for loosening restrictions 
on technology sales to reforming East Bloc countries. However, the United 
States has indicated it will take a tougher stand toward the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's pact, the 35 nations at the conference -- the United States, Canada 
and all European countries except Albania -- informally endorsed a document 
committing them to support private property, free enterprise and multi-party 
democracy.

Nelson R. Mandela will lead an 11-member African National Congress delegation 
in groundbreaking talks next month with the government on ending white-minority 
rule, the organization said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the May 2-4 talks, Mandela will embark on a series of foreign trips to at 
least nine countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union and several 
African and European nations, the ANC said. 
</P>
<P>
Next month's discussions are designed to clear the way for formal negotiations 
on a new constitution that will give the 28-million black majority a share of 
power in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that this meeting achieve the necessary results in terms of 
removing the obstacles that continue to stand in the way of negotiations," the 
ANC said in a statement from its exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has said those obstacles include lifting the 1986 state of emergency, 
allowing exiles to return to South Africa and releasing anti-apartheid 
activists convicted of politically motivated crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The government, which had previously announced the dates for the talks, has 
made clear that several black opposition groups in addition to the ANC will be 
invited to take part in the formal negotiations on a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The talks originally were set for today, but the ANC called off that meeting to 
protest a March 26 police shooting that left at least 11 protesters dead in 
Sebokeng.

RECORD EXPOSURE OF WORKERS TO RADIATION CITED -- AND DISPUTED

A consumer advocacy group said Tuesday that more nuclear power plant workers 
than ever before were exposed to measurable radiation in 1988, the last year 
for which data was available. But the data was disputed by both the federal 
government and the nuclear industry. 
</P>
<P>
The study by an energy research project of Public Citizen said that 105,265 
instances of worker exposure to measurable radiation occurred at the nation's 
107 commercial nuclear reactors that year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest number of incidents of worker exposure ever recorded by 
the U.S. commercial nuclear power industry," the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
It said its study, based on documents from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
found 104,511 such incidents in 1987 and 100,992 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of exposure incidents nationwide was up in 1988, the number 
per plant is decreasing steadily, said Joseph Fouchard, a spokesman for the 
commission. There were 98 plants operating in 1987, nine fewer than the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
"With respect to worker exposure to radiation at nuclear power plants, we 
believe it has been steadily improving," Fouchard said. "We believe the 
situation is getting better." 
</P>
<P>
The industry-sponsored Council of Energy Awareness, in a written response to 
the report, said that "the total number of exposed individuals increased only 
because, according to Public Citizen's figures, there were 10 more nuclear 
energy plants in operation than the year before." 
</P>
<P>
"Their own numbers show that in 1988, the year on which they report, the number 
of workers per plant who were exposed to any measurable radiation declined to 
an all-time low, down 22% in the five-year period, 1984-1988," said the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Each exposed worker in 1988 received an average radiation dose of 0.390 
person-rem, which Public Citizen said was roughly equivalent to 20 chest 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
The exposure could lead to significantly increased risk for radiation-caused 
cancers among the workers and genetic damage to their children, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on both sides agree that the greatest exposure of workers occurs during 
reactor maintenance work, mostly on older reactors.

Three Northwest Airlines crew members accused of flying while intoxicated 
pleaded not guilty in federal court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd set a trial date of June 11 for Capt. Norman 
Prouse of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert Kirchner of Highland Ranch, Colo., 
and flight engineer Joseph Balzer of Antioch, Tenn. U.S. District Judge James 
Rosenbaum will preside at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The crew members were arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport on March 8 
after a dawn flight from Fargo, N.D. They were accused of drinking at a Fargo 
bar late the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest fired the three, and the Federal Aviation Administration revoked 
their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Felony indictments for operating a common carrier under the influence of 
alcohol were returned April 4 against Prouse, Kirchner and Balzer. A single 
trial is scheduled, although Balzer's attorney said he would try to get his 
client a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
The three face misdemeanor charges in North Dakota and are scheduled to appear 
in Cass County Court in Fargo on Thursday.

Ann Richards, the Texas state treasurer who gained national prominence with a 
sarcastic keynote attack on George Bush at the 1988 Democratic convention, 
scored a resounding victory over Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox in the state's 
Democratic gubernatorial runoff election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With 90% of the precincts reporting, Richards had 571,742 votes, or 56.2%, to 
Mattox's 445,403, or 43.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The vote ended one of the nastiest campaigns in Texas history. Richards never 
trailed as the election results rolled in Tuesday night in her race against 
Mattox, whom she had called the "garbage politician of Texas." She is the first 
woman to win the Democratic nomination since Miriam (Ma) Ferguson did so in 
1932. Ferguson went on to win the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Richards will face Republican candidate Clayton Williams Jr., a political 
neophyte whose folksy cowboy-millionaire image swept him to victory in the 
April primary over his more experienced rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has said he would be more uncomfortable facing a woman and Republican 
strategists have said Richards could be a more formidable opponent than Mattox 
in the fall general election. Among other things, she will be able to take 
advantage of a Williams gaffe in which he said ugly weather was like a rape: 
"If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it." He later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
In her victory speech, Richards told a group of supporters in Austin that it 
had "been a very long, hard race" that she compared to a demolition derby. At 
the same time, Mattox vowed to close ranks within the party and work to help 
Richards defeat Williams in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings about the principals of the Democratic Party are far deeper than 
my own ambitions," he told Austin supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mattox and Richards had pledged to run a clean campaign, but the promise 
was hardly out of their mouths when the contest was reduced to a name-calling 
match virtually devoid of any discussion of issues. 
</P>
<P>
Most vocal was Mattox, a man known to run no-holds-barred campaigns throughout 
his political career. He launched his attack early on, insinuating at first 
that Richards had been a user of illegal drugs 10 years ago before she 
underwent treatment for alcoholism. He ran television ads asking, but not 
answering, the question of whether she had used drugs and challenged Richards 
to produce her medical treatment records to prove that she was treated only for 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the closing days of the campaign, he accused Richards outright of 
having once been a cocaine addict. He also said he had affidavits from people 
who saw her use illegal drugs. Yet he never made the affidavits public. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Richards compared Mattox on the last day of the campaign to a 
"chicken-eating dog" who needed to be broken of his bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, she accused Mattox of hiding his true personal income and 
chided him for refusing to make public his income tax returns, as she had done. 
In television commercials, she pointed out that Mattox had been indicted in 
1983 on bribery charges, but failed to mention that he had been acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
She also called into question his receiving $200,000 in a land deal from a man 
now under indictment on racketeering charges. Like Mattox, she offered no proof 
that her opponent had actually done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The runoff followed a bitter three-way primary fight in which neither Richards 
nor Mattox gained a majority. Richards dealt a blow to former Gov. Mark White 
in the primary, accusing him of lining his pockets while in office. After being 
eliminated in the primary, White accused Richards of using Gestapo tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the campaign surprised even the most jaded observers of Texas 
politics, which has long been known as a place where political campaigns are 
bare-knuckle scraps. Pollster Richard Murray said he would have believed the 
usually tough Democratic primary would have moved in the direction of 
moderation in view of the fact that Republicans were gaining ground in what was 
once an essentially one party state. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the learning curve has flattened out," he said. The intensity of the 
campaign was expected to weaken the party as it faced the general election 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
George Christian, former White House press secretary and now a political 
consultant in Austin, called the Richards-Mattox battle the worst he had seen 
since the advent of television advertising and he said the news media was to 
blame, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
"The press was more apt to print unsubstantiated charges that were thrown 
around," he said. "I think the press was used more by all the campaigns than 
I've ever seen it."

Ann Richards, the Texas state treasurer who gained national prominence with a 
sarcastic keynote attack on George Bush at the 1988 Democratic Convention, 
edged into an early lead over Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox in the state's Democratic 
gubernatorial runoff election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Richards and Mattox fought bitterly to win the chance to face Republican 
candidate Clayton Williams Jr., a political neophyte whose folksy 
cowboy-millionaire image swept him to victory in the April primary over his 
more experienced rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has said he would be more uncomfortable facing a woman and Republican 
strategists have said Richards could be a more formidable opponent than Mattox 
in the gubernatorial face-off. 
</P>
<P>
With 4% of the vote counted, Richards was leading with 74,594 votes, or 55%, 
compared to 60,025, or 45%, for Mattox. Many of the early votes counted were in 
urban areas, where much of Richards' strength lies. 
</P>
<P>
The contest between Richards and Mattox was one of the nastiest in Texas 
history. Both candidates pledged to run a clean campaign, but the promise was 
hardly out of their mouths when the contest was reduced to a name-calling match 
virtually devoid of any discussion of issues.

<P>
"The press was more apt to print unsubstantiated charges that were thrown 
around," he said. "I think the press was used more by all the campaigns than 
I've ever seen it." 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll published Sunday in the Houston Chronicle, Richards was 
given a slight lead over Mattox, despite what was commonly described by 
political observers here as a poorly-run campaign in which she allowed Mattox' 
bulldozer approach to set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
"She allowed others to control the agenda of the campaign," said State Lands 
Commissioner Garry Mauro. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom was that Richards would carry the large population centers, 
with the upscale city voters as her core of support, while Mattox would tap his 
strength in rural East and South Texas. But the race was so close on election 
day that even bad weather in a major metropolitan area could have turned the 
tide. On Tuesday, both candidates were keeping a wary eye on the weather.

ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS ASKED TO CONSERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to drought warnings from state water officials, the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution urging 
residents to voluntarily cut water consumption by at least 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution urges water suppliers to push conservation proposals and asks 
restaurants to post notices telling patrons that water will be served only to 
those who ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county does not have authority to enact mandatory water 
restrictions, Tuesday's resolution is accompanied by a list of 10 water-saving 
hints. Among other things, residents are asked to avoid watering during hot 
parts of the day, to install pool covers and to avoid hosing down driveways and 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote came in response to a meeting last week at which 
water-conservation officials appeared before the board and asked the county to 
take some action. 
</P>
<P>
The state is in the fourth year of a drought, and even though Orange County 
sits on a large underground lake that helps buffer it from shortages, officials 
of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California urged the county to 
join in the state's efforts to curtail usage.

SOLDIER'S DESCENDANT FIGHTING FOR A CAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL WAR: A RETIRED ATTORNEY SAYS HIS GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A MEMBER OF ONE 
OF NATION'S FIRST ALL-BLACK REGIMENTS, WAS DENIED HIS PAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Charles Johnson is looking for glory. Not for himself, but for the 
great-great-grandfather who was killed while serving as an unpaid Civil War 
soldier in one of America's first all-black Army regiments. 
</P>
<P>
One such regiment was portrayed in "Glory," the Oscar-winning movie about black 
Union troops who rejected their monthly wages because they were less than the 
$14 paid to white soldiers. The "Glory" troops who survived the battle of Ft. 
Morgan eventually got paid. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says his great-great-grandfather -- who died Nov. 30, 1864, in the 
Battle of Honey Hill, South Carolina -- did not. 
</P>
<P>
So Johnson has written the President and two congressmen seeking the $237 that 
he says was earned by his ancestor -- plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
With compounded interest figured at 6% annually, the 125-year-old debt could 
reach as high as $345,000, a Bank of America official said. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson, 68, a retired Pasadena attorney, said he is driven by principle 
and doubts that he will see any money. 
</P>
<P>
"This man died for his country," Johnson said of Emory Allen, his forefather 
slain at the age of 40. "He was a free black man with a farm and a tinsmith 
business. He left behind a family and a wife carrying a child he would never 
see. He had to really want to fight for something he loved. And I want that to 
be known." 
</P>
<P>
In his request to President Bush, Johnson mailed his proof: copies of Allen's 
enlistment and death notifications that indicate he received only $14 worth of 
clothing, and a letter signed by 74 black soldiers, including Allen, and sent 
to President Lincoln, demanding the same $14 monthly pay as white soldiers. 
Obtained from the National Archives in Washington, the letter was written from 
Folly Island, South Carolina, and dated July 16, 1864. 
</P>
<P>
"We the members of company D of the 55th Massachusetts Volunteers call the 
attention of your excellency to our case," it begins. 
</P>
<P>
". . . We have been in the field now 13 months, and a great many yet longer. We 
have received no pay and have been offered only $7 per month, which the 
paymaster has said was all he had been authorized to pay colored troops. This 
was not according to our enlistment. Consequently we refused the money." 
</P>
<P>
At a later date, according to the letter, Congress passed a law equalizing the 
pay but a bureaucratic mixup continued to prevent the troops' payment. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Sir . . . to us, money is not the object," the soldiers wrote. "We came 
to fight for liberty, justice and equality. These are gifts we prize more 
highly than gold. For these we left our homes, our families, friends and 
relatives." 
</P>
<P>
The letter concluded with the soldiers saying they had risked their lives "to 
do battle for God and liberty," but they sought immediate discharge if not 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no presidential response to Johnson's letter, dated March 
12. A White House spokeswoman said there would be no comment on the letter 
because "correspondence to the President is considered private." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also wrote to U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, whose Los Angeles office has 
asked the U.S. Army to investigate the claim. The Army has no comment on 
Cranston's request because "correspondence, even from a senator, is considered 
private in nature," said Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear which government agency would handle Johnson's request. It also 
is unclear whether such a request is subject to a statute of limitations -- and 
if payment is due, the interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Would inflation be factored in? Would the dollar's present-day value or the 
Confederate value be used? There are so many variables," said Dave Reed, vice 
president and manager of the Bank of America's South Pasadena branch, who 
consulted several bankers before trying to figure out what Johnson might be 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figured it at 6% . . . it could be up to $345,000," said Reed, who was 
contacted by The Times. "It's kind of mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he does not know what the interest rate would be, but the statute 
of limitations issue rankles him. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can pay the Japanese reparation for the offenses we committed against 
them by putting them in camps during World War II," he said, "I think the 
government can pay my grandfather's heirs. He fought for this country. I'm 
fighting for what I think is right. This (claim) may not fall into a statute of 
limitations, but it would be the just thing to do to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
In his lawyering days, Johnson handled plenty of civil rights cases. He was 
among several attorneys who won decisions in the 1970s to desegregate Pasadena 
public schools. In the 1970s, he worked to help preserve affirmative-action 
programs for minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been active in local chapters of the NAACP and is still involved 
with private community mentor programs for black students. He has, in the words 
of Pasadena Mayor William Thomson, been "a prominent and respected member of 
the community for years." 
</P>
<P>
His interest in Emory Allen began as a child in Michigan, where his family had 
"begats" at the breakfast table. "Begats are like in the Bible, so-and-so begat 
so-and-so. My family's history and a sense of identity were kept alive this 
way," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The most fascinating ancestor of all, Johnson said, was Emory Allen. His mother 
had his wallet and his sword, which was hidden behind the living room couch. 
She regaled her children with family folklore about Allen and other relatives. 
About 20 years ago, Johnson decided to find his roots and went in search of 
documents about him. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lincoln letter was actually discovered by another relative earlier this 
year after "Glory" opened at movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought these soldiers were portrayed as heroes when they were really stupid 
fools, and victims sent to slaughter," Johnson said. "But I felt it would be a 
timely claim to file seeking the back wages for my grandfather."

MOVE TO OUST WOOD AS HEAD OF CRA FAILS IN CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A move to oust the head of the Community Redevelopment Agency failed Tuesday 
when the Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly to endorse Mayor Tom 
Bradley's reappointment of James Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who has chaired the CRA's board since 1984, had become a focal point for 
dissatisfaction with the agency's emphasis on downtown development. Wood has 
been a member of the board since 1977 and has helped bring about a dramatic 
rebirth of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have complained that the rebirth has gone too far, 
aggravating traffic and air pollution problems while ignoring other segments of 
the city. But in an 11-3 vote, the council rejected a committee recommendation 
that Wood's reappointment to a four-year term on the board be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Wood told reporters the council action was an endorsement of his leadership and 
said, "The future of downtown is continued responsible development." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the skirmish was a message to slow downtown development, Wood said, 
"No. I believe the message is exactly the opposite. . . . The City Council 
accepted its responsibility for the plans it approved." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, some council members have been openly at odds with Wood 
and other CRA officials, whom they have accused of being less than open about 
the activities of the huge agency, which oversees an annual budget of $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the council gave itself greater control over the CRA, but stopped 
short of a complete takeover. Last week, after a contentious meeting, the 
council's Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee voted 2 to 1 against 
Wood's reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, at a relatively tame council meeting, Wood was praised by many 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre said that all great cities depend on the 
development of a core. "Without that core, without that vitality, we have no 
city," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has overseen the development of downtown and directed the CRA over 
the years, Alatorre said. "Ultimately we have to share the blame if, in fact, 
the direction of the CRA is not now, all of a sudden, the direction that we 
would like to move in." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, whose district includes downtown, called Wood "a 
heavenly saint" and one of the most outstanding citizens of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had a crown," Lindsay said. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not as kind. 
</P>
<P>
"We need new leadership at the CRA," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who 
chairs the committee that voted against Wood. "What we're seeing here is a 
future of more and more development and that development is all going downtown 
without the appropriate mitigation. . . . What we're talking about is the 
future of the city of Los Angeles. . . . The issue is responsible growth." 
</P>
<P>
Molina voted against the confirmation, as did Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and 
Ernani Bernardi. Councilman Nate Holden was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most stinging criticism came from Yaroslavsky, who said the agency 
has "failed miserably." 
</P>
<P>
"This agency has done some great things in the 1960s and '70s. In the 1980s, I 
think it kind of lost its mission. 
</P>
<P>
"It kindled the flame of redevelopment downtown, and by 1980 or '85 we should 
have declared victory and gone on to deal with some of the other problems that 
have plagued the downtown area . . . such as homelessness and poor people."

MAN ACCUSED IN SILBERMAN CASE PLEADS GUILTY TO CRIMINAL COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Ziegler, a Los Angeles-area investment broker accused of taking part in a 
money-laundering scheme with San Diego businessman Richard Silberman, pleaded 
guilty Tuesday to one criminal count, the first resolution of any charges 
connected to the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea bargain, Ziegler, indicted on five counts related to the alleged 
scheme to launder $300,000, pleaded guilty to a single charge of structuring 
the transfer of funds to avoid filing the paper work that federal law demands 
for any transaction over $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler also agreed to forfeit his share of the cash, stocks and bonds that 
federal prosecutors contend were central to the scheme. In exchange, 
prosecutors dropped the other four charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of Ziegler's plea bargain came as U.S. District Judge J. 
Lawrence Irving denied a defense request to move Silberman's upcoming trial out 
of San Diego. The judge rejected -- at least until he has questioned 
prospective jurors -- the claim by Silberman that he could not get a fair trial 
here because of intense publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti, Ziegler and two other men have been 
accused of laundering $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI agent allegedly 
characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 60, is due to stand trial on April 25. The remaining three 
defendants are scheduled for trial on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark in Ventura County, was added to the case in October, 
six months after the original indictment named Silberman, Petti and two Los 
Angeles men -- Jack Norman Myers and Darryl Nakatsuka -- in the scheme. All but 
Petti, who is in a federal prison after his probation on a bookmaking 
conviction was revoked, are free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler had faced a maximum penalty of 35 years in federal prison and $1.75 
million in fines on the five original charges. 
</P>
<P>
Through the plea agreement, he faces a 
</P>
<P>
maximum of five years in prison -- followed by two or three years of probation 
-- and up to a $250,000 fine, Irving said. Ziegler is scheduled to be sentenced 
on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-page plea agreement filed Tuesday in federal court in San Diego, 
Ziegler admitted that he received $45,000 in cash in November, 1988, from Myers 
and Nakatsuka. Prosecutors allege the $45,000 was part of $100,000 delivered by 
the undercover agent, the first of two deals involving a total of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of transactions he directed that broke the $45,000 into 
various sums less than $10,000, Ziegler deposited the cash into a San Fernando 
Valley thrift account to which he had access, according to the plea agreement. 
Then, it said, he wired the money to a bank account in Hong Kong that 
prosecutors contend was controlled by Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I was doing was a violation of the law," Ziegler told Irving in a 
brief hearing Tuesday confirming the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The $45,000 that Ziegler wired to Hong Kong eventually made its way to a Swiss 
bank account, along with most of the rest of the $100,000, which got there 
through various other channels, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 deal involved a swap of money for stock in a Silberman gold mining 
company, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped charges against Ziegler relating 
to the second deal in the alleged money-laundering plan, a February, 1989, 
exchange of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. According to prosecutors, Ziegler 
arranged for the bond purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also allege that the bond deal hit a snag when Myers told Silberman 
that Ziegler had changed his fee and would not produce the correct number of 
bonds. Silberman asked Petti for help in collecting the rest of the money from 
the bond transaction, prosecutors claim. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
declined to comment Tuesday on the plea agreement or to speculate on the 
possibility that Ziegler would become a government witness against Silberman. 
In a brief filed Tuesday, Ziegler's name was not among 33 witnesses prosecutors 
said they expect to call at Silberman's trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision to deny Silberman's request to move the trial out of San 
Diego followed a hearing Tuesday morning at which defense lawyer James 
Brosnahan said pretrial publicity was so pervasive that a fair trial in the 
local courts was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
A March survey commissioned by the defense team found that 89% of the eligible 
jurors in the San Diego area were "familiar" with the Silberman case, Brosnahan 
said. On Tuesday morning, when Brosnahan and Silberman stopped at a coffee 
shop, the lawyer said, "six people recognized (Silberman)." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol C. Lam said the survey was "nothing more than a lot 
of smoke and a lot of mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "We are reduced to listening to Mr. Brosnahan's report of how many 
people said hello to his client at breakfast. That is not enough to (move the 
case)." 
</P>
<P>
In a written decision issued late Tuesday, Irving said publicity about the case 
had so far not been so damaging to Silberman that he had to transfer it. But 
before making a final decision, he said, he wanted to question prospective 
jurors to see if the San Diego metropolitan area could produce 12 open-minded 
people.

UTILITY MERGER RAISES FEARS OF IMPACT OF L.A. SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city administrators and air quality officials expressed concern 
Tuesday about a state report that says if San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
merges with Southern California Edison Corp., Los Angeles' pollution could have 
an immediate impact on San Diego's skies. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report, released by the state Public Utilities 
Commission on Monday, found that the merger would significantly increase Los 
Angeles' smog. The increase in pollution, however, could be offset in part by 
using San Diego-area power plants when smog alerts forced a slowdown at plants 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, bridled at the 
implied linking of San Diego and Los Angeles' fate. The use of San Diego as a 
backstop, he said, would place the city where it doesn't want to be -- squarely 
in the shadow of its larger and more polluted northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"This has long been a fight for local control over our utility's future. But 
this (suggestion) takes it a step further and links us environmentally to 
what's happening in L.A.," Downey said, adding that under a merger, "basically 
San Diego would become a suburb of Los Angeles and would be subjected to the 
whims of (Edison's) bureaucrats sitting up in Rosemead. It's saying, 'If L.A. 
has a smoggy day, so will San Diego.' " 
</P>
<P>
Downey was among several politicians and air quality advocates in San Diego and 
Los Angeles who expressed renewed opposition Tuesday to the proposed 
$2.5-billion merger, which would create the nation's largest utility company 
with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Some agencies, including the South Coast Air Quality Management District in Los 
Angeles County, reserved comment until they could fully examine the 900-page 
report. But others said the report's highlights alone supported their worst 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Goggin, a spokesman for the San Diego County air pollution control 
district, agreed with Downey that the potential shift of electricity production 
to San Diego to avoid tougher air quality rules in Los Angeles could have 
undesirable effects. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that permits issued to San Diego plants in the 1970s allow them 
to burn dirtier fuel -- oil instead of natural gas. In addition, Goggin warned, 
San Diego plants currently operate at only 38% of the capacity they are 
allowed. The fear is that, if a merger took place, Edison could legally stoke 
up San Diego's plants to full capacity on smoggy Los Angeles days. 
</P>
<P>
"They have under their permits the ability to increase (use) and use less clean 
fuels," Goggin said. "If that were to take place, it would require tighter 
restriction on other industry. It lays it on everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials deny that this could happen, arguing it is in their own 
economic interest to boost operations at Los 
</P>
<P>
Angeles plants, not at the older, less efficient San Diego plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil is more costly than gas, so we wouldn't use oil instead of gas if gas were 
available," said Lewis M. Phelps, a vice president at Edison, who said San 
Diego plants "would never have to run more than they do now." He repeated his 
claim that the merger would be "environmentally positive." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Soto, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air, 
disagreed. He said a merger would be "a disaster" for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very inconsistent with local policy and it's certainly inconsistent with 
the goals of the 20-year plan," Soto said, referring to the far-reaching 
clean-air plan that aims to bring the four-county Los Angeles Basin into 
compliance with federal standards by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Soto noted that just last year, when Edison said it would be prohibitively 
expensive to meet certain pollution control deadlines imposed by the plan, the 
South Coast district granted the utility a seven-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the draft report has suggested that pollution resulting from the 
merger could be mitigated in part by speeding up schedules that require air 
pollution controls at power plants. Given Edison's prior stance, Soto called 
this prediction unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are (Edison officials) going to not have to meet the standards that 
everyone has to meet, but now they're going to cause a possible increase in 
emissions," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said that Edison has not yet had time to sufficiently analyze the 
report's suggested mitigation measures. 
</P>
<P>
Auto emissions are the major source of air pollution in Southern California, 
but in their respective regions, SDG&amp;E and Edison are among the largest 
emitters of stationary pollution.

COURT MAY RELEASE FUNDS TO FRAUD SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: OLEN B. PHILLIPS SEEKS ACCESS TO ABOUT $1,500 IN SEIZED FUNDS TO MAKE 
HIS HOUSE PAYMENT AND TO PAY OTHER BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A small portion of funds frozen last month when the state took over the assets 
of Olen B. Phillips is expected to be released this week so that the embattled 
Thousand Oaks real estate financier can pay the mortgage on his home and other 
personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
According to his attorneys, Phillips, a suspect in the largest alleged fraud 
scheme in Ventura County history, barely has enough money to buy groceries. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Weissman, a court-appointed attorney who has been placed in charge of 
Phillips' holdings, said he will give the businessman access to a bank account 
containing about $1,500 in personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Weissman said he will also meet with Phillips' attorneys to discuss the release 
of other assets -- including $20,000 in United Airlines stock -- which 
attorneys say belongs to Phillips and not investors, as claimed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative date to discuss the issue has been set Thursday in Los Angeles 
County Superior Court, but the dispute could be resolved out of court today, 
Weissman said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Weissman releases the stocks, he said attorneys must prove that the 
stocks were purchased with money from Phillips' salary as a pilot for United 
Airlines, and not with investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard Hoefflin, representing Phillips, said the state was 
overzealous when it seized the holdings -- estimated in the millions -- and now 
the businessman is struggling. He said the state lacks the evidence necessary 
to take over the funds and has violated his client's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the absolute right to get whatever we're going to get him," Hoefflin 
said. "It's absurd that we have to be put through this exercise to release 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
On March 28, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski granted a 
temporary restraining order allowing Phillips' assets -- including 11 
businesses and 48 limited partnerships and investment groups -- to be seized 
and placed under the scrutiny of Weissman. Hoefflin said he will request in 
court April 27 that the restraining order be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"The state went in and threw a pile of documents at the judge, and he issued 
the court order based on invalid information," Hoefflin said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the state Department of Corporations requested the restraining 
order because they said innocent investors were in danger of losing money that 
they had entrusted to Phillips, who had built a multimillion-dollar real estate 
empire in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has not been charged with any crime; investigations are continuing at 
the state, county and federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
According to Alan Weinger, an attorney with the Department of Corporations, 
investigators are trying to find what happened to $40 million in missing funds 
from 2,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
He said Phillips is suspected of defrauding investors in real estate holdings 
he controlled, particularly those who purchased trust deeds or gave the 
50-year-old pilot cash loans in exchange for claims on property. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is also under investigation by the FBI in connection with a massive 
phony loan scheme at Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan, which went out of business in 
1988. Phillips was a stockholder and a director of the now-defunct United 
Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, the parent company of Westlake Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's former president, Steven Smith of Thousand Oaks, pleaded guilty in 
federal court in Los Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud and misapplication 
of bank funds in connection with the case. According to investigators, the 
thrift was apparently making millions of dollars in bogus loans -- some of them 
written to people who never existed -- as part of a scheme to build the largest 
video store chain in the nation. Smith is expected to be sentenced in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles on Monday.

VOTERS RETURN 3 TO OJAI CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Ojai City Council members easily defeated two challengers Tuesday to 
retain their seats after a slow-paced campaign in the county's smallest city. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1,169 of the city's 3,976 registered voters -- 27% -- cast ballots 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The low turnout contrasts with that of two years ago, when 34.7% of the 
registered voters cast ballots in a hotly contested race for two seats on the 
five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest topics in this year's contest were traffic, parking, affordable 
housing, the budget and municipal recycling. The most prominent event of the 
election -- a debate held by the League of Women Voters -- drew fewer than 30 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Nina Shelley, 68, an outspoken opponent of the proposed Weldon 
Canyon landfill site, was reelected to a third four-year term on the council. 
Of the five candidates, Shelley was the biggest vote-getter with 856 votes or 
26.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked hard the last four years," Shelley said in an interview at City Hall 
after the votes were counted. "It takes a little seasoning." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Joseph DeVito, 57, won a second term with 774 votes or 23.7%. Early in 
the campaign, DeVito said the laid-back race was a sign of the confidence that 
the city's voters had in their political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Olsen, who at 40 is the youngest council member, won a second 
term with 815 votes or 24.9%. Olsen, a junior high school vice principal, 
campaigned to build bike and foot trail connections to the county's Ojai Valley 
Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Lawrence O. Jensen, 40, an electrician, failed for a second time to 
win a council seat. In 1986, he lost by only 81 votes. Jensen received 401 
votes Tuesday or 12.3%. Despite his poor showing, Jensen said he may run again 
in 1992, when the other two seats on the council open up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to keep them honest one way or another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Eisner, 45, a political newcomer, garnered 417 votes or 12.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley was endorsed by Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, an environmental group 
that has 700 members in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Ojai said the city's strong economic climate may have 
contributed to the incumbents' success at the polls. Both the city's sales and 
bed tax revenues increased by 10% this fiscal year. In addition, the city 
completed a $1.68-million project last month to strengthen the downtown arcade 
to comply with earthquake safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
During the election, all candidates agreed that the best solution to traffic 
congestion was to expand Ojai's mass transit service provided by a single 
trolley bus. Olsen and DeVito said the service should be provided seven days a 
week instead of six. DeVito said the fare, now 75 cents, should be free. 
Shelley suggested trying free fares during peak traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also agreed on the need to create a curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The city's three polling places were open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDOWNERS CRITICAL OF SATICOY AREA PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saticoy Area Plan approved Tuesday is so restrictive on water use for 
industry that it will be impossible to build on the land that the new plan 
opens for development, local property owners told county supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Using a formula based on historical use of the land now cultivated for 
agriculture, the County Board of Supervisors imposed a limit of just over one 
acre-foot of water for each acre of land. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not an industrial park in the county that could operate with that 
limit," said Chuck Rogers, who represented Saticoy land owners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're taking our freedoms away from us," said Don Whaley of Ventura, who owns 
property zoned for industrial development in Saticoy. The board approved the 
Saticoy Area Plan 4 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which updates a 1967 version, permits 161 new homes and opens for 
industrial development 44 acres of predominantly agricultural land along the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Manager John Baker also argued against the plan, but for different 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He said some provisions of the plan are too lenient because developers would be 
allowed to set up their own mutual water companies to supply water. 
</P>
<P>
That water would be drawn from ground-water supplies, the same underground 
pools that supply the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme and hundreds of 
agricultural pumpers. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing new building in Saticoy is unfair when neighbors in Ventura, who drink 
the same water that Saticoy residents drink, are prohibited from building under 
the city's present moratorium on new water hook-ups, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Ventura should have more control over development in Saticoy since 
Ventura may one day have to provide the water. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny unincorporated community northeast of Ventura is part of Ventura's 
sphere of influence. Because of the four-year statewide drought, the city of 
Ventura is rationing water and has forbidden any new hookups until the water 
shortage eases. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Smith, supervisor in the county Planning Division, said new development 
in the unincorporated Saticoy area is necessary to bring in money from 
developers' fees to upgrade roads, water and sewer services.

CITY DELAYS DECISION ON WATER LIMITS

<P>
The Simi Valley City Council has decided to wait for the Metropolitan Water 
District's assessment of a statewide drought before it decides whether to 
impose mandatory water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday delayed action until after the district's board of 
directors' meeting April 17. 
</P>
<P>
The district, a major supplier of water to Simi Valley and other Ventura County 
cities, has pushed for adoption of mandatory water-saving measures before 
summer to head off increased water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they would prefer to continue the city's voluntary 
water-saving program because it is cheaper and easier to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Vicky Howard, however, said that if necessary, the city could 
implement a series of water conservation recommendations drafted when the city 
faced a drought in the late 1970s. City officials said if approved, the water 
rationing ordinance could be in place within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
MWD's largest Ventura County customer is the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, which serves the cities of Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the water districts cannot force their customers to adopt water 
rationing ordinances, the agencies could substantially increase their water 
rates or limit the flow of water to cities that do not cooperate in 
conservation efforts, said Michael Kleinbrodt, Simi Valley's deputy director of 
public works. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura adopted an ordinance last month that limits water use by 
residential and commercial customers. The ordinance, which goes into effect 
Friday, also places a moratorium on hookups for new construction. CARLOS V.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PHYSICIAN IN CAMARENA CASE PLEADS NOT 
GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mexican physician arrested in the torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique 
Camarena pleaded not guilty to murder charges Tuesday and told a judge in Los 
Angeles, "I want to prove I am a good man" at trial. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered Humberto Alvarez-Machain, 42, a 
gynecologist from Guadalajara, held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was arrested last week in El Paso after he was taken there by Mexican 
law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez will stand trial May 1 along with four other men in custody in 
connection with Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing against bail, Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano said that Alvarez 
was present when Camarena was tortured, and administered a drug to revive the 
agent when he passed out while being interrogated by his captors.

Although Thousand Oaks' 25th anniversary was actually in October, 25 trees are 
being planted in a belated celebration at the interchange of the Moorpark and 
Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the trees were slated by the City Council to be planted during the 
anniversary, but the planting was delayed until the state issued a permit. 
</P>
<P>
The interchange is owned by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The trees will be dedicated as part of the Earth Day ceremonies April 22. 
Thousand Oaks Mayor Fiore and Mayor Pro Tem Frank Schillo will perform the 
ceremony at California Lutheran University, beginning at 10 a.m.

WATERFRONT HOTEL MOVES CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed 41-story luxury hotel between Seaport Village and the San Diego 
Marriott's twin towers moved closer to construction Tuesday. The San Diego 
Unified Port District unanimously backed the project but asked for several 
minor architectural changes. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which last July approved the conceptual plan for the sprawling 
waterfront project, met Tuesday to review design changes prompted by the 
expansion of the site to 5.91 from 4.75 acres when the city realigned Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a pair of complaints from environmental groups, and minor aesthetic 
recommendations from the Port District, the process went smoothly for Doug 
Manchester, president of Torrey Enterprises and chief developer of the project. 
Manchester owns the adjacent San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Manchester argued that, in order to attract the major gatherings of trade 
associations it wants and needs for the new Convention Center to thrive, San 
Diego "demands" the hotel space that would be provided by the Hyatt Regency San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of his architects -- several flew in for the meeting, one from Dallas, the 
others from San Francisco -- said the new Hyatt hotel would be an 
"architectural showplace" for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of several large groups and associations that wanted desperately to 
come here for their conventions but deferred to other cities," Manchester said. 
"The reason is, at the present time, we just don't have the space." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher B. Neils, Manchester's attorney, said Convention Center management 
has indicated it needs at least 2,000 hotel rooms adjacent to the waterfront 
site. Neils said the Marriott now provides 1,400, and the additional rooms 
provided by the Hyatt Regency (about 900), would push San Diego over the 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this project is worth about $60 million to $70 million a year for the 
economy of San Diego, not to mention what it will bring in occupancy taxes and 
new jobs," Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Manchester's presentation, also involving landscapers and attorneys, 
failed to win the commissioners' complete and immediate backing. Commissioner 
Lynn Schenk abstained from voting on the matter, saying only she hoped the 
project was "public friendly" and served the interests of San Diegans as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-0 vote merely endorsed a motion, asking Torrey and its band of architects 
to redesign the 7,000 square feet of retail space, confining it to one building 
instead of the three separate structures now in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners expressed concerns that "undesirables" -- meaning 
transients or homeless persons -- might congregate in the corridors between the 
buildings. They also asked that the retail area be moved back, farther from the 
waterfront. And, finally, they expressed interest in having a trellis cover the 
top of a six-story parking garage to make that structure more aesthetically 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Neils, the attorney, said he hoped construction could begin "within two 
months." Although the hotel is now an 8-year-old undertaking, with Hyatt's 
involvement having reached the six-year mark, Neils said he hoped construction 
would be completed in 28 months. 
</P>
<P>
One person objecting to the project was Judy Collins, a spokeswoman for 
Citizens' Coordinate for Century III. Collins argued that the environmental 
impact report for the project, approved in 1984, is no longer relevant because 
it fails to consider other new construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The EIR considered only this project," Collins said. "We want it to consider 
the Convention Center, the Marriott and the expansion of Seaport Village." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Powell, a spokesman for the Environmental Health Coalition, raised 
questions about the project, saying it fails to address the modern downtown 
concern of "de-watering" -- the ability of new buildings to withstand 
hydrostatic pressure (to resist the intrusion of contaminated underground 
water). 
</P>
<P>
Powell left the meeting dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather have heard an explicit statement from the developers 
saying, 'We're convinced we can handle hydrostatic pressure,' rather than 
several guys looking around and asking, 'Uh, I think it's OK, don't you?' "

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $66,000 FINE PROPOSED FOR MOBIL VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials are proposing a $66,000 fine against Mobil Oil Corp. for 
violations of hazardous waste disposal laws at its Torrance refinery. Mobil has 
not decided whether to accept the penalty or contest it, a company spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors in November found that the company had not disposed of a five-inch 
blanket of caustic soda that was eating through a concrete pad. In addition, a 
pipe was leaking the caustic material onto the ground. Inspectors also found 
that Mobil had sent more than 450 truckloads of dirt contaminated with lead and 
chromium to landfills without analyzing the level of toxicity, as required by 
federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Mobil settled a suit filed by the Department of Health Services, 
agreeing to pay a fine of $125,000 for several other violations and to make up 
to $225,000 in improvements in the handling of hazardous wastes at the 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Violations cited in that case included charges that Mobil had improperly 
disposed of oil-contaminated dirt and lacked adequate space and emergency 
communications equipment in waste storage areas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS BALK AT BACKING HIGHER SALES 
TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors balked Tuesday at endorsing 
legislation to increase the state sales tax, the key element of a proposal to 
raise money for new schools in the Santa Clarita Valley, unless the legislation 
is amended. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) -- which would require approval by 
voters throughout the state -- would boost the sales tax by a quarter-cent per 
dollar and allow property taxes to be raised by a majority of voters instead of 
requiring approval by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the county chief administrative officer said the bill is unfair 
because income from the sales tax increase would go only to school districts 
with booming enrollments, and only to those that increase their property taxes, 
a difficult feat for large districts such as Los Angeles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KAISER EMPLOYEES RETURN TO WORK AFTER 
STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Technicians, maintenance workers and licensed vocational nurses began returning 
to work Tuesday at seven Kaiser Permanente hospitals and 45 clinics in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, ending an eight-day strike. The new contract 
signed by officials of Kaiser and the Service Employees International Union 
Local 399 calls for all workers to return by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A Kaiser spokeswoman said individual hospitals and clinics were making 
decisions on who to call back to work first. Some facilities called all workers 
back on Tuesday. Others gave preference to workers with seniority or made 
decisions on most-needed specialties. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals were only 45% full and doctors were seeing only about 70% of their 
normal patient load Monday when workers voted to accept a new contract offer.

NEW HARBOR DISTRICT CLEARS REQUIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH HARLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 80,000 county residents will soon receive a notice that they have been 
excluded from the Oxnard Harbor District. 
</P>
<P>
The notice is one of the last legal requirements before the district's 
boundaries can be reduced, Port Hueneme City Manager Dick Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
Over strenuous objections from the harbor district, a county agency last month 
voted to reduce district boundaries to the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, 
eliminating Camarillo, portions of Thousand Oaks and unincorporated areas. 
Oxnard and Port Hueneme supported the change. 
</P>
<P>
The public notice will advise residents of the boundary change, which wipes out 
their right to vote for board members. Unless 25% file a protest, triggering an 
election, the decision will become final after a last public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But the bitter, long-running dispute over port boundaries may be revived by the 
port district commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still hoping that the district will not shrink," said board President 
Edward Millan, a resident of Camarillo, who would be barred from seeking 
reelection in November under the decision by the Local Agency Formation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not determined what action we are going to take," Millan said, "but 
you can bet your bottom dollar that we will do what we can." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor District Executive Director Anthony Taormina said that delays are still 
possible in the LAFCO boundary-change process. If Ventura city officials seek 
to have that city included in port boundaries, as they have suggested, the 
process could be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Port attorneys also have said in past weeks that they see grounds for a 
potential lawsuit over LAFCO's decision. JUDITH HARLAN

GOP RIVALS AGREE ON VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
ASSEMBLY: PAULA BOLAND JOINS ROBERT WILCOX IN CALLING FOR THE BREAKUP OF THE 
LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Granada Hills real estate agent seeking the Republican nomination to 
represent the northern San Fernando Valley in the state Assembly said Tuesday 
she plans to pursue a breakup of the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School 
District, moving in on political turf staked out by her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Boland, 50, said that falling test scores and increasing campus violence 
have persuaded her to seek creation of a separate school district for residents 
of the San Fernando Valley, now part of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully intend to do everything in my power to break up the district," said 
Boland, who would not discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
Boland is one of five GOP candidates in the June 5 primary election for the 
seat vacated by Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge). Her chief 
rival, Robert Wilcox, 24, a former La Follette aide, first made a campaign 
issue of favoring Valley secession from the Los Angeles district -- a longtime 
effort by La Follette with which he has been closely associated. 
</P>
<P>
Although members of the Legislature do not have direct jurisdiction over school 
district programs, Boland said she opposes bilingual education, as well as the 
busing of children to Valley schools from more crowded parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Separation of the Valley from the rest of the 610,000-student Los Angeles 
school district gained more support this year among parents angry over plans to 
operate schools year-round. 
</P>
<P>
District and state education officials agree that creation of a separate Valley 
school district is very unlikely because of legal and economic obstacles. The 
Legislature previously has not been interested in taking up the issue despite 
repeated efforts by La Follette. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette in February said she would not seek reelection after serving 10 
years in the Assembly. She endorsed Wilcox, who served as executive director of 
a committee she formed last summer to reexamine the district breakup issue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox reacted to Boland's statement by saying she knows little about the 
issue, "but I welcome Paula to the longtime effort." 
</P>
<P>
In a report scheduled for submission to the state Board of Education later this 
month, La Follette's committee is expected to recommend that the Los Angeles 
district be broken into eight or more separate school districts, with at least 
two in the Valley. La Follette wants the state board and the Los Angeles County 
Committee on School District Organization to approve a citywide vote on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the proposal say changing the size of the Los Angeles school 
district would do little to boost academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the GOP primary will face what is considered only token 
Democratic opposition in the November election. The majority of voters in the 
38th District, which covers most of the northern Valley, are registered 
Republicans.

BUSINESS DISTRICT GROWTH LIMITS MOVE FORWARD IN CANOGA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council took the first step Tuesday toward controlling 
development in Canoga Park's business district, approving a motion by 
Councilwoman Joy Picus to begin preparing a specific plan for the busy 
commercial strip along Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
Specific plans are city ordinances that can range from banning certain types of 
businesses to regulating architectural styles. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas of the west San Fernando Valley, such as Reseda, the council has 
imposed temporary building moratoriums to allow time for the specific plans to 
be prepared and approved. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she does not anticipate a building moratorium in Canoga Park "for 
the time being." She said she plans to appoint a citizens committee to 
recommend the Canoga Park restrictions relatively soon, so that a plan might be 
ready by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In general, specific plans have been employed by the Planning Department to 
impose controls on development, whether they be limits in booming areas such as 
Ventura Boulevard or incentives for more development in aging commercial areas 
such as Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Canoga Park, Picus was reluctant to say that Sherman Way needed 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said she hoped a specific plan would bring about "a fresh face for 
Sherman Way." 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy economically, and it has been for some time," she said of the 
strip, which includes a renowned row of antique stores, as well as pornographic 
businesses, thrift shops and a pool hall.

Young Soon Yoon plopped a bundle of silk cushions in the middle of her living 
room. Alongside boxes, newspaper-wrapped dinnerware and an unplugged rice 
cooker, the 69-year-old grandmother sat and mused on the next chapter of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, this would be impossible," she said of her new one-bedroom apartment 
on Bonnie Brae Street, where she plans to fiddle with her industrial-size 
sewing machine, entertain friends and just relax. 
</P>
<P>
After working for decades -- most recently in a Los Angeles garment factory -- 
and rearing five daughters and eight grandchildren, Yoon said she looks forward 
to "personal time," a concept not widely recognized in the crowded South Korean 
city she left in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
She was among the first to move into Sangnok Villa, Los Angeles' first 
subsidized senior-citizen housing project intended for Korean-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Sangnok, which in Korean means evergreen, is not in Koreatown, but in a largely 
Latino area to the east, near crime-ridden MacArthur Park. Three blocks to the 
north, barricades close off a neighborhood that has been targeted by police for 
a crackdown on drug-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of senior-citizen housing is an unfamiliar one for many Koreans 
whose tradition dictates that the extended family remain intact. In South 
Korea, which has no social security system, the elderly most often live with 
and are cared for by their adult children. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many were eager to be among the first to live at Sangnok Villa. 
For each of its 60 apartments, management has received more than a dozen 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking these days is that living separately is more comfortable for 
everyone," said Yong Soo Kang, 71, who, after 10 years of living with her son 
in a condominium apartment in Koreatown, moved to Sangnok last week. "That's 
how our lives are in America." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Yoon said: "After living in Los Angeles, it makes a lot of sense. 
Right here is near my family, my church and my friends' homes -- everywhere I 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
The project was the product of nearly five years of planning, according to the 
Korean American Christian Evergreen Assn., which developed the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The group received the $3.9-million construction cost from the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
the Retirement Housing Foundation, a nonprofit developer specializing in 
housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Because of funding guidelines, the apartments are open to anyone 62 or older, 
said the foundation's rental manager Paul Frysak. But, he added, almost all of 
Sangnok's 700 applications were from Korean-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The construction site was chosen by the redevelopment agency. The decision was 
based on the lower land costs there compared to parts of Koreatown, which to 
some of the organizers seemed a more logical location. 
</P>
<P>
The complex was completed just last month, but already there have been some 
problems with vandalism. During construction, more than 150 windows were 
broken, and this week, burglars broke into three unoccupied apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and the building's superintendent, Tony Hough, said they are seeking 
money from the management company to hire a guard and install security bars on 
ground-level windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
As residents were moving in, gang "tags" could be seen on the building's 
peach-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me so mad that people just have to go and mark it up so bad," said a 
61-year-old woman who stopped to read the graffiti spread across Sangnok's 
front stairway. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who asked that her named not be published, manages a nearby 
apartment building on Westlake Avenue. She blamed the graffiti on a "certain 
element," who, she said, vandalize and litter the area. She added that the 
elderly residents of Sangnok Villa should be wary when they walk the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go out much at night," she said as she lowered her voice and scanned 
the street. "And I'm not really too keen about walking this way in the 
daytime." 
</P>
<P>
Others said that the Korean residents have been welcomed by many in the 
neighborhood. "We see that they don't look like us, but most everyone around 
here understands that the elderly should be treated with respect," said Manuel 
Torres, 41, who emigrated from Mexicali, Mexico, and has called this stretch of 
Bonnie Brae his neighborhood for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, who manages a parking lot across the street from the housing complex, 
said he hopes that his neighborhood, now divided by language and customs, will 
not become caught up in racial conflict.

<P>
QUARANTINE: BURBANK AIRPORT, THE ONLY ONE WITHIN A RESTRICTED AREA, CONTINUES 
TO CONFISCATE ABOUT 100 POUNDS OF FRUIT A DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal agriculture officials said Tuesday they continue to confiscate about 
100 pounds of fruit daily from passengers at Burbank Airport, despite publicity 
about the seizures that began when inspectors were stationed there three months 
ago to halt the spread of the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9,000 pounds of fruit have been seized since Jan. 9, when six inspectors 
established a checkpoint at the airport to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly 
outbreak from spreading beyond Los Angeles, said Scott Sanner, a regulatory 
supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Most of the fruit is taken 
from passengers who are carrying no more than one or two pieces for an 
in-flight snack. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Airport was targeted because it is the only commercial airport within a 
Medfly quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, it's still the same," he said. "I thought the word would have 
gotten out and gradually it would have tapered off. It hasn't. The public is 
just not aware." 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed officers stationed at the airport's two security checkpoints monitor 
specially installed X-ray screens for fruit. Fruit found in carry-on luggage is 
confiscated and placed in blue buckets until it is taken to the department's El 
Monte office for inspection. No fruit fly larvae have been discovered in the 
confiscated fruit to date, Sanner said. Confiscated fruit is taken to a 
landfill and buried after inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector James C. Rhodes said most people surrender their fruit without much 
trouble. "A lot of them just say, 'Oh, I forgot,' " Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
Art Zygielbaum of La Canada Flintridge gave up the three apples he had brought 
to snack on Tuesday during a business trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I a bad guy?" Zygielbaum asked as he handed over his contraband. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not bad," Inspector Wesley Drosselmeyer said. "It's just not allowed 
out of the area." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it applied to store-bought fruit," Zygielbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanner said the checkpoint is aimed at preventing home-grown fruit from leaving 
the quarantine area. He said inspectors will allow store-bought fruit to pass 
if it is sealed in its original package. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brauer, on his way to Colorado Springs, Colo., was stopped when 10 
oranges from his brother's tree in Altadena showed up on the X-ray screen. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought fruit was allowed to go out, but not allowed to come in," Brauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the opposite is true. Sanner said passengers flying into Burbank 
Airport do not need to worry that their fruit will be snatched upon arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Sanner said inspectors are expected to stay at the airport until mid-summer, 
when the Medfly quarantine for Burbank is expected to end.

SIMI AND LIBRARIES

<P>
Libraries and librarians are endanger of becoming extinct in Simi Valley 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are charged with the responsibility of preparing our children with the 
knowledge of the opportunities and resources in the world around them, to teach 
them how to look for information, to analyze and communicate that information. 
</P>
<P>
Libraries are the facilities but more importantly librarians are the 
facilitators for providing information and resources. Yet, both are considered 
fluff when it comes to education in California and Simi Valley! 
</P>
<P>
I was recently asked by a teacher to provide information for her class on U.S. 
foreign policy. The most recent book in my collection was copyrighted 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Today's youngsters are going to need more education than every before in order 
to be marketable. It is unconscionable to cut programs that provide them with 
the key to a better future.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: DAM PROJECT TO STOP SEEPAGE OF SEAWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A $28.5-million upgraded water diversion system under construction near Saticoy 
will save Ventura County an additional 4.2 billion gallons of water each year, 
United Water Conservation District officials say. 
</P>
<P>
A concrete-and-steel dam will replace an earthen structure that now diverts 
nearly 14 billion gallons of Santa Clara River water each year for county use. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, scheduled for completion in March, will stretch 1,740 feet 
across the river basin and rise 25 feet from the riverbed. A specially 
constructed fish ladder will allow rainbow trout to pass from one side of the 
structure to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Water diverted from the Santa Clara River basin is pumped into shallow dirt 
ponds covering 133 acres near Saticoy. Once in the ponds, the water naturally 
percolates through the soil and replenishes the ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the one near Saticoy, the United Water Conservation District 
operates diversion systems in Piru and El Rio along the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
The improved Saticoy area diversion system will prevent the further intrusion 
of seawater into the Oxnard plain, according to Fred Gientke, United Water 
Conservation District general manager. 
</P>
<P>
More fresh water is being pumped out of the Oxnard plain than is pumped in, 
Gientke said. As a result, underground fresh-water levels have been brought 
down below sea level, and about 25 square miles of the Oxnard plain have been 
contaminated by the intrusion of seawater. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers use 75% of the water pumped out of the Oxnard plain, Gientke said. The 
remaining 25% is used by the cities of Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo and Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and growers are charged $13.50 per acre-foot of water, but local 
municipalities pay $40.50 per acre-foot. One acre-foot of water, or 325,000 
gallons, is about the amount used by a family of four in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new dam will be capable of diverting up to 56,000 acre-feet of 
water per year from the Santa Clara River, most of the river water will flow 
into the ocean. Each year, the river washes about 110,000 acre-feet of fresh 
water, or 35.7 billion gallons, into the Pacific Ocean. JONATHON GAME

HARTLEY'S OFFICE GETS TOUCH-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city workers have begun re-covering Councilman John Hartley's office 
with new wallpaper little more than a month after Hartley delayed purchase of 
the wall coverings because of concerns about the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley decided to go ahead with the $4,400 wallpaper installation after 
comparing the city price with an estimate from a private contractor, said 
Raquel Beltran, Hartley's top aide. 
</P>
<P>
The private contractor estimated that the job would cost $4,962, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley will stand by his decision not to purchase $33,000 worth of work 
stations for his staff, keeping the total cost of his office renovation at 
about $16,000, Beltran said. Instead, partitions taken out of city storage will 
be used to divide the office, Beltran said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley announced that he would not install the work stations and postponed the 
wallpaper purchase at a March 1 press conference, calling the $50,000 cost of 
the office remodel "offensively high." The announcement came as newly elected 
council members Hartley and Linda Bernhardt were receiving intense public 
criticism for authorizing the renovations at a time when the city was beginning 
to address a $60-million deficit for the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, whose $32,450 renovation was nearing completion at the time, called 
Hartley's announcement "a cheap political ploy." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the announcement, the wallpaper installation was estimated at 
$6,100. By having city workers do the recovering during daytime work hours, the 
cost was reduced to about $4,400, Beltran said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley also announced that he would not accept a salary increase voted by the 
council that will bring the eight council members' pay to $49,000 by July 1, 
1991.

COUNTY SEEKS STATE FUNDS TO COMBAT MEASLES EPIDEMIC; 
</P>
<P>
VACCINATIONS: SUPERVISORS APPROVE A DECLARATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD IN 
ASKING FOR $300,000 TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest effort to combat Los Angeles County's worst-ever measles 
epidemic, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a Declaration of Public 
Health Hazard that allows the county to request $300,000 from the state for 
broadened immunization measures. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the county Department of Health Services said they will seek 
funds from the state Department of Health Services to increase vaccine 
supplies, maintain extended clinic hours for immunization, and expand media and 
community outreach efforts. 
</P>
<P>
John Dunajski, assistant chief of California immunization for the state health 
department, indicated that the request would be viewed favorably. "Los Angeles 
County is definitely an applicant that will be seriously reviewed. I'm sure 
they will receive some funding," he said in a telephone interview. "The state 
did make available $1.2 million for immunization programs." 
</P>
<P>
The county measles outbreak this year has struck 1,500 people and killed six, 
including four under age 15, officials from the county Department of Health 
Services said. This contrasts with a reported 1,202 cases and 17 deaths last 
year. Two people died of measles in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 cases of measles have been reported statewide this year, 
including 24 deaths, Dunajski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the disease is going at a much greater rate than last year," county 
health Director Robert C. Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Insufficient funding has hamstrung past attempts to curb the disease, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's been a continuous outbreak since 1987," said Dr. Stephen 
Waterman, chief of the Health Department's communicable disease control unit. 
"It is the longest-running measles outbreak in the country, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
Measles, also known as red measles or rubeola, is among the most contagious 
viruses. It usually starts with coughing and a high fever and can cause 
dehydration, diarrhea or inflammation of the brain. Although the disease 
usually disappears after about five days, measles can kill if unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
After unanimous approval of the declaration Tuesday, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
urged the director of the Department of Health Services to provide measles 
immunizations at all of the county's 42 health centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are having the worst measles epidemic in the history of the county," said 
Hahn, who represents the 2nd District. "We should insist that the health 
department open up all of its clinics every night and on Saturdays so our 
children and babies will get prevention. It's a deadly disease that is at 
epidemic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the clinics now offer vaccinations, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already opened up many of our clinics" to those seeking immunizations, 
he said. "But whether each and every one of them should be open is something 
I'll have to look into." 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Waterman said many of the clinics are in areas of the county hit 
hardest by the epidemic, such as South-Central Los Angeles, El Monte and East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these areas will also be focal points for the county's latest 
anti-measles campaign, Waterman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pulling together billboards and posters, many of them in Spanish," the 
physician said. "Many of the people hit by the disease are Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
Asian and Pacific Island ethnic groups and children of low-income families have 
also been hit hard by the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, other locations throughout the state have been plagued by measles 
outbreaks, including San Diego and San Bernardino counties. Reports of measles 
cases have also skyrocketed in Alameda County in the Bay Area.

PRIESTS ACCUSE FBI OF PLAN TO SPY ON CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two activist priests Tuesday accused the FBI of trying to coerce a Salvadoran 
factory worker into spying on a downtown Los Angeles church that has been a 
haven for hundreds of illegal immigrants and Central-American refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Father Luis Olivares, pastor of Our Lady Queen of the Angels Roman Catholic 
Church, said the alleged efforts to spy on members of the church, also known as 
La Placita, formed part of a longstanding campaign to discredit the parish's 
work on behalf of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares said he has requested FBI files on the church under the Freedom of 
Information Act, and Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) has also asked the FBI for 
an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent Fred Reagan, a spokesman for the agency, refused to comment 
on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the church, Olivares and Father Michael Kennedy said 
that on Oct. 5, an FBI agent approached Alberto Palacios, a 53-year-old 
Salvadoran refugee who fled his country in 1985 after imprisonment for union 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Palacios, who also appeared at the press conference, said the agent 
interrogated him for nearly two hours and informed him that he was under 
investigation apparently in connection with a plan that Palacios had devised to 
raise money for Salvadoran children wounded in that country's 10-year-old civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Palacios said, the agent told him that "things would go better" for 
Palacios if he cooperated with federal agents by naming the most politically 
active organizers at La Placita. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I should go to see who were the organized," Palacios said. The 
agent "gave me his phone number to call him with this information." 
</P>
<P>
Palacios identified the agent as Thomas S. Caldwell, and presented a card that 
Palacios said the agent had given him. A Thomas Caldwell works for the FBI's 
Los Angeles office, but a reporter's phone calls to the man were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the situations where we can't respond," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Palacios said the agent gave him six months to come up with some information, 
during which time the Salvadoran struggled to decide whether to seek help. 
Finally, last month, he went to the Central American Refugee Center, which has 
taken his case. Linton Joaquin, an attorney for the refugee center, said he has 
asked the FBI for full disclosure of any investigation involving Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations of FBI spying are the latest in a series of controversies 
surrounding Olivares, an outspoken critic of U.S. policies in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service threatened a criminal investigation 
into Olivares' activities after his decision in 1985 to declare La Placita a 
sanctuary for refugees. And he has received numerous death threats since 1987, 
some reminiscent of warnings from death squads active in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been declared a public sanctuary, there has always existed a sort of 
doubt over whether our activities on behalf of refugees are, in fact, 
religious," Olivares said. 
</P>
<P>
"The implication has been that our movement was a cover for extreme left 
political activities, aimed at destabilizing the U.S. government. It has always 
been seen with suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares said that the allegations of FBI surveillance represent another effort 
to link people working at La Placita and others who work with Central-American 
refugees to leftist guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of this decade, the FBI's anti-terrorism division conducted a 
wide-ranging, five-year probe into the Committee in Solidarity with the People 
of El Salvador, a pro-left organization that opposes U.S. policy in Central 
America. The investigation failed to prove a link between the solidarity 
committee and terrorism, and six FBI agents were eventually disciplined for 
negligence in the investigation.

YOUTH GETS 22 YEARS IN HIGH DESERT GANG SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old gang member was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum term of 22 years 
and four months in juvenile custody for fatally shooting a popular Antelope 
Valley High School youth in what authorities described as that area's first 
gang-related killing. 
</P>
<P>
Under juvenile sentencing procedures, however, the youth will be released 
before his 25th birthday, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth pleaded guilty March 23 to second-degree murder in the Jan. 6 slaying 
of Christopher Sanford, 18, of Lancaster, who was leaving a party in Lancaster 
when he was shot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth also pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the wounding of Sheldon 
Culver, 20, of Lancaster, who was shot in the neck but later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the youth, a member of a Sylmar gang, shot at several youths 
who were chasing him from a party that he attempted to crash, but missed and 
struck Sanford, who died a short time later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Los Angeles 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Chesley McKay, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators named the youth as a suspect after interviewing other party-goers 
who witnessed the shooting, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said. The youth remained at large for several weeks but turned himself in to 
authorities Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting prompted an outpouring of grief by Sanford's schoolmates and 
teachers, who remembered him as a likable youth and a star goalie for the high 
school's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Although gang activity has been on the rise in the Antelope Valley in past 
years, sheriff's investigators said the shooting was the first gang-related 
fatality in the area.

CAR RAN OVER VICTIM IN PURSE THEFT, WITNESS SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HEARINGS: FREDA CRAWFORD, 83, DIED MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER BEING INJURED IN THE 
ROBBERY, AND TWO MEN ARE CHARGED WITH HER MURDER.

An elderly Granada Hills woman was dragged by a car for 60 feet and run over as 
she tried to keep a robber from taking her purse, a witness testified Tuesday 
in a preliminary hearing for two men charged with the woman's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Michael P. Kellet, 21, and Richard E. Phillips, 20, both of Northridge could be 
sentenced to 26 years to life in prison if convicted in the murder of Freda 
Crawford, 83, who died last April in a convalescent home. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
David R. Lopez, who is prosecuting the case, said Crawford's death resulted 
from injuries suffered in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford was preparing to load groceries into her car outside the Hughes 
supermarket at Devonshire Street and Balboa Boulevard when a white Chevrolet 
Camaro drove up beside her and the driver grabbed her purse, Cecilia Rivera 
testified Tuesday in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady was dragging alongside the car. She was knocked down at the 
completion of a sharp swerve," Rivera said. "I saw the left rear wheel go over 
her head. The purse went into the car." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera said the car turned out of the parking lot and sped off on Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
Kellet and Phillips were arrested the next day after a boy who had heard news 
accounts of the robbery saw a car that matched the description of the suspects' 
vehicle, Lopez said. The boy's father notified police, who stopped the car in 
an undeveloped part of Northridge where the men had gone to ditch it, Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellet was sentenced in late 1988 to four years in prison after pleading guilty 
to two counts of robbery, involving Crawford and an earlier purse-snatching, 
Lopez said. Phillips has appealed his robbery convictions in the same case, for 
which he is serving a seven-year sentence, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were charged with murder after Crawford died more than a year after the 
robbery. She was in a coma for three months after the attack and was kept on a 
life-support device until her death, Lopez said.

EXPLANATION FOR CUT IN LAX FEES ASKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has called on airport officials to explain why $7.4 million 
in increased parking revenue at Los Angeles International Airport is being 
passed on to airlines as reduced landing fees. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said Tuesday that they were surprised by the request, since 
the mayor's office endorsed the parking rate increase last year and did not 
object when the Airport Commission -- appointed by Bradley -- approved the 
lower landing fees last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure he understands it, but he wants me to explain it one more time," 
said Clifton Moore, executive director of the city's Department of Airports. 
"People are concerned, and they are entitled to an explanation. But the 
explanations have been made before, and they will be made again, and they 
basically won't change." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said a longstanding agreement between the Department of Airports and 
airlines at LAX gave the city no choice but to reduce the landing fees from 63 
cents to 26 cents per 1,000 pounds of landed weight. The agreement requires the 
airport to pass on surplus revenues to the airlines, which, in turn, guarantee 
airport bonds and cover any airport losses, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"When times are good, they benefit, and when times are bad, they pay," Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport parking rates were increased from 33% to 100% last December in an 
effort to discourage long-term parking in lots near the airport and to 
encourage car-pooling and use of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Jerald K. Lee, the department's director of administration, said most of the 
cut in landing fees is not attributable to the new parking rates. He said the 
new landing fees reflect a $16.7-million surplus this year -- more than half of 
it from unexpected rental car and concessions revenue and savings on salaries, 
supplies and services. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani acknowledged Tuesday that Bradley approved the new 
parking rates and did nothing to block the lower landing fees, but he said the 
mayor was surprised that airport officials did not spend some of the surplus 
parking revenues on other projects. Under the agreement with the airlines, the 
airport can avoid passing on surpluses to the airlines by simply spending the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent months there has been a growing movement in the mayor's office to 
determine how best to allocate scarce city resources," Fabiani said. "It is 
clear that as the airport grows and becomes more profitable, it is going to 
become more and more important as the city becomes increasingly strapped for 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the agreement with the airlines does not allow the department to use 
the surplus money for construction projects, such as a new terminal. "We feel 
an obligation to run the airport as efficiently as we can," he said. "We are 
not going to just spend money to spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the LAX area, said the airport needs 
to renegotiate the agreement with the airlines, which officials say is at least 
40 years old and expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"This should be a good time to make sure we get a new landing agreement that 
never puts the city in this idiot position again."

SDSU SAYS RIGGINS FIRED FOR DEALINGS WITH AGENT; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: SUMMARY OF REPORT TO NCAA SAYS HE VIOLATED RULES IN SPRING 
OF 1989. HE SAYS SCHOOL MISREAD ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO CHANA PERRY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Earnest Riggins was fired in May after six seasons as the San Diego State 
women's basketball coach because he violated NCAA rules by representing a 
former athlete in dealings with a player agent, the university said in a 
document released this week. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was contained in a summary of a report the university submitted 
to the NCAA detailing last spring's school investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said the player was Chana Perry, an All-American center for SDSU who 
completed her eligibility with the 1988-89 season. Perry is playing for a 
professional team in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The university released the 2 1/2-page summary Monday following a request for 
the report by The Times under the California Public Records Act. The university 
has thus far declined to release the complete report on the advice of its 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The summary does not indicate when the university submitted its report to the 
NCAA or what action, if any, was taken in response. It does say that it 
consulted with NCAA officials during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The summary said the university declined to renew Riggins' contract because he 
violated an NCAA rule prohibiting university personnel from marketing 
student-athletes to professional teams and organizations or receiving direct or 
indirect compensation for such services. It also does not say that Riggins 
gained any benefits from the dealings described. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins has denied violating NCAA rules and said the university has 
misinterpreted his actions. He said his termination was improper and is 
contesting it through the California State University system's grievance 
procedure. Riggins said he is seeking pay the university owes him on a contract 
he contends was valid through the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, 52, also contends he was a victim of sex and race discrimination by 
the university because he was a black male coaching a women's team, and he 
filed a separate grievance against the university on these charges. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said both grievances have been denied at two levels within the 
university system. He said a hearing on the improper termination grievance has 
been scheduled for May 11, before an arbitrator from the American Arbitration 
Assn. He is unsure, he said, how he will proceed with the discrimination 
grievance. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins compiled a record of 118-67 after taking over at SDSU in 1983. His 
1988-89 team, led by Perry, finished 25-9. He said he has been unemployed since 
his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The university said in the summary that the investigation conducted by the 
athletic department began in April 1989 and concluded that Riggins helped fill 
out an agreement that served as a basis for a contract the player (identified 
by Riggins as Perry) signed with an agent a week later. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions were based on information provided by the athlete, her parents, 
the agent and members of Riggins' staff, among others. Riggins is one of only 
two people identified by name in the summary; S. David Berst, director of 
enforcement for the NCAA, is the other. All others are identified only by title 
or their relationship to the player. 
</P>
<P>
The summary said Riggins "met with (the player) and filled in the blanks on a 
Standard Player Contract." It also said there was a meeting later that day 
between Riggins, the agent and the agent's wife, during "which preliminary 
discussion took place which would lead to contract negotiations." At this 
meeting, Riggins led "the discussion and all of the negotiations," the summary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he did fill in portions of the agreement but only on the 
instructions of Perry, to be used as a guide for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Chana what do you want? Let's put it down on paper,' " Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said the discussions took place in Amarillo, Tex., after Perry and SDSU 
concluded the 1988-89 season by finishing second in the Women's National 
Invitation Tournament March 25. Riggins said he introduced Perry to the agent, 
whom he identified as Joe Betancourt of Crystal City, Tex. But, he said, he was 
never attempting to arrange a contract for Perry and denied leading the talks. 
</P>
<P>
One week after the meeting, the player and her parents met with the agent and 
signed an agreement similar to the one Riggins filled out, the summary said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said by telephone Tuesday that she supported Riggins. She said he did 
nothing improper and that she had asked Riggins to deal with agents who wanted 
to talk with her during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked that he had been fired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She characterized Riggins' actions as an attempt to protect her from agents who 
might have endangered her NCAA eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I didn't want to talk to any agents during the season," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
But the summary said the player and her parents were upset with Riggins because 
he withheld information about other agents and professional teams that were 
interested in the player. The summary specifically mentions a team from Japan 
with which Riggins would not negotiate, adding that he also refused to tell it 
how it could contact the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he placed information relating to teams interested in Perry in a 
file for her and that he followed his standard practice, with a player's 
agreement, of denying agents information concerning parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that for any of my players," Riggins said. "I don't give out phone 
numbers or addresses. I didn't do that for Chana, and I wasn't going to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The summary also said that the agent who signed the player was upset with 
Riggins because he also withheld information about the player's parents from 
him, requiring that the agent work through Riggins, the summary said. 
</P>
<P>
"The agent indicated that he was irritated that Mr. Riggins was involved in the 
negotiations, but it appeared to be the only way to get the student as a 
client," the summary said. The agent also told school investigators by 
telephone that "he was told by Mr. Riggins that he (Riggins) had the influence 
to direct the student to the agent." 
</P>
<P>
Betancourt could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The summary said Riggins initially was "inadequate and evasive" in his written 
response to the allegations. Riggins said a meeting then was held with Athletic 
Director Fred Miller and two associate athletic directors, Jayne Hancock and 
Don Kaverman. 
</P>
<P>
The summary contains a description of that meeting, in which Riggins "was at 
first nonresponsive." Only after "incriminating information was brought to his 
attention" did Riggins admit his involvement, the summary said. The "most 
compelling piece of evidence" was a copy of the contract that "was in his 
handwriting, which he had prepared as a rough draft for further negotiations 
with the agent." The summary also said the internal investigation had turned up 
two other NCAA rules violations in the program. The university said the 
violations were "minor" and that it followed standard procedure by reporting 
them to the Big West Conference. The summary did not describe their nature. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Haney, commissioner of the Big West Conference, said the violations 
were not considered for further action because SDSU intends to leave the 
conference in a few months to join a new Western Athletic Conference for women. 
</P>
<P>
The summary said that after Riggins had been presented with the university's 
conclusions, he was offered the option of resigning or being released. 
</P>
<P>
When Riggins declined to resign, the university said it notified him on May 12 
that it would not renew his contract. The university said the contract 
contained "a clause allowing nonreappointment if he was found to be involved in 
any violations of NCAA regulations." Such clauses are required under NCAA 
rules. But Riggins said his grievance contends the clause is improper under the 
collective bargaining agreement between the CSU system and the California 
Faculty Assn., the union that represents faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said officials misinterpreted his actions, that they were designed to 
protect Perry from harassment by agents during the season and keep her from 
endangering her eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules prohibit a player from signing or agreeing to be represented by an 
agent. Loss of eligibility is the penalty for a violation. 
</P>
<P>
The summary discusses no possible motive for Riggins' alleged actions but says 
the arrangement "gave Riggins some leverage with the professional agent and 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he had no financial agreement with Betancourt concerning Perry. He 
said their only business relationship involved a clinic to be held in Spain 
last summer and that it began in September 1988, almost three months before the 
start of Perry's senior season. Riggins said Betancourt promised him an 
unspecified fee to lecture at the clinic, along with expenses including air 
fare and hotels, for him, his wife and their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he never went to Spain and that neither he nor any family members 
accepted benefits from Betancourt. Perry said she was aware of the clinic but 
that it had no bearing on her decision. 
</P>
<P>
Perry had a controversial five-year college career. She started at Northeast 
Louisiana in 1984, but one year later, the school was placed on NCAA probation 
because of rules violations while she was being recruited. That led to a civil 
suit against the school and a former assistant coach by Perry's mother, Ruth 
Antoinette Perry Smith of Brookhaven, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was settled out of court, but Perry was prohibited from playing at 
Northeast Louisiana and transferred to SDSU in 1986. After sitting out 1986-87, 
she came back strong, averaging 23.5 points and 13.1 rebounds as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the strong interest from women's professional teams around the 
world. Top U.S. college players, especially centers with strong offensive 
skills, are valued. 
</P>
<P>
Perry would not discuss specific financial terms of her agreement with the 
Italian team but said she was "well-represented" by Betancourt and that in 
addition to her salary she received free rent and the use of a car while in 
Italy.

<P>
NOTEBOOK: THE POLITICAL COLUMNIST STOPPED BY THE BALLPARK TO SAY HELLO TO TONY 
GWYNN AND OREL HERSHISER, TWO OF THE SUBJECTS IN HIS LATEST BOOK.

Men at work: 
</P>
<P>
Political columnist George Will was sitting on the bench in the Padre dugout 
before Tuesday's home opener, dressed in a sport coat and necktie. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Mark Grant walked past, stopped and looked. 
</P>
<P>
"You're out of uniform," Grant said. "You don't have a bow tie on." 
</P>
<P>
They both laughed. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken six attempts, but Will finally is enjoying a book promotion tour. 
</P>
<P>
He was in San Diego Tuesday pushing "Men At Work," his sixth book. He was able 
to get to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium by late afternoon to say hello to Tony 
Gwynn and Orel Hershiser -- two of the book's four main subjects, along with 
Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony La Russa -- and appear on Jerry Coleman's pregame radio 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun," he said. "Most book tours are a grind." 
</P>
<P>
While several players sat in the clubhouse and watched Will on Roy Firestone's 
ESPN talk show (taped earlier), Will was in the Padre dugout talking to Gwynn 
and then watching him hit. 
</P>
<P>
On a local radio talk show earlier in the day, Will said Gwynn was the best 
all-around player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
At the stadium, Will continued his praise. 
</P>
<P>
"Put Tony in Fenway Park, and he'd bat .440," Will said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, whose first hit of the season was a single to right off Dodger starter 
Tim Belcher Tuesday, said he has a copy of the book but hasn't read it yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably read it on the (upcoming) road trip," Gwynn said. "I guess it's 
good. George is a really good writer and a good person. I had a lot of fun 
working with him." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser said he had started the book but had not finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's outstanding," Hershiser said. "I admire the man for his 
analytical talent and the way he expresses himself. He has an amazing 
vocabulary and a knack for using all of the right words in all of the right 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot about a game I thought I knew a lot about. It will be 
interesting for people to learn so many things about baseball that they have 
taken for granted or maybe never knew existed." 
</P>
<P>
Will is scheduled to travel from San Diego to the Bay Area today for more 
promotional work. So far, he said, he has received good reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Clark said he's even going to read it," Will said. 
</P>
<P>
He was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way it sounds," Clark said. "He's writing it from a different arena 
that people haven't been tuned in to. Some people say baseball is too slow, but 
it's a fast game relative to everything that happens." 
</P>
<P>
Add Will: Gwynn said he has already been kidded about being in the batting cage 
in the early morning hours, something Will wrote in the book. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not exactly true," Gwynn said, laughing. "Ten-thirty or 11, maybe. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Will on home openers: "All the real baseball fans come on the second day, after 
all of the suspenders and yuppies have gone." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn's obsession: Will's 16-year-old son, Geoffrey, has attended Gwynn's 
hitting school over the Christmas holidays the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"You get so many names and faces that you don't remember them," Gwynn said. 
"You remember swings." 
</P>
<P>
Swings? 
</P>
<P>
"We worked with (Geoffrey) on the angle of his bat," Gwynn said. "He was 
wrapping the bat behind his head. We tried to straighten it out. He'll probably 
be a pretty good little hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Book tour mania: The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former Padre and 
Giant pitcher Dave Dravecky, who is also on a tour promoting his new book. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky, whose comeback attempt from cancer ended last season, was supposed to 
sign books before tonight's game. That has been rescheduled because Dravecky's 
wife, Jan, is ill. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't prevent some warm reunions between Dravecky and some former 
colleagues, though. He and Padre Manager Jack McKeon embraced in the hallway 
outside the San Diego clubhouse an hour before the game. Then, McKeon kidded 
Dravecky about throwing out the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look good, I might sign you," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky: "Well, I don't have an agent." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon: "If you need an agent on your books, let me know." 
</P>
<P>
How-soon-they-forget-dept.: Early in Tuesday's game, a note was flashed on the 
scoreboard referring to the Cubs' victory over Philadelphia. Former Padre 
Marvell Wynne singled home the game-winning run. The scoreboard referred to 
"Marvelle." Coincidentally, former Padre John Kruk was also included in the 
note -- he doubled home Philadelphia's only run. 
</P>
<P>
Boo: You know Tony Gwynn received the loudest cheer during pregame 
introductions. But the loudest boo? It went to Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda. 
Second-loudest went to Dodger outfielder Hubie Brooks, whose eighth-inning home 
run Monday sent the Padres to a 4-2, opening day defeat.

VALLEY TRIO DOMINATES L. A. JUNIOR GOLF EVENT 
</P>

Three Valley entrants swept the girls' division in the 40th Los Angeles Junior 
Golf Championships on Tuesday, with 15-year-old Emilee Klein of Studio City 
shooting an even-par 72 for a two-stroke victory at the Sepulveda golf courses 
in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who shot a 75 the first day, had a total of 147. Heidi Voorhees, 16, of 
North Hollywood, shot a 78 in the final round of the two-day event and finished 
second at 149 while Renee Hunt, 16, also of North Hollywood, had rounds of 76 
and 75 for a 151 and third place. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' division, Chris Tidland, a senior at Valencia High in Placentia, 
was an easy winner, compiling a two-day score of 143. His rounds of 70 and 73 
gave him a four-stroke win. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, a sophomore at Notre Dame High, began the day four strokes behind 
Voorhees. But an even-par round that included three birdies and three bogeys 
was enough to overhaul the first-day leader. Klein won the 11-and-under 
division of the same tournament four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"To win is exciting," said Klein, who has played in several national amateur 
tournaments. "Winning is important. If I can win here, against this type of 
competition, then I know I can win anywhere. This is where the great golfers in 
the country come from. This is the place to play if you want to see the best 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The other girls know I play pretty steady, and that might have put some 
pressure on them." Late in June, the Southern California Professional Golf 
Assn. will send three junior women and three junior men from the area to play a 
team of French junior players at the Paris Country Club. Voorhees, who also 
attends Notre Dame, and Klein remain first and second on the girls' list with 
four events remaining before the team is determined. 
</P>
<P>
Tidland, 17, was playing in the city's Junior Championship for the first time. 
He shot a 70 on Monday but trailed Jim Skinner of Pacific Palisades by a 
stroke. Skinner, however, shot an 80 on Tuesday and Tidland was never 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Tidland carded three birdies and four bogeys Tuesday, scoring all of the 
birdies on par-fives after reaching the greens in two shots.

BIRMINGHAM HOLDS ON TO CLAIM TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HOLT-GOODMAN FINAL: WHEN POLY RALLY FALLS SHORT, SINK ENJOYS A LONG-AWAITED 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is, after all, Coach Wayne Sink's final season at Birmingham High after 26 
years. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the event, the traditional Holt-Goodman baseball tournament, for 
which he was the organizer and planner for many of those years. It is also a 
tournament that has never seen Birmingham reach the finals under Sink. 
</P>
<P>
So what in the name of party poopers were the Poly Parrots doing Tuesday at 
Birmingham's Ramirez Field by mounting a furious, seventh-inning rally against 
Sink's Braves and closing a five-run deficit to just one run with none out and 
the bases loaded? 
</P>
<P>
Just making it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with that precarious position Sink called on Noah Kirshbaum in relief. 
Kirshbaum, who had pitched just once this season before Tuesday, eventually 
ended the game by inducing a line-drive double play and a ground out to give 
Sink and the Braves a 7-6 win in the tournament's title game. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Sink went to the team's field house and took out the monstrous 
trophy that for so long had gone to other teams. But this time, he kept it. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a couple of cheap hits and some big plays to do it, but we did it," 
Sink said, proudly wearing a fresh white T-shirt that read "1990 Holt-Goodman 
Champions." He added, "But that's baseball. And that's a helluva team we beat. 
I'm glad we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the title game, Poly (14-3) was riding a 12-game win streak and had 
defeated North Hollywood, Kennedy and San Fernando to reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly eye-opening was the 11-10 win over San Fernando in which Poly 
fought back from a 6-1 deficit and endured a four-run Tiger seventh inning 
before winning in the 10th. So it was no shock when Poly mounted its 
last-inning bid Tuesday against Birmingham (11-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-2, the Parrots lashed out at eventual winner and tournament MVP 
Josh Brown (7-2), who had held Poly to six hits entering the seventh. Francisco 
Flores doubled to start the rally and, after Steve Chavez walked, Wil Molina 
stroked an RBI double to make the score 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sink summoned senior second baseman Matt Mowry -- whose three-run double in the 
second inning had given Birmingham its early, comfortable lead -- as a 
reliever. Poly's Roy Lozano greeted Mowry with a run-scoring infield single and 
when No. 3 hitter Jonathan Campbell singled to right to make the score 7-5, 
Sink removed Mowry in favor of Kirshbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Poly's Gabe Chavez singled to left to load the bases and, after Rodrigo Dorame 
legged out an RBI infield single, it was 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirshbaum bore down and stopped the threat there.

THERE'S MORE TO THIS USD TEAM THAN NORIEGA; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: SENIORS DAN MATTERA AND J.R. EDWARDS ARE MOST PROMINENT AMONG OTHERS 
WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR GAMES TO NEW LEVELS FOR THE 19TH-RANKED TOREROS. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes Ed Collins, the University of San Diego's men's tennis coach, has a 
hard time fathoming just how much sophomore Jose Luis Noriega of Peru has meant 
to his program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be the first to admit Jose has helped our program tremendously," Collins 
said. "He's a national (college clay court) champion. That's something to be 
proud of, and it helps our program. Because when Jose's name is mentioned, 
people tend to think of USD tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's impact was not unlike that of a rookie quarterback coming in and 
leading a veteran NFL team to its first Super Bowl. In his freshman season, 
Noriega won the West Coast Conference singles and doubles championships and 
reached the round of 16 at the NCAA individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't coincidence that the Toreros gained their first NCAA Division I 
tournament after 10 years of competing at that level. 
</P>
<P>
"He's accomplished a great deal since he's been here," Collins said. "He 
deserves all the attention he gets." 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Dan Mattera and J.R. Edwards don't mean to downplay Noriega's 
importance -- he was 11-2 in No. 1 singles last year -- but they admit 
accepting his fame has not always been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was really tough because all we heard was Jose, Jose, and I was 
having a pretty good season (23-6 at No. 6 singles)," Mattera said. "I used to 
be so bitter. But you just finally realize it's going to be that way and learn 
to accept it. I feel like we are finally content with the way we're playing, 
and we don't really care about other things so much." 
</P>
<P>
And while Mattera was bitter, Edwards said he was intimidated by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt nervous playing doubles with him," Edwards said. "I don't know 
if I ever felt really comfortable. As good as he is, he's definitely 
intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Mattera and Edwards say they have learned to accept Noriega for 
what he is. And the bitterness and nerves have turned to admiration and 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fears came from us," Mattera said. "We were the ones who were causing 
the tension. He was modest the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes us better is that he believes he can win at No. 1. He handles 
everything so well. I couldn't handle all that pressure of playing No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Although Noriega doesn't claim to be a team leader, he said the way he deals 
with pressure has rubbed off on the others. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tell every one to have fun and not have so much pressure on them," he 
said. "I've seen some players doing some things that they've never done 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Such as occasionally beating him in challenge matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've learned to prepare themselves better mentally and not feel so 
intimidated," Noriega said. "I think I show that it's not that hard. They all 
have the tennis skills to beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said Noriega has also shown that hard work can lead to victories. 
</P>
<P>
"If they work hard, he works harder," Collins said. "He doesn't waste a minute 
in practice. He has a purpose for every ball he hits." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, that was the antithesis of Edwards' and Mattera's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of them are extremely talented, but they had a lot to learn about 
tennis," said Collins, in his 12th year as coach at USD. "A lot of changes have 
been made systematically in their games over the years." 
</P>
<P>
With Edwards, who came to USD from Denver, Collins' job was to tone down his 
power game. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came here from the altitude in Denver, he had a big serve, and that 
was about it," Collins said. "He took a lot of chances and didn't have a large 
margin for error in his game. He could fall apart at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards agrees. "I thought a good strategy was to serve and volley and go for 
winners," he said. "I didn't really have a purpose. When I first got here, I 
beat everybody before they figured out what I was doing. And then when I 
started losing, I'd always lose to the same type of player. A quick guy who 
could run down shots and hit a lot of balls." 
</P>
<P>
And until his junior year, Edwards would rarely come back after losing the 
first set. He had the worst comeback record on the team for two years. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, Edwards went 13-5 after losing the first set -- the best of any 
player on the team. This season, while playing anywhere from No. 2 to No. 4, 
Edwards has gone 26-8 in singles and doubles and is ranked 74th in singles for 
the 19th-ranked Toreros (20-4). 
</P>
<P>
"After going undefeated in the Blue-Gray Classic, he's shown that he's learned 
to play with pressure," Collins said. "He's also toned down his game and 
increased his margin for error." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said his game has undergone a complete transformation. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to rally now, and I don't have a problem staying on the baseline," he 
said. "In fact, I am now playing like the players that used to beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Mattera came equipped with a fierce two-handed backhand, but not much else. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have been easier to work with than J.R. because my game was so 
undeveloped," said Mattera, who played in high school at South Torrance High. 
"I had to start from scratch. I didn't have to have an overhaul, because I 
didn't have a serve, an overhead or a volley." 
</P>
<P>
Said Collins: "It was so obvious. He needed to improve his full game." 
</P>
<P>
Mattera has done so to such an extent that he is now the most consistent winner 
on the team. He is 37-8 overall (ranked 47th nationally in singles) and has a 
perfect 19-0 record in doubles; 15 of those victories have come when playing 
with freshman Kevin Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
USD has also been helped this year by seniors Chris Toomey of Poway High, who 
is 28-8 in singles and doubles playing in a number of different spots, and Tim 
Bubnack of Torrey Pines, who is 14-6 in singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I can't believe how much we've improved," said Mattera, who has won 
75% of his matches during his USD career. "Last year we were winning at No. 5 
and 6, but to be playing at No. 2 or No. 3 beating these guys, that's hard to 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
Collins finds it even harder to believe that he may miss Mattera and Edwards 
more than Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, two years ago, I was sure I'd be able to improve my program when 
they left, but now it'll be impossible to replace them," Collins said. "Next 
year will definitely be a rebuilding year." 
</P>
<P>
Mattera said he's hopeful Collins won't have too many of those. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we've been here, we've beaten Stanford, Cal, USC and gone to the second 
round of the NCAAs," he said. "When I first got here, we'd be lucky to get a 
match off those teams. But now we're a legitimate threat. People know who we 
are. It would be disappointing to see all that go down the tubes."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: NEW TRACK GIVES UCSD RECORD RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Tim Kyser remembers the way things were on the UC San Diego track team 
-- back when shin splints, sore feet and abrasions were not so occasional 
because of a hard dirt track. 
</P>
<P>
"It was intercollegiate athletics, but it had a club atmosphere back then," 
said Kyser, a 400-meter runner. 
</P>
<P>
Back then was last year. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD now has an impressive new state-of-the-art, all-weather track and a number 
of school records to go with it. Some are calling the track the best in the 
county, and you will get no argument from Kyser or freshman Paul Dillon, who 
ran last year for St. Augustine High, which has a 330-yard dirt oval. 
</P>
<P>
Already, UCSD has set eight women's marks and three men's, and the Tritons have 
had only one meet on the track. 
</P>
<P>
The second will be Saturday at 10 a.m.: the UCSD Open Invitational, in which 
several world-class performers such as Brazil's Joaquim Cruz (800 meters) and 
France's Phillippe Collet (pole vault) will compete along with several top 
collegians. 
</P>
<P>
Olympian Steve Scott will assist in officially dedicating the facility April 28 
when UCSD plays host to the San Diego Collegiate Championships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the all-weather surfaces, the facility features 
multi-directional runways for the long jump and pole vault, grills surrounding 
the long jump pits to help keep the sand where it's supposed to be, a large 
approach area for the high jump and bi-directional sprint lanes. It was not 
built to accommodate a football field as with many tracks, so most of the field 
event areas are on the outside. Only the high jump is contested in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
John Colborne, a two-time San Diego Section player of the year from Poway High, 
participated in the 21st Aloha/Japan basketball tournament in Tokyo this past 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In three games, Colborne averaged 10.3 points and seven rebounds for the South 
(1-2), which was coached by Alabama Birmingham's Gene Bartow. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-9 senior, Colborne led Southern Methodist in scoring (18.2 points per 
game) and rebounding (7.3) this season and was chosen second-team All-Southwest 
Conference. In his career, Colborne had 1,046 points and 576 rebounds, shooting 
54% from the field and 76% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
John Jerome, who averaged 19.2 points per game as a senior to set the 
University of San Diego's single-season scoring record, was selected the most 
valuable player in a 70-team basketball tournament at a Montana scouting camp 
in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome, whose team won the championship of the Wayne Estes Tournament, said he 
is now getting more attention from teams in the Continental Basketball Assn. 
and in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty worthwhile for me because I didn't have a lot of notoriety going 
in," Jerome said. "I'm starting to get a lot of calls now." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego State men's tennis team snuck into the top 25 for the first time 
in 10 years. The Aztecs, led by No. 78-ranked Tole Marinkovic, are ranked 24th. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's women, previously ranked 17th, moved up to 16th. The Aztecs' 
doubles team of Dorey Brandt and Taunya Johnson is ranked 38th. 
</P>
<P>
Former Aztec Eric Wynalda had two goals and an assist in the United States' 4-2 
victory over Iceland Sunday in preparation for this summer's World Cup in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International's softball team, winner of only 15 games last year, has gone 
20-22 this year against some pretty tough competition. Last week, the Gulls 
upset No. 6 Nebraska, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, USIU faces No. 8 Cal (26-17) and the Bears' incredible freshman, 
Michele Granger. 
</P>

While still at Valencia High, Granger was voted player of the year by the U.S. 
Olympic Committee three years in a row. She pitched a perfect game and a 
no-hitter and led the United States when it won the 1986 World Championship and 
was a member of the 1987 gold medal team in the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
After a mysterious circulatory injury to her pitching hand forced her to 
redshirt last year, Granger, 20, is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"She's slumping right now," said Herb Beneson, sports information director. 
"But she still leads the team in every category. Come to think of it, she leads 
the conference (Pac 10) in just about everything, too." 
</P>
<P>
Granger, who pitches left-handed, is 15-8 with a 0.44 earned run average. Her 
226 strikeouts are nearly three times more than the next best in the Pac 10.

INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Brown strikes again, exhibiting his contempt for the voters of 
California. His comments in your article on the initiative process speaks to 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Legislature, under his leadership, either failed to act or 
passed wimpy legislation in the areas of insurance reform, campaign financing, 
ethics, anti-smoking and environmental issues. At the same time, Willie and his 
gang had very little problem taking money from any special-interest group that 
could pay their price to pass laws suited to their fancy. 
</P>
<P>
What will it take to convince Willie Brown and company that they work for and 
are paid by the people of California and not industry trade associations? 
</P>
<P>
What Brown doesn't understand is that a Constitution and initiative process 
exist so that the people will be heard when elected officials refuse to listen 
and act. It shocks me to think that deep down, the Speaker's only concern is 
concentrating and maintaining absolute power over the legislative process, the 
people be damned. The arrogance alone should be reason for expulsion from 
public office.

BEAR MASCOT

<TEXT>
<P>
In only a few short weeks, the community of Big Bear, overcome by Cocomania, 
has given the public an education unsurpassed in local history (Part A, March 
27). 
</P>
<P>
It has taught us that misguided passion (not to be confused with compassion) 
has united residents and politicians alike, openly disregarding state laws and 
demeaning and threatening those who enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
It has maximized tourism through the sales of T-shirts and beverages topped 
with gummy bears and littered mountain roads with distracting signs. Using this 
rationale, the town insists the best interest of an innocent bear cub is to 
remain in Big Bear Valley as their mascot. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed 2-to-4 acre "natural habitat" would deprive Coco of her territorial 
needs and freedom to fulfill her natural instincts, becoming frustrated and 
confused as she matures. Captive bears teach us nothing about the behavior of 
wild bears. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife is property of the state -- including citizens outside of the mountain 
resort communities. The funds and energy spent to keep the cub in Big Bear 
Valley would be better served preserving critical wildlife habitat, and 
improving facilities for the nearby Moonridge Animal Park bears, adopting one 
of the bears already in captivity as their mascot.

THEY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he retired after 22 years as chancellor of UC Irvine in 1984, Daniel G. 
Aldrich Jr. left a bustling university that boasted many respected programs, 
from an innovative School of Criticism and Theory to a medical school. Among 
its notable scholars were F. Sherwood Rowland, Frederick Reines and James 
McGaugh, pioneering researchers into the ozone layer, the existence of 
neutrinos and human memory, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time soils chemist, Aldrich, who died Monday of cancer at 71, was the 
academic architect of the Irvine campus, taking the helm in the early 1960s 
when the campus was nothing more than an expanse of hills. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure lasted far longer than any other chancellor's in the UC system, and 
twice he was called back after retirement -- once to be acting chancellor at UC 
Riverside and later to the same post at UC Santa Barbara after its chancellor 
became embroiled in a financial scandal. No wonder Aldrich was affectionately 
described by UC President David P. Gardner as the university's "utility 
chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
Known as "Chancellor Dan" on campus, he successfully steered the fledgling 
institution through its early days and the turbulent '60s. He believed in 
hiring good people and then letting them do the job. He was at heart a New 
England farm boy who, despite his important educational positions, retained a 
sense of humor and always sought to maintain that down-to-earth touch. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Orange County and UC Irvine grew up together. Without Aldrich, 
there still would have been a new university established in one of the 
fastest-growing areas of the state. But Aldrich was the right choice for the 
time and task, and because of his work all of Southern California is better 
equipped to study, understand and solve the urban problems of its future.

DRESS CODE FOR CAB DRIVERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Clean clothes? Great! Buttoned-up shirts? Fine. No open-toed sandals? OK. 
Optional uniforms with company logos and ties? Why not. Better manners? 
Wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
But what possible public health, public safety or public interest need is 
served by the city of Los Angeles telling commercial taxicab drivers they can't 
wear plaid pants or leisure suits (Metro, March 30)? Are clashing colors and 
polyester illegal? Maybe a driver likes to wear striped pants in 13 day-glo 
colors. That's not illegal -- yet! 
</P>
<P>
I rarely have a need to ride in a cab, but if, I did my sole concern would be 
getting to my destination safely, quickly and without being overcharged. The 
color or pattern of the driver's pants might not be what I would choose to 
wear, but it's not my business (nor should it be the city's) to play the role 
of a fashion expert. 
</P>
<P>
What's next -- regulations on what color shirt my hair stylist can wear? What 
if the city had outlawed narrow ties for its employees 10 years ago, when wide 
ties were in? (Now, of course, it's just the opposite.) Will we need a corps of 
fashion police to enforce these silly laws? With all the city's problems, let's 
leave fashion alone.

THE FLY THAT'S BUGGING SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Medflies are popping up in all sorts of places. Yesterday, West Los Angeles 
-- tomorrow? Still, the state says that it's sticking to its May 9 deadline for 
the end of widespread malathion spraying in some 350 square miles of Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. But it also says that it's reserving its right to 
spray, once or twice, new areas of infestations. If necessary, the state says, 
a new infestation will be put down by malathion spraying first, followed by a 
release of sterile flies to breed the remaining pests out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
Make sense? While many scientists agree there is no pesticide more "innocuous" 
than malathion, the state's seemingly instinctive reliance on pesticides as the 
first line of defense against pests like the Medfly raises serious questions. 
So does proposed legislation by Assemblyman Norm Waters (D-Plymouth). The bill 
would extend indefinitely the exemption, scheduled to expire Jan. 1, 1991, that 
allows the California Department of Food and Agriculture to pesticide-bomb 
pests without an assessment of the effect on the environment (an environmental 
impact report). 
</P>
<P>
The pro-exemption lobby, which includes the agriculture department and the 
Western Growers Assn., argues that the state must be able to respond to 
infestations in a timely manner to avoid a permanent establishment not just of 
Medflies but of other destructive insects. But it makes no sense to extend the 
pesticide free hand indefinitely. Any stopgap measure is by definition 
temporary, to be used only until a permanent solution is found. But no 
permanent solution for combatting the Medfly is likely to be found as long as 
the state holds onto the pesticide security blanket. With no responsibility to 
demonstrate the environmental impact of using pesticides, the use of pesticides 
will likely remain the easiest feasible option to eradicate troublesome bugs 
and will prevent other options from receiving the degree of study, testing, 
planning and money needed to be develop them. 
</P>
<P>
Because there will likely always be some degree of ambiguity about the health 
effects of malathion, most residents of California would like to believe that 
the state would consider pesticide spraying, especially over crowded urban 
areas, as a last-resort method of eradication. But the Waters bill, and the 
department's support of it, suggests that the old-style mentality still 
prevails.

NOW THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT;

SECRET MEXICO-U.S. DRUG CHASE WAS A CONFIDENCE-BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officially, the top-secret aerial mission over northern Mexico didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, neither Washington nor Mexico City will confirm that a U.S. radar 
plane recently pursued a suspicious aircraft from Colombia into Mexican 
airspace. When the Colombian plane landed on a remote airstrip near Monclova, 
just south of the border, the U.S. Customs Service alerted Mexican authorities, 
who nabbed eight smuggling suspects and 1,700 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
But it did happen, as Times correspondents Marjorie Miller and Douglas Jehl 
have reported. The incident shows that two governments that have often been 
critical of each other, especially on the touchy issue of drug smuggling, can 
cooperate when they want to -- although that is not the main lesson of 
Monclova. Even before he was elected, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari was saying publicly that drug trafficking poses as great a threat to 
his country as it does to the United States. While Mexicans don't abuse drugs 
to the extent U.S. citizens do, the corruption that comes with drug trafficking 
helps undermine whatever trust Mexicans have in their police and, ultimately, 
their political system. And, sure enough, five suspects taken into custody by a 
task force of special Mexican federal agents at Monclova were local Mexican 
officials (the other three were Colombian citizens). 
</P>
<P>
So despite the cynical suspicion by many Americans that the Mexicans won't 
cooperate with us because they know that many of their own officials are up to 
their ears in drug trafficking, the Monclova operation was a success. One 
likely reason: It was kept quiet until after it happened. That's a noteworthy 
contrast to the flap caused recently when Pentagon officials boldly announced 
they were sending a Navy task force to anchor off Colombia to intercept drug 
smugglers without bothering to tell the Colombians first. The outcry in Bogota 
proved that Mexicans are not the only Latin Americans sensitive about 
heavy-handed gringo interference. 
</P>
<P>
So if Washington has more operations like Monclova in mind -- and it should -- 
the odds of success are higher if it avoids making big, public productions out 
of them. It just takes some sensitivity to Latin Americans' sensibilities. They 
know that their people are involved in drug trafficking, and that some of their 
cops are crooked. But so are some of ours. Instead of shouting about it, let's 
offer help quietly, so nobody gets embarrassed. That way only the bad guys wind 
up angry and frustrated.

BELCHER TOO MUCH FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: PITCHER SHOWS NO ILL EFFECTS OF SHORTENED SPRING TRAINING AS HE WINS, 
1-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you read somewhere that a short spring training would hurt power pitchers 
like Tim Belcher? 
</P>
<P>
After what happened in the Dodgers' 1-0 victory Tuesday night at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, try telling that to the radar gun. Try telling that to the 
inside of catcher Mike Scioscia's glove. 
</P>
<P>
Then try telling that to the San Diego Padres, whose bats were rendered useless 
by Belcher as he allowed only three hits. 
</P>
<P>
You read right. Throwing fastballs that hit Scioscia's glove as hard in the 
ninth inning as in the first inning, Belcher made a mid-April night sound like 
August. Two days into the season, it was the longest outing in the major 
leagues thus far, and it'll probably be the most impressive for some time. 
</P>
<P>
He did not walk anyone and faced just two batters over the minimum of 27. And 
he did this with just three weeks of spring training, after just one official 
spring game. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Belcher needed just a fifth-inning home run by Juan Samuel, who with 
Hubie Brooks becomes the second Dodger newcomer to win a game with a homer in 
two games this season. But he took care of the rest himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like a good spring training workout," Belcher said afterward with an 
embarrassed grin. "Really, I feel like it's still spring training. I don't feel 
like I was overpowering. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like last August or September where I felt like whatever I threw up 
there, they weren't going to hit it. . . I was just able to get a few pitches 
up there where I wanted them." 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, last August and September. Belcher was the best pitcher in the league 
during that time, going unbeaten in his last eight starts of last season, at 
7-0 with a 1.25 earned-run average. That stretch helped him lead the major 
leagues with eight shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he yielded a first-inning single to Roberto Alomar, and then picked 
him off first base. He gave up a fourth-inning single to Tony Gwynn. He gave up 
a two-out, ninth-inning single to Phil Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
And nothing more. He threw 110 pitches, 30 more than in his final spring outing 
in a triple-A game in Vero Beach last Thursday, but he threw no wild pitches, 
and certainly showed no signs of a weak arm. 
</P>
<P>
This despite having thrown so little this spring. Tuesday was the first time 
since last season that he had pitched to Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out there for the opening warmups and I said, 'Oh, it's Scioscia,' " 
Belcher said after disappointing the Padres home opener crowd of 52,254. "I 
guess I really had not worked that much." 
</P>
<P>
That is small consolation to the Padres, favored by most to win the West 
Division. In their first two games this season, they have managed just three 
runs against four Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in 66 games that the Padres had been shut out, the 
longest such streak in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"All Tim Belcher did tonight was put on a clinic," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"It was just a little short of perfection. He knew what he wanted to throw, and 
where he wanted to throw it, and that's exactly what he did." 
</P>
<P>
In the Padre ninth, with most of the 52,254 fans still in the park, he retired 
the first two left-handed hitters he faced, Garry Templeton and Mike 
Pagliarulo, on fly balls to left field. This meant they could not get around on 
his fastball. After the single to Stephenson, Belcher finished the game by 
retiring the left-handed hitting Alomar on another fly ball to left field. 
</P>
<P>
"Even then, they couldn't catch up with him," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Padres hit 13 fly balls, nine to left field, which Belcher 
translates to mean he was a bit lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"They say this is a game of inches, well, tonight it was a game of fractions," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was asked if Belcher was ever one batter from leaving the game, 
considering the bullpen was working through the last couple of innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was three batters ahead of staying in the game," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Padres' Tony Gwynn: "He didn't lead the league in shutouts for 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored their run in the fifth, but typical of night in which they 
got nine hits, they should have had more. Alfredo Griffin began the inning with 
a line drive between first and second base, his second hit of the night, and 
third in his first five at-bats of the season. Belcher bunted him to second, 
setting up a nice plate appearance with a runner in scoring position for 
Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
One pitch later, catcher Benito Santiago caught Griffin wandering off second 
base. He threw to second baseman Alomar, who threw to third baseman Roberts, 
who tagged the charging Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
This cost the Dodgers a run, as Samuel belted a 2-2 fastball over the 
left-center field wall for his first homer. He had just 11 last season after 
averaging 18 in his previous five big-league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell said his shoulder felt better Tuesday after he threw lightly on 
Monday, adding, "The next time I throw could be in a game." That could come as 
soon as today, although it's more likely he'll make his season debut Thursday 
or Friday. The Dodger bullpen ace said that because the shoulder has been stiff 
since he struck out the side in one inning against Atlanta a week ago in spring 
training, he has not wanted to "cut loose" until he felt certain it would not 
cause problems. He said he will have to cut loose (throw hard) before entering 
a game, and will probably do it in the bullpen on the first night he is ready 
to pitch. "If it feels fine in the bullpen, I'll come in the game, and if it 
doesn't, I'll sit down," Howell said.

On April 10, 1982, the Kings won the Miracle on Manchester game. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, on the eighth anniversary of that event, came the Massacre on 
Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, scoring early, often and with record efficiency, routed the Calgary 
Flames, 12-4, before a sellout Forum crowd of 16,005, giving the Kings a 
three-games-to-one lead in their best-of-seven opening-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
There were three King hat tricks, an NHL playoff record. Between them, Dave 
Taylor, Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom scored on nine of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had only four previous playoff hat tricks in their entire history. 
</P>
<P>
The former King playoff record for points in a game was four. Three Kings -- 
Granato, Sandstrom and Wayne Gretzky -- had five apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky tied another Kings playoff record with four assists. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 goals are the most the Kings have ever scored and the Flames have given 
up in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
It also ties the Kings' all-time record for goals in any game. 
</P>
<P>
Up in the owners' box, Bruce McNall, the Kings' current owner, and Jerry Buss, 
the previous owner, were almost too shocked to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned," McNall said. "It was crazy up there. Pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson came by to offer congratulations. He had just seen Showtime on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is mind-boggling," Taylor said, "when you look at the stats. You are going 
to have a game like that where the puck has eyes and they find the corners and 
they go in the net. We can't get too fat because we scored a dozen goals. We 
just have to go to Calgary and get the fourth win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Calgary Coach Terry Crisp: "We're totally humiliated and totally 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' attack was ignited by two Flame penalties. 
</P>
<P>
First, Al MacInnis was called for holding Jay Miller. Then, Ric Nattress 
received a double-minor, for cross-checking and unsportsmanlike conduct when he 
smacked John Tonelli after the King wing had already gone down. 
</P>
<P>
Given a five-on-three advantage for 1:34, the Kings got off only two shots and 
both missed the mark. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings didn't let the opportunity totally slip away, finally scoring 
with a man advantage at the 6:38 mark. Todd Elik, controlling the puck behind 
the net, flipped it out on the left side to Taylor, who shoved it past goalie 
Mike Vernon's glove side barely inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
That goal started a 5:17 span during which the Kings scored four goals on five 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
After Elik's goal, the onslaught continued: 
</P>
<P>
8:25 -- Granato scores his first goal of the night after Rob Blake, skating 
down the left side, appears to get knocked off the puck by Doug Gilmour. 
Granato gains control and fired from the left circle. Vernon, screened by both 
a Flame and a King, never saw the puck until it went past his glove. 
</P>
<P>
11:06 -- Wayne Gretzky, coming in from the right side, passed the puck across 
the middle under the glove of a diving Nattress to Sandstrom rushing the net 
from the left. Vernon had already come out on the right, leaving an open side 
for Sandstrom to smash the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
11:55 -- With Rick Wamsley replacing Vernon, Luc Robitaille left a drop pass 
for Elik in the slot. His shot was wide to the right, but Wamsley got a glove 
on it, knocking it down. That left it sitting on the ice on the right side, and 
Dave Taylor scored his second goal of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
While the Kings were busy filling the net with pucks, the Flames were 
struggling to get a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't get their first until after 16:04. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added three goals -- Jay Miller's first and the second of the night 
for both Granato and Sandstrom -- to take a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's goal proved that the puck was bouncing the Kings' way. 
</P>
<P>
From behind the Calgary goal, he took a shot that bounced off the net. 
Undaunted, he shoved the puck in front. It bounced off MacInnis' skate and 
rolled past Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Otto and Paul Ranheim scored for Calgary in a span of 22 seconds, but the 
Kings came right back with a goal, Wayne Gretzky's first since his back injury. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to score from the right side, Gretzky was blocked by both Nattress 
and Wamsley, both of whom tried to push him out of position. 
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky held his ice, arched his back and, without looking, shoved the puck 
behind him, by both Nattress and Wamsley into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Elik also scored for the Kings, and Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk closed 
out Calgary's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames can take solace from the fact that the series is not over. And from 
the fact that Game 4 is. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Miracle on Manchester occurred when the Kings came back from a 5-0 deficit 
to beat the Edmonton Oilers, 6-5, in overtime during a 1982 best-of-five 
playoff series the Kings won, three games to two.

FINLEY IS SHARP IN 7-0 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: HE ALLOWS TWO HITS IN 6 1/3 INNINGS. DOWNING, DAVIS AND BICHETTE HIT 
HOME RUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He pitched as clean a game as anyone could want, but Chuck Finley wasn't afraid 
to get down and dirty in order to get the Angels their first victory of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Locked in a foot race with Seattle's Harold Reynolds in the sixth inning after 
Reynolds had hit a grounder to first baseman Wally Joyner, Finley took a toss 
from Joyner and, with no regard for the safety of his valuable left arm, flung 
himself at Reynolds to make the tag. Finley and Reynolds tumbled into the dirt 
behind first base, a tangle of arms and legs that could have produced a serious 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it produced an out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those deals where you don't have that many outs, and if you want 
to stay out there, you have to make those plays," he said. "A couple of innings 
before, I was kind of slow getting to a couple of balls. It was my time to get 
my butt off the mound." 
</P>
<P>
What he did on the mound, though, was even more impressive. Finley allowed only 
two hits in 6 1/3 innings, both to Henry Cotto, and benefited from home runs by 
Brian Downing, Chili Davis and Dante Bichette as the Angels blanked the 
Mariners, 7-0, Tuesday night before 23,508 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Downing's homer in the seventh produced three runs, and Mark Eichhorn preserved 
the shutout with 2 2/3 innings of two-hit relief, earning his first save as an 
Angel and his first since June 2, 1988, when he was with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe now the Angels will correct the spelling on the nameplate that's affixed 
to the top of his locker. "There's supposed to be two 'h's,' " he said, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
But some things turn out better than they're supposed to. Like Finley, who went 
five innings in an exhibition game against the Dodgers last Friday and wasn't 
supposed to last more than five against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect five, hope for six and beyond that, you don't have any right to 
expect anything," Manager Doug Rader said. "What really makes it difficult is 
when a guy is doing that many dominating things and you know there's no way 
he's going to finish the game, yet you want to leave him in as long as you can. 
</P>
<P>
"You know there's not much chance he's physically fit to finish the game, but 
when he's going like that, you've got to milk it as long as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Finley milked it skillfully, striking out two and walking only one on 78 
pitches. It was the walk he issued to Alvin Davis in the seventh that ended his 
evening, not the fall he had taken the inning before. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried. He's one of those tough Louisiana guys," Rader said. "If you 
can eat the food, you can take a tumble like that." 
</P>
<P>
Finley had felt his fastball drop off as the game progressed, and he was glad 
to last as long as he did. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole night, I was really pleased with the way I was around the plate," he 
said. "I didn't expect to be that sharp. Lance (Parrish) did a great job of 
mixing pitches. I was spotting my fastball. The next thing you know, it's the 
fourth inning and you're a little deeper into the thing than you thought you'd 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Home runs by Davis and Bichette in the second put Seattle starter Randy 
Johnson, who played basketball and baseball at USC, into a 2-0 hole. 
</P>
<P>
Finley protected that lead well, aided by a fine throw from Bichette in right 
to shortstop Mark McLemore, who in turn relayed to third baseman Rick Schu to 
cut down Cotto after he tried to stretch a double into a triple in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Schu came up with a sparkling defensive play in the eighth to help Eichhorn 
preserve the shutout, after Edgar Martinez had doubled and moved to third on 
Cotto's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Schu snared Dave Valle's shot to third, held Martinez, and got Valle at first. 
Then pinch-hitter Scott Bradley ended the inning with a grounder to second. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, the designated hitter Tuesday night after missing Monday's opener -- 
the first opener he'd missed in 11 years -- padded the lead to 5-0 in the 
seventh with his three-run homer to left off reliever Jerry Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray, with a run-scoring single, and Wally Joyner, with a sacrifice fly, 
accounted for the Angels' final two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Eichhorn was grinning broadly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be back in the American League," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn split last season between Atlanta and its Richmond farm club and was 
signed by the Angels as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing Lach told me when I got here was that my bread and butter was 
my forkball," he said. "I guess the last couple of years I lost confidence and 
went with my sinker and slider. In the eighth inning I went with the sinker (on 
Martinez's double) even though it was a five-run ballgame. Guess I'm just 
hard-headed." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitcher Mark Langston, who will start against his former Mariner 
teammates tonight, said he will block out memories of his old friendships once 
the game starts. But he confessed that he misses his old roommate, Alvin Davis, 
with whom he used to share post-game snacks. "It's tough to eat a whole pizza," 
Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. is a dutiful son. Remembering that Tuesday 
was the 40th birthday of his father, Cincinnati outfielder Ken Griffey, Sr., he 
asked the Mariners' public relations director, Dave Aust, to call Houston -- 
where the Reds were playing -- and put a congratulatory message on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, who was limited to designated hitting Monday because of persistent 
tightness in his groin, was in left field Tuesday, with Devon White in center 
and Dante Bichette in right. Claudell Washington, a left-handed hitter, was 
removed from the lineup against the left-hander Randy Johnson. Washington also 
has a plantar's wart on his left foot, but padding in his shoe alleviates his 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has to do with Johnson, and a lot has to do with Chili being able to 
play the outfield," Manager Doug Rader said of the lineup changes. Bichette, he 
said, "may end up platooning with Claudell. It depends on who produces and is 
swinging the bat. I don't believe in strict platoons. It might be a reverse 
platoon where Claudell hits left-handers better than right-handers. That 
happens a lot."

MELVIN DURSLAG: FIRING OF MUSBURGER CASE OF OVEREXPOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You sit in mild shock, reconstructing what has happened in the wake of Brent 
Musburger's uncoupling by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
What you have is an uncomplicated case of a television guy getting bounced. 
What has resulted is an earthly crisis, leaving you to ponder several points, 
none of which is important, but all of which tend to show intriguing interest 
in television reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Sports events on TV today seem to pale in importance to the way they are 
announced. Show us a viewer and we will show you a formidable authority on the 
broadcasting art. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude may be an extension of what one finds in newspapers, now grown 
serious in their appraisals of how someone calls a match on television. 
</P>
<P>
A bum in the booth would seem to be television's problem, not ours. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers review television, but television doesn't review newspapers, maybe a 
break for newspapers. The upshot is, if Red Smith, or Grantland Rice, or John 
Lardner, late giants of sports print, were writing today and got bounced, 
eyebrows might arch. But you announce the removal of Brent Musburger, American 
colossus, and the republic quakes. 
</P>
<P>
Brent isn't a bad fellow. We first encounter him as a baseball writer in 
Chicago, enjoying a spectacular paucity of success. Discouraged with his job, 
he starts dabbling in radio, then in television, quickly to rise as a large 
personality in the industry, earning wages in seven figures. 
</P>
<P>
When this happens to Brent, he can't believe the outrageous nature of TV, 
rewarding people with such treasure, for such labor. Brent goes along, 
tittering. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the way many begin in broadcasting. Then an interesting 
transformation occurs. The money is soon taken for granted and the principal 
gets serious about himself and his functions. He is moving in an orbit of 
luxury hotel suites, dinners at Lutece, limos, even chartered jets. 
</P>
<P>
Outside stadiums, autograph seekers besiege him. Solicited for talk shows, he 
tells long stories about his flight from New York -- like an actor. From a 
listed telephone, he goes to unlisted, from where he shifts to an arrangement 
whereby one telephones a second party, who contacts the third party to see if 
he will return the call of the first party. 
</P>
<P>
The first party isn't always successful. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of some who rose to executive producer, they wouldn't even return 
calls to their announcers. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producers ordered documentaries, dramatizing for viewers the work of 
their staffs and themselves. One wound up such an epic removing his headphones 
on camera, lighting a victory cigar and telling his group, "Great show, guys." 
</P>
<P>
So sports television, at the network level, is no business for one whose head 
is readily turned. Dazzled by the glamour, the adulation and the money, he sets 
himself up for a mighty depression when the foot arrives. 
</P>
<P>
For one who pulled the string 15 years, Musburger comported himself better than 
most, always conscious of the circus in which he performed, the absurdity of 
the pay and the frailty of the job. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until a few days after his canning that Brent slipped, appearing on 
two networks to tell viewers of his unfair deal. He was forgetting the wisest 
of maxims, namely, only suckers complain. 
</P>
<P>
Brent was forgetting, too, about the 15 years he fooled 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Howard Cosell, most distinguished in broadcast journalism to land on 
his organ of hearing, forgot. Howard decimated just about everyone -- 
producers, directors, colleagues in the booth and noblemen of the press. 
</P>
<P>
In a cultural exchange one time with your venerable correspondent, Howard 
shouted: 
</P>
<P>
"I have had the most hostile press in America. I have been called a company 
pimp, a prostitute and a man with no trace of decency or morality. I have been 
vilified by people who have made no effort to look into my background, my 
education and my honesty." 
</P>
<P>
He then added, thoughtfully: 
</P>
<P>
"And I know your story will make me look like a horse's ass." 
</P>
<P>
His genius for prophecy was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
But Cosell had a rare gift in his industry. He not only was the talent, but the 
agency that promoted the talent. And the agency had a devotion to the client 
that warmed the heart. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the business rose higher than Howard and he, too, was destructible, 
vanishing into the pack, whence he came. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in sports broadcasting should remember the deathless words of the late 
Harvey Kuenn, who said of baseball managing, "All of us are going to get fired. 
It's just a matter of how long we can last until it happens." 
</P>
<P>
The Musburger firing flabbergasts you, not for the atrocity of the act, but for 
the commotion it has stirred. What has happened is, in TV, a tribute to form.

GRAF RETURNS, SCORES THUMBS-UP VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steffi Graf, sidelined since breaking her right thumb on Feb. 6, said she felt 
fine Tuesday and needed only 45 minutes to beat Petra Langrova, 6-1, 6-0, in 
the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships at Amelia Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked women's player said the thumb, broken in a skiing 
accident in Switzerland, was not a problem and predicted the layoff will help 
her in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed maybe two or three tournaments, but I don't think it hurts me at 
all," Graf said. "I felt good being away. It should keep me fresh for other 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
The match was the first for Graf since Feb. 4, when she beat Arantxa Sanchez 
the final of the Pan Pacific Open in Japan. Two days later, Graf fell on her 
right hand trying to evade photographers at St. Moritz, Switzerland. She 
originally hadn't planned to return until April 30, but the thumb healed 
quicker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Graf has lost to Gabriela Sabatini in this tournament each of the last 
two years. Sabatini defeated Claudia Kohde-Kilsch, 6-2, 6-1, in their 
second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tournament where I haven't done as I have in others, but I lost twice 
with Gabriela playing above her level," Graf said. "I want to (win) this time." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said it took hours of practice to regain command of her game. At times 
during the layoff, she said, she played left-handed because of stiffness in her 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"It took days to hit my first backhand," she said. "It took me days to hit my 
first overhand, the first volley. It was kind of funny, but it was good because 
there was always something new to be happy about." 
</P>
<P>
Other second-round winners included No. 4 Zina Garrison, 6-3, 6-7 (7-1), 6-0 
over Barbara Romano; No. 5 Natalia Zvereva, 6-2, 6-2, over Ann Grossman, and 
No. 8 Gretchen Magers, 6-1, 6-4, over Camille Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Jaite of Argentina, seeded No. 2, beat West German Markus Zoecke, 6-1, 
7-6 (7-1), to advance to the third round of the Count of Godo tournament at 
Barcelona, Spain. Carlos Costa of Barcelona upset ninth-ranked Petr Korda of 
Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and eighth-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria lost 
to Goran Prpic, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calgary seems to be going up in flames, but it should be remembered that as 
recently as last year a team rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit to win a 
Smythe Division semi-final series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That team was Los Angeles, which overcame Edmonton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cancel those orders for pipes and slippers for 34-year-old Dave Taylor, who 
scored a hat trick Tuesday, and 38-year-old Larry Robinson, who has saved his 
best hockey of the season for the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When three players from the same team score three goals apiece, should it be 
known as a hat-trick hat trick? 
</P>
<P>
Question from the 1980s: How will the Lakers do the year after Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar retires? Answer: They will improve their regular-season record. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' victory over Dallas Monday night was their 58th of the season, one 
more than they had all last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At this pace, they will compile their third-best won-lost record since moving 
to Los Angeles from Minneapolis for the 1960-61 season. They're 58-17. In 
1971-72, they finished 69-13. In 1986-87, they were 65-17. Next best were three 
62-20 finishes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Next question, of course, is how will they do after Magic Johnson retires? Do 
not expect any improvement then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Magic is unstoppable when he drives and sacrifices his body as he did against 
the Mavericks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The drafting of Vlade Divac as the 26th player in the first round was equal 
parts the Lakers being smart and the rest of the league being dumb. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the joys of any basketball season is listening to Chick Hearn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roy Tarpley of the Mavericks fits the description of a player who is available 
on a "day-to-day" basis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Terry Price of the Hartford Courant calls Saturday's Michael Nunn-Marlon 
Starling fight "Camp Confusion vs. Camp Calm" and reports that Nunn was late 
for a workout Monday afternoon in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Caesars Palace is trying to line up a doubleheader featuring Mike Tyson and 
George Foreman against modest opposition in June. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I still don't understand why the Angels -- who drew only 38,406, compared to 
48,686 for the Dodgers -- chose to open their Anaheim Stadium season at the 
traffic-jam hour of 6 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, I say never take out a pitcher when he has a no-hitter going, but 
Texas Ranger Manager Bobby Valentine was justified in yanking Nolan Ryan on 
opening night after he threw 90 pitches in five innings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Bruce Hurst was the only major league pitcher to go the distance 
Monday. . . . Wonder if Hurst would have been allowed to pitch to the Dodgers' 
Hubie Brooks in the eighth inning if the Padres still had Mark Davis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Rodney Peete and Oscar winner Denzel Washington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose will appear in Las Vegas on May 20 at a baseball card show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger publicist Steve Brener has become the agent for former Dodger 
outfielder Mike Marshall. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics will miss the fielding and timely hitting of Tony 
Phillips as much as they will the power of Dave Parker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You know Commissioner Fay Vincent is a baseball fan when he stays for all nine 
innings of Pittsburgh's 12-3 victory over the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who were overrated last year, are underrated this year. . . .

ROUT BEGINS EARLY AS L.A. KEEPS ITS COOL;

<P>
FLAMES: KINGS' 4-0 FIRST PERIOD LEAVES CALGARY PLAYERS SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS 
THAT NEVER COME.

<P>
When the horn sounded at the end of the first period Tuesday night at the 
Forum, the capacity crowd of 16,005 roared in approval. 
</P>
<P>
But as they made their way slowly to the locker room through a tunnel beneath 
the stands, the Calgary Flames did not. 
</P>
<P>
They looked dazed. 
</P>
<P>
They looked confused. 
</P>
<P>
Two nights earlier, the defending Stanley Cup champions had been victims of 
only the fourth short-handed overtime goal in the history of the NHL playoffs, 
Tony Granato's game-winning shot Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the Kings led, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
And it had been 4-0 before the Flames put a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Wing Gary Roberts poked at the floor three times with his stick as he reached 
the locker room, and a teammate smashed his stick against a basket of towels, 
but mostly the Flames filed quietly -- and politely -- past a couple of 
security guards and a handful of curious onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames' game plan, it seemed, had failed them badly. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and tried to intimidate us," defenseman Rob Blake of the Kings 
told a Prime Ticket audience before the second period. "They took a penalty 
early in the game and we capitalized on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept running around and we kept our composure. We put three past (Mike) 
Vernon (the Flames' starting goaltender) and one past (Rick) Wamsley (Vernon's 
replacement), so we came out and did what we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
And more. 
</P>
<P>
Only 26 seconds after defenseman Al MacInnis of the Flames had gone to the 
penalty box for holding Jay Miller at 3:46 of the first period, teammate and 
fellow defenseman Ric Nattress joined him, Nattress having been assessed a 
double minor for cross-checking and unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"Our energy and emotion was directed in the wrong way," Nattress said. "Instead 
of just being physical and ready, we were over aggressive. We had opportunities 
for the puck, but we went after the man. It's always nice to get the hit, or 
the big play -- but you've got to do the right thing at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings weren't able to capitalize on the two-man advantage, but Dave Taylor, 
after taking a pass from behind the net by Todd Elik, lifted a power-play goal 
into the upper right corner of the net at 6:38 to start the Kings on their way 
to a 12-4 victory that gave them a 3-1 lead over the Flames in their 
best-of-seven Smythe Division semifinal playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
Blake had a hand in the second goal, which undoubtedly will show up on 
highlight films long after this series has ended. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie from Bowling Green University, who joined the Kings in the last week 
of the regular season, seemed to have been taken out of the play when checked 
by Doug Gilmour as he carried the puck into the Flames' zone. 
</P>
<P>
But Blake left the puck for Granato, who took it to his left before rifling a 
shot from the left circle that made its way through the legs of Gilmour, Blake 
and MacInnis and past Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
"It started off as a four-on-two, but the guy caught me from behind, so I kind 
of just left it," Blake said. "I didn't know Tony was coming, but as it went, 
he put it through all three (pairs of) legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty good shot, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
But, as it turned out, only the second in a long series. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Sandstrom and Dave Taylor scored for the Kings before the end of the 
period. The Flames managed to put their first shot on goal only 3:45 before the 
end of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the period ended. 
</P>
<P>
The rout would continue. 
</P>
<P>
As the Flames emerged from the locker room after the first intermission, wing 
Tim Hunter tried to cheer them up. 
</P>
<P>
But most exited the room as quietly as they had entered. 
</P>
<P>
Their nightmare wasn't over. 
</P>
<P>
And, as they filed past, it seemed as if they sensed it.

THESE HIGHPOINTERS HAVE 50 GOALS

SALISBURY, Conn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Things are looking up for Doug Heroux and Bill Conroy. Again. They are 
collectors, of a sort. Hobbyists with high ideals -- 50 of them. 
</P>
<P>
The upwardly mobile duo have set their sights on reaching the highest point in 
each of the 50 states, from Alaska's lordly Mount McKinley (20,320 feet) to 
Florida's lowly Britton Hill (345 feet). 
</P>
<P>
So far, the two have already bagged peaks in 26 states. More than three years 
into their quest, the team is lagging a bit behind the initial goal of knocking 
off 10 peaks annually for five years. They are too late to be among the first 
10 climbers to complete the lofty pursuit, as they had hoped, but they should 
have no trouble being part of the first 100. 
</P>
<P>
Heroux, of Waterbury, Conn., and Conroy, from Naugatuck, Conn., aren't alone in 
their quest; others are on the way up. Highpointers, a national club, was 
recently formed (Heroux and Conroy are members), and now guidebooks and 
organized group ascents are available to all. 
</P>
<P>
The team's fascination for peak experiences grew out of a passion for hiking 
and climbing in New Hampshire's White Mountains, still their favorite spot for 
training. Their idea of a good time is a midwinter climb up Mount Washington. 
There, on the Nelson Craig trail just a few weeks ago, Heroux was tromping 
through waist-deep snow and Conroy was blown 40 feet by a gust of wind. That 
was fun. And they actually liked waking up in a hoarfrost-coated tent, their 
drinking water transformed into a chunk of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's highest point is on a shoulder of Mount Frissell, a mountain 
whose peak rises in Massachusetts. It is a hill they know well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our practice mountain," Heroux said. "We've done it in winter, in summer, 
in the rain, in the mud, in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
Frissell is basically a walk-up, and for Heroux and Conroy, a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Other summits are even easier; some require no climbing at all. The two sloshed 
across cornfields in a Winnebago all the way to the roof of Nebraska. At least 
half the nation's high points are within equally easy reach. 
</P>
<P>
But even easily climbed mountains may harbor unexpected challenges. An angry 
bull gave chase while the two were high-pointing in North Dakota. To reach 
their goal, Heroux and Conroy had to figure out how to get around the 
cantankerous beast. 
</P>
<P>
And more malevolent obstacles may await. Some high points are on private 
property where trespassers -- even those who ask permission -- aren't welcome. 
"I heard shotguns are involved in some of the high points," Heroux said. 
</P>
<P>
A few top spots are demanding, though, and four are very difficult: 
Washington's Mount Rainier, Wyoming's Gannett Peak, Alaska's Mount McKinley and 
Montana's Granite Peak. These require advanced climbing skills. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley is so daunting that when Conroy first thought of topping out in 50 
states, he listed the high points and then nixed the idea. No way could he 
climb to the summit of North America's highest mountain. People die there. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 years later, he teamed up with Heroux. The two decided to dust off the 
list of high points and hit the trail. 
</P>
<P>
At Mount Frissell a few weeks ago, Heroux and Conroy are preparing for their 
climb beneath a threatening pewter-gray sky. They will curl around Bear 
Mountain, cut across the stony dome of Round Mountain, plunge into a valley and 
chug up the steep rocky brow of Frissell. In all, a hike of 8 to 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Heading out of a trail-head parking lot, Heroux, a stringbean of a guy, 
shoulders a 35-pound backpack stuffed with essentials: a few plastic jars of 
premixed Tang, a couple of candy bars, a few pieces of triple fudge cake and 
plenty of pricey outdoor gear. "Just in case there's a white-out, I'll have 
everything we could need," he says. Mostly though, the heavy pack is carried 
for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Conroy, a Kenny Loggins lookalike, carries nothing. The 40-year-old gets his 
exercise in more perverse ways -- donning a 60-pound backpack, for example, and 
boarding a treadmill set at maximum incline for a one-hour workout. Or maybe 
he'll run a few miles; he plans to compete in the New York marathon this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The two plod toward Frissell with the measured pace of those accustomed to 
walking great distances: sure and steady. They don't waste breath talking. The 
clank of caribiners (metal rings that fasten ropes to the metal spikes used in 
climbing) dangling from Heroux's pack fills the silence -- that, and the squeak 
of his Day-Glo green hiking boots. 
</P>
<P>
Their path threads thickets of shoulder-high mountain laurel, fords creeks, and 
meanders through forests thick with mixed hardwoods. Hiking has little appeal, 
says Conroy. What drives them onward is the challenge of reaching a peak. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the two practice climbing techniques while dangling like spiders from 
ropes in the rafters of a warehouse Conroy uses for his moving business. 
Heroux, 32, is a self-employed plumber. "We needed time to hike," Heroux 
explains. "So we both started our own business." 
</P>
<P>
They also needed time to get in shape. Conditioning is the key to reaching the 
top of the tough summits. 
</P>
<P>
Take Mount McKinley. There, climbers fly into a base camp on the Kahiltna 
Glacier, rope together, then stagger upward through oxygen-thin air, ever wary 
of yawning crevasses. With each climber lugging more than 100 pounds of gear, 
reaching the summit often takes two or more weeks. During their attempt last 
May, Heroux and Conroy said they felt lost in the gaping vastness, dwarfed by 
the mountain's gargantuan scale. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, altitude sickness forced Conroy to turn back at 11,000 feet. "My 
lungs filled with fluid," he said. "I could hear them gurgling. That worried me 
a little." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Heroux and a group of other climbers and guides pressed on to 17,000 
feet -- eight hours from the summit -- only to be hammered by a storm and 
nailed down for days. "We were holding on for dear life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm-enforced idleness depleted their food supplies, so the summit 
remained elusive for Heroux, too. They plan to try again. 
</P>
<P>
Another tough climb, one the duo did notch, was Washington's Mount Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
It was on their first visit to the mountain, a tourist trip to a place called 
Paradise, that the men hatched their 50-state scheme. Awed by Rainier's beauty, 
they decided to return the next year, take lessons and make the climb. They 
figured if they could reach Rainier's summit, they could hit the other 49 high 
points. A year later, they came, they saw and they conquered. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone understands their high-minded obsession. "When you tell people you 
drove all the way to Delaware to stand in the middle of the street (where that 
state's high point is located), they think you're pretty strange," said Heroux. 
</P>
<P>
But in a sense, the high point quest is just an excuse to travel. "That's the 
key to this whole thing -- to see the country," said Heroux. "I don't want to 
travel to England or something, there's so much to see in the U.S." Each trip 
has been duly recorded -- complete with maps and photos -- in a series of 
leather-bound scrapbooks kept by Heroux. After nabbing all 50 high points, he 
wants to hit every national park in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Until their next major mountain assault, the two are content in dreaming up 
variations on a theme, new ways to reconquer nearby peaks. Lately they've 
plotted a way to bag the high point in each of seven states within a single 
24-hour span. They'll start at the top of Backbone Mountain (3,360 feet) in 
Maryland, then race to Delaware and on to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut 
and Massachusetts. The climax would be Rhode Island's Jerimoth Hill: "You 
arrive at the top of a hill, park the car, see if the dog's chained, walk into 
a guy's backyard and stand on a rock." Heroux said. "You've done Rhode Island."

GUN DOG SHOWDOWN TESTS POINTERS, FLUSHERS TO DETERMINE HUNTER'S BEST FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If your dog won't sit on command, can't tell a quail from a cat and never 
points at anything but his food dish, he could have learned something at Norco 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Some of man's more useful friends demonstrated their skills in that special 
partnership between hunter and dog. No snooty Westminster show this -- prancing 
around an air-conditioned arena for a lousy blue ribbon. This was down in the 
dirt, find that bird, bring it back, food on the table and a pat on the head -- 
all the reward in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Good dog. 
</P>
<P>
The Gun Dog Showdown at Raahauge's hunting club was staged by the Quail 
Unlimited's San Gabriel Valley chapter as a contest between flushers and 
pointers "to determine the best hunting dog in Southern California," according 
to the billing. 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . 
</P>
<P>
That debate will rage forever but, to avoid further suspense, the winner and 
runners-up were, in order, pointer, pointer, flusher, flusher, pointer. Dog 
lovers can draw their own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Jasper and his father, Herk, the first- and fifth-place finishers, are German 
shorthaired pointers who were run by Jim Collis, a professional dog trainer 
from Lake Mathews who seemed embarrassed that someone might think he was a 
ringer. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't want to win," he said. "I mean it." 
</P>
<P>
But his dogs couldn't help themselves. Herk, his work done, would still be 
standing stone-still on point for an empty bird trap if Collis hadn't 
physically pulled him away. 
</P>
<P>
The best flushers, placing third and fourth overall, were Bob Sanchez's little 
brown and white springer spaniel, Sam, and his Labrador retriever, Woody. 
Sanchez, who also has trained hunting dogs professionally, said it isn't very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"You can train any dog to point," he said. "A point is just a prelude to a jump 
. . . getting on the game. Generally, the Labs are the easiest. The pointers 
like to run and hunt, but the Labs want to please you more." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Langdon of Rialto, whose German shorthaired pointer, Bonnie, placed a 
close second to Collis' Jasper, said: "These dogs are real easy to train. All 
you have to do is teach 'em their name. They know more about hunting than we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The contest would prove that point. 
</P>
<P>
There were 42 entries, with two brushy fields 75 by 150 yards planted with one 
chukar partridge in each of three spring-loaded traps marked by colored stakes. 
A hunter had 10 minutes and five shells to bag the birds. Less time and unused 
shells were credited for points. Two judges graded the dog on efficiency, 
responsiveness to his handler and retrieving. 
</P>
<P>
When the dog indicated he had located a bird, a nearby judge would release the 
trap remotely with a garage door-type control, the bird would be launched 10 
feet into the air, and the hunter would try to shoot it. 
</P>
<P>
From that simple format, it's amazing how many things can go wrong. Take the 
springer named Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
As Jackson's handler snapped his fingers, the little dog broke like a shot, 
running at top speed back and forth across the field -- "quartering," it's 
called -- until it located the first trap and pounced. The bird sprang out, but 
it all happened so quickly that the handler couldn't trip his safety before the 
bird was out of range. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also found the other two birds, but his handler missed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a case of the dog doing an excellent job, but the handler was 
nervous," said one judge, Mike Mathiot, who is Western Regional Director for 
Quail Unlimited. "That's the best springer I've seen. That dog was red-hot." 
</P>
<P>
Another handler kept insisting his dog go one way -- away from a bird -- when 
the dog knew better. Even grabbed him and pushed him once. 
</P>
<P>
"You never do that," Mathiot said. 
</P>
<P>
But the dogs are forgiving. Boone, a yellow Lab owned by Ray Chafe of Santa 
Ana, sniffed out all three birds in 3 minutes 46 seconds -- fastest time of the 
day. When Chafe shot the birds, Boone picked them up and returned to sit 
quietly by Chafe's left leg, bird in mouth. 
</P>
<P>
But Chafe lost points because he took an extra shot at his first bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Stupidity on my part, buddy," he told Boone as they walked out of the field. 
"You did your part. I choked." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Bittle of Midway City worked with Susie, a German shorthaired pointer 
who had trouble finding the downed birds. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the matter with (her) today?" Bittle said in exasperation. "Usually 
she brings 'em back to me on the run." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Susie picked up a loose bird in the brush and struck a perfect point. 
The bird flushed, and Bittle knocked it down. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're there, my Susie will find 'em, that's for sure," Bittle said. 
</P>
<P>
Herk, rated a master hunting dog by American Kennel Club trial, is 8. Collis 
said a good dog can work until his teens. 
</P>
<P>
"His father died at 15 and was hunting the year before," Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
Collis uses a whistle to get his dog's attention, hand signals to direct him 
and, occasionally, verbal commands -- "come around" to turn the dog, "whoa" to 
stop him. Most dogs don't need to be told to keep moving, but some 
inexperienced dogs may wander aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Not Herk. At a swing of Collis' hand, he bounded into the field at a steady, 
purposeful lope, head up and all senses on full alert. From downwind, he locked 
in on the chukar scent from the first trap and came to a solid point 10 yards 
away. The bird sprang, Collis took deliberate aim, fired, and the bird fell. 
Herk hadn't budged. 
</P>
<P>
"Fetch," Collis said, and Herk fetched. 
</P>
<P>
After only 5 1/2 minutes, the game was over, but Herk wanted more. He struck a 
point at an empty trap, totally concentrated. A photographer walked all around 
Herk taking pictures. Herk didn't even blink. The only thing moving was his 
bobbed, quivering tail. 
</P>
<P>
Collis said: "He'll stay there till the cows come home." 
</P>
<P>
The Gun Dog Showdown was less formal than an AKC field trial, and what was 
proved remained open to question -- even to Collis, the winner. Is a pointer 
better than a flusher? 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a fair question," Collis said. "It depends on what you want out of 
the dog." 
</P>
<P>
The dogs work differently, depending on a combination of instinct and training. 
Jerry Johnson of La Verne worked with Peg, a black Lab. 
</P>
<P>
"A pointer, when he gets scent, will stay away from the bird . . . (and) 
usually lock up and go on point -- actually put their nose down, bring their 
paw up, get their tail out," Johnson said. "A Lab will come up, get the scent 
and they're after 'em. They push 'em right out of the (cover)." 
</P>
<P>
John Carnakis said: "A springer spaniel, as soon as the bird flushes, they're 
taught to sit down. Then when the bird is shot, they have them go and retrieve 
on command." 
</P>
<P>
Collis said: "As a field dog, your pointing dog or your springer is probably a 
better dog than the Lab. The Lab is a good field dog and an outstanding water 
dog. When I go up north to Alturas for ducks, I take my Lab, because you're 
talking zero to 32 degrees and times when the dog has to break ice to retrieve. 
These (pointers) can do it, but it's really rough on their bodies. They don't 
last as long as a Lab will. 
</P>
<P>
"The springer is one of the best pheasant dogs. He can work the birds close and 
he's fast. Bobwhite quail, you wouldn't stand a chance. They'd push those birds 
out and you'd never get a shot. But a pheasant, he'll get the pheasant between 
you and him, push it in to you. That's an ideal springer, and most of them work 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
In this particular contest, before Jasper, a pointer, brought back three birds 
in 4 minutes 10 seconds, Collis said: "I would give the edge to the springer or 
the flushing dog because he puts the bird up instantly. The minute he gets near 
the bird, he puts it up, while we're waiting for the dog to point it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you didn't know where the marker was, I'd give the edge to the 
pointing dog. He'll go out there and find it and he'll stay there until you get 
within range. With a flushing dog, you might let him get a little far away and 
you might have a 60-yard shot instead of a 20-yard. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea of an ideal pointer is a dog that will go out, find the bird, hold the 
bird, hold as the bird goes, you shoot, then you send the dog and he brings it 
back to your hand." 
</P>
<P>
Points weren't deducted if a dog dropped a bird at a hunter's feet. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hunter preference," Collis said, "but I like 'em to bring it back to 
the hand, because if the bird is (only) wounded and they drop it at your feet, 
as soon as the bird's down, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
A good hunting dog will cost $250 to $300 as a puppy, then $200 to $300 a month 
to train, for a minimum of three months. 
</P>
<P>
And if a hunter had to choose one all-purpose dog? 
</P>
<P>
"First choice is German shorthaired," Collis said. "Second choice is Lab. If I 
was just hunting duck, I'd use the Lab, but because I hunt quail, pheasant, 
chukar, dove and duck, I use the shorthair more than anything."

Well, that settles it . . . or does it?

BUDGET DEFICIT CASTS PALL ON DFG'S PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game, strapped by dwindling hunting and 
fishing license revenues, is prepared to reduce its operations by as much as 
20% unless a projected $8-million budget deficit can be made up elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Director Pete Bontadelli emphasizes that in directives sent to the 
various divisions -- Inland Fisheries, Marine Resources, Wildlife Management, 
Wildlife Protection, Environmental Services -- "we did not ask them to make 
cuts. We asked them to put (their programs) in ranking order." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has offered the DFG some suggestions on meeting the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"They say we can reduce expenditures, raise license fees or shift to 
alternative fund sources," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The alternate-fund suggestion includes "all sorts of options," he said, one not 
being a dip into the state's general fund to help hunting and sportfishing 
programs, which are supposed to be self-supporting. Section 711 (c) of the Fish 
and Game Code prohibits that, although the general fund is used for non-game 
programs (711 (a), 712). 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli said that he does not want to increase sport license fees, adding 
that he hasn't given up on the General Fund despite Section 711 (c). 
</P>
<P>
"That's a section that needs to be reviewed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG's funding process may be in need of a total overhaul. In the 
environmentally aware 1970s and '80s, especially, the department was handed a 
list of responsibilities not included in its original mandate, which dealt 
mainly with hunting and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Among other duties, the DFG now has to oversee the cleanup of off-highway oil 
spills, take care of threatened and endangered non-game species -- which far 
outnumber game species -- and spend thousands of man-hours preparing documents 
to justify hunting seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature concedes as much in Section 710 of the Fish and Game Code, 
stating in a 1988 amendment of the code that the fact that ". . . the 
department has not been properly funded . . . (has) prevented proper planning 
and manpower allocation . . . (and) has resulted in inadequate non-game fish 
and wildlife protection programs." 
</P>
<P>
One longtime DFG employee calculated that the department's proposed budget of 
$141 million for the next fiscal year amounts to only 0.27% of the state's 
total budget of $53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature could double our budget and it would still be only one-half of 
1%," he said. "But it would do tremendous things for fish and game." 
</P>
<P>
The DFG's financial fix has caused Bontadelli to spend much of his time in 
budget meetings, which is one reason he hired James Dwight as a deputy director 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight, 55, is a certified public accountant who was associate director of the 
Federal Office of Management and Budget in 1972-73 and chief deputy director of 
California's Department of Finance from 1966 to 1972. He recently retired after 
15 years with a Washington accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight, who will make $78,252 per year, becomes Bontadelli's fifth deputy. 
</P>
<P>
However, that's only one more than he had when he became director in November 
of 1987 and, considering current events, Dwight's talent for figures should be 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
Baja fishing: Marlin fishing has been fairly slow from Cabo San Lucas to La Paz 
but light-tackle fishermen at the East Cape region of the Baja peninsula aren't 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Snyder of Encino recently returned from three days at Hotel Punta Colorada. 
His catch: three striped marlin, 30 dorado, two pargo and a few cabrilla. 
</P>
<P>
Dorado to 20 pounds have been providing most of the action, but yellowfin tuna 
to 40 pounds and pargo upward of 30 pounds are being taken as well. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Overall winner of last weekend's Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby was Tim 
Crissman of Newhall with a 31.2-pounder caught Saturday. Crissman gets his 
choice of a trip to a resort in Alaska or Mexico, or an outboard engine. Second 
place went to Wallace Kroutkramer of South Pasadena with a 24.6-pound fish, and 
third to William Northington of Redondo Beach with a 20.4-pounder. There were 
1,950 participants who caught 463 legal-sized halibut during the two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
The drive for an initiative that would ban gill nets along the Southern 
California coast is going strong, with 775,000 signatures gathered so far, 
according to Jim Paulk of the Committee to Ban Gill-Nets. The committee needs 
595,000 signatures by May 7 to put the measure on the November ballot, but is 
aiming for 950,000 to assure that enough of the signatures will be valid.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WESTLAKE CATCHER HITTING HIS STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one time, they couldn't give Mike Lieberthal away. He was a tiny 12-year-old 
who wanted to play with the bigger boys, but they didn't care to play with him. 
</P>
<P>
Howie Shwartzer, a coach in the Woodland Hills Senior League, could only smile 
when a league official offered him this scrawny kid who wanted to play with the 
13-to-15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
"He called and said he had a little guy from Westlake named Mike Lieberthal," 
Shwartzer recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The book on Lieberthal was that he was 4-foot-9 and probably couldn't hit his 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Shwartzer, who had previously coached Lieberthal and knew otherwise, tried not 
to sound sarcastic. "Well, we'll do the best we can with him." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lieberthal is 6-foot, 165 pounds, and has become the player everybody 
wants. The senior at Westlake High is hitting .558 with nine home runs and 24 
runs batted in, and is one of the most sought-after prospects in the nation. 
Area scouts project him to be selected in the first three rounds of major 
league baseball's June 4 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a better catcher in the nation, I want to see him," one scout said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers avoid throwing him strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts scribble notes. 
</P>
<P>
Students organize fan clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The kid who pleaded for an opportunity to play varsity baseball at Westlake 
High, who spent endless hours collecting as many blisters as line drives in a 
batting cage, has become a minor legend on the Westlake campus. 
</P>
<P>
"You begin to wonder what it is that this kid can't do," said George Genovese, 
a professional scout for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
The hiss of the pitch broke the silent anticipation of the crowd last Wednesday 
at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal shifted his weight, turned his hips, snapped his wrists. And as the 
ball kept sailing, he headed toward first base in a sprint-turned-trot. As he 
rounded third, his teammates patted him on the back and pounded his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, who already had taken a curtain call after his third home run of 
the game, had just hit his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
He blasted a three-run shot off Simi Valley ace Kenny Hood in the first inning. 
He drove a fastball over the left-field fence for a solo shot in the second. He 
turned a curveball into a grand slam in the fifth. And, in the sixth, he 
deposited a low fastball on the junior-varsity field some 400 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal's fourth home run tied a Southern Section record set by two other 
players. He drove in 10 runs and had five hits. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the most awesome performances I've ever seen," Simi Valley Coach 
Mike Scyphers said. "Mike is the best catcher I've ever seen at the high school 
level. He just has that aura about him, and really stands out." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lieberthal barely had a leg to stand on when he entered Westlake High four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He had played with minor league baseball players as a 14-year-old competing in 
a winter league. But a 5-4, 130-pound ninth-grader out of Colina Intermediate 
School had trouble getting into Coach Dennis Judd's sixth-period baseball 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into his office every day for about a week, begging him to let me in 
the class," Lieberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Judd was persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd do anything," Judd said. "Not only to get into the class, but he'd do 
anything on the baseball field. He'd play anywhere you asked." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal worked his way into the starting lineup at second base. Judd's 
decision to start a freshman, rather than a senior, drew criticism from 
parents. "I took some heat, but he was very talented," Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal wasn't an instant hit, and a designated-hitter occasionally filled 
his spot in the batting order. But his father directed him toward their 
back-yard batting cage. Dennis Lieberthal invested about $1,500 in the cage and 
a pitching machine when Mike was 9. With his mother, Anita, feeding the machine 
(once taking a line drive in the face), Mike worked in the cage as long as two 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents used to tell me that he was playing too much baseball, that I 
was pushing him too hard," Dennis Lieberthal said. "But I wasn't pushing him, 
he was pushing himself. It's hard to explain that to people." 
</P>
<P>
Mike's dedication became an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many times when he was 10 years old and his friends were out riding 
bikes when he was in the batting cage," Dennis Lieberthal said. "He could have 
gone out with them, but he just stayed home and hit." 
</P>
<P>
Mike said he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I know baseball is my future, and whatever I do now will dictate what happens 
in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal has played more than 400 games the past four years. Two summers ago, 
Dennis Lieberthal hired Doni Green, a former Simi Valley track coach and an 
assistant at Cal Lutheran, to improve his son's running form and speed. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lieberthal worked with Green for about two hours a day, five days a week. 
Then he would leave for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very hard worker," Green said. "And a pretty busy cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most critical to Lieberthal's development as a player was his 
experience playing with minor league players on winter league teams sponsored 
by the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros and Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal has caught Trevor Wilson, who pitches for San Francisco's triple-A 
affiliate in Phoenix and briefly pitched for the Giants last season. Lieberthal 
singled off Eric King, a former Royal High player who pitches for the Chicago 
White Sox. And he doubled in his only appearance against Roger Salkeld, the 
former Saugus pitcher who was selected third overall by Seattle in last June's 
major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
Genovese said Lieberthal's skills made up for his lack of size. 
</P>
<P>
"George kept yelling, 'Hey, kid! Who ya play for? Who ya play for?' " Dennis 
Lieberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike replied, "Colina!" 
</P>
<P>
Genovese scratched his head. "Where?" 
</P>
<P>
"Colina Junior High!" Mike said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lieberthal has played for Genovese's winter league teams and 
developed a close relationship with the scout who signed George Foster and 
Garry Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to describe Michael is to say that he comes to the ballpark to 
beat you," Genovese said. "He plays the game as if it was a religion, and 
you'll probably see him in the big leagues in about three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to find a scout who isn't fond of Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw him was during a tryout camp last year," said one scout 
who requested anonymity. "He threw a ball down to second and I said, 'Who is 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal throws the ball from home to second base in 1.8 seconds; 2.2 is 
considered average at the major league level. He runs to first base in 4.5 
seconds, which is above average for a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Some don't need numbers to be impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him catching during an infield practice, and that was all I needed to 
see," said Ray Poitevint, vice president of the Milwaukee Brewers. Poitevint is 
a former scout who has signed 60 players who have played in the major league. 
</P>
<P>
"Just his footwork and arm were enough to impress me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal drove away from his four-homer game in a BMW with personalized 
license plates that read MIDLINF. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year starter at shortstop during his sophomore and junior seasons, 
Lieberthal moved to catcher this season. He played the position in the rookie 
leagues, and decided the move would provide him with a better opportunity to 
play major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quicker ticket to the big leagues because everybody's in need of a good 
catcher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His catching skills have been honed by the Dodgers' Rick Dempsey. And his 
lanky-but-strong build has led to comparisons with the San Diego Padres' Benito 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Poitevint prefers a comparison with Enos Cabell, a player he signed out of L.A. 
Harbor College who was overlooked in five drafts but eventually enjoyed a 
15-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
"Enos would do whatever had to be done, and that's how I feel about 
Lieberthal," Poitevint said. "The first one to the field and the last one to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal picks runners off base from his knees, and his soft hands behind the 
plate impress scouts, who follow every move. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to get real nervous," Lieberthal said. "I'd try to throw the ball too 
hard, or try to make a perfect throw every time, and it would just screw me 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, who received his first letter from a university when he was 14, 
will sign a letter-of-intent today with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
But Lieberthal may never step into the batter's box at Packard Stadium. If he 
is drafted in the first two rounds, he will sign a professional contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just the money," said Dennis Lieberthal, a part-time scout with the 
Giants and a successful businessman. "It's the investment they have in you for 
the round. A first-round pick is pretty much a sure thing, and they're given 
every opportunity to prove themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Mike said if he signs a contract, he will work on his education during the 
off-season. Poitevint recommends that approach. 
</P>
<P>
"This boy, with the type of skills he has, isn't going to refine them playing 
college baseball," Poitevint said. "He can always go to school, but he can't 
always become a professional baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
His father agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"If he plays pro baseball, he's not giving up an education, he's giving up a 
chance to play college baseball," Dennis said. "Now, it would be different if 
Michael had a dream to be a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't. Lieberthal's idea of defense involves blocking a 55-foot 
curveball. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a professional baseball player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I'm not drafted in the first two rounds, I'll be completely happy with 
going to Arizona State. I'll go there, work hard, and hope I'm drafted again 
after my junior year." 
</P>
<P>
The chant echoed from Westlake's bleachers as he approached the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
"Dong, dong, dong!" they yelled. 
</P>
<P>
Two pitches later, he sent a hanging curveball into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
After he crossed the plate, the chant took a different tone. 
</P>
<P>
"God, god, god!" 
</P>
<P>
The billing, as humorous as it is, now follows Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
He has led Westlake (15-0) to the No. 1 spot in the 5-A Division and a No. 5 
national ranking by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Shwartzer knew his tiny second baseman, who also did some catching, would be a 
catch someday. He even teased his starting catcher, Mike Urman, who was 
selected in the second round by the Atlanta Braves in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to joke around with Mike and tell him that this little kid was going to 
be a better catcher than he ever was," Shwartzer said. "Little did I know that 
my words would come true." 
</P>

Home runs by Keyaan Cook and Dylan Jones knocked El Camino Real High from the 
ranks of the unbeaten Tuesday as Montclair Prep posted a 7-6 victory in the 
semifinal round of the Thousand Oaks baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a senior, belted a three-run home run off junior right-hander Terry 
Morrow (0-1) to give Montclair Prep a 3-0 first-inning lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a junior designated-hitter, added a solo home run in the second inning. 
Montclair Prep (14-2) added three runs in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Kevin Grant (7-1) scattered eight hits and stifled a 
seventh-inning rally for the win. With one out and runners at first and second, 
Gregg Sheren hit a fly ball to the warning track in center field. Both runners 
advanced on a wild pitch before Jason Cohen flied to left to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep plays Agoura today at 1 p. m. for the tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier quarterfinal game, El Camino Real (10-1-1) scored 11 runs in the 
fourth inning en route to clobbering Canyon, 12-1. Junior right-hander Corey 
Bromberg (1-0) struck out eight while pitching a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen hit a three-run home run and Sheren had a solo homer.

NEWSWIRE: LAGUNA SECA TRACK CALLED DANGEROUS, BOYCOTT URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Sheene, a former world motorcycle racing champion, said Tuesday in 
Brisbane, Australia, that the United States Grand Prix cycle race should be 
moved away from the Laguna Seca track in Monterey, Calif., and urged a rider 
boycott if the race is held there again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Sheene, the 500cc world champion in 1976-77, made his plea after Australian 
Kevin Magee was critically injured when he crashed in the race there last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Magee, who broke a leg in a fall at the same track last year during an incident 
in which Bubba Shobert suffered serious head injuries, was still listed in 
critical condition Tuesday at San Jose Medical Center, where he had surgery to 
remove a blood clot on his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Wayne Gardner, another former world champion, and American Kevin 
Schwantz also fell during the race, and four-time world champion Eddie Lawson 
broke his right heel and left ankle during a fall in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Sheene, a commentator on Australian television, said of Laguna Seca in the 
Brisbane Sun: "The place is a dump. If I was still riding, there is no way I'd 
race there." 
</P>
<P>
He said the main dangers at Laguna Seca were the lack of runoff areas and the 
skid-inducing white markings.

CONSUMER VIEWS: 'BOLTING' AS EARTHQUAKE PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In view of the severity of damage caused by the San Francisco quake, 
would bolting structures to their foundations reduce earthquake damage 
substantially? Also, what does the recently announced $360-million earthquake 
bond issue involve? -- N.H.J. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There's a lot to be said for the bolting idea. Fred Turner, a 
structural engineer with the California State Seismic Commission, says: "I 
believe that anchoring housing to foundations and 'cripple walls' is the best 
form of earthquake insurance anyone could buy." 
</P>
<P>
The seismic commission is developing statewide policies on earthquake 
preparedness. Actually, Turner adds, bolting housing to its foundation may not 
be necessary, depending on where you live. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Long Beach quake in 1933, state legislation was passed specifying 
seismic fittings for all new structures," Turner says. "However, for private 
structures, this was made optional except that Los Angeles, Long Beach and a 
few other cities went a step further and made it mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
This means that if you live in Los Angeles and your home was built after 1933, 
your foundation and house probably are already anchored. 
</P>
<P>
What makes anchoring particularly appealing, according to Shirley Mattingly, 
director of the Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, and Carl Deppe, 
chief of the earthquake safety division of the L.A.'s Department of Building 
and Safety, is that it's a relatively simple procedure and not too costly. 
</P>
<P>
What's involved, Deppe says, is anchoring wall plates to the foundation with 
bolts "either bolting directly through a plate that sits on top of the 
foundation or utilizing angle irons. The biggest problem, of course, is getting 
in there because the under-floor clearance makes it a tight fit. That's where 
bolting sideways, with angle irons, may be the most practical way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But in addition to bolting, Deppe and Turner emphasize, it's also necessary to 
stiffen and brace the cripple walls, normally with plywood. These are short 
walls -- 1 1/2 to 2 feet high -- extending from the wood floor to the footings. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Mattingly, Deppe and Turner agree, bolting and shoring up the 
cripple walls is practical only for single-family residences. (Multiple-unit 
structures require more extensive earthquake retrofitting.) The cost of such a 
project is unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"Conceivably," Turner says, "a homeowner who is pretty handy could, with the 
proper instruction, do it himself. Otherwise, you're going to have to call in a 
contractor and it might be as little as a few hundred dollars for an 
uncomplicated job, but perhaps a couple of thousand -- depending on the size 
and complexity of the house. And, of course, if you're talking about hillside 
houses or homes on stilts, it's going to be much more than that." 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue now before the Los Angeles City Council, which you mentioned, is 
a two-part measure, according to Mattingly, and the larger portion, about $300 
million, is for funding to reinforce public buildings and public structures 
such as bridges. The balance of about $80 million, she says, is "for upgrading 
private housing through low-interest loans." 
</P>
<P>
The seismic commission is sponsoring legislation that would mandate angle 
bolting, the bracing of cripple walls and the erection of restraints on 
chimneys for all older housing.

LUKENS HOUSE A VICTORIAN GEM WITH MANY FACETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORETTA SCHERTZ KELLER, Keller is an Altadena free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind an evergreen hedge and wrought-iron fence in downtown Pasadena sits the 
Theodore Parker Lukens house, the perfect vehicle for a bit of time travel. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kislingbury makes the trip every day. 
</P>
<P>
Kislingbury purchased the Lukens house, an elaborate, 5,000-square-foot 
Victorian gem, in 1971. He and his wife, Ellen, now live there with their 
3-year-old son, James, and Kislingbury's daughters, Anne, 16, and Amy, 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Living here is old-fashioned fun," he says. "It gets me away from the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Passers-by on busy El Molino Avenue can catch a glimpse of the home's shingled, 
deep-pitched roof and its wide upper porch. Adorning the porch and large front 
dormer is a stick-style, Gothic gingerbread frieze, painted cream and blue 
against the earthen tones of the roof and wood siding. 
</P>
<P>
The house, completed in 1887, is set far back on an expansive lawn with 
towering palms. There's a circular fountain, and a worn Model T rests in front 
of a mock "cemetery" shaded by lush orange trees. But the tombstones mark no 
graves -- Kislingbury, 46, put them there for fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I got them from a stonecutter," he says. "They were leftover tombstones." A 
shirt-and-boots man, he delivers one-liners with an intense, deadpan 
expression, like the comedy writer he always wanted to be. Instead, Kislingbury 
is the proprietor of Delacey's Club 41, a restaurant in Old Pasadena, where 
he's opening a second eatery, The Right Spot. Near both he keeps a warehouse 
that he calls "Revolting Development," where he stores moose heads and serves, 
as his business card states, "cold beer, cigars and insults" to his pals. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the Lukens house for $32,500, and has since spent countless dollars 
and all his spare time to restoring it. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is like something out of Charles Addams' sketchbook. From the 
imposing foyer stairway to the three bed-sitting rooms, it's a treasure chest 
of wood and velvet -- voluptuous Americana at its bawdy, nostalgic best. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the poolroom, with its penny peep show and six-penny arcade slot 
machines -- one, an ornate 1905 Mills Dewey with the admiral's face sculpted on 
a musical cabinet. The jackpot is $2. In another slot the payoff is a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
Not lost among the glories is a five-sided window seat under a two-story bay 
window, one of six in the house. It sits next to the tile and brick fireplace, 
one of three. 
</P>
<P>
Taxidermy is a popular motif. A giant grizzly bear confronts one from his post 
alongside a cast-iron turtle spittoon. Mounted overhead are a caribou, an elk, 
a rhino and an African Cape buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't shoot the animals -- I just collect them," Kislingbury shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
If one wants to rest, there are two chairs made of steer horns, circa 1890. And 
a stool made out of an elephant's foot -- "It's a footstool," Kislingbury 
quips. 
</P>
<P>
Kislingbury's 19th-Century American art collection all but camouflages the 
gold-leaf-on-deep-red paper that covers the 12-foot walls. One work, a bar 
scene that rivals the best of the turn-of-the-century Ashcan School of 
realistic art, was reproduced on tin and given away to barkeepers by liquor 
distributors, he says. Posters advertise whiskey or cigarettes. And exquisitely 
sculpted, curvaceous ladies -- in the form of statuettes -- hold court 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
There's a 1905 Victrola in the parlor. An ornate Italian rocking chair, circa 
1860, with busts of two women projecting from its rolling legs, seems ready to 
sail the seas. Woody the chiseled dog, who sits nearby, has glass eyes. And 
Kislingbury's wife houses her doll collection under the figure of a hovering 
owl. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, there's an eight-burner stove. In the breakfast area, the 
family dines under a buffalo head and to the accompaniment of tunes from a 
jukebox. An adjoining bathroom has an ornamental cast-iron sink with original 
1885 hardware. And the dining room holds an antique piano crafted in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
The house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, was 
designed for Lukens, Pasadena's first real estate developer, by Harry Ridgeway, 
who also designed the city jail and some of Pasadena's early Methodist and 
Episcopal churches. 
</P>
<P>
The house's front parlor holds an 1890 portrait of the original tenant, who 
served two terms as Pasadena's mayor, then known as the president of the Board 
of Trustees, according to Lukens' biographers. 
</P>
<P>
A mountain peak in Southern California and a lake in Yosemite National Park, 
for which he urged federal control, are named after Lukens, a lifelong 
naturalist and a friend of Sierra Club founder John Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Kislingbury says he didn't know anything about the home's celebrated first 
owner until about a month after he moved in. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, Kislingbury, who was born and raised in Pasadena, hadn't 
thought much about his city's history. Now he and his family are living inside 
a piece of it.

FASHION PROGRAM MAKES DIFFERENCE, IS NAMED FOR AWARD

When Richard Gonzalez first showed up for Myrna Craig's fashion merchandising 
class at the East San Gabriel Valley Regional Occupational Program, he had 
purple hair, chains on his jacket and fingernails painted black. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Gonzalez, 17, of Covina, dons a suit and tie for his part-time 
job in sales and visual display for a Robinson's department store. 
</P>
<P>
Nez Camarena, 26, had to endure hassling from his buddies when he became the 
first male to take the class in 1976. "Gentlemen in fashion didn't go over very 
well then in Covina and Azusa, California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But this year Camarena returned to visit the class driving his Porsche 911. He 
said he is about to open his own kitchen design firm in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and Camarena are among the success stories to come out of the elective 
vocational course, which serves about 250 students from six local high school 
districts: Azusa, Baldwin Park, Charter Oak, Covina, Glendora and West Covina.

Now the fashion program is reaping a little success of its own. The state 
Department of Education has nominated it as California's choice for the 
Secretary's Award in Vocational Excellence, an annual award presented by the 
U.S. secretary of education to the best vocational education programs in the 
country. The winners are expected to be announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the West Covina-based fashion merchandising program has 
helped turn the tide for a number of students in gangs, on drugs or on the 
verge of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
"Myrna Craig takes high numbers of at-risk students and successfully intervenes 
and steers them to employment and success," said Gary Thompson, program manager 
for business education for the Department of Education. He said the East San 
Gabriel Valley program was chosen as the state's nominee for the national award 
over several hundred other outstanding vocational education programs throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They epitomize what we'd like to see happening," Thompson said. "An extremely 
strong curriculum, strong business community participation and an outstanding 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said about 80% of her students come from "low socioeconomic" backgrounds. 
At their home schools, the dropout rate runs between 30% and 40%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate in her program is lower -- about 10% to 20%, Craig said. She 
estimates that more than half the students who complete the fashion program go 
on to higher education. Graduates have attended the Fashion Institute of 
Technology in New York, Otis/Parsons Art Institute, Los Angeles Trade and 
Technical College, Mt. San Antonio College, Cal Poly Pomona, and USC. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the two-year program, students work for one school year as unpaid, 
part-time trainees in local stores. Last year, Craig said, all the students who 
worked as trainees were later hired for paid positions. 
</P>
<P>
"(The class) made me realize that there's more to life than having a good 
time," said Gonzalez, who is working part time at Robinson's as part of his 
senior year in the program. After graduation, he plans to enroll in a two-year 
art program at Los Angeles Trade Tech. "I mean, I still like punk music, but I 
know now that there's a time for play and a time for business." 
</P>
<P>
Lila Feingold, a Covina High School senior, said the teachers make the 
difference. "When a teacher teaches you math or English, they're there to teach 
you the basics, and when class is over, they're done. But (fashion program) 
teachers are here because they want to be here. They want to find out what we 
want to do, and then make us really good at it. They put in 100% more time and 
interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Feingold started taking fashion merchandising just to fill out her list of 
credits for graduation. But she soon found that she could not just sit back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting. I got really involved and I couldn't just walk away," said 
Feingold, who is working part time for an attorney and will attend Mt. San 
Antonio College next year. She said she would like to be a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Abel, another of Craig's students, said her teacher's enthusiasm was 
contagious. "I've never accomplished something like this before," said Abel, 
who conducted a seminar for learning-disabled students as part of the public 
relations component of the course. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, named this year's Outstanding Vocational Teacher in Los Angeles County, 
teaches her fashion merchandising students everything from color coordination 
and sales to public relations and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we do here has to be hands-on to keep this kind of student 
interested," said Craig, 50. 
</P>
<P>
She said she started out in the fashion industry as a model and has owned a 
fashion show production firm, Beaux Monde. Craig became a teacher in 1974 and 
joined the Regional Occupational Program staff five years later. "I gave up the 
business to do education. I'm a teacher first. I really feel I have to give the 
kids back something." 
</P>
<P>
The three other instructors in the program also have backgrounds in the fashion 
industry, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Their students don't just read about trademarks and advertising campaigns. In 
one project, they created their own mock cosmetic lines and labels, applied for 
copyrights, and recorded radio and television commercials touting the creams 
and hair gels. 
</P>
<P>
In another course segment, students went beyond merchandising theory and 
actually set up a store in their classroom, putting out accessories, dressing 
mannequins, pricing and tagging merchandise and marking it up or down. 
</P>
<P>
They also put on fashion shows, doing the lighting, publicity, music, 
videotaping and modeling. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Miranda, 21, a production assistant at a children's clothing 
manufacturer in the City of Industry, is a program graduate. "I was very, very 
impressed with the way Miss Craig went about devoting a lot of her time to the 
students," Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really career-choice-oriented. She devoted a lot of time into each 
student. She just actually sat down with the student and spoke to them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion students are a diverse group. Some are college-bound. Some are 
learning-disabled. Some have spent most of their school years dreaming up ways 
to get out of class. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my second senior year," said Shawn Raney , 18, of West Covina High 
School. "I was supposed to graduate last year, but I didn't. I'm not very into 
academics, but this class is not really like a class. Everybody has the same 
interests. It's more like a family." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the class not only teaches fashion, it boosts students' self-esteem. 
"This may be the first thing they're really good at in school," she said. "Some 
parents come to our fashion shows and it's the first time they've really 
noticed their kids."

U.S. ATTY. GEN. CLARIFIES USE OF DRUG ASSETS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: DICK THORNBURGH SEES NO BAR TO WIDE USE OF SEIZED MONEY AND 
PROPERTY TO PAY FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PROJECTS, INCLUDING JAIL CONSTRUCTION.

<P>
Frustrated by a long and sometimes contentious debate with Sheriff Brad Gates 
over how money and property seized in drug raids can be spent, Orange County 
supervisors have enlisted the aid of the nation's top law enforcement officer 
to clarify some hazy legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh met with Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez last week 
in Washington and assured the supervisor that all types of law enforcement 
programs may be funded, even jail construction, according to Vasquez and 
Justice Department aides. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth called the attorney general's comments to Vasquez 
"good news," adding that they help dispel the impression that seized drug 
assets cannot be used for certain kinds of programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some supervisors have complained that Gates cultivated that impression, 
occasionally leading them to believe that federal guidelines sharply limit the 
programs they can fund with seized assets. Gates denied that but said he has 
suggested that the assets be funneled back into drug enforcement activities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them to do with as they please," said Barry Stern, an associate 
deputy attorney general who also met with Vasquez during the supervisor's 
Washington trip. "We limit it to law enforcement purposes, but beyond that, 
it's their decision. They can buy a vehicle, buy firearms, build a jail, any of 
those things." 
</P>
<P>
The county is frantically searching for funds to build two new jails to relieve 
overcrowding, and the supervisors are simultaneously struggling with a 
projected $25-million deficit in the 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who sparred with the supervisors for months over the disposition of the 
213-acre Rancho del Rio in South County as well other seized drug assets, said 
Tuesday that he would review any suggestions, but he also expressed 
reservations about using drug assets for jail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the ranch's sale could help pay for a jail, operational costs would 
have to be borne by future budgets, Gates said. "Unless they want that jail to 
sit vacant, we better have an ability to fill it up with cooks and the other 
people that it takes to run it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez stressed later that he is not advocating that the ranch proceeds or 
other drug assets be used to help fund a new jail. But he and agreed that the 
idea is worth investigating. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Rancho del Rio, which was seized in a 1985 drug raid, would only 
defray a fraction of a new jail's cost. The Theo Lacy Jail expansion project, 
for instance, is estimated to cost $52 million, of which the county is paying 
$11 million. The 213-acre ranch is estimated to be worth about $2 million as 
is, though developers say it would be worth several times that with proper 
entitlements and road and water improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Before they could even consider the financial implications of funding a jail 
through drug seizures, however, supervisors needed to learn how the money from 
seized drug assets can legally be used. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said his continuing confusion led him to broach the topic with the 
attorney general on two occasions, first when the two of them traveled to 
Uruguay last year and most recently during an hourlong meeting in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
During last week's meeting, Thornburgh told Vasquez that the Justice Department 
would not object to seized assets' being used toward construction of a new 
jail, the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the attorney general: 'Could drug forfeiture monies be used for jail 
construction?' " Vasquez said. "The answer was yes." 
</P>
<P>
The result, Vasquez added, is that "the lack of clarity that once existed has 
been eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
How to use seized drug assets has been a longstanding point of contention 
between the supervisors and the sheriff, especially in regard to the creation 
of a DNA lab and disposal of the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Overarching that debate have been questions about the legal use of seized drug 
assets. A Jan. 19 letter from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles warned 
the supervisors that selling the property and using money from the sale to 
offset current and future sheriff's budgets would be a violation of the federal 
guidelines governing transfer of seized assets. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho del Rio "was deeded to the county of Orange based on the representation 
that the property would be developed into a law enforcement training center," 
U.S. Atty. Robert L. Brosio said in his letter. Selling the property and using 
the money to pay for existing programs would violate federal guidelines, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
That bolstered Gates' case for building the training center, but Grace Benton, 
public affairs officer for the Los Angeles attorney general's office, said 
Tuesday that the county would not be prohibited from using the money to build a 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to build a jail, they can do that," she said. "If they've talked 
to the attorney general, then they know that. He's the boss." 
</P>
<P>
Gates did not dispute the notion that proceeds from the ranch sale could be 
devoted to jail construction. He added, however, that he believes that seized 
drug assets are better used to fight drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to give special focus to the war on drugs, and that's what we feel 
is the most appropriate use of the money," Gates said. "We're always open to 
look at any proposal that the board thinks is a responsible use of the funds in 
this department, but I think the people of this county want us to focus on 
drugs."

STATE ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVE RACES; 
</P>
<P>
HILL TAKES BIG LEAD IN BITTERLY FOUGHT 31ST SENATE RACE 
</P>

<P>
Capping a bitter and expensive campaign, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) 
appeared headed for victory Tuesday in a special election for a state Senate 
seat in one of California's most Republican districts. 
</P>
<P>
Hill held a 3-to-1 lead over his Democratic opponent in early returns from more 
than 20,000 absentee ballots. The four-term legislator was seeking to replace 
state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), who resigned in December 
after serving more than 20 years in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said Tuesday evening that his campaign had spent more than $90,000 on an 
absentee-ballot strategy, but he was still surprised at the wide margin. "I 
think it's certainly larger than what I thought it was going to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill had more votes in just the absentee ballots Tuesday than he had when he 
won the special primary for the seat in February. He said the results made him 
optimistic about winning, but he said it was too early to declare victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 36, had been favored to win despite vicious attacks by his opponents who 
focused on reports that he has been targeted by the FBI in its investigation of 
political corruption at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I think it was a factor since 80% of the mail was focused on it," 
Hill said earlier in the day. "I think it was reassuring to find that the folks 
in the (Assembly) district I have represented for eight years trusted me and 
hung in with me." 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Janice Graham, 53, who opposed Hill in Tuesday's election, agreed that 
the Republican voters who dominate the district appeared loyal to Hill and that 
conservatives may also have been attracted to Hill's opposition to unrestricted 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a former schoolteacher who lives in Laguna Hills, had expected state 
Democratic leaders and abortion-rights groups to join her campaign when Hill 
narrowly defeated Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in a bitter 
primary in February. But statewide leaders said they still considered her race 
unwinnable. 
</P>
<P>
The 31st Senate District stretches from West Covina in Los Angeles County to 
Laguna Beach in Orange County. It has a registration edge for the GOP of about 
54% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian scheduled the race when Campbell resigned after more 
than 20 years in the Legislature. Campbell was named president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The third candidate on Tuesday's ballot in the 31st Senate District was Robert 
Lewis from the American Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
There were two other special elections Tuesday for openings in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County's 26th Senate District, Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier) was leading in the race for the Senate seat formerly held by 
Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who quit in February after his conviction on 
political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon held a large lead in the early returns, although the registrar had 
received only about 5,000 absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
A third special state election was held Tuesday in San Diego to fill an 
Assembly seat left vacant when Lucy Killea won election to the state Senate 
last December. With nine candidates in the race, none was expected to receive 
more than 50% of the vote, forcing a June runoff election between the top 
vote-getters from each party. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates -- five Democrats, three Republicans and a Peace and Freedom 
Party member -- were on the ballot. Former San Diego City Councilman Mike 
Gotch, a Democrat, and Republican Jeff Marston, a former aide to ex-U.S. Sen. 
S.I. Hayakawa (R-California), each had about a third of the votes in the early 
returns.

CRYSTAL COVE'S FUTURE CLOUDS LIVES OF MANY; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: AS THE STATE BEGINS TO TRANSFORM THE COASTAL PARK INTO A TOURIST 
ATTRACTION, LONGTIME RESIDENTS THINK AHEAD TO WHEN THEY WILL BECOME OUTSIDERS. 
</P>

<P>
For almost 16 years, Virginia McKinney has dished up date shakes and sandwiches 
from a wisp of a building perched high above the ocean and overlooking peaceful 
Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to stay, to build on the little business that has been a fixture 
there for so long, but next month she will leave. McKinney's Sunshine Cove date 
shake shack, just off Coast Highway between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach, is 
finally giving way to progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I've loved that little store," McKinney said of the tiny stand, which, since 
1945, has drawn motorists and bicyclists from the busy highway for a moment's 
rest. "I just get waves of nostalgia when I think I'm not going to be there. 
That's been my life." 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plan that will change the character of Crystal Cove State Park 
forever, the State Parks Concessions Board Tuesday reviewed bids from operators 
eager to replace McKinney and capitalize on a surge of tourists expected when 
the area is transformed from a quiet, residential beach community into a 
full-fledged park system. 
</P>
<P>
The state is requiring that besides food, the new concessionaire also sell 
umbrellas, suntan lotion and other merchandise more in tune with concession 
stands found at other state park facilities along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vellanoweth, chief of the Concession Programs Division for state parks, 
said from Sacramento that a new concessionaire would be chosen today for 
Crystal Cove. 
</P>
<P>
The management change is just one step in a larger plan to convert the park, 
almost 3,800 acres of hillsides and beachfront property sprawled along both 
sides of the highway for 3 1/2 miles, into a major attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Since the property was purchased from the Irvine Co. in 1979, state officials 
have been considering ways to protect the landscape while offering the public 
more picnic areas, overnight camping spots and a restored historic community. 
</P>
<P>
To make way for this vision of the future, however, Virginia McKinney is not 
the only one who will have to cut her ties with the past. Two entrenched 
residential communities, Crystal Cove and El Morro Beach Mobile Home Park, will 
also have to pull up stakes between now and the year 2000. While the lease for 
the mobile-home park does not expire until 1999, the lease for the 46-home 
Crystal Cove community expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be a good thing for everyone if we were able to stay," said 
Cinda Combs, whose grandmother first moved into one of the 46 Crystal Cove 
beach houses, cradled in the buffer zone between the highway and the surf, just 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, many locals are not looking forward to the changes such as 
those in store for Sunshine Cove. As far as Combs is concerned, pushcarts or 
canteen trucks at the ocean's edge will not improve the area's special allure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is rather a special beach," she said. "The people I know who come down to 
stay the day come because it's not like Huntington, not like Bolsa Chica. They 
don't come because they can get hot dogs nearby." 
</P>
<P>
But Alan Tang, associate landscape architect for the state Department of Parks 
and Recreation, said it was only reasonable for the state to provide enhanced 
recreation opportunities for the public after paying $35 million to acquire the 
park. An extended stretch of coastal property offers special opportunities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there could be an opportunity to provide accommodations and some 
recreation facilities you wouldn't find anywhere else along the coast," he 
said. "We see this as an opportunity to provide an alternative which can't be 
duplicated really anywhere else. Where else are there cottages by the ocean 
that the public at large would have access to, either as overnight 
accommodations or as a park-related function?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because we paid that amount of money, the public has a right to use those 
areas," he added. "Some of the best parts of the beach and the coastline are at 
Crystal Cove and at El Morro." 
</P>
<P>
State officials say they have been restoring natural vegetation on the coastal 
strip, which Tang said has been scarred by cars and dirt bikes. In addition, 
eight restrooms and a park headquarters and maintenance facility have been 
built and more than 1,000 parking spaces are now divided among seven parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Once Crystal Cove is vacated, Tang said, workers will begin rehabilitating the 
old, beachfront buildings while preserving the "historic ambience" of the 
homes, which were built in the 1920s and 1930s. Those homes will be available 
to the public to be rented for overnight stays or for special group events. 
</P>
<P>
To supplement what Tang said is one of the better underwater park areas in 
California, the state's plan also allows for the creation of support facilities 
for scuba divers, including a small shop on the beach where divers could refill 
their tanks or buy equipment, and areas where divers can drive near to the 
water to unload equipment before parking their cars. 
</P>
<P>
When El Morro Beach Mobile Home residents move from their 294 homes, those 
areas will probably be used to provide more parking, picnic areas and 
campgrounds, Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Peyton, whose family took over and expanded the 294-home mobile-home park 
in 1955, said residents don't seem to be worried yet about the "magic moment," 
Dec. 31, 1999, when their lease will expire and they will have to move. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody signed the lease that that's what they were going to do," Peyton 
said. "But nobody around here is really thinking about it that much yet." 
</P>
<P>
For Virginia McKinney, however, the moment is just around the corner. And 
whatever the public benefit, McKinney describes the transition in personal 
terms. Although she had hoped to keep her store, the changes have left her 
feeling disappointed and almost looking forward to the next month, when the 
lease expires and she can put the move behind her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can just coast out of there and retire with dignity," she said, "that's 
what I would like to do."

DIANNE KLEIN: GRAY HAIR CAN WASH YEARS OF SUCCESS DOWN THE DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Vince Boyle was on the other side, the side that hired and fired, 
the side that came up with all sorts of creative excuses for handling the 
unpleasantries of corporate personnel policy. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president for human resources, Boyle was in on the power meetings. He 
knew the mind set well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what's written down," he says. "It's what's said in the boardroom 
that counts. . . . It's a feeling, a psychological feeling." 
</P>
<P>
So when the time came, nobody spelled it out. Vince Boyle says he knew what was 
coming all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see the bullet headed straight at me." 
</P>
<P>
At 56 years old, Vince Boyle was too old, a virtual relic in the leaner, meaner 
world of corporate America. His company, an international financial firm in 
Newport Beach, preferred to call his departure part of a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the only one who had gray hair and some of them were older than me," 
Boyle says. "This was a joke in our company. Then you see them on the street, 
after we were all let go, and they all look like me. They were dyeing their 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
That was six years ago. Boyle hasn't had a steady job since. 
</P>
<P>
He takes what he can find, which isn't much. His wife works. He volunteers. He 
sends out resumes, hundreds and hundreds of them. Most aren't acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Boyle has done everything right. Except grow older. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Young, who will be 65 this month, left Texaco voluntarily after 17 years, 
seeking new challenges. He started his own oil-refining company, a small 
operation in Signal Hill, and more than tripled his income. In 1979, his best 
year, he reported an income of $92,000 to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
When the industry began hurting, and his company went belly up, Young became 
executive director of an industry-lobbying group for 15 months. That ended in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Today, listed last among the "highlights of qualifications" on his two-page 
resume, is this: Mature, dependable and very personable with good sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
That helps. 
</P>
<P>
Young has had to sell his house. For the past two years, he's been rooming with 
his ex-wife in her mobile home in Huntington Beach. He can't find a good job. 
Potential employers tell him that he's overqualified. He says that he'll take 
way less. 
</P>
<P>
They don't answer his letters. They say they'll keep his name on file. They 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
"They equate being old with being all used up," Jim Young says. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five months, Young has been working behind the deli counter at a 
Ralphs supermarket, serving salads and slicing cold meats. The department 
manager is 26 years old. Young earns $5.75 an hour, working on the average 
about 25 hours a week. He wishes that they would put him on full time. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Vitt, who lives in Orange, has a similar story. At 60 years old, he 
takes what he can, a little here and there. He is divorced; his two children 
grown. He has cleaned out the college fund that he set up for them years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago in January, Vitt and 41 other professionals were let go. He was 
a national sales manager -- in the wrong division. His company, in the 
machine-tool industry, shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
"For about a year after I was laid off, I thought I could get back into the 
industry," he says. "I went on probably 30, 40 interviews. After about 20, 30 
minutes, I'd be out the door, or they'd keep me there an hour, telling me that 
I was overqualified, that I was too senior a manager." 
</P>
<P>
Vitt, Young and Boyle are friends. They met through their involvement with 
Rancho Santiago College's now-defunct Older Worker Task Force, of which Vitt 
was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
They've talked to all sorts of community groups in Orange County. They can 
spout statistics, they can dispel myths. They are in good health, eager to work 
and contribute. 
</P>
<P>
The men talk of the graying of America, the declining birth rate, the 
downsizing of corporations nationwide, the two-way street that is company 
loyalty and the shortsightedness of companies that value youth over experience. 
</P>
<P>
The county's official unemployment rate of 3% doesn't include older workers 
such as them, who have been out of work for more than six months, who may be 
listed as "early retirees." 
</P>
<P>
"We've defined the problem," Young says. "But you don't get anywhere just 
defining it. We haven't cracked that wall of age discrimination, which is alive 
and well." 
</P>
<P>
"We're part of a throwaway society," Boyle says. "They should use us for Earth 
Day, recycle us." 
</P>
<P>
We are having this conversation in my office, exchanging bits of horror stories 
about the realities of the workplace in Orange County, where youth reigns 
supreme. 
</P>
<P>
Young tells of a co-worker at Ralphs who thinks that he's quite a brain. He 
explained to her that the deli scale with the digital display interprets .25 as 
a quarter-pound. She had no idea why that would be. 
</P>
<P>
At the pizza parlor that he owned a few years back, Boyle noticed that the 
workers had lined up their watches on a shelf near the front counter. He asked 
them to put them in the back, out of public view. 
</P>
<P>
Then one of Boyle's six children, who was managing the restaurant, explained 
why the watches were there. The employees didn't know how to read the clock on 
the wall. The watches' digital displays told them the time. 
</P>
<P>
The men say they've given up on self-pity, that now they're just talking common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years from now, we would not be sitting around here having this 
conversation," Young tells me. "Industry, businesses, will be forced to hire 
older workers. Demographics do not support today's attitude." 
</P>
<P>
After about an hour and a half, the men take their leave. They're heading for 
lunch together, to talk some more. They've got time to spare.

CITY'S OLDEST WORKER GOING STRONG AT 91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poring over a computer printout of every type of crime code listed at the 
city's Police Department, records assistant Murray Ross shakes his head 
incredulously at the thick stack of pages. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see all the stupid things that people are up to, it's amazing to me," 
he said. "I guess I have a Pollyanna attitude about overlooking deficiencies in 
human nature." 
</P>
<P>
Naive optimism, perhaps, but he makes no apologies. Ross, who turned 91 on 
Tuesday, believes that this quality has been the key to his long life. 
</P>
<P>
He is the city's oldest employee, and works 20 hours a week in the Police 
Department's records division, where he was hired in 1987 under its senior aide 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so sharp for a person his age. He's remarkable," said Pat Davies, Ross' 
supervisor. "We've really lucked out with our senior aide program in general, 
and Murray has been exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
And Ross said he may well continue working past his 100th birthday. Throughout 
his life, he said, he has faced obstacles much more formidable than age. 
</P>
<P>
A son of Russian Jews, he said he has never been daunted by the anti-Semitism 
he has encountered his entire life. As a theater manager through five decades, 
he survived the arrival of television that nearly devastated the movie 
business. 
</P>
<P>
And when doctors told him on two separate occasions that his days were 
numbered, he wouldn't believe them. 
</P>
<P>
The first time was in 1930 when, during the Depression, Ross was stricken with 
polio. At that time, the disease typically was a harbinger of lifetime 
disability or death. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the illness contributed to the demise of his first marriage and loss 
of his successful job with RKO studios in Los Angeles, and initially left him 
incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
But he kept on working. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Seattle to take advantage of a hydrotherapy program for polio 
victims, and landed another theater management position. Four years later, he 
was walking again. None of the symptoms ever recurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Things looked pretty bleak for a while though," Ross recalled. "I remember at 
the time getting a letter from the White House. President Roosevelt had heard 
about my situation and invited me to visit. I decided not to go, though, 
because I didn't think it would be of any help to me. I thought nothing would 
help me more than my willpower to overcome my deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Ross, at 85, developed an aortic aneurysm -- just weeks after he 
attended the funeral of a friend who died of the same affliction. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, he made a nearly complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ross said his health has been relatively good. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his job, he also heads up his block's Neighborhood Watch committee and 
helps care for his wife of 52 years, Mimi. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it? I'm going to be 91," he said a few days before his 
birthday. "I don't feel it, or look it or act it. I might just get to see the 
21st Century. My kids are taking bets on it." JOHN PENNER

FAMILY FILES CLAIM OVER CONCERT DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a Fountain Valley teen-ager who died in police custody outside a 
Grateful Dead concert at the Forum last December filed a wrongful death claim 
against the city of Inglewood on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, potentially a precursor to a lawsuit, says Patrick Shanahan, 19, was 
the victim of "summary execution" by overly aggressive police officers who 
struck him with their batons, applied a chokehold and did not start emergency 
first aid when he stopped breathing, said Lawrence Trygstad, the family's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police have maintained that officers did not use excessive force. 
They said Shanahan was uncooperative and under the influence of drugs when 
police arrested him outside the Forum on Dec. 10. Officers took Shanahan to a 
nearby hospital after he stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
An internal police investigation of the incident is continuing. In addition, 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating the police 
response, and the FBI is looking into whether Shanahan's civil rights were 
violated when police arrested him.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER PICKETED OVER TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 30 medical technicians and supporters picketed UCI Medical Center for an 
hour Tuesday to demand a raise. 
</P>
<P>
At one point a security guard threatened to have demonstrators arrested for 
disturbing the peace, but the pickets dispersed peacefully, said psychiatric 
technician Les Lyon, president of the technicians' union. 
</P>
<P>
The technicians carried signs that said: "First Class Hospital -- Second Class 
Wages," and "Mary Piccione -- You Got A Good Raise. Now We'd Like One." 
</P>
<P>
Piccione, director of the medical center, earned $136,163 annually until 
December, when her pay was boosted to $143,600 a year, a medical center 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Lyon said, the 714 members of his union -- a mix of licensed 
vocational nurses, ward clerks and medical technicians -- earn $1,400 to $3,000 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
Talks reached an impasse March 30, with union leaders seeking a 6% wage 
increase and administrators offering an average of 2.9%, Lyon said. Medical 
center officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon vowed to picket again soon if there is no movement in talks: "We've got to 
call some attention to this. This is my third year without a raise, and I'm 
looking at a 1% increase in salary. There's reason enough to be angry." LANIE

TACTIC LIKELY WON'T STALL JAIL EXPANSION

A last-minute court maneuver to block expansion of the Theo Lacy Jail in Orange 
is not expected to derail a lawsuit settlement reached last month that paves 
the way for plans to double the number of inmates housed there. 
</P>
<P>
The county, under federal court order to ease overcrowding in its jails, has 
been tied up in a legal battle over the Lacy expansion for two years. The Board 
of Supervisors voted in December, 1987, to expand the jail from 622 to 1,326 
beds at a cost of $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the Orange City Council voted to sue the county. Joining 
the city was Tishman West Management Corp., owner of The City shopping mall 
across the street from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Last month a state appellate court ruled that the county could proceed with the 
expansion plans. A few weeks later the city approved a settlement after county 
officials agreed to house no more than 1,326 inmates under normal conditions 
and 1,968 inmates in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Tishman West filed an appeal of the court ruling on Monday, but executives 
acknowledged that they and county officials are also close to reaching a 
settlement. However, Tishman West is asking for clearer limits on the number of 
inmates to be housed at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
"On the substantive part it's very close," Tishman West Vice President William 
Durslag said. "The appeal had to be filed within a certain amount of time or 
we'd lose our right to appeal but we're very optimistic we can reach an 
agreement with the county and put this thing to bed." 
</P>
<P>
County officials, however, indicated that they intend to reject the latest 
demands from Tishman West sent over in a letter to county officials last week. 
The Board of Supervisors was briefed Tuesday in executive session on the letter 
and the court appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth declined to discuss specifics of the case because of the 
pending litigation but said the county plans to proceed with its expansion 
despite the court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counsel Edward N. Duran explained: "I don't think they have 
that much of a chance on appeal. . . . It wouldn't necessarily delay anything."

LINCOLN SCHOOL COULD BE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Newport-Mesa Unified School Board, faced with growing enrollment at the 
elementary-school level, may decide as early as next week on the reopening of 
Lincoln School as an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The board is considering two options, according to Carol Berg, assistant 
superintendent. The first calls for Lincoln to be reopened for all the fourth- 
through sixth-graders within its zone. Under the plan, grades kindergarten 
through third would be housed at Andersen Elementary, Harbor View and Eastbluff 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The second option calls for Lincoln to be a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade 
school, with Andersen and Harbor View offering the same grades. A third school 
would be constructed in the San Joaquin Hills area. Eastbluff, currently a 
kindergarten center for the entire zone, would be closed, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
The board will consider the matter at its meeting next Tuesday, and parents of 
both Harbor View and Andersen students are invited to an informational meeting 
at 7 p.m. next Monday at the Phase 1 Harbor View Homes Clubhouse on Port 
Westbourne Place. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have formed an ad hoc committee to work with the board on the decision, 
which would not take effect until the 1992-1993 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Some committee members say they are frustrated by what they call the lack of 
information provided by the board on the first alternative, adding that they 
believe that the needs of the children would be better served under the second 
plan, according to committee spokeswoman Candi Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that your kindergarten teacher watches you grow through the time that 
you're in sixth grade . . . provides stability and security in a world that is 
changing so rapidly and putting so much pressure on kids," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
But Berg said unifying fourth-through-sixth-graders in one central location 
offers some advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"The major plus for a K-3, four to six configuration is space," Berg said. "And 
that the one school site (Lincoln) has some amenities . . . like a science 
room, a gymnasium, that could be shared by all the students in the zone." LAURA

CHILDREN TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT AT ABORTION PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: PARENTS INVOLVE THEIR YOUNGSTERS IN THE ISSUE WITH A MARCH 
ORGANIZED BY OPERATION RESCUE.

The cameras were focused on the children Tuesday as dozens of local parents 
opposed to abortion turned out with their youngsters at a clinic to dramatize 
their cause with a Children's Survival March. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration by about 170 people outside one of the area's largest family 
planning clinics, on Chapman Avenue, kicked off a series of local Easter week 
events that will culminate with a rally this weekend. It was one of nine such 
demonstrations around Southern California organized by Operation Rescue 
anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene that has been played out with increasing frequency since the U.S. 
Supreme Court gave states greater flexibility to decide abortion policies, 
about 20 abortion-rights proponents met the protesters in occasionally sharp 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
But police, who have had to break up fistfights at past Orange County abortion 
rallies, reported no problems or arrests. The protesters, from toddlers to 
grandparents, stayed on the sidewalk outside the clinic, offered literature to 
women entering the area and occasionally sang religious songs. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of children, many of them on break from school for spring vacation, 
played games along the sidewalk and munched on cheese and crackers. Some 
mirrored their parents and held signs that proclaimed that abortion was murder. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates who turned out for the demonstration criticized their 
counterparts for bringing young children to a busy intersection and exposing 
them to potential harm on the crowded street corner outside the Family Planning 
Associates Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really dangerous," said Anaheim resident Miki Moreno, an organizer of 
the counterdemonstration. "I wouldn't bring my kids out here." 
</P>
<P>
Some abortion rights advocates charged that the abortion foes were exploiting 
the children for the benefit of media photographers and thrusting them into an 
issue they do not really understand. 
</P>
<P>
But one young woman, who declined to give her name because she said it could 
hurt her acting career, pointed to her young daughter and said: "She knows why 
she's out here. I tell her we're going to save some babies. She understands." 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Jenny Klein of Anaheim, who came to the rally with her mother, 
said she was there "to stop abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at her mother, she said the unborn "should have a right to live just 
like us." 
</P>
<P>
Members of each side in the debate, armed with signs and sometimes graphic 
photographs, said they hoped to sway public opinion and, in turn, put pressure 
on politicians at this time of intensified debate on the abortion question. 
</P>
<P>
But Larkette Lein, an Irvine woman who is helping start a local religious 
coalition for abortion rights, conceded, "We're certainly not changing each 
others' minds out here." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protest drew far fewer people than the estimated 12,000 or more that 
turned out in January to form a "human cross" in Orange County streets and 
fewer than a similar event last year at the same site. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers discounted suggestions from their critics that the movement is 
losing support, and they promised to prove as much at activities set for this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion forces will hold a rally Thursday night at the Anaheim Vineyard 
featuring national anti-abortion leader Randall Terry. They are also planning 
on possible arrests and civil disobedience at undisclosed abortion clinics in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties on Friday and Saturday. Counterdemonstrations 
are expected.

IRVINE HOUSING FEE PLAN IS CALLED TOO EXPENSIVE 
</P>

<P>
A plan to fund affordable housing projects through fees on new commercial 
development drew opposition from businessmen who complained to the City Council 
Tuesday night that the suggested fees were onerous. 
</P>
<P>
A committee appointed to study the issue recommended to the council that 
developers be charged $5.50 per square foot for office space, $5 per square 
foot for research and development facilities, $3.50 per square foot for hotel 
and retail buildings and $3 per square foot for manufacturing plants and 
warehouses. Residential development is not included in the fees. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, representatives of the Building Industry Assn., 
the Irvine Co. and other developers supported the fee but asked that it be much 
less than those proposed by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Peter Swartz, president of NH Research, complained that any fees would be 
detrimental to his business. He said the suggested fees would come to $250,000 
for a property he plans to develop in the Irvine Spectrum complex, an amount he 
said would wipe out his profits. 
</P>
<P>
"This (proposed) law sends a clear message that the long-term interests of my 
company are outside of the city," Swartz said. "I can't compete if I have a 
government that is loading up on me and making the costs of doing business 
higher and higher." 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Sim, president of the Irvine Co.'s investment property group, asked 
that the fees be lowered to $1 per square foot per office development and 
for-sale housing, and to 50 cents per square foot for all other development, 
including apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council adjourned its meeting without voting on the proposed fee 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The fees stem from the council's decision last year to require that 12.5% of 
all future housing in the city be built for low-income residents. At the same 
time, the council directed a blue-ribbon committee to look into "linkage fees" 
to be imposed on businesses and developers, to establish a fund that would help 
finance affordable housing. Businesses should be targeted, the council majority 
said, because they bring workers into the city who cannot afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's housing plan, 11.5% should be priced for households earning 
80% of the county's median income, or roughly $36,000 a year, and 1% set aside 
for handicapped, elderly and others earning up to 30% of the county median. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is the first city in Orange County to create an affordable housing trust 
funded by developers. Several other California cities have similar policies, 
including San Diego, San Francisco and Santa Monica. San Francisco officials 
told The Times in an October interview that its housing fund has raised $29 
million since 1985, helping to build or rehabilitate 5,690 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The fees would apply to development permits requested after Oct. 24, 1989, and 
would be collected at the time an application is made, 
</P>
<P>
Mark Petracca, a UC Irvine political science professor and member of the 
15-person committee that drew up the fee schedule, praised the plan as a way of 
overcoming the prohibitive costs of buying a home in Irvine.

YOUNG MAN DIES IN SHOOTING; GANG RIVALRY BLAMED

A young man was shot and killed Tuesday, apparently by a rival gang member, as 
he stood on the sidewalk of a residential neighborhood, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 6:20 p.m. at the corner of Myrtle and Baker 
streets, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Bob Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name and age were not released. Authorities said he was standing 
on the southwest corner of the intersection when a car drove past and a 
passenger jumped out and shot him in the chest and neck at close range. The 
attacker then ran back to the car, which sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Simone Placentia said she was inside her home with her children when she heard 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the gunfire," Placentia said. "I was running out when a neighbor said: 
'Call the paramedics. They shot someone.' By the time I got out there, there 
was a crowd around him." 
</P>
<P>
She said the victim had been helping her next-door neighbors clean their house. 
</P>
<P>
An officer at the scene of the shooting said the victim was a known gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"The two gangs have been fighting recently," said the officer, who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area said that several gang members have been known to loiter 
on the streets but that there have not been many gang-related problems.

FINLEY IS SHARP IN 7-0 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: HOME RUNS BY DOWNING, DAVIS AND BICHETTE LEAD OFFENSE.

<P>
Early or late in the season, preceded by a shortened spring or by the usual 
preparations, Chuck Finley's pitching performance Tuesday night at Anaheim 
Stadium was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander allowed the Mariners only two hits in 6 1/3 innings' work and 
watched while his teammates slammed three home runs, a combination that brought 
the Angels a 7-0 victory, their first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had not recorded a victory of any kind since a 6-3 decision over 
Milwaukee in an exhibition game on April 1. They had lost their last seven 
exhibition games and their season opener on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Both hits off Finley were by Henry Cotto, who had an infield single in the 
third and a double in the fifth that he unsuccessfully tried to stretch into a 
triple. Finley struck out two and walked one before yielding to Mark Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis and Dante Bichette hit home runs in the second off Seattle starter 
Randy Johnson (0-1), who is 6-foot-10. Johnson, who played baseball and 
basketball at USC, was relieved in the sixth by Jerry Reed, who was victimized 
for three runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Reed got the first two outs in the seventh but gave up a single to Wally Joyner 
and a walk to Davis before Brian Downing drove a 2-and-2 pitch into the 
left-field seats for his first home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn preserved the shutout by pitching 2 2/3 strong innings, earning his 
first save as an Angel and his first save since June 2, 1988 when he was with 
Toronto. He allowed only two hits, and his defense did its part to hold the 
Mariners scoreless in the eighth, when Edgar Martinez doubled and moved to 
third on Cotto's grounder to the right side. Brian Giles followed with a shot 
to third that was gobbled up by Rick Schu, who held Martinez at third. 
Pinch-hitter Scott Bradley ended the inning with a grounder to second. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored their last two runs in the eighth off rookie Brent Knackert 
on an RBI-single by Johnny Ray and a sacrifice fly by Joyner. So sure of the 
outcome were the 23,508 fans that about a third of them left before Seattle 
batted in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Downing's three-run blast in the seventh, the homers by Davis and 
Bichette had given the Angels a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who had been the designated hitter in Monday's season opener, led off 
the second inning by lacing a 3-and-2 pitch from Johnson that appeared to be 
over the middle of the plate over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, making his first appearance of the season, was the designated hitter 
Tuesday night. His absence from the Opening Day lineup Monday even broke a 
streak of 11 straight appearances in the Angels' Opening Day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Downing grounded out his first at-bat, but Bichette ripped a high 2-and-0 pitch 
over the fence in right, to the right of the 370-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was Bichette's first at Anaheim Stadium since April 12, 1989, when 
he hit one off Oakland's Curt Young. The Angels led the American League last 
season with 145 home runs, two fewer than the major-league leading Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels might have prolonged the second inning, but were foiled. Lance 
Parrish reached when second baseman Harold Reynolds bobbled his grounder, and 
Parrish moved to third when Rick Schu doubled to left-center. Mark McLemore 
followed with a grounder to second, and Reynolds' throw home was in time to get 
Parrish. Devon White struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle tried to mount a threat in the fifth, but the Angels' defense held 
firm. Henry Cotto looped a hit down the right field line, reaching second 
easily and then trying for third. Bichette made a strong throw to McLemore, 
whose relay to third baseman Schu was in time to get Cotto and end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Finley helped his own cause in the sixth. Reynolds hit a grounder to the right 
side that was scooped up by Joyner, leaving Finley and Reynolds to race to the 
bag. Finley bounded over to first, colliding with Reynolds and sending both 
somersaulting into foul territory. But Finley held onto the ball and displayed 
it to first base umpire Vic Voltaggio, who gave the out sign. 
</P>
<P>
Through six innings, Finley had allowed only two hits and had struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, didn't last through the sixth. He yielded a leadoff single to 
Downing, then after getting Bichette to take a called third strike he walked 
Parrish, which signaled the end of his evening. Right-hander Jerry Reed 
relieved him and closed out the inning by getting Schu and McLemore to fly to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Finley kept going strong into the seventh, but the Angels had Mark Eichhorn as 
insurance. Finley got Griffey on a grounder to second for the first out of the 
inning, but walked Alvin Davis after falling behind 3 and 1, the first walk he 
issued in the game. That was all pitching coach Marcel Lachemann needed to see: 
Lachemann promptly trotted out to the mound to take Finley out and call for 
Eichhorn. The crowd gave Finley a warm hand as he strolled back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Finley made 78 pitches in his 6 1/3 innings, walking one and striking out two. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitcher Mark Langston, who will start against his former Mariner 
teammates tonight, said he will block out memories of his old friendships once 
the game starts. But he confessed that he misses his old roommate, Alvin Davis, 
with whom he used to share post-game snacks. "It's tough to eat a whole pizza," 
Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. is a dutiful son. Remembering that Tuesday 
was the 40th birthday of his father, Cincinnati outfielder Ken Griffey, Sr., he 
asked the Mariners' public relations director, Dave Aust, to call Houston -- 
where the Reds were playing -- and put a congratulatory message on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, who was limited to designated hitting Monday because of persistent 
tightness in his groin, was in left field Tuesday, with Devon White in center 
and Dante Bichette in right. Claudell Washington, a left-handed hitter, was 
removed from the lineup against the left-hander Randy Johnson. Washington also 
has a plantar's wart on his left foot, but padding in his shoe alleviates his 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has to do with Johnson, and a lot has to do with Chili being able to 
play the outfield," Manager Doug Rader said of the lineup changes. Bichette, he 
said, "may end up platooning with Claudell. It depends on who produces and is 
swinging the bat. I don't believe in strict platoons. It might be a reverse 
platoon where Claudell hits left-handers better than right-handers. That 
happens a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jack Howell, who sprained his left ankle last Wednesday, was 
available for pinch-hitting duty Tuesday night. However, Rader said he probably 
would wait until Howell was able to start before he'd use Howell at all. "I'm 
not convinced (using Howell to pinch-hit) is the right thing to do," Rader 
said. "When he's ready, the thing to do is have him start. You're prepared to 
play looser." 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure, who received a cortisone injection in his left elbow Monday, will 
be re-examined today. Rader said he was hopeful that McClure might be able to 
throw today or Thursday. . . . Kent Anderson, who had been bothered by rib 
cartilage problems, is available. . . . Trainer Ned Bergert said shortstop Dick 
Schofield, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list April 1, is progressing 
rapidly enough to have taken ground balls. However, Schofield isn't as advanced 
with his lateral movement. . . . Second baseman Johnny Ray has a slight 
inflammation near his right shoulder blade. It's being treated with heat and 
ice and isn't considered serious. . . . The Angels' Opening Day loss was their 
third straight. They also lost their openers in 1979, 82 and 86 and went on to 
win division titles.

Tuesday, on the eighth anniversary of that event, came the Massacre on 
Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored early, often and with record efficiency to whip the Calgary 
Flames, 12-4, before a sellout Forum crowd of 16,005, giving the Kings a 
three-games-to-one lead in their best-of-seven opening-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 goals were the most the Kings had ever scored and the Flames had ever 
given up in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
It also ties the Kings' all-time record for goals in any game. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor, Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom all had hat tricks, an NHL 
playoff record. Between them, they took only nine shots and made them all. 
</P>
<P>
The enormity of the night can be illustrated by the fact that the Kings had 
only four previous playoff hat tricks in their entire history. 
</P>
<P>
They played I Love L.A. so many times at the Forum Tuesday, it sounded like a 
Randy Newman concert. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' lightning attack was ignited by a pair of Flame penalties. 
</P>
<P>
First, Al MacInnis was called for holding Jay Miller. Then, Ric Nattress 
received a double minor, for cross checking and unsportsmanlike conduct when he 
smacked John Tonelli after the King wing had already gone down. 
</P>
<P>
Given a five-on-three advantage for a minute and 34 seconds, the Kings got off 
only two shots and both missed the mark. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings didn't let the opportunity totally slip away, finally scoring 
with a man advantage at the 6:38 mark. Todd Elik, controlling the puck behind 
the net, flipped it out on the left side to Taylor, who shoved it past goalie 
Mike Vernon's glove side just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
Thus begun an incredible 5 minute, 17 second first-period explosion that 
produced four King goals on five shots. 
</P>
<P>
After Elik's goal, the onslaught continued as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 8:25, Granato scored his first goal of the night after Rob Blake, 
skating down the left side, appeared to get knocked off the puck by Doug 
Gilmour. Granato gained control and fired from the left circle. Vernon, 
screened by both a Flame and King, never saw the puck until it whizzed past his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 11:06, Wayne Gretzky, coming in from the right side, passed across the 
middle under the glove of a diving Nattress to Sandstrom rushing the net from 
the left. Vernon had already come out on the right, leaving an open side for 
Sandstrom to smash the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
That was it for Vernon, but not the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 11:55, with Rick Wamsley in goal, the Kings struck again. When MacInnis 
gave the puck away, Luc Robitaille left a drop pass for Elik in the slot. His 
shot was wide right, but Wamsley got a glove on it, knocking it down. That left 
it sitting on the ice on the right side where Dave Taylor quickly jumped on it 
for his second goal of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about two teams heading in opposite directions. While the Kings were busy 
filling the net with pucks, the Flames were struggling to get a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't get their first until 16 minutes and four seconds had elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added three more goals-Jay Miller's first and the second of the night 
for both Granato and Sandstrom-to expand the lead to a 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
A team losing 7-0 doesn't need any added reminders that this was not its night, 
but Miller's goal provided undisputable proof the puck was bouncing the Kings' 
way. 
</P>
<P>
From behind the Calgary goal, Miller took a shot that bounced off the net. 
Undaunted, he shoved the puck in front. It bounced off MacInnis' skate and 
rolled past Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
What are you going to do? 
</P>
<P>
Calgary responded with a pair of goals in the space of 22 seconds to cut the 
margin to 7-2. Joel Otto got the first, Paul Ranheim the second. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings came right back with a goal that gave them several reasons to 
celebrate anew. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it increased their lead to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
For another, it was scored by Wayne Gretzky, his first since his back injury. 
</P>
<P>
But, perhaps most importantly, the goal brought more cheering from the Kings' 
bench because it showed that Gretzky is all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
It was said that his full range of motion would be the last thing to return in 
his recuperation from a hyperextension of the back. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to score from the right side, Gretzky was blocked by both Nattress 
and Wamsley, who both struggled to push him out of position. 
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky held his ice, arched his back and, without looking, shoved the puck 
behind him, by both Nattress and Wamsley into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
That puts Gretzky in the Magic Johnson range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Elik also scored for the Kings, and Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk 
closed out Calgary's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Was it really only a week ago that the Kings were thought to be heading to the 
slaughterhouse, facing the defending Stanley Cup champions without Wayne 
Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
The Flames can take solace from the fact that the series is not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
But the only thing that gave them solace Tuesday night was knowing that Game 
Four was finally over.

ANGELS: OUTFIELDER, DESIGNATED HITTER ADD HOME-RUN POWER TO LINEUP.

<P>
There was a strange configuration to the Angels' lineup Monday, with Brian 
Downing on the sidelines on an opening day for the first time in 12 years, and 
Chili Davis making a rare appearance at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the season, Downing, who has been bothered by a nagging 
muscle problem in his lower rib cage and back, was back at DH. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who can make left field such a place of unexpected twists and turns, was 
back in left, even though he has been bothered by a slight groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
And the Angels, held to five hits Monday in a 7-4 loss to Seattle, turned the 
tables on the Mariners in a 7-0 victory Tuesday in which five of the runs came 
on three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Classic Angel baseball, from the team that led the league in home runs last 
season but finished 12th in runs scored. But it doesn't matter when you win. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't nothing wrong with a team that hits home runs," said Davis, whose solo 
home run in the second was the game-winner. "I know a whole bunch of teams that 
wish they had some home-run hitters in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Downing followed Davis to the plate in the second, and grounded out. Up stepped 
Dante Bichette, who homered for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Downing broke the game open in the seventh with a three-run home run, driving 
in Wally Joyner, who had singled, and Davis, who had walked. 
</P>
<P>
Downing had been in the opening day lineup every year since 1979. He sat out 
Monday, and not by choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been my nature never to ask out of a game," he said. "But 
realistically, I'm not playing well enough to have been in the lineup (Monday) 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, he said, he might not have been right to start Tuesday's game. 
"At times I've played when I shouldn't have played," he said. "This probably 
was one of those times. But sometimes it works out." 
</P>
<P>
It worked out for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, was batting fifth instead of leadoff, came up with two on and two out. 
</P>
<P>
"The two-out home run really made a big difference in the ballgame," Manager 
Doug Rader said. "Three RBIs with two outs." 
</P>
<P>
The situation with Downing's rib cage/back problem, coupled with his age (39), 
might mean changes for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Downing doesn't know how much he'll be playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sporadically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That could mean more time at DH -- and less in left -- for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what happens, I think Brian is too good a hitter, too valuable a 
player to not play," Davis said. "With the problem with his side they may try 
to limit the time he plays. Hopefully, he'll get healthy. I'm 30, Brian's 39. 
My turn will come to sit down and take four hacks." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lived up to their reputation by living by the home run Tuesday. But 
at least they lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of fact that we didn't score enough runs last year," Downing 
said. "What people say is true. We do strike out too much. We don't walk 
enough. Our club is built on pitching. Our field is manicured for pitching. 
There are just not going to be as many ground-ball hits. Specifically, balls 
are outs that elsewhere are hits. We have to hit home runs." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they did. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is that we scored some runs," Davis said. "And if it's a home 
run offense that does it, that's what it takes."

Anthony Curran had just demonstrated how to vault 11 feet in the air with one 
arm behind his back, then flopped off the mat at Foothill High School last 
Sunday afternoon and quickly got back into the routine. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, stay relaxed! Have confidence!" Curran shouted to one of his young 
students who was charging down the runway. "Drive the arms and . . . 
reeeeeeeach." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Van Sluis, a 5-foot 110-pound freshman at El Modena High School, cleared 
the height with little problem. As Van Sluis got off the mat, Curran praised 
his technique, and sent the beaming youngster down to the end of the runway for 
another try. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that Curran, a four-time All-American in the pole vault at UCLA, 
enjoys the moment as well. Curran, who has held pole vault clinics for the last 
five years, has developed an enthusiastic, highly knowledgeable coaching style 
that keeps kids from all over Southern California coming to see him each 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Curran's weekly clinics might be a saving grace for the pole vault, an event 
that is on the decline not only in Orange County but across the nation. "What 
he's doing is the greatest thing in the world for kids," Edison Coach Rick 
Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
At the clinics, at which Curran charges $20 for sessions that run from 1 1/2-2 
hours, vaulters warm up and stretch before working into various technique 
drills. Then, the bar is raised and the vaulting begins. 
</P>
<P>
"I always start them off as beginners," said Curran, who was one of five 
vaulting brothers who competed for Crespi High School in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do clinics wherever I'm needed, whenever coaches call me," Curran said. 
"When I was in high school I was lucky, I had a coach who understood the vault 
pretty well. But there aren't a lot of coaches well-versed in the event. There 
are basic technical things they need to know. Some who don't understand the 
event, don't want to deal with it. I would be the same way. If I didn't know 
anything about croquet, I wouldn't want to coach it."

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Cirillo had an RBI single in the ninth inning to give USC a 6-5 victory 
over Cal State Fullerton Tuesday in a nonconference baseball game at Titan 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Gil opened the ninth with a double off Fullerton pitcher Matt Watson. 
Watson (1-5) struck out the next two hitters before Cirillo hit a slow roller 
through the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had two runners on with two out in the ninth, but Eric Hughes got 
Matt Hattabaugh to fly out to center. Hughes (2-2) did not allow a run over the 
final two innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton starter Huck Flener allowed four runs in 2/3 of an inning and USC 
(28-11) added another run in the third to take a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored two in the second and three in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Phil Nevin led off with a double for the Titans (18-16). Rich 
Gonzales had an RBI single and scored on Paul Bunch's double. Bunch went to 
third on a passed ball and scored on a squeeze by Hattabaugh. 
</P>
<P>
In another nonconference baseball game: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International 12, UC Irvine 6 -- Jon Damush had three hits, scored two

THRIFTS: OLYMPIA S&amp;L IN ILLINOIS HAD CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORITY 
TO TAKE IT OVER. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, MEANWHILE, SAID ASSETS OF FIRMS AND 
THEIR OFFICERS WILL BE SEIZED.

<P>
The federal courts have removed a troubling legal obstacle to the government's 
savings and loan bailout through two separate rulings involving an insolvent 
thrift that had challenged the government's constitutional authority to seize 
and close it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Justice Department announced Tuesday that the government plans 
to freeze and seize assets of both thrifts and their executives in cases 
involving fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Berwyn, Ill., had asked the courts to 
delay an impending takeover by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The thrift's 
primary argument was that the takeover was unconstitutional because neither M. 
Danny Wall nor his temporary replacement, Salvatore R. Martoche, were confirmed 
by the Senate as OTS director. The thrift also challenged the takeover on 
technical grounds involving OTS procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth last month had blocked the 
takeover as long as no properly appointed OTS director was in office, Olympic 
knew the order might be reversed as soon as a new OTS director was confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a three-judge panel of the Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the 
District Court order was terminated by the swearing in of a new OTS director, 
T. Timothy Ryan Jr. Ryan was confirmed last week and sworn into office this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Olympic lost its last bid to avoid a takeover when Judge Lamberth 
ruled on the thrift's secondary challenge involving OTS procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling last month, Lamberth had declined to consider those secondary 
arguments, because he had already blocked Olympic's seizure as long as OTS was 
not headed by an officer appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Lamberth denied Olympic's plea for a further delay so that it 
could pursue its secondary arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts of the tangled S&amp;L issue were scarcely surprised by the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"While there was temporary turmoil, it was clear it would be moot as soon as 
somebody was confirmed," said Bert Ely, who heads a financial institution 
consulting firm in Alexandria, Va. "The only surprise was that they got Ryan 
through faster than expected." 
</P>
<P>
Ely called Olympic's efforts to prolong the case a legal farce. "Olympic is 
broke, and what you have is management trying to hold onto their jobs by 
fighting the government with taxpayer money," he said. "There's a question if 
that's a legitimate use of taxpayer money." 
</P>
<P>
Added Robert Litan, a banking industry specialist at the Brookings Institution: 
"This is a waste of money. Olympic had to know that if they won on the 
constitutional appointment theory, the Administration and Congress would 
eventually appoint somebody. It's just wasteful litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the announcement that the government plans to freeze and seize assets 
in cases involving fraud, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel explained 
that in criminal S&amp;L investigations so far, the pattern has been that "the 
assets are not there following the convictions." The new effort will try to 
"prevent assets from being dissipated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authority to freeze and seize the assets was contained in the bailout package 
approved by Congress last year. In the Justice procedure announced Tuesday, the 
assets to be targeted could be either those of the S&amp;Ls or of the 
individuals involved, Runkel said. "It's a device to freeze assets that are 
derived from savings and loan wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
The government has recovered about $12.5 million, while the taxpayers have 
spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" to cover the costs of the illegal 
actions, Runkel said. The General Accounting Office has recently estimated that 
the total taxpayer cost of bailing out the thrifts and their depositors will 
run at least $325 billion over the next 30 to 40 years, and more likely $400 
billion or higher -- with much of the cost coming in the next 10 years.

UAL Signs Buyout Deal: UAL Corp. signed an agreement to be bought for $4.4 
billion by a group of its unions, but analysts remain skeptical that the 
largest-ever U.S. employee-led buyout will succeed. The stock has languished 
far below the $201-a-share of the employee group's bid, reflecting the 
widespread doubts. On Tuesday, it finished up 25 cents to $161.25 on the NYSE.

Heinz Will Use Recyclable Plastic Bottles: H. J. Heinz Co. said it will begin 
making ketchup squeeze bottles from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which can 
be recycled, rather than the existing composite of polypropylene and adhesives. 
Environmentalists generally supported the move while cautioning that until 
plastic recycling markets are in place, the new bottles will continue to meet 
the fate of the old: burial in a landfill.

Research Link: After a 3-year test, Arbitron will soon go national with a TV 
and radio ratings system it hopes will prove revolutionary. The system, called 
ScanAmerica, asks participants to tell not just what they watch, but also what 
they buy. A participant uses an electronic wand to scan the bar codes on 
household purchases. With this added information, Arbitron can tell advertisers 
whether the watchers of, say, "Knot's Landing," are more likely to include cat 
food or diapers in their weekly shopping. St. Paul Pioneer Press

Mortgages for Movers: Barnett Mortgage of Jacksonville, Fla., and SunTrust 
Mortgage of Atlanta have come up with loans for home buyers who don't plan to 
own one house for the rest of their lives. The loans, called 7-30 mortgages, 
offer a fixed rate for the first seven years and an option to renew at an 
adjusted rate over the remaining 23 years. The advantage to new homeowners is a 
lower initial rate than traditional mortgages. Florida and California, with 
their transient populations, are expected to embrace the new offering, but the 
loans may also attract military families, first-time home buyers and executives 
who relocate frequently. St. Petersburg Times

Ready Cameras: Film manufacturers are taking advantage of consumers' interest 
in low-end 35-millimeter cameras. Polaroid, Kodak and Fuji films will be joined 
in the market by Konica's new film and a 3M product under the Scotch name. One 
reason for the increased competition: 35-millimeter film sales soared 87.4% in 
1989, a $254-million increase over 1988. Chain Drug Review

Child Labor: The Labor Department reports that 90,000 children between the ages 
of 14 and 15 are working in the United States, and estimates that the United 
States employs more persons under 18 than any other industrialized nation. The 
numbers reflect intentional or accidental violations of U.S. law, especially in 
restaurants, supermarkets, gas stations and farms. The department is concerned 
not only about children's safety, but also their education. In the United 
States, where 10% to 12% of high schoolers are employed, the overall literacy 
rate is 75%, compared to 95% in West Germany and Japan where less than 1% of 
teens work. Tampa Tribune

BECHTEL GETS $11-MILLION CONTRACT IN HONG KONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bechtel, the big engineering and construction firm, said Tuesday that it has 
won a contract with the Hong Kong government to help plan and manage 
construction of a $16-billion project that would include a world-class airport, 
railways, bridges and highways. 
</P>
<P>
The $11.5-million contract, in effect through next year, is a boon to the 
privately held San Francisco company, which recently has begun emerging from an 
industrywide slump. 
</P>
<P>
"This promises to be one of the most exciting megaprojects in the world," 
Stephen D. Bechtel Jr., chairman and chief executive of Bechtel Group Inc., 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel spokesman Rick Laubscher said the "entire collection of projects . . . 
will vault Hong Kong infrastructure to the head of the world pack." 
</P>
<P>
The project, which the Hong Kong government hopes will basically be completed 
in seven years, has an enormous scale. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel officials said it would be comparable to building a new airport the 
size of San Francisco International, a new freeway stretching from San 
Francisco to Silicon Valley, a new transit system similar to BART from San 
Francisco to San Rafael (in Marin County), plus a bridge about 10% longer than 
the 4,200-foot Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The new Chek Lap Kok Airport -- to be built on a small island just north of 
Lantau Island, which is southwest of Kowloon and west of Hong Kong Island -- 
would be the project's centerpiece. Initially, it would have two runways but 
ultimately would grow to four and could accommodate 80 million passengers a 
year, about twice the number handled by Los Angeles International Airport last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It would replace the single-runway, World War II-vintage Kai Tak Airport in 
urban Kowloon. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is vital to the future growth and prosperity of Hong Kong in the 
21st Century," said Melinda Parsons, a San Francisco-based spokeswoman for the 
British colony's government. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government stands to be a beneficiary if the project is completed 
on time in 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. The project is 
expected to get 60% of its financing from the private sector and 40% from the 
Hong Kong government, according to Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by the government, the project would include an airport rail link 
and expressways running from Lantau Island to Kowloon to Hong Kong Island. In 
addition, it would include a suspension bridge and underwater rail and 
vehicular tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the construction will be on reclaimed land. The densely packed island 
territory, with 5.7 million people, routinely uses fill to expand its limited 
land. 
</P>
<P>
International Bechtel Inc., the Bechtel Group subsidiary that signed the 
contract, is also on a list of eight competitors for the next contract that 
Hong Kong expects to award on the project, to develop the master plan for the 
$4.5-billion airport portion. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard J. Begley, vice president of business development for Ralph M. 
Parsons Co., a Pasadena engineering firm, said he expects Bechtel to be 
disqualified from that portion because of its other management work on the 
project. Parsons is also a contender for the airport contract, which Begley 
said is expected to be awarded next week. 
</P>
<P>
Begley described the Hong Kong government's schedule for the project as 
"extremely aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of $16 billion might seem low by U.S. standards. Laubscher 
explained that Hong Kong's pro-development attitude tends to reduce costs for 
environmental and other studies. By comparison, the Bay Area's BART system 
would cost about $7 billion in today's dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel recently has had a spate of activity. Last month, Executive Vice 
President John Neerhout Jr. was named project chief executive of the channel 
tunnel connecting Great Britain and France. The company also was chosen to 
conduct a feasibility study for the Soviet Union, which wants to design a 
Silicon Valley-style research center near Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The company's annual report said it is working with 950 clients on nearly 1,600 
projects and studies.

Judge Delays Motorola Decision: U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in Austin, 
Tex., delayed his decision until June 18 on Hitachi's motion to lift a stay of 
Bunton's earlier injunction that halted Motorola from selling its key 68030 
microprocessor. Motorola said it continues marketing and selling the chip, 
which controls several popular computers made by Apple Computer, 
Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and others.

CBOT Cleared in Soybean Flap: The Chicago Board of Trade acted within ethics 
rules when it declared an emergency and ordered traders to reduce July, 1989, 
soybean holdings, the General Accounting Office said. The GAO concluded that 
Board of Trade members who held contracts did not participate in meetings that 
led to the emergency order. The controversy centered on Ferruzzi Finanziaria 
SpA, one of the world's largest soybean processors.

Realtor to Buy KDAY-AM: Southland realtor Fred C. Sands has agreed to acquire 
Los Angeles radio station KDAY-AM from Dallas-based Heritage Media Corp. for 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission. 
Sands, who also owns rock music station KNAC-FM in Long Beach, said he has no 
plans to change KDAY's urban contemporary format. Heritage Media said it 
decided to sell KDAY because it wanted to concentrate on FM radio stations and 
on AM/FM combinations.

<P>
Crude oil prices, depressed by bulging U.S. inventories and OPEC 
overproduction, tumbled Tuesday to close below $18 a barrel for the first time 
since August. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for May delivery 
finished at $17.68 a barrel, down 76 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that an American Petroleum Institute report to be released late 
Tuesday would show crude stocks buildups also contributed to the market's 
already overwhelmingly bearish tone. The figures, released after the close of 
trading, showed an 8-million barrel increase in crude oil stocks at 371 million 
barrels. Crude stocks are a bearish 45 million barrels above their levels at 
this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We can reasonably expect a bounce to recover from this blood bath, but beyond 
that the market looks like it's going to remain weak because production is 
outpacing demand for the time being and storage space is so tight," United 
Energy Inc. analyst Kevin Breslin said. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is also 
hitting world oil prices hard, according to traders who described the market as 
fundamentally very weak. 
</P>
<P>
North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude, fell 65 
cents, following a 75-cent drop on Monday, to $15.95 per barrel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dubai, the key Middle East marker grade, was at $14.05 for May cargoes, down 50 
cents from Monday and $1 below last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on OPEC deciding at some stage to curtail supply, which would 
take time, but which would calm the market," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand a lot depends on consumption of oil products -- gasoline, 
heating oil," the trader added, summing up the sentiment that has led to such 
precipitous falls in prices worldwide.

Stock prices ended mixed in moderate, quiet trading Tuesday after overcoming 
earlier losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 9.01 to 2,731.08. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues barely nudged out advancing ones in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 723 up, 740 down and 511 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.02 million shares, up from 
114.97 million in Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
163.85 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was limited by the Passover holiday, which began Tuesday, and by the 
upcoming Good Friday holiday this week, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Ames Department Stores was the most-active NYSE issue, dropping 7/8 to 2 3/8. 
The discount store operator announced that it expects to report a loss of $288 
million for its fiscal 1989 and that it was negotiating a new credit agreement 
with its banks. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, another active NYSE issue, shot up 4 1/4 to 68 1/2. The technology 
company reported first-quarter profit rose 3.2%, at the high end of analysts' 
expectations. It also said there are signs of renewed strength in the 
semiconductor industry. The news helped spark renewed buying of other high-tech 
stocks, including Intel, up 3/4 to 42 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, continuing its recent rebound, added 1/4 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed lower Tuesday amid concern that the 
Group of Seven major industrialized nations were not firm in their commitment 
to support the yen. The blue chip Nikkei average of 225 selected issues, which 
jumped 3.8%, or 1,119.15 points, on Monday, fell 773.25 points, or 2.5%, to 
29,624.68. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares ended lower as a weaker pound added to concerns over 
Britain's political and economic outlook. The Financial Times 100-share index 
ended 10.2 points off at 2,217.5.

CREDIT: Lukewarm Auction Sinks Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell, dampened by disappointing results in the government's auction 
of new long-term bonds for financing the bailout of the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about 1/2 point, or $5 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.59% from 8.55% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bidding at the Resolution Funding Corp.'s auction of $3.5 billion 
in 40-year bonds was weaker than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds sold at a yield of 8.89%, well above the average yield of 8.85% to 
8.86% expected by market watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said buyers of the new 40-year bonds were worried about the extra 
interest rate risk of the longer maturity. There also were fears that the 
S&amp;L problem is worse than anticipated and the government will have to flood 
the market with borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Resolution Trust Corp., the U.S. agency overseeing the 
bailout of troubled thrifts, said Tuesday that it will pay all interest on 
mortgage-backed bonds issued by thrifts now controlled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The statement helped calm the $20-billion market for the mortgage-backed bonds, 
which was rocked by fears that the government would stop paying interest on the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.187% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Plunges in Erratic Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined sharply against most major currencies in thin, seesaw 
trading as concerns about continued central bank intervention dampened market 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery settled at $375 an ounce, $1 lower than late Monday. Republic 
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $375.50, off 15 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar climbed 1.70 yen to a closing 
158.15 yen on Tuesday. It was quoted at 158.60 yen in London, and at 157.60 yen 
in New York, down from 158.335 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Demand Propels Livestock Prices 
</P>
<P>
Livestock futures traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jumped to an 
all-time high, prodded by strong demand and tight supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in New York, copper and cocoa continued to soar on strikes and rumors 
of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
April cattle futures advanced 0.30 cent to 80.25 cents a pound, equal to the 
previous all-time high reached on April 18, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Beef and pork are doing a lot better than most people would have expected at 
this time of year," said one livestock trader about what seems to be lessening 
concern about the dietary pros and cons of beef and pork consumption.

Two members of the Mitsubishi Group created from the breakup of Mitsubishi 
Mining during the U.S. occupation after World War II announced Tuesday that 
they will merge. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co., in announcing 
their merger, attempted to head off expected criticism that the move is a step 
toward re-establishment of the monopoly power held by Japan's prewar zaibatsu 
financial combines. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi Group companies comprised one of the three most powerful 
zaibatsu before and during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger plan, nine shares of Mitsubishi Metal will equal 10 shares of 
Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement effective Dec. 1, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will link one of Japan's largest smelters of nonferrous metals with 
one of its largest producers of cement. 
</P>
<P>
"Every president of the two companies over the past 40 years sought out the 
possibility of a merger," said Mitsubishi Metal President Takeshi Nagano, who 
will become chairman of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
"When this merger is complete, we will feel that the war is finally over for 
our companies," Nagano said at a news conference jointly sponsored by the two 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the two companies said the merger should not be seen as a 
"monopolistic threat." 
</P>
<P>
By combining resources, the two firms will be able to grow into a comprehensive 
company, which is "the best way to conduct a flexible and dynamic adjustment to 
various structural changes progressing worldwide," Nagano said. 
</P>
<P>
Masaya Fujimaru, president of Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement, who will be 
president of the new company, said the merger is not aimed at strengthening the 
business affiliations of the Mitsubishi Group, which is still known for its 
strong ties among member companies. 
</P>
<P>
Nagano said the metal business is vulnerable to changes in foreign exchange 
rates and market prices, and the merger would help protect against such 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the companies said the combination of research in metals and 
ceramics is expected to create a wide range of new materials. 
</P>
<P>
The sales of the new company are expected to total the equivalent of about $5.7 
billion during the first year and $6.4 billion within the first five years, the 
two companies said. The new company, which will have 9,000 employees, will have 
total assets of $5.1 billion, they said.

JUDGE ORDERS U.S. TO TELL WHY VALUE OF LINCOLN WAS CUT

A federal judge said Tuesday that regulators should explain why they slashed 
the estimated value of financier Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan 
Assn. and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
"The government says it's $2 billion in the red, and the former operator says 
it's $600 million in the black," U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin said. "I'm 
in a quandary." 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin suggested calling in the court-appointed receiver in the case to 
explain the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came after Keating testified that Lincoln was worth $500 million 
to $700 million when the government seized it a year ago. The financier is 
trying to regain control of the Irvine thrift, which was seized by the 
government a year ago, along with its large real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
James Murphy, an attorney representing the government in its defense to 
Keating's lawsuit challenging the takeover, tried to dissuade the judge. He 
said FDIC reports on Lincoln's status are already court records. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin's suggestion brought broad smiles from Keating and several associates. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Keating has alleged that S&amp;L regulators undervalued Lincoln's 
investments and were grossly mismanaging them since taking over the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it looks like we may start cutting through the bull and start talking real 
turkey," said Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law and the manager of 
Lincoln's vast real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, raised its 
estimate of the 30-year cost of bailing out bankrupt thrifts from $257 billion 
to $300 billion. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher said the figure could 
climb to $400 billion or $500 billion if interest rates rise or there is a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that that the U.S. taxpayer need take that hit, whatever the 
number is -- $300 billion, $500 billion -- under a proper structure for the 
industry," Keating testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
That structure, according to Keating, would return S&amp;Ls to the deregulated 
status they had in 1982-85. Then federal regulators began reimposing 
restrictions on thrift investments. 
</P>
<P>
Keating recounted how the Federal Home Loan Bank Board criticized his 1984 
purchase, using federally insured deposits in Lincoln, of stock in Gulf 
Broadcasting Co. He said the regulators objected, even though the thrift 
realized a $50-million profit on the deal 15 months later. 
</P>
<P>
"Their criticism," he said, "was that we might not have made it (the profit). 
We felt we had no downside. There was a feeding frenzy for media properties at 
that time. I thought we could have ended up with a $400-million gain. That was 
later proven out by the subsequent liquidation of Gulf's assets." 
</P>
<P>
Keating said Lincoln settled for the $50-million profit because of regulators' 
resistance to its participation in what was viewed by some as a hostile 
takeover attempt against Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the government undervaluing Lincoln assets, Keating pointed to 
the luxurious Phoenician Resort that, using the thrift's funds, he built 
outside Phoenix at a price tag of $275 million. Lincoln later sold a 45% 
interest in the Phoenician and another hotel in Phoenix to Kuwait for $170 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Keating estimated that Lincoln's interest in hotel is worth $190 million, 
almost double $99-million asset value listed by government regulators on their 
books. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete misunderstanding of value to write that hotel down," he said. 
"Resorts are a highly salable commodity in the world today. It just hurts me. I 
think they're going to give it away."

DEUTSCH AD AGENCY PLANS AN OFFICE IN SOUTHLAND

<P>
The third New York advertising agency within a week has revealed its intention 
to open an office in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the agency, Deutsch Inc., said its office will not just be 
set up to service current clients, but also to get into the scramble for new 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch is regarded by many as one of the hottest creative shops in New York. 
It may be best known for its hip commercials for the new magazine Entertainment 
Weekly that advise people to "Kick back. Chill out. Hang loose. Have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch says it will likely open its Southland office in Santa Monica. Last 
week, the agencies Lowe Marschalk and Young &amp; Rubicam both said they 
planned to open small Southland offices to service current clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take the New York smarts and bring it to Los Angeles," said Donald 
Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of the agency, who said 
the office will open in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
Among the West Coast accounts Deutsch is after is Ikea, the large Swedish 
furniture marketer, which Deutsch already creates ads for on the East Coast. 
Ikea is expected to open at two Southland locations within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch said his West Coast office will initially employ 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little frightened," said Deutsch. "But the crazy part is, everyone from 
this office wants to be the one to go to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Some executives regard Los Angeles as the most difficult new market to enter in 
the country. Several West Coast advertising executives were skeptical about 
Deutsch finding much success in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a lot tougher to grow in than New York," said Philip Joanou, 
chairman of Dailey &amp; Associates, which creates ads for the California 
Lottery. "In New York, you have the opportunity to pitch a good-sized client 
two or three times a month. In Los Angeles, it's once or twice a year, if 
you're lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Often, New York agencies want to keep their best people in New York so they 
don't send the best talent to Los Angeles, Joanou said. Those West Coast 
offices sometimes fail. 
</P>
<P>
"You get business in the Los Angeles market more through talent than through 
time," said Nancy Shalek, president of the Shalek Agency. "You get business 
here by being on the inside."

PARENT OF DAILY NEWS LOSES $42.5 MILLION DURING YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooke Media Group Inc., parent of the Daily News newspaper, lost $42.5 million 
last year because of the company's heavy debt load and a $6-million operating 
loss by the newspaper, according to a government filing. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News' operating loss -- the difference between revenue and day-to-day 
expenses of running the newspaper, excluding such items as interest and taxes 
-- was wider than the $2-million operating loss in 1988. The newspaper's 
revenue climbed 8% to $113.6 million from $105.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills-based company, owned by financier Jack Kent Cooke, owns 
several cable-television systems in addition to the newspaper. Most of the 
cable properties were acquired in 1987 for $1 billion, with mostly borrowed 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke is currently selling the cable systems piecemeal, and the company now 
treats them as discontinued operations. That means Cooke Media's operating 
results include only the Daily News' operations. However, interest costs on the 
cable systems' debt and proceeds from sales of the cable properties are 
included in the results. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooke Media's stock is privately held, part of its borrowings included 
bonds sold to the public, and the company therefore must disclose its financial 
results in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke Media's filing for 1989 showed that last year's loss was substantially 
less than the $104.3 million it lost in 1988. That's because last year Cooke 
Media had a $71-million gain from selling some of its cable properties. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke Media has reported net losses totaling $226 million over the past three 
years, largely because of its debt burden. But its properties have generated 
sufficient cash flow to service the debt, and with the help of the cable sales, 
the company cut its total long-term debt last year to $809.2 million from 
$902.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cooke Media expects to sell all of its cable systems for about $1.6 
billion, meaning that it likely could pay off the debt and still earn a profit 
of about $300 million on its investment in cable.

LITTLE ADO IN O.C. OVER NEA FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: THE RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL DEBATE HAS BEEN MINIMAL, ESPECIALLY IN 
CONTRAST WITH THE REACTION IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE 27 ARTISTS WERE ARRESTED LAST 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi is galled by efforts of Orange County Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and others to restrict federal funding of the arts and 
likens a government that controls the content of artwork it supports to 
pre-glasnost Communism. 
</P>
<P>
"Art in a Communist government is used as a tool to express government 
propaganda," said Dvir-Djerassi, general manager of the Garden Grove Symphony. 
"It's not the business of the government to tell the arts how to conduct 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a leading congressional foe of the National Endowment for the 
Arts, wants to abolish the federal arts agency entirely. Yet Dvir-Djerassi has 
taken no action on behalf of the symphony over attacks on NEA funding of art 
exhibits considered by conservatives to be obscene and sacrilegious. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove is part of the district of Rep. Robert K. Dornan, not Rohrabacher, 
but Dvir-Djerassi said he is worried about going against the grain of the 
county's conservative political climate and wishes to "depoliticize" the 
orchestra. Thus, the symphony has remained officially silent and ignored pleas 
from the American Symphony Orchestra League, a national service organization 
with more than 850 members, to petition Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The symphony is not alone. The county arts community's response to the national 
debate has been minimal, certainly in any organized or public fashion and 
especially in contrast with the response in Los Angeles, where 27 artists were 
arrested last month during a demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Even Robert Garfias, a UC Irvine anthropology professor and one of 26 members 
of the National Council on the Arts -- which advises the NEA on grant 
recipients and policies -- has not tried to rally local NEA support. Other than 
his board membership with the Orange County Philharmonic Society, Garfias said, 
he is "not really involved" with the local arts community any more. Garfias was 
once on the board of the defunct Orange County Arts Alliance, a countywide arts 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Some local arts administrators have taken such actions as writing legislators 
to support the NEA, and several said they urged their trustees or general 
membership to express their views. But no public protests or organized events 
have taken place here since the controversy erupted last year, and none are 
planned in the near future, according to several artists and administrators 
interviewed -- even though hundreds of thousands of NEA grant dollars have been 
awarded here, nearly $450,000 in 1989 alone. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, county artists and arts administrators interviewed recently 
expressed unanimous support for reauthorization of the NEA without restrictions 
on the content of artworks. Congress is holding hearings for reauthorization of 
the NEA, whose current budget is $171 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done anything; I'm completely embarrassed to tell you that," said 
one local artist, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA controversy erupted over two photography exhibits that received NEA 
support. One, by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, contained sadomasochistic and 
homoerotic images. The other, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar 
of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged by the exhibits, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the agency's chief Senate 
foe, pushed through legislation that bars for one year NEA funding of what he 
called obscene artworks that do not meet certain standards of artistic 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan supports the Helms restrictions, an aide said, and throughout the 
protracted debate, Rohrabacher has attacked the NEA repeatedly for funding 
exhibits he considers obscene. Others urge a ban on federal funding of projects 
that they consider obscene or blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these attacks, Los Angeles artists and arts administrators 
formed the Coalition for Freedom of Expression. Working to oppose censorship 
and NEA funding restrictions, the ad hoc group staged several public protests. 
In one, 250 people marched into downtown Los Angeles; 27 were arrested. In 
another action, computers were set up in several Los Angeles restaurants for a 
letter-writing campaign that resulted in 3,000 letters to Congress, coalition 
co-chairwoman Joy Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar coalitions have been active in Washington, San Francisco and New York, 
Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
Some county residents have been working with the Los Angeles coalition, 
Silverman said. Orange County artists or others may have also taken part in 
protests in Los Angeles, where the arts community is older, larger, more 
cohesive and better organized than Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some arts officials have spoken out. Among those who have written various 
legislators personally or on behalf of their organizations are David Emmes, 
producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory, an NEA grant recipient 
annually since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
NEA funding, which totaled $95,000 to SCR last year, "has been a tremendous 
catalyst in stimulating local support," said Emmes, adding that the 
organization's trustees were also urged to write legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, whose NEA grants totaled $111,000 
in 1989, have sent several letters to lawmakers while also suggesting that 
trustees do so. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum, which won $27,500 in NEA grants last year, has a policy 
for "freedom of artistic expression," director Charles Desmarais said. The 
museum's 1989 newsletter suggested that the museum's 3,000 members contact 
their congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many in the arts community have done nothing. Explanations ranged from 
busy schedules to a focus on local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach is within Rohrabacher's district, but the Huntington Beach 
Allied Arts Board has taken no official action, said board chairman Steve 
Schwartz, who added that the uproar "hasn't affected anything we're concerned 
with now in Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The board, which advises the City Council on arts issues, is concentrating on 
such matters as creating a new arts center, scheduled to open next spring, and 
"other more pressing things on which we feel we can make an impact," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among leaders of larger local arts organizations who said their groups have 
taken no official action on the issue are Louis G. Spisto, director of the 
Pacific Symphony, and Bonnie McClain, executive director of the Pacific Chorale 
-- both 1989 NEA grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply have not brought it up at a board level," McClain said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society has applied for a 1990 NEA grant but has 
not officially supported the agency, Executive Director Erich Vollmer said. 
Though Vollmer recently met in Washington with NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer, 
the focus was not on the NEA's troubles but on efforts to form a new countywide 
arts agency. (Frohnmayer "was very supportive and encouraging and hopes we get 
something going," Vollmer said.) 
</P>
<P>
Several artists and arts officials said they believe that such an agency, if 
formed, would organize, focus and carry out advocacy efforts. Orange County is 
one of just five counties statewide without a "state-local partner," a 
countywide agency that is its official arts representative to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Maxine Gaiber, spokeswoman for the Newport Harbor Art Museum, said museum 
officials recently decided that their most effective efforts toward supporting 
the NEA "would be to focus on development" of a county arts council.

"Sajak" Producer to Helm New Late-Night Show: Michael Weisman, the former 
executive producer of NBC Sports and the current executive producer of the 
now-canceled "Pat Sajak Show," is developing a new late-night show for CBS that 
is scheduled to debut this summer in the 12:30 a.m. time slot. Weisman took 
control of the beleaguered CBS talk show last January. Of the low-rated 
"Sajak," which will air for the last time Friday, Weisman said, "It is ironic 
that we will have our last show on Good Friday, but as one of my writers said: 
'Yeah, but on Easter Sunday, we won't be coming back.' " GREG BRAXTON

Tharp Works Moving to Chicago: Hubbard Street Dance Company will announce "a 
major artistic collaboration" with choreographer Twyla Tharp at a press 
conference this morning at the company's headquarters in Chicago. Sources close 
to the company report that the announcement will involve Hubbard Street's 
acquisition of modern-dance works that Tharp created in the 1970s for her own 
company -- a company she disbanded in 1988 to become artistic associate at 
American Ballet Theater. "It's a major artistic initiative for Hubbard Street," 
said Gail Kalver, the company's general manager. GREG BRAXTON

"James Bond" Triumphs: Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, was 
awarded unspecified libel damages at a London court Tuesday from the publishers 
of a North American movie magazine that suggested he was going to be booted 
from the Bond role. Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe 
magazine that the actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from 
financial disaster were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. Conway 
said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's performances 
in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill." GREG BRAXTON

TIM MILLER, MALCOLM BOYD IN 'RUNNING?' AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On Palm Sunday, while both "Parsifal" and Passover music made their way over 
the airwaves, performance art was being preached at Highways -- courtesy of Tim 
Miller and his ad-hoc collaborator, the Rev. Malcolm Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were they a topical twosome, presenting ritualized excerpts from the 
66-year-old Episcopal priest's prayer book, "Are You Running With Me, Jesus?" 
but a compatible one at that. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it was just a matter of time before the idea that theater and church 
derive from a common source would hit. The human condition, as these eloquent 
spokesmen pointed out, is ultimately bewildering. The outcries made on its 
behalf inspire both art and religion. 
</P>
<P>
In Miller's creative realm -- one that combines script, dance motif and 
veristic detail -- little else could be so ripe as the Jesus theme. For the 
concept of God as salvation surely rings on deaf ears, he says, given the 
universal miseries of life. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Miller sees the Crucifixion as a metaphor. Midway through the hourlong 
event, he asks: "Why don't all the Jesuses get fed up, jump off their crosses, 
pack their bags and go to Miami?" 
</P>
<P>
He opts, of course, comically to anthropomorphize the Christian son of God, to 
bring Him into the present, to make Him one of us and thus get some 
accountability for such horrors as the Holocaust, war and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Both Boyd and Miller want to know "why people crucify each other" and seek "to 
understand the existence of suffering, torture, violence, pain and loss." 
Throughout, they punctuate their relatively quiescent anguishings with 
choreography: aerobic semaphores and circular locomotions. 
</P>
<P>
Miller habitually impersonates Jesus the carpenter in dance gestures, moving a 
plane back and forth, nailing together the pieces of wood that become his 
crucifix. With each hammer blow he hollers common invectives of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
But the most original ideas were literary: for instance, his likening Jesus to 
a cross (pun unintended) between Alyosha Karamazov and Zooey Glass. The most 
moving contribution from Boyd came in his teary "confession" to the audience: 
"Jesus had a body, too, and experienced things. Yet he consented to his death. 
So can I." DONNA PERLMUTTER

BENEFIT RECITAL BY DONALD MCINNES AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a recital to benefit the Koldofsky Memorial Scholarship Fund at USC, violist 
Donald McInnes introduced a serious and major work: Robert Suderberg's "Solo 
Music II: Ritual Cycle of Lyrics and Dances" for unaccompanied viola. 
</P>
<P>
Although the work was composed in 1988, this performance, Monday night, was 
billed as a world premiere -- although, according to an insert in the 
information-poor program book, a preview of the piece had been given in 1989 at 
Williams College, Mass., where Suderberg is composer-in-residence. The composer 
sat in the Hancock Auditorium audience. 
</P>
<P>
Lasting 23 minutes, the five-part work does not shy away from making big, 
expressive and rhetorical gestures. It requires formidable technique and rich, 
strong tone, yet also a sense of inwardness, alertness to folk and national 
borrowings and even a willingness to indulge in impish wit. McInnes provided 
all of these handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving a first Los Angeles performance, William O. Smith's "Psyche," for 
viola and women's voices (composed in 1987) proved an attractive work. 
</P>
<P>
While the women in the audience hummed a middle C for the duration 
(approximately five minutes), the violist deftly explored small excursions away 
from the tone, first close by, then in various octaves, before addressing 
explosively plucked and strummed chords, multiple-string slides, flashy 
arpeggios and eerie glassy harmonics. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, pianist Alan Smith provided accompaniment. Fluent in transcriptions 
of five songs by Faure -- in which McInnes made an almost persuasive case for a 
viola substituting for a voice -- Smith came to life and suggested that he 
might have a musical personality or ideas of his own only in a series of four 
Serenades (linked by their titles, certainly not their moods) by Schubert, 
Brahms, Wolf and Richard Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Smith had provided proficient but characterless support. Certainly he 
failed to match McInnes' warm phrasing and spectral rhythms in Rebecca Clarke's 
Sonata (1919), an Impressionistic work with muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The two opened the recital with a considerate but not affectionate reading of a 
transcription of Mozart's Sonatina in E-flat, K. 439b, No. 2.

'CRAZY PEOPLE': SOME LAUGHS BUT A GOOD IDEA GOES TO WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The satiric idea behind "Crazy People" (citywide) deserves a better movie. 
Dudley Moore, looking a bit haggard and bored, pays Emory Leeson, an ad exec 
who, on deadline pressure, has a brainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Ad men lie for a living, he reasons, so why not cleanse the air and level with 
consumers? Emory's resulting "truth in advertising" binge lands him in a loony 
bin, but, by accident, his brutally frank prototype ads are printed up and 
widely circulated. In the wake of their success, he's hailed as a marketing 
genius. 
</P>
<P>
The satire pretty much stops right there, which is a shame. In fact, things get 
progressively gooier. Ensconced in his pastoral sanitarium, Emory, along with a 
bevy of fellow oddballs, is enlisted by the ad agency's heartless president 
(J.T. Walsh) to concoct new "truth" ads -- as uncompensated occupational 
therapy. Away from the fast track, Emory learns to appreciate life's simple 
pleasures, which include making the cozy acquaintance of a fellow patient 
played by the resplendent Daryl Hannah. Going crazy has its compensations. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Markowitz, who also wrote "Good Morning Vietnam," has come up with some 
sharp jabs at Madison Avenue, but the film itself is an example of ad-promo 
hard-sell disguised as soft soap. Tony Bill's direction lacks zip -- the 
malingering maudlin moments periodically dissolve the screen into a glob of 
oleaginous mush. In the scenes with Emory and his cohorts, the filmmakers 
promote sentimentality as strenuously as the "heartfelt" commercials they're 
satirizing. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, "Crazy People" is yet another variation on the 
we're-all-sane-in-here-they're-all-crazy-out-there game plan of, say, "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or, more recently, "The Dream Team." There's something 
emotionally satisfying in this sort of set-up no matter how many times it's 
played out -- the role reversal confirms a widespread fantasy that we're saner 
than the nuts running the show -- but it's also a rigged scenario. It coddles 
the mentally ill by turning them into saintly truth-tellers. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is why the crazy people in "Crazy People" (rated R for strong 
language) are remarkably undifferentiated; they sport their eccentricities, but 
since they're basically in the movie for a quick heart tug and a laugh, they 
never have a chance to become full-fledged characters. One oldster thinks he's 
a TV sitcom writer, another obsesses about Saabs, a black man thinks he's a 
macho Latino, and so on. These characters are all set-up and punch-line. 
</P>
<P>
Only Dick Paymer's George, a lost soul who limits his conversations pretty much 
to the word hello, registers with any real poignancy. Still, I could easily 
have lived without the end-credit sing-along of George's "The Hello Song." 
Also, when he's finally airlifted to sanity, anyone wanna guess what word 
George blurts out to the big bad doctors? 
</P>
<P>
A number of actual corporate logos are used in the film, and I suppose one 
should be grateful that, for a change, the logos aren't employed as the usual 
product plugs that routinely garnish our movies. (The ad line for the United 
Airlines spot says: "Most of our passengers get there alive.") But the "daring" 
of this approach doesn't jibe with the film's overall gloppiness. And the film 
doesn't advance its satire by implying that "truth" advertising may actually be 
another kind of con, in the same manner as the current "reality" TV. The 
filmmakers' attitudes are hopelessly confused, but the confusion is purest 
Hollywood, where sincerity and the hard-sell are as twinned as Tweedledee and 
Tweedledum. 
</P>
<P>
We're supposed to applaud Emory and his gang for leveling with consumers and 
exposing the hypocrisy of advertising. But the aims of their own ad campaigns 
are just as mercenary. After all, their ads exist to sell merchandise too. The 
sequences where the buying public are shown clamoring to buy the products are 
far more cynical than the moviemakers seem to realize. We're meant to be happy 
for the new-found admen, those happy-go-lucky band of screwloose innocents, but 
the real message seems to be that, in today's media-wise culture, the best way 
to put one over on the buying public is to be crazy -- like a fox.

WILLIAM WEGMAN GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Wegman's 21 recent photographs at Linda Cathcart Gallery, which date 
from the past 15 months, show the artist working at top form. The pictures 
range from the decidedly fashion-conscious -- the artist's Weimaraner, Fay Ray, 
eloquently modeling haute-couture finery for the camera -- to the high-mindedly 
formal, in doggy portraits whose chiarascuro effects are exquisitely arrayed. A 
few even manage to straddle these two poles, with Fay decked out as if in 
preparation for photographic enshrinement in some official hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
At James Corcoran Gallery, meanwhile, Wegman shows seven recent paintings and 
10 works on paper. Childlike renderings on gentle fields of washed color, the 
New Yorker's paintings have only been seen here once before, in a small 1988 
show at Thomas Solomon's Garage. This larger display is welcome, if only 
because it helps to bring into focus the artist's otherwise seemingly 
disconcerting decision a few years back to begin painting at all. 
</P>
<P>
When Wegman began to make videotapes and photographs 20 years ago, his work 
emerged from the larger suspicion of the day that painting, as a medium, was 
moribund, gelled in an aspic of pompous rhetoric. Wegman's simple tapes and 
snapshots, underscored by boy-and-his-dog subject matter and sight-gag wit, 
emphasized a "homemade" quality that effectively knocked art off its lofty 
pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
That unpretentious, homemade element is evident in Wegman's doodle-like drawing 
style, both in the works on paper and in the new paintings. What's curious 
about the latter is the washy fields of mottled color on which the images, many 
adapted from elementary school textbooks, are arrayed. These colorfully stained 
fields are executed in the very style of abstract painting Wegman successfully 
sought to undermine from the start. A poignantly lyrical quality emerges from 
the strongest of them, "Evolutionary Aquarium" and "Social Studies," and the 
titles tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
 Through April 21 at Linda Cathcart Gallery, 924 Colorado Ave., and James 
Corcoran Gallery, 1325 5th St., both in Santa Monica.

No group or individual claimed responsibility for the killing, and the motive

Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government decreed a series of economic measures 
benefiting agriculture and state workers and devaluing the local currency 
4.88%. President Daniel Ortega is to hand over the government to Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro on April 25. The measures raised the minimum wage for state 
workers in April by about 400% to about $140 and said debts owed by farmers to 
the state banking system for the 1988-89 harvest will be restructured.

Train robbers shot and killed a postal worker and stole $3 million in Austrian 
currency from a mail car in what police said was the biggest heist in the 
history of Austria's postal service. The robbery near Vienna prompted postal 
authorities to post a $25,600 reward for the three thieves. The bandits stole 
moneybags containing about 35 million Austrian schillings before walking off 
the train unnoticed when it stopped in the suburb of Huetteldorf.

Britain and the Soviet Union signed an agreement calling for prompt 
notification of nuclear accidents and exchanges of information about the use 
and control of nuclear installations. The Soviet Union was criticized for its 
delay in notifying other countries of the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which was 
detected by Western monitors long before any Soviet announcement. The agreement 
came during talks in Moscow between British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.

</P>
<P>
Manufactured by Intoximeters Inc. of St. Louis, the 800 Alcosensor III devices 
distributed to CHP offices this month will provide digital readouts of the 
blood-alcohol level in drivers' systems. CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan said 
officers will ask motorists to blow into the preliminary alcohol screening 
devices on a voluntary basis if they are stopped on suspicion of drunk driving 
but have not been arrested. They can be arrested, however, if the readouts show 
blood-alcohol levels at or above the legal standard of .08%.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that notices of 
noncompliance have been served to the Marine Corps Logistics Base near Barstow 
for violations of federal hazardous-waste laws. 
</P>
<P>
EPA inspections showed that base annexes violated several provisions of the 
federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the treatment, 
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes, officials said. Violations include 
operating unauthorized hazardous-waste management units; treating, storing or 
disposing of hazardous waste not authorized by an existing permit; failure to 
maintain proper records, and failure to comply with land disposal restriction 
requirements. The Marine Corps is required to respond to the notice within 30 
days, detailing efforts planned to bring the facilities into compliance with 
the law, officials said.

JACK SMITH: A LOOK AT THE HOUSE OF CARDS DECONSTRUCTION BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having already written three columns on the vogue theory of literary criticism 
known as deconstruction, perhaps I ought to drop it; but I feel obliged to make 
a final accounting of the responses, pro and con. 
</P>
<P>
I have received 114 letters, 91 applauding my skepticism and 23 upbraiding me 
for my ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the letters against me were more fun; many were from professors of 
English or actual deconstructionists, and most were vitriolic and abusive, 
which suggests an insecurity in the movement. On the other hand, the numbers 
may suggest that a large majority of people are as ignorant as I am. 
</P>
<P>
I have room to quote only a few, and I will not name my critics, since I have 
already been accused of distorting their messages by quoting mischievously out 
of context. (One deconstructionist accused me of making his colleagues look 
like fools by my selective quotations.) I am neither that despicable nor that 
clever; fools will out. 
</P>
<P>
First, since I do not understand deconstruction, I have been unable to define 
it. Writing in the Wilson Quarterly (Winter 1990), Frank D. McConnell, 
professor of English at UC Santa Barbara, observes: "First, deconstructionist 
criticism is almost invariably written in a convoluted style and with a 
specialized vocabulary that excludes all but the initiated from penetrating its 
arguments." (That may explain my ignorance.) 
</P>
<P>
Here are just a few highlights (quoted out of context, and anonymously) from 
the hostile letters: 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, what I found was yet another vitriolic attack on deconstruction by a 
man who glories in his own purposeful ignorance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Your simplistic definition of deconstruction as reducing text to ambiguity or 
meaninglessness is irresponsible, not to mention absurd. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled. I wonder how someone as ostensibly intelligent and interested 
in language as you usually seem to be can be so smug about your own ignorance. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Your second article concerning deconstruction was even meaner and more 
mindlessly destructive than the first. . . . I am truly bewildered by the 
persistence of your anger and hostility, which you thinly veil under the 
posture of defensive jocularity. . . ." -- from a professor who was beside 
himself with anger. 
</P>
<P>
From a professor who admits he has spent 15 years trying to read Jacques 
Derrida, the high priest of deconstruction: "Mr. Smith seems to recognize that 
(his) article resembles nothing so much as prejudicial rant against some 
foreign group. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And so on. Oddly, most of them accuse me of being angry. 
</P>
<P>
I was only trying to have some fun with what to me is an impenetrably esoteric 
fad that seems to have captured our campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pro letters were fun, too: 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, as you well know, the argument that you don't have the background 
to understand their work (and) therefore are unqualified to judge (it) is 
merely the 'trust me' argument dolled up in academic finery." -- David Simmons, 
Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an ex-fourth-grade teacher, I might have hazarded a guess that 
'deconstruction' is what elementary school children do to school equipment." -- 
Gerd Abegglen, Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know that some of us out here in the academic trenches have 
nothing but praise and encouragement for your evaluation of deconstruction. The 
intemperate responses of the defenders of deconstruction come across as little 
more than a defense of obscurantism, perhaps with a bit of psychological 
defensiveness thrown in; for the real question these days is how 
'intellectually irresponsible' and 'ideologically dangerous' deconstruction 
itself is" -- Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D, Los Angeles Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"How could a clever, sensible guy like you let himself be hoodwinked by the 
deconstructionist swindle? Don't you know it's all an elaborate practical joke, 
the English department's version of the Piltdown Man?" -- Dennis Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
"Never mind the querulous complaints of the so-called deconstructionists, who 
deliberately choose to ignore the fact that the essence of literary art is 
communication. . . . They remind me of Boston, 'where the Lowells talk only to 
Cabots and the Cabots talk only to God." -- Maury Green. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most profound comments can be plucked from a sheaf of essays 
written on the question by the seventh-grade pupils of Rita V. Flint's Jurupa 
Middle School, who have been learning to read the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
This one by Tiffany Schnabel is typical: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that calling you childish, intellectually irresponsible and 
ideologically dangerous is very grown-up." 
</P>
<P>
Good thought. Let's all grow up.

FROM THE DOABLE TO THE FANTASTIC, STUDENTS LOOK TO THE FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Schroeder, 26, looks at the future and sees a computerized cookbook that 
calls up whatever recipe one wants and displays it on a screen, alongside an 
ingredient-weighing scale. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like having 'The Joy of Cooking' right at your fingertips," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Arnold, 28, looks at the future and sees a lightweight scooter that can 
be folded up and tucked into a backpack. 
</P>
<P>
"Some college students have to park so far away from campus that they really 
have a dual commute," he says. "I see this scooter as an alternative to a 
bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
Darren Saravis, 27, looks ahead and envisions a laptop computer for composing 
music, one that would use existing software but be packaged into a new 
sculptural form as compelling as Cubist art. In much the same way that 
architecture inspires people, Saravis thinks "the products around us can 
inspire us and make us feel better." 
</P>
<P>
These are not mere philosophical musings. These industrial design students are 
pondering the future because they will be shaping it and, in fact, have already 
started. Their work is on display this month at the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the people who will be shaping our world in the next decade -- 
making an impact on our daily lives in a thousand ways," said Ron Pierce of the 
Industrial Design Society of America, Los Angeles chapter, which assembled the 
show. "They are really visualizing what life will be like 20 years from now. 
They will be deciding what your cars, your appliances, your houses look like." 
</P>
<P>
The 25-project student exhibit is part of a show titled "On the Edge: 
Industrial Design in Southern California," which spotlights state-of-the-art 
work being done here. It was assembled this month for WestWeek, a design 
conference that brought more than 30,000 national and international visitors to 
the Pacific Design Center's 210 showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to demonstrate what designers are doing right now and what design 
students are thinking about the future," Pierce said. The works were chosen 
from three area design schools: the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, 
Cal State Long Beach and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The student exhibit represents a testing ground for future concepts. 
</P>
<P>
"These products are models only and will not be manufactured," Pierce said, 
"although major manufacturers like Sony often sponsor the college research 
projects to get ideas for their own future work. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to select a good cross-section of what's being done. A number of the 
products are doable right now, some are on the cutting edge of doable, and some 
are pushing the technology to its fantasy limits." 
</P>
<P>
The show seems eclectic, its prototypes touching on work-to-play aspects of 
daily life, from a graceful array of woodworking tools through a sculpted 
faucet and sink to such lighthearted toys as Andy Huang's Vid Pet (a video 
camera housed in a remote control mobile toy). 
</P>
<P>
Yet the exhibit presents an overall theme in its use of form and color, a theme 
Pierce describes as a growing sensitivity to the user's emotional needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Along with our rapid advancement in technology, with the development of 
computer chips and microprocessors, there is a kind of counter-reaction in 
trying to humanize these products," he said. (It's a phenomenon "Megatrends" 
author John Naisbitt has described as "high tech/high touch.") 
</P>
<P>
In place of the hard-edged black boxes associated with electronics, student 
designers are bringing "some spirit, some warmth and playfulness into these 
products," Pierce said. "This can be as appropriate for a kitchen appliance as 
a child's toy." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce also notes that designers today are trying to make products more 
expressive of what their actual function is. This has been made possible partly 
by technology that has shrunk computers from bulky clusters of motors, tubes 
and gears to compressed electronic boards, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The exciting part of student work is that they are constantly testing our 
preconceptions," he said. "They have the freedom to push the boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
"On the Edge" suggests to the viewer that the consumer future holds not only 
new computer forms and user-friendly work tools for the household, but also an 
emphasis on new looks in transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Center's Brian Coleman's team designed a bright pink Surround Cycle, 
which crosses a child's Big Wheel tricycle with the old-fashioned appeal of 
rolling down the hill in a tire's inner tube. He is an engineer and 
environmentalist who expects to tackle serious transportation projects. He is 
working on a "clutchless transmission with a direct linkage between each gear." 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are getting too excited about new technology when the old ideas 
haven't been fully explored," he said. "The automotive industry talks about new 
technologies, but basically you still have this gasoline power plant that is 
polluting the atmosphere and gobbling up fossil fuels." 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the technology spectrum, "On the Edge" features a 
superconductive magnet levitation bike designed by Art Center students Hiroshi 
Tsuzaki and Makoto Makita. 
</P>
<P>
The prototype, based on emerging transportation technologies being explored in 
Europe and Japan, is described as a "statement of the promise of the future," 
with its sculpted look and its technology reduced to bare essentials, says the 
Art Center's Martin Smith, who was the instructor on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Tsuzaki describes the technology, which allows the wheels to turn without 
friction, as "not for bicycles yet," but with great potential. 
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in transportation design," he said, "and I am not just 
thinking about cars. In the future we may not use the word car. It may be more 
like a robot. The technology can be used so many ways."

CRA policies -- A headline in a Times story March 31 may have created the 
erroneous impression that accounting firm owner Deborah Morrisette had 
criticized the Community Redevelopment Agency during a workshop for minority- 
and women-owned businesses. Additionally, a sentence in the story implied that 
Morrisette was critical of practices that permitted Bishop H.H. Brookins and 
other influential members of minorities to get city contracts. Morrissette made 
no such statement regarding Brookins.

Hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovaks staged a 10-minute strike today to 
demand that the Communist Party hand over property it gained unlawfully during 
four decades of monopoly rule. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 minutes before noon, car horns began blaring and shopkeepers closed their 
doors to support the strike called by the opposition movement Civic Forum 
chapter located at the CKD Polovodice factory.

In Wenceslas Square, several thousand people jangled their keys in unison -- a

gathered in the same square had produced the eerie sound to signify that the 
communists' lock on power was over.

DEFECTORS BLOCK PERES CABINET;

<TEXT>
<P>
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres failed to form a new Israeli government today 
in a blow to prospects for early peace talks with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Two religious deputies humiliated Peres by walking out of his coalition just 
before the Knesset began a special session due to approve a Labor-led Cabinet 
to replace caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The defections left Labor with only 59 supporters against Likud's 60 in the 
120-seat Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) adjourned a chaotic session without endorsing a new 
government, leaving Shamir, 74, in power. 
</P>
<P>
"I have informed the speaker of the house that because of developments in the 
last hours I am incapable of presenting a government today and I will do it at 
a later date," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
President Chaim Herzog later agreed to give Peres two more weeks to seek a 
majority. But political commentators said his prospects appear slim, casting 
doubt on the 66-year-old Labor leader's political future. 
</P>
<P>
Labor might be forced to return to a national unity government with Likud, and 
former Labor Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 67, could emerge as a compromise 
candidate for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
As Peres left the president's residence he told reporters: "I am convinced that 
if Israel does not open a peace process, we will lose the diplomatic initiative 
and create the conditions for a hostile initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis Avraham Verdiger and Eliezer Mizrahi said they could not back a Peres 
government dependent on Arab deputies who support the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Verdiger resigned from the Knesset and Mizrahi quit the ultra-orthodox Agudat 
Israel Party, the only religious faction to side with Labor against Likud. 
Mizrahi said he would stay in parliament and vote against a Peres cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
After a tumultuous debate in which Jewish and Arab members traded abuse, with 
hapless Speaker Dov Shilansky incapable of maintaining order, the session 
adjourned. It is not due to meet again until the regular summer session opens 
on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's production was a disgrace to the Knesset. Democracy was turned into a 
kind of farce," Likud caucus leader Sarah Doron said on Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Labor opened Israel's latest political crisis in March by walking out of a 
15-month-old national unity government with Likud over Shamir's firing of Peres 
and his refusal to accept U.S. proposals for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in 
Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament passed an unprecedented "no confidence" motion in Shamir's rump 
cabinet on March 15, and Herzog asked Peres five days later to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader informed the president last week that he had a majority after 
embittered former Likud minister Avraham Sharir crossed the floor to Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Likud meanwhile worked to persuade the New York-based Lubavitch religious sect, 
which opposes territorial concessions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
to instruct its followers in Agudat Israel not to support Peres. 
</P>
<P>
The religious Shas party, whose five abstentions brought down Shamir, proposed 
today that a new national unity coalition be formed in which the premiership 
would rotate between Labor and Likud.

AIDS VICTIM RYAN WHITE EULOGIZED;

First Lady Barbara Bush and a host of celebrities joined mourners at services 
today for AIDS victim Ryan White, the teen-ager who steadfastly fought to the 
end against public misconceptions and prejudice about his deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon funeral was held in Second Presbyterian Church, chosen because it 
was one of the few churches near his hometown of Cicero that could accommodate 
the throngs of mourners. It can seat more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
White, 18, died Sunday in Riley Hospital for Children after waging a five-year 
battle against the disease and discrimination against its victims. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ray Probasco, a Methodist minister and friend of the White family, 
delivered the main funeral sermon. The choir from Hamilton Heights High School, 
where White was a junior, sang and singer Elton John, a friend of White's, 
played and sang his own "Skyline Pigeon" and lead the congregation in the 
Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
John, football player Howie Long, talk show host Phil Donahue and three of 
White's high school friends -- Tommy Hale, Leo Joseph and John Huffman -- were 
the pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Evan Bayh ordered flags in the state flown at half-staff. Classes were 
held today at Hamilton Heights High School, where White was a junior, but 
students were allowed to leave and attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
White, who won the admiration of stars and common people alike during his 
crusade for AIDS education, was remembered Wednesday by former President Ronald 
Reagan as a teen-ager "who just wanted to be like the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan would probably be embarrassed by all the fuss we are making over him," 
Reagan wrote in an op-ed column in the Washington Post. "He did not want to be 
anyone special. He just wanted to go to school, play with his friends and grow 
up like every other kid in the neighborhood. But it was not to be." 
</P>
<P>
After the funeral White was buried this afternoon in a private service at a 
cemetery in Cicero, the town about 25 miles north of Indianapolis where he had 
lived since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people called during visitation Tuesday at a mortuary in suburban 
Carmel despite dreary, rainy weather. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors included family, friends, classmates, well-wishers and AIDS 
activists. About 25 people at a time were allowed into the visitation area, 
where they were greeted by White's mother, Jeanne. 
</P>
<P>
John, who arrived at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis on April 2 and 
kept vigil in White's room until his death, stood behind Jeanne White to offer 
comfort to her and other friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Prominently displayed in front of White's open casket were a slate from the 
1989 television movie, "The Ryan White Story," and a People magazine cover 
featuring White. Numerous photos, including a baby picture posted above White's 
body, were placed among flowers that adorned the casket. 
</P>
<P>
White was diagnosed with AIDS in December, 1984, after contracting the virus 
from a blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia. He was told he might 
live six months to one year but he survived more than five years.

U.S. SAYS 'NO' TO UNITED GERMANY IN NATO, WARSAW PACT

<P>
The State Department today flatly ruled out a proposal by Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that a united Germany become a member of both the 
Warsaw Pact and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the proposal "is in our 
minds another form of neutrality which the Germans themselves, their neighbors 
and the Soviet Union regard as undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was floated this week by Soviet officials, including Shevardnadze in a 
magazine published in Brussels, "NATO's 16 Nations." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said in the article, "It should be recognized that the idea is out 
of the ordinary, but must we cling to things we have grown accustomed to in 
such an unusual situation? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be erroneous to begin building German unity by destroying the 
existing security systems without having replaced them with new ones. Dual 
membership for Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the difficulties."

An Atlas-E rocket roared toward space today, carrying three small scientific 
satellites on a $22-million mission aimed at improving military communications 
and aiding navigation. 
</P>
<P>
The 96-foot rocket lifted off the pad at Space Launch Complex-3 at 8 a.m., said 
Maj. Tom Worsdale, an Air Force spokesman at this sprawling coastal military 
base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked excellent," he said. "It's the smoothest launch I've seen in the 
year I've been here. Everything went perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Worsdale said the rocket flew south over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The three satellites, which contain four experiments, were propelled into a 
460-mile polar orbit by the Atlas, which was topped by a Scout-Altair 
upper-stage booster. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is named P87-2 Stacksat. The Air Force has not explained the 
meaning of P87-2, but Stacksat means that the satellites were stacked atop the 
rocket for launch.

The government of Romania, citing the threat of demonstrations, asked ex-King 
Michael today to postpone his first visit since he was dethroned in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
But a Bucharest aide to the 68-year-old former monarch said he still plans to 
arrive from his home in Switzerland as scheduled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, the king is not giving up his visit," the aide said after the 
ex-monarch's advance party told him by telephone that the government had asked 
him to stay away until after elections May 20. 
</P>
<P>
"He still intends to come," the aide said. "Officially, he thanks the 
government for its concern and he feels he has no reason not to come." 
</P>
<P>
Ex-King Michael will be the first monarch deposed by Communists in Eastern 
Europe after World War II to return to his homeland since Communist rule began 
to crumble last year. 
</P>
<P>
The interim government made its appeal after several opposition politicians 
said the former king's visit might spark demonstrations and inflame election 
passions.

The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more 
than doubled in the last 100 years, and it will probably rise at an even faster 
rate in the next 30 years, researchers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Britain's Harwell Laboratory said recent measurements of 
ground-level ozone indicate that levels of the gas are, on the average, twice 
as high as those recorded by French researchers in Paris in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's 
ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. But 
when found near ground level, the highly corrosive form of oxygen can cause 
respiratory distress. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is formed through complex 
reactions with nitrogen oxide and other chemicals found in automobile and 
industrial emissions containing nitrogen oxide.

WOMAN DIES AFTER JUDGE OKD RESPIRATOR REMOVAL

A paralyzed 50-year-old woman died today just minutes after doctors unhooked 
her life support system -- a move a judge ruled did not need court approval as 
long as it was requested by the patient. 
</P>
<P>
After a bedside meeting with her sister and her favorite nurse, Dr. James 
Sullivan unhooked the respirator that had kept Nancy Gamble alive for 14 months 
at Baptist Hospital, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble, 50, who was paralyzed by the incurable Lou Gehrig's disease, died 
"peacefully" 15 minutes later this morning, attorney Mary Martin Schaffner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson County Chancellor Robert Brandt ruled Tuesday in the right-to-die suit 
Gamble filed after Baptist Hospital refused to let her physician remove her 
respirator. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that Gamble's physician could remove her respirator and for the 
first time in Tennessee, he also decided that physicians may act without any 
court's permission to honor a disabled patient's wish to die. 
</P>
<P>
Disabled rights activists protested Brandt's decision, calling it "further 
movement down the slippery slope of euthanasia of individuals whom society may 
perceive as unwanted burdens." 
</P>
<P>
But Brandt said: "This case does not involve suicide and it does not involve 
euthanasia. This case does not belong in court." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that physicians may unhook the respirators of disabled patients 
as long as the patients are mentally competent, fully informed of their 
condition and voluntarily deciding to die. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt called it discriminatory to "impose the cumbersome legal process" on the 
disabled trying to decide their own medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This court finds they should have the same right to decide their future as 
those who are not totally disabled," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for ADAPT, or American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today, urged 
the court to assure that Gamble is offered suicide prevention counseling. 
</P>
<P>
ADAPT argued in court papers that Gamble could have lived independently with 
attendants to care for her at home and that she could have operated a computer 
with her mouth to communicate better. 
</P>
<P>
"Terminal illness should not be used to justify a wholesale abandonment of 
society's policies designed to protect human life," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner said Brandt's ruling is the first in Tennessee to say disabled 
patients no longer must seek court permission to have respirators removed.

KEATING CHALLENGES U.S. ESTIMATE OF LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN SAVINGS: EX-CHAIRMAN OF FAILED S&amp;L LABELS GOVERNMENT'S 50% 
WRITEDOWN AS 'ABSURD.'

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Keating, the former chairman of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan 
Assn., today bitterly challenged government estimates of losses at the thrift 
as inflated and arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
He called a 50% government writedown estimate on the company's headquarters in 
Arizona "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, in his bid to regain Lincoln from federal regulators who seized it 
last April, said the government wrote down the value of Lincoln assets to make 
the thrift's loss appear larger. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators who took control of the Irvine, Calif., thrift have said 
that protecting Lincoln's depositors from losses could cost taxpayers as much 
as $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been hearing this number in the media throughout the world since the 
takeover," Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin at a pretrial 
hearing on a government motion to dismiss Keating's suit for control of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
John Lundin, a Keating attorney, said the government's estimate of Lincoln's 
loan losses was "done arbitrarily" and arrived at shortly after regulators took 
control of the thrift when it was determined to be operating in an "unsafe and 
unsound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said federal regulators, after taking over Lincoln, determined that all 
of the thrift's $1.4 billion mortgage-backed loan portfolio was in default. 
Regulators tallied a loss of $703.3 million from these loans. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's books, Keating said, showed that only about 3% of the loans had 
defaulted and would not be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators also said the thrift's $71.1-million portfolio of commercial loans, 
backed by collateral other than mortgages, had soured and represented an 
estimated loss of about $31.5 million. Keating said that less than 3% of these 
loans were in default. 
</P>
<P>
Also cited was a 50% writedown on an $11-million office building Lincoln 
purchased in the "high-rent district" of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers are absurd," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Sporkin how much the building should be sold for, Keating 
replied, "I'm saying it isn't $6 million or $5 million." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a depressed real estate market in Arizona, Keating said the building 
"may be a little less than when we bought it." 
</P>
<P>
"The testimony here is, this is a pretty shoddy piece of work," Sporkin said. 
</P>
<P>
James Murphy, an attorney representing the Office of Thrift Supervision, said 
he plans to present witnesses to support the government's figures. 
</P>
<P>
In another challenge of the government's takeover, Keating's attorneys produced 
a memo from Mark Randall, the federal managing agent at Lincoln, to his 
superiors questioning the competence of Roger Clark, hired by regulators to 
serve as the thrift's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, dated July 19, 1989, cites Clark's "inaction" and "questionable 
judgment" while operating the thrift under receivership. Clark now serves as 
Lincoln's chief financial officer.

Bowing to growing U.S. pressures, Japan's domestic telecommunications company 
NTT announced today it has selected a U.S.-Japanese joint venture for 
construction of its new head office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. said Cesar Pelli &amp; Yamashita 
Associated Architects have been selected as contractors from among seven 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors are a joint venture of Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates Inc. of New 
Haven, Conn., and the Japanese engineering company Yamashita Architects &amp; 
Engineering Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Pelli, professor of architecture at Yale University, has designed many 
buildings in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Cesar Pelli-Yamashita venture was selected after NTT's Evaluation and 
Screening Committee has carefully studied proposals submitted by applicants, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
NTT's project calls for a 30-story head office in Tokyo's expanding business 
center of Shinjuku. 
</P>
<P>
NTT said it had originally planned to select contractors from among Japanese 
companies but made the change in light of repeated U.S. calls on Japan to open 
up its construction market.

The stock market barely budged in a quiet session today as Wall Street drew 
closer to a long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.35 to 2,729.73. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 725 up, 747 down and 492 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 141.08 million shares, against 136.02 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost .06 to 187.57. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, prices of long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly, 
lowering their yields to the 8.56%-8.62% range. 
</P>
<P>
That reversed an increase in rates Tuesday that occurred as a sale of 40-year 
savings institution "bailout" bonds drew an unenthusiastic reception. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said traders were proceeding cautiously as they watched the first 
corporate earnings reports for the January-March quarter come in. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are expected to be downbeat, for the most part, reflecting 
persistent weakness in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in nervous early trading today, rebounding from Tuesday's 
selloff that stemmed from disappointment over the government's auction of new 
long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up at midday around 3/8 point, or 
$3.75 per $1,000 face amount, after losing about $5 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 8.54% from 8.59% 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shorter-term Treasuries posted more modest price gains. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the credit markets got a boost today from rumors that at least 
two money center banks are having liquidity problems due to troubled real 
estate loans.

A coalition of health organizations and scientists today called on hamburger

food and stop cooking french fries in beef fat. 
</P>
<P>
"We are troubled by many of your products, but especially by the unnecessary 
use of shortening made largely from beef fat," said a letter from organizations 
that included the American Heart Assn., American Public Health Assn. and the

</P>
<P>
"As you know, a small serving of your french fries contains more beef fat than 
your regular hamburger," they said.

The letter was also sent to the fast food chains Wendy's and Jack in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has already stopped frying chicken, fish and pies in beef fat, and 
announced last week that it is testing french fries cooked in vegetable oil in 
500 of its restaurants.

RYAN WHITE'S AIDS BATTLE TO BE TOLD IN BOOK

<P>
The story of Ryan White's battle with AIDS will be told in a children's book 
its publisher hopes will help better educate the nation's youth about the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was the subject of persecution at his Indiana grade school five 
years ago when he was diagnosed as having the disease, died Sunday a hero among 
his peers. The 18-year-old White spent much of his time near the end of his 
life answering volumes of mail from children wanting to know more about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"He got maybe 1,000 letters a week from kids. Every time he appeared somewhere 
the volume doubled," said Toby Sherry, a senior editor with Dial Books for 
Young Readers, a division of E. P. Dutton in New York City. "Dial considers it 
an important book, because kids will listen to another kid about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
White collaborated on the book with a writer who wished to remain anonymous, 
Sherry said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not done a very good job educating our country about how AIDS is 
transmitted -- especially with young people; who think they're immortal. It's 
the first time a child who has AIDS is talking to other children" through a 
book, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, they will listen. To me, that's what's important about this book." 
Sherry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan was an important spokesperson," Sherry added. "I never met him, but I've 
seen him on TV and he was remarkable -- you were riveted. I think part of it 
was because he had so much presence and his feet were on the ground and he was 
so sensible, and I think kids really listened to him." 
</P>
<P>
The book will be Ryan's story of the past five years, from the time he was 
denied the opportunity to attend classes at a Russiaville, Ind., school near 
Kokomo after he was diagnosed as having contracted the acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. He got the virus, as hundreds of hemophiliacs have, 
through a tainted blood-clotting agent. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry said the book, which was proposed by the White family, is expected to 
run about 100 to 130 pages and have lots of photographs, which they feel will 
help keep youngsters turning the pages.

<P>
Eddie Murphy, his production company, and Paramount Pictures won a victory 
Tuesday when a Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit over the movie "Coming 
to America." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in August, 1989, by Oman Oba Adele Mouftaou Lassine 
Osseni-Bellow, also known as Prince Johnny Osseni-Bellow. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff claimed in his suit that Murphy, Eddie Murphy Productions Inc., 
and Paramount Pictures Corp. used his story idea to produce a film about an 
African prince coming to America. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Philip Saeta dismissed the state court case when Osseni-Bellow failed to 
appear in court for a scheduled hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was similar to another action in federal court, also involving 
Osseni-Bellow and a Canadian writer, Shelby Gregory. That lawsuit, a copyright 
action over "Coming to America," involved the same allegations as the state 
suit and already has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither lawsuit was related to the celebrated action over "Coming to America" 
by columnist Art Buchwald.

Watching kidvid on Saturday mornings next season, remember -- you heard it 
someplace else first. 
</P>
<P>
The three networks have revealed their new series for next year, which are 
animations of everything from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on CBS to Roseanne 
Barr's childhood on ABC, with a strong rock beat from NBC. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, nine shows have been dropped from the Saturday morning 
schedule. NBC will no longer broadcast "Alf," "Smurfs," "The Karate Kid" and 
"Kissyfur." CBS has eliminated "The California Raisins," "Dungeons and Dragons" 
and "The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy," while ABC parts with "Gummy 
Bears," "Weekend Specials" and "Animal Crackups." 
</P>
<P>
The market involved is not chopped marshmallows. Brandon Tartikoff, president 
of NBC Entertainment, said in emceeing his network's presentation to 
advertisers that the 36 million children who spend Saturday morning in front of 
the tube also have about $7 billion in allowances, gifts and odd-job pay -- and 
influence their parents' purchases of $70 billion worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The new NBC shows are: 
</P>
<P>
"Rick Moranis in Gravedale High." Half-hour series features the voice and 
animated image of Moranis as a dedicated teacher who becomes headmaster of a 
high school for monsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Kid 'n' Play." The half-hour animated comedy was inspired by the rap duo from 
the hit movie "House Party." 
</P>
<P>
"The Boys Next Door" (working title). In this live-action half hour, five 
teen-age boys pirate the airwaves to broadcast their own music and sketch 
comedy show from the basement of their California home. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday Videos" (working title). Celebrity guest hosts will present the music 
videos aimed for a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Stuff: The Entertainment Magazine of the NBA." The half-hour show will 
feature the best plays and players in the National Basketball Assn., with a 
strong behind-the-scenes and off-court focus. 
</P>
<P>
The new ABC shows: 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz." The Wicked Witch has been magically reincarnated so that 
Dorothy, the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow can overcome her. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Kids on the Block." The hot musical group stars in a half-hour series 
in which each episode opens with live-action music before switching to animated 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"Little Rosey." Roseanne Barr stars in the animated story of her life at 10. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS newcomers: 
</P>
<P>
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Each hourlong show will present two new 
adventures of the heroes on the half shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." The stars of the hit kids' movie, Alex 
Winter (Bill) and Keanu Reeves (Ted) will recreate their roles as the voices of 
the time-traveling teen-agers in this animated series.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist refused today to block rebroadcast of part 
of a cable television documentary about the child-custody battle over Hilary 
Foretich. Rehnquist rejected a request to keep a four-minute segment of the 
telecast off the air. 
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Nathan Lewin, a lawyer appointed to protect the 
interests of Hilary, 7. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin said that each time the segment is aired it violates Hilary's privacy 
rights by letting more viewers see footage "likely to be highly distasteful and 
embarrassing during (Hilary's) entire life." 
</P>
<P>
The documentary, first shown in this country April 6, is scheduled for 
rebroadcast Saturday and again April 19 by Lifetime cable network. It 
chronicles Hilary's odyssey with her maternal grandparents from Northern 
Virginia to England to New Zealand to avoid unsupervised visits with the girl's 
father, Dr. Eric Foretich. 
</P>
<P>
A four-minute portion of the British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, entitled 
"Hilary in Hiding," shows the girl in a therapy session in which she 
demonstrates with dolls alleged sex abuse by her father. Foretich has denied 
abusing his daughter.

What a difference a year makes, says actor Richard Gere. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at this time, I looked around and asked, 'Why aren't I being offered 
certain movies?' And the hard answer was, 'You're not box office, pal,' " Gere 
said in May's Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The actor says his appeal had dropped so severely after movie bombs such as 
"King David" and "Power" that he considered saying sayonara to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a point where I thought the courageous choice would be to get out of 
the business. But then I thought, 'No, the courageous thing is to stay in it,"' 
Gere recalled. 
</P>
<P>
His choice paid off, with "Internal Affairs" and the current "Pretty Woman" 
reviving the career of the one-time "American Gigolo."

Carl Perkins earned his Ph.D. in rock 'n' roll long ago and now he'll get an 
honorary doctor of humanities from Lambuth College in Jackson, Tenn., on April 
29. When Lambuth President Thomas Boyd called to talk to Perkins about the 
degree, Perkins asked him, "Can you graduate from college with only eight years 
in school?" Thomas assured him that he could, in this case. . . . There's 
another Kennedy wedding coming up in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Kara Kennedy, 30, daughter of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and a producer 
on "Evening Magazine" at WBZ-TV in Boston, will marry Michael Allen, a 
Washington architect. The date and site of the wedding were not announced. 
Kara's cousin, Kerry Kennedy, 30, daughter of the late Robert Kennedy, recently 
announced her engagement to Andrew Cuomo, the son of New York Gov. Mario M. 
Cuomo.

TV viewers who hoped to see Dale Murphy and Will Clark start the baseball 
season were seeing Herman Munster and Jed Clampett instead, thanks to a spring 
thunderstorm and programming decisions at SuperStation TBS. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner's television station, WTBS, decided not to show the opener of 
Turner's baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The season opener, against the National League champion San Francisco Giants, 
was scheduled to be televised from Atlanta Tuesday night, but a strong 
thunderstorm washed out the game. 
</P>
<P>
A 5:10 p.m. EDT double-header was then scheduled for today, but a TBS Sports 
spokeswoman said there are no plans to change the programming to televise 
either game. 
</P>
<P>
The TBS lineup tonight: "The Munsters," "The Beverly Hillbillies" and the 
Atlanta Hawks-Milwaukee Bucks basketball game.

At the Southeast 17th Street causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway, many 
worlds meet. To the southwest, cruise ships dock, chock-a-block with 
multinational clienteles. From the northwest, charter fishing boats rumble away 
from hotel marinas and private piers toward Port Everglades Channel and the 
fishing grounds offshore. 
</P>
<P>
To the northeast stands Pier 66 Resort and Marina, all spit and polish, fern 
bars and waterside cafes, and primary layover facility for the fleet in the 
Whitbread Round the World Race. 
</P>
<P>
To the southeast stands a lesser hotel and a flamingo-pink shopping center. At 
the lesser hotel, the Best Western Marina Inn, part of the Whitbread overflow 
will dock this week. At a small, smelly bar tucked away in the pink shopping 
center, an ersatz treasure hunter named Dick Vogel was holding court late one 
night last week. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel's tales of treasure were nonsensical; his admiration for the Nazi 
infantry in World War II was vocal and comparable in zeal only to his distaste 
for the Whitbread race. 
</P>
<P>
"Whitebread, who cares about the Whitebread?" Herr Vogel said. "Bunch of slimy 
limeys and (assorted other racial epithets) chasing each other around the 
world. Who cares? What's the point?" 
</P>
<P>
In the bar that night while Vogel presided was a knot of journalists in town to 
cover the Whitbread. The correspondent from Britain's The Independent sat 
quietly while Vogel railed about gold coins and emeralds ("an Englishman is 
never unintentionally rude," he said several times), but Vogel's assessment of 
the Whitbread set him off. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is -- quite exactly, really -- the point," the correspondent from The 
Independent said. "Slimy limeys, Italians, Swedes, Dutch, Finns, Americans, 
Kiwis, Australians and Germans racing around the whole bloody world. Not for 
money -- for a chance to win a few silly, plated trophies and the privilege to 
be able to say they have done it." 
</P>
<P>
The point seemed quite exactly lost on Vogel. Treasure, after all, to many is 
something you can pick up, rub between your fingers and admire or sell. Perhaps 
the point is lost on many other Americans as well. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some who notice that Steinlager 2 and Fisher &amp; Paykel, each a 
multimillion-dollar campaign with major corporate sponsors, are neck and neck 
over the last four legs of the race. Others may have taken note that there is 
no American entry and there is one all-woman crew. But few will be able to tick 
off the ports of call, the large or small tragedies and triumphs in 33,000 
miles of racing. 
</P>
<P>
To many of the crew, being there at all is treasure in itself.

SINGLE QUITS; GREGG TO HEAD ATHLETICS AT SMU

Southern Methodist Athletic Director Doug Single, hired three years ago to 
rebuild a scandal-scarred program, resigned today and Football Coach Forrest 
Gregg was named as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Single, who came to SMU after the NCAA ordered the football program shut down 
for two years after finding numerous violations, left to head Special Olympics 
International. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Gregg, hired by Single two years ago, will remain as football 
coach for the 1990 season before giving up his coaching duties to serve only as 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"In very few places has it ever worked successfully for the same person to be 
head coach and athletic director," SMU President A. Kenneth Pye said. "Forrest 
brings integrity and the confidence of the alumni in his new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Pye also praised Single, who was in Washington for a news conference to 
announce his new post, for restoring progress to SMU's athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll miss the players and the coaches, and it will be tough for me to leave 
coaching," Gregg said about his decision to give up coaching after the 1990 
season. "I thought I'd be coaching the rest of my career, but this job will 
present a tremendous challenge and I look forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Single was credited by university officials with motivating the 
school's return to football competition. The Mustangs resumed playing football 
last year after the NCAA suspended the program after the 1986 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose Doug Single to be director of athletics because of his integrity, 
academic excellence and creativity," Pye said in a prepared statement. "He has 
lived up to every expectation. Special Olympics is giving him an extraordinary 
opportunity to bring his charisma and dedication to sports in the international 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
Single begins work for Special Olympics on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA sanctioned SMU on Feb. 24, 1987, canceling the school's football 
season that year and restricting the number of scholarships for 1988 because of 
recruiting violations connected with the pay-for-play scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded Special Olympics 22 years ago, announced 
Single's selection as president and chief executive officer of the training and 
athletic competition for individuals with mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug Single has brought drive and integrity to every sports organization he's 
led," said Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz. "He'll be great for Special Olympics, a 
one-of-a-kind combination of athlete, administrator, spokesman and all-around 
leader for a program unique in the whole world of sports." 
</P>
<P>
Single was selected from a field of more than two dozen candidates, resulting 
from what the sports organization called an exhaustive search lasting more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug Single is a great athletic director, fund-raiser and athlete, but the 
greatest thing about him to me is this," Shriver said. "For many years, he has 
been a volunteer for Special Olympics. To me, that makes him very special 
indeed." 
</P>
<P>
Single was also credited with helping to revitalize the SMU's basketball 
program. School officials said he raised more than $3 million to finance 
renovation of the football stadium and to provide start-up costs for returning 
the football program to active status. 
</P>
<P>
A national search committee that included Donald Keough, Coca-Cola Co. 
president and chief executive officer, made the recommendation for Single. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a dynamic individual to continue to lead and inspire the 
professional staffs and 500,000 unpaid volunteers who administer the programs 
each day around the world," Keough said. "After a yearlong search, Doug Single 
has been identified as the sports leader who can best guide the continued 
expansion of Special Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Single, at 29 the nation's youngest athletics director, was also credited with 
reviving Northwestern's athletic program.

Phoenix Suns guard Mike McGee was fined $3,000 for smacking New Jersey's Purvis 
Short in the back of the head, the NBA said today in announcing seven player 
fines totaling $10,500. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was fined for his part in a brief fight with Short on March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Short was fined $1,000 for initiating the fight by throwing an elbow, the NBA 
said. The NBA said McGee, a former Net, received the larger fine because of the 
way he retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Denver guard Todd Lichti and Seattle forward Xavier McDaniel were 
fined $1,500 apiece for fighting in a game at Denver on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley of Philadelphia and Charles Oakley of New York were fined 
$1,500 apiece, and Patrick Ewing of the Knicks got a $500 fine for fighting on

JOHN CLAYTON JR. -- THE TRAVELING BASS PLAYER AND COMPOSER; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: HE TOURS, RECORDS AND TEACHES -- AND FINDS TIME TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE BLACK 
MUSICIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Clayton Jr. is rapidly becoming one of the most internationally respected 
bassists and composers and with good reason, when you consider his credits. 
</P>
<P>
As a jazzman, he's played with the Count Basie Orchestra and pianist Monty 
Alexander; as a classicist, he served as principal bassist with the Amsterdam 
Philharmonic for five years. 
</P>
<P>
As a bandleader, he co-leads the Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra with his brother, 
saxophonist Jeff Clayton, and drummer Jeff Hamilton. The group, which made one 
of its rare appearances Monday at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, has 
two albums due out next week: an instrumental set on Capri Records and one 
backing singer Ernestine Anderson on Concord. The brothers also co-lead a 
quintet, which appears tonight at the Indigo Jazz Club in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer and arranger, Clayton went to West Germany three times last year, 
mainly to write music for the Cologne Radio Orchestra. He also contributed 
works for Doc Severinsen's Tonight Show Orchestra, and for six weeks -- which 
he describes as "my write-till-I-drop period" -- wrote dozens of arrangements 
for the Gene Harris Phillip Morris Superband, prior to its 1989 world tour. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said his current inspiration as a writer is Academy Award winner Johnny 
Mandel. "I have to learn how to work with synthesizers and computers," Clayton 
said, "and Johnny has been my mentor, just as Ray Brown was when I was studying 
the bass. Henry Mancini helps me too." 
</P>
<P>
In between writing assignments, Clayton's life as a touring and recording 
musician, and as a bass teacher, goes on unabated. In the past year he has 
toured Holland with pianist Alexander, gigged with John Collins, Benny Carter, 
Bud Shank, Carmen McRae and Nancy Wilson, and recorded with Rosemary Clooney 
and Mancini. He also took part in a series of instructional videos along with 
fellow bassists Ray Brown, Milt Hinton and Francois Rabbath, the French 
classical virtuoso. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps enough is enough. "For the next year," he said, "I really have to cut 
down on the traveling. With these albums coming out, I want to establish the 
big band, and work on writing projects in Los Angeles. Of course, I can still 
go back to Germany when they need me." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles in 1952 into a musical family -- "My mother still is a 
wonderful pianist and conducts church choirs" -- the tall, personable Clayton 
began his bass studies with Ray Brown at 16. Only three years later, he was the 
bassist on the TV series "The Mancini Generation." He gave up the series to 
complete his studies at Indiana University; then came two seminal years as he 
toured the United States and Europe with Monty Alexander. The Basie gig came 
next. 
</P>
<P>
"After leaving Basie, I moved to Holland, but I flew right back to take part in 
the finals of the National Black Music Colloquium and Competition," he said. "I 
tied with a viola player for first place in the strings division. But 
meanwhile, I had auditioned for the Amsterdam Philharmonic, so I went right 
back and started there." 
</P>
<P>
Widely accepted though he is on the Los Angeles music front, Clayton is 
disturbed by a lingering racism he finds all around him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad. I'll look around in a studio and see that I'm the only black 
player in the whole place, out of maybe 60 musicians," he said. "It's the same 
with big jazz bands; it's shocking to me that anyone could have a big band in 
Los Angeles and go on and on for years without even accidentally having a 
single black player. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the number of black jazz musicians who are capable, anxious and willing, 
this situation is ludicrous. It's important to reach out to the young black 
players and open the door for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I could shrug my shoulders and say, 'Well, that's the way it is; nobody says 
the music business is fair.' But if I do that, things will only get worse, so I 
can't ignore the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Given his widespread credits in playing and writing, in classical and jazz, 
what does Clayton hope for in his future? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to spend 40% of my time playing jazz bass, 40% composing, and 20% 
playing classical music," he said. "My loves are playing bass, in any style or 
capacity, and writing music; so as I have my bass or my pen in my hands, I'm 
happy."

STUCKY STRIKES CHORD FOR A 'COMMON LANGUAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he has taught music at Cornell University since 1980, Steven Stucky is 
no ivory-tower composer. Even if he wanted to be -- which he doesn't -- the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, for which he is composer-in-residence, wouldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my roles with the Los Angeles Philharmonic is to be seen a lot," Stucky 
said in a recent phone interview from his home near Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. 
"Not in a frivolous PR way, but because to the extent there's a sort of gap or 
reservoir of mistrust between the consumers of modern music and the producers 
of modern music, one of the ways to get over that is through ordinary human 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
Stucky will make that human contact in a talk about his music tonight at 7:30 
at the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply having the chance to meet the artist and talk in easy, layman's terms 
about what he's trying to do goes a long way to creating a common language to 
approach the music. . . . I've seen it happen over and over again," said the 
40-year-old composer, who has received commissions from orchestras in 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis and, of course, Los Angeles. His Concerto 
for Orchestra was a finalist for the 1989 Pulitzer Prize in composition. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps for me as a listener, too. I often find it easier to warm up to a 
piece by someone I know than to a piece in which I have no human entry, only 
the notes. Connecting the piece with the personality of the composer, knowing 
something about him as a human being, gives you a natural way in." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Stucky to talk too much about his private life ("My life is 
boring," he said) or to talk in lofty technical and theoretical terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about (music) that way," he said. "I tend to talk about what 
makes my pulse race, my hair stand up, what gives me visceral reactions. When 
I'm composing, I suppose what I'm trying to do is raise those reactions in 
myself in the hope that I will make them in other people." 
</P>
<P>
Composing, however, is a "slow, painstaking, note-by-note" process, Stucky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm constantly revising, tinkering when I'm writing," he said. "It's not fast. 
It can be weeks or months; months usually. But it usually produces in the end 
what I want without having to go back and try again. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a moment after a few months, when the piece exists even though 
it's not finished. It takes on a personality and becomes easy to write. It has 
momentum, a history of its own." 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, he orchestrates his work as he writes, bar by bar, sometimes 
filling up to 34 staves. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideas are always related to their instrumentation right away," he explained. 
"There is no reason to wait to work an idea out until later. The relationship 
of the idea and its orchestra coloring is very close, and that's part of what I 
have to get down right away. 
</P>
<P>
"The momentum from bar to bar is an illusion which arises later," he added. "It 
doesn't exist in the moment of composing, normally." 
</P>
<P>
How does inspiration fit into the picture? 
</P>
<P>
"I think of inspiration as something that comes of long, hard work," he said. 
"You create the conditions in which an idea can be born by working hard with 
your imagination. At a certain moment, an idea exists which didn't exist 
before, but it comes from preparing the ground for it." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have tended to describe Stucky's music in terms of color, and he is 
happy with that approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Color -- which is a sloppy metaphor, we don't have a good language for these 
things -- color is important to me," he said. "I'm trying to use elements of 
music other than traditional ones for carrying the main emotional freight or 
dramatic import: Things more important (to me) than traditional elements like 
melody and harmony are other aspects, like loud and soft, high and low, light 
and dark, which you could call coloristic aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to take that argument too far. I'm not sure how much the 
traditional categories can be replaced. But I'm interested in redressing the 
balance away from the hard-core 19th-Century Germanic ideas of what the 
elements of music are: melody, harmony, counterpoint. Other aspects have been 
neglected." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Stucky's recent music has been written for orchestra. "I think that's 
where I'm most at home," he said. "My way of expressing myself depends on a 
fairly large range of color, and the orchestra is the place to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he is happy that perennial predictions for the demise of that 
institution still haven't come true. "It's not dead for me or for some other 
composers," he said. "That situation is less true today than it was 10 to 20 
years ago. There are combinations of factors for that. One is the new system of 
placing composers in residence with orchestras, which created a mechanism so 
that audiences could get the hang of the music. It also ensured that other 
composers have an advocate within the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
"So the number of new pieces programmed is higher than it used to be. Some 
composers see a purpose in writing orchestral music. They have hope of seeing 
it played. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is an anachronism. Technologically, the orchestra is a 19th-Century 
instrument. Most of the instruments have not changed much in at least 100 
years, and sometimes longer than that. It's a machine built to play 
19th-Century music, but some of us, I hope we're not being too retrogressive, 
seem to have things to say that can be said by that same instrument. I hope it 
hangs around a little bit longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Stucky, composer-in-residence for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will 
talk about his music at 7:30 p.m. today at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff 
Drive, in Laguna Beach. Tickets: $6 general admission; $4 students, seniors and

FILM: FRANCES SPENT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON FOR TRYING TO KILL HER STRAYING 
HUSBAND TONY. FUNNY STUFF? 'I LOVE YOU TO DEATH' DIRECTOR LAWRENCE KASDAN 
THINKS SO -- AND THE HAPPY COUPLE AGREE.

<P>
In 1983, Frances Toto, a mother of four living in Allentown, Pa., and married 
to Tony Toto, a local pizza shop owner, decided to have her husband bumped off. 
It was an impulsive decision, Frances said later, but not a capricious one. 
Tony was cheating on her pretty much around the clock, and girls were starting 
to call the house. "A body can only take so much," Frances explained. 
</P>
<P>
After failing in attempts to blow Tony up in his car and ambush him with a 
baseball bat (the bomb didn't go off and he chased the bat-wielding assailant 
away), she hired two amateur hit men, who for $500 put a bullet in Tony's chest 
after Frances first subdued him by spiking his chicken soup with sleeping 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony didn't die. He lay in bed unattended for four days with two bullets in 
him (another of his wife's friends tried to help by shooting him in the head), 
and he still didn't die. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so full of life, you couldn't kill him," said Lawrence Kasdan, the film 
director, who has made an improbable new comedy, "I Love You to Death," based 
on Tony's and Frances' romantic troubles, now patched up since Tony recovered 
from his wounds and Frances was released from prison. The two are living 
together happily once again. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a story about extreme behavior," Kasdan said. "The potential is there, 
I think, for all of us to act in extreme ways. I wake up some mornings with the 
most extreme thoughts, either good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
Comedies about adultery are almost as old as drama, and murder plots based on 
adultery have a long tradition in Hollywood running right up through Kasdan's 
own 1981 film "Body Heat" and on to "Fatal Attraction." But finding humor in an 
offended spouse's actual murder attempt is relatively unexplored territory -- 
and for good reason, some would say, in a society where rising statistics of 
domestic violence are no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
The opening credit that "I Love You to Death" is "based on a true story" 
becomes a startling piece of information as the film unspools its farcical 
scenario of the simple, devoted Rosalie, played with unfamiliar anguish by 
comedienne Tracey Ullman, trying ineptly to arrange the murder of her 
philandering Joey, the movie version of Tony played by a broadly Italianate 
Kevin Kline. 
</P>
<P>
"When they offered it to me," Kasdan said of the screenplay by John Kostmayer 
-- the first script he has directed that he has not also written -- "they told 
me this is a feminist movie: He ends up with a bullet in his head and it makes 
him think. And what he thinks is that he loves his wife. To me what the story 
is about is that their love was so strong, you couldn't kill that. Even having 
tried to murder him, he still loved her. So there's a symmetry there to me. 
He's too full of life to die and so is their relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Jeffrey Lurie, who arranged for the film to be made at Tri-Star 
Pictures, describes the story affectionately as that of "a troubled but heroic 
couple that was trying, each from a different perspective, to save their 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The Totos, who made their first trip to Los Angeles this week to help launch 
the movie, say they are thrilled with it. "Most of the scenes are very real," 
attested Tony, a fit, sprightly man of 44 who seemed to be catching on quickly 
to the Hollywood promotional spirit in his Italian-inflected English. "The 
movie is great. It's fantastic. We love it. And it's a message for everybody: 
Crime doesn't pay, cheating doesn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not entirely true if you consider the money the Totos stand to make 
from their participation in the movie, said to be close to six figures up 
front, with a percentage deal tied to future profits. 
</P>
<P>
Frances, who is 45 and somewhat less ebullient than her husband, said their 
children gave the film high marks as well. "They were laughing at Kevin Kline 
because he's got his (Tony's) mannerisms down fantastic," she said, seated 
beside Tony in the library at the St. James's Club on Sunset Boulevard. "And 
his accent and all." 
</P>
<P>
Tony admitted that the movie is somewhat funnier than the real events that 
brought him close to death and sent Frances to prison for four years after 
pleading guilty to criminal solicitation to commit murder. He remembers, for 
example, waking up in the hospital and feeling scared and worried. "I couldn't 
understand why my wife did this? Was it because I cheated on her or something 
else? At the same time I was praying to God, 'Please let me live.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Allentown later speculated that the chicken soup laced with 
barbiturates may have actually saved Tony's life by lowering his metabolism and 
slowing the bleeding from the gunshot wounds, a detail preserved in the film. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre case of the Totos found its way to Hollywood via a story outline 
prepared by two Allentown police officers familiar with the case, Barry 
Giacobbe and Arthur Beers. Eventually, Ron Moler, the producer of the comedy 
"Bachelor Party," saw the outline and optioned the rights from the policemen 
and the Totos and brought in screenwriter John Kostmayer to put a comic spin on 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
"The comic possibilities were pretty obvious," said Moler, who convinced the 
initially skeptical Totos to sign over the rights to him. "Tony was thinking 
about a book, and I said, 'This is a black comedy.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of pumping bullets into somebody is not generally funny, and in fact 
that's not what made us laugh," said Kostmayer, who also wrote the popular 1983 
Los Angeles play "On the Money." "The humor comes from the contradiction 
between what they (Frances and her co-conspirators) wanted to accomplish and 
what they did accomplish. It's only funny because the consequences were 
relatively happy for the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
Kostmayer acknowledges that some viewers could find the material difficult. "I 
think some people are going to react badly to the irreverence and the 
Rabelaisian humor and the fact that the comedy is offered with the realism 
intact." 
</P>
<P>
The term "black comedy" is sometimes used to describe the comic interpretation 
of otherwise dark or menacing situations, but the difference between "I Love 
You to Death" and recent black comedies like "The War of the Roses" and "Shock 
to the System" is its basis in truth, its proximity to near calamity. 
</P>
<P>
Kasdan said he didn't know this when he first read the script. "I read it and 
loved it," he said. "I thought it was sweet and touching." He also said, "This 
is a story that once would have been on 'Ripley's Believe It or Not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kasdan has made four other movies in the last decade -- "Body Heat," "The Big 
Chill," "Silverado" and "The Accidental Tourist" -- and considers them all to 
have been risky. "Finding the right tone is the challenge of a thing like this. 
Although it's a challenge finding the right tone with any movie. To what extent 
can you push the envelope in either direction and still have the piece be 
unified, whether you're doing a Western or a comedy or a drama. I think that's 
true in a lot of what I've done. I thought 'Accidental Tourist' was very funny 
but very sad too. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the comedies that come out of Hollywood aren't funny. We spent two 
weeks in rehearsal to talk about what kind of movie we were making, what kind 
of joke is acceptable. There are things that are different from the real story, 
but the most outrageous stuff in the movie all happened." 
</P>
<P>
The drug-dazed hit men, played by William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, apparently 
were just as feeble-minded as they look on the screen. In a miscalculation that 
spared Tony's life, the real would-be killers recited the Pledge of Allegiance 
to each other at his bedside in an effort to remember on which side of the 
chest the heart is located. (The gunmen still got it wrong and shot him in the 
right side, missing his heart by an inch.) 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, everybody would like to be as free as Joey," said Kasdan. "You may 
not applaud his promiscuity, but what is appealing about him is that he has 
this enormous appetite for life and sort of goes at it without much conscience, 
you know? He enjoys every minute of his day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not an admirable character necessarily, but he's human. In less extreme 
forms we all do this every day. I think this is what all the movies I've made 
have been about, which is this battle going on between your desires and your 
ideals. That's what 'Body Heat' is about. The guy knows what's right. But what 
he wants is very strong and it overcomes what he knows is right. That's what 
'The Big Chill' is about. That's what life is about to me, trying to reconcile 
what you know to be the correct behavior with what you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was wrong," Tony admitted at the St. James's Club about his 
behavior. "Because of what it was doing to my family. But I just blank 
everything out and just go on and kept doing what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Frances, to judge from the movie, never thought to confront Tony about his 
infidelity before leaping to her radical solution. Did she ever discuss it with 
him? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I would try to," she said before being interrupted by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to a little bit," he interjected, "but I just said, 'Eh, don't 
bother,' and I make up some excuse and she just gave up." 
</P>
<P>
In the film, she learns of his infidelity when she spots him with another 
woman, but in truth she never actually saw him with any of his girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I never got caught," Tony said, with what sounded like pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so many people call me and tell," Frances continued, "I think if more 
people had minded their own business, we might have been better off." 
</P>
<P>
But Tony immediately saw the flaw in this. "Well, maybe not. Because I would 
have kept going and kept going and. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
No telling what Frances might have done eventually.

For a 47-year-old artist of unheroic pretensions, William Wegman's career can 
hardly be said to be languishing. Two concurrent exhibitions of his recent work 
opened recently in Los Angeles (paintings at James Corcoran and large Polaroids 
at Linda Cathcart). These will be followed this month by two similar 
exhibitions in New York. And those will be followed in May by a retrospective 
exhibition that opens at the Kunst Museum in Lucerene and will travel from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But even this Swiss exhibition, entitled "William Wegman: Paintings, Drawings, 
Photographs, Videotapes," fails to encompass the encyclopedic scope of Wegman's 
recent endeavors. A little over a year ago, for instance, he accomplished the 
well-nigh impossible task of completing a genuinely funny, aesthetically 
serious, politically relevant work of public sculpture for the Stuart 
Collection in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On a beautiful promontory adjacent to the UCSD campus, Wegman constructed a 
"scenic overlook," complete with telescope, water fountain and a large bronze 
drawing of the view. This "overlook," however, faces away from the Pacific and 
presents us with a tripartite vision of what we would gladly overlook: the 
dread "valley of the condos," spreading east, which we may contemplate as a 
landscape vista, a drawing in institutional bronze, or in a "video" close-up 
through the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even from this exalted and ironic promontory, at this enviable moment in 
his career, there has to be something bittersweet for William Wegman about the 
schizophrenic nature of his impact on our culture. He could claim, for 
instance, with some justification, to be spiritual father to some of America's 
"most serious new art." And he could claim, as well, with equal justification, 
to be the spiritual father of "America's Funniest Home Videos." 
</P>
<P>
But I doubt that he would claim either. It would be less a testament to his 
influence than an emblem of his isolation, since both the "Funniest Home 
Videos" and the "most serious new art" are, for the most part, creatures of a 
cultural mind-set that is antithetical to Wegman's. 
</P>
<P>
This mind-set first came to prominence in the late '50s, then blossomed again 
in the late '80s. It regards image-making as an essentially polarized activity. 
In the '50s you either made "serious" abstraction or you "sold out" to Madison 
Avenue. These days you either make hermetic Euro-crit for the galleries or gaga 
lumpen-pop for the tube. Between these polar extremes, Wegman continues to 
cultivate an equatorial territory he has less staked out for himself than 
inherited by default. 
</P>
<P>
The perimeters of this domain are deftly delineated in a 1984 drawing that 
portrays two vaguely Matissean heads, a woman and a man, frowning earnestly at 
one another. The heads are labeled "Wife" and "Husband," and beneath them is 
the caption: "2 philosophers worrying about everyday problems." These people 
live in "the Wegman zone" -- where art, philosophy, and everyday relationships 
interpenetrate and impinge upon one another, tantalizing us with the 
possibility of communication, guaranteeing its improbability. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something more obvious here than has otherwise been supposed," Wegman 
seems to say, gazing at this impure world. And his comedy arises from its 
improbable revelation. In Wegman's first video with the late Weimaraner, Man 
Ray, we are introduced to the noble pooch as he noisily chews on what he 
assumes to be bone, and we know to be a condenser microphone. The scene is at 
once funny and sad because that symbolic "bone of contention" does, in fact, 
establish a skewed, improbable community between man and beast. The distance 
between "medium and message" is collapsed as Man Ray "eats the mike." The 
tragedy of technological distance is miraculously transformed into the divine 
comedy of its violation. 
</P>
<P>
Wegman loves these tiny victories, those moments when the manipulative 
wickedness of what technology and history teach us is redeemed by the benign 
stupidity of things we actually learn. For his new paintings, he has gleaned 
hundreds of historical, scientific, technological and architectural images from 
the encyclopedias he pored over as a child. But he has "detoxified" them, 
defused all of their virulent modernist subtexts about "progress," "evolution" 
and "style" and reconstituted them into a series of extravagant capriccios. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those imaginary tableaux of antique architecture that 18th-Century 
Englishmen used to send home like post cards from Italy, these new paintings 
tease the iconography of history and technology from amid veils of falling 
color. They hilariously translate the rhetoric of "prograss" into haunting, 
subaqueous visions of Oriental timelessness. And in their innocent drollery 
they are indeed like post cards, not from Italy, but from Wegman's "prehistoric 
childhood." 
</P>
<P>
But for all the high comedy Wegman derives from such subversions and lapses of 
communication -- his work does, nearly always, communicate. It is about 
communication, however imperfect, and the laughter it calls forth is the mark 
of its accessibility. It's not surprising then that Wegman responds like a 
tuning fork to point where it all goes phony. Usually, this point is marked by 
a particularly infelicitous effort at "double-encoding" (putting a message into 
a code that communicates it; then, putting that code into a code that obscures 
it, or restricts its recipients.) 
</P>
<P>
The kind of double encoding that concerns Wegman most urgently involves 
re-encoding images of the phenomenal world with human cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
Wegman's most hilarious send-ups of this proclivity are his color Polaroids of 
Man and Fay Ray. Each of these pictures fails pitifully in an attempt to 
"signify" the already "significant" image of the dog and, in its failure, 
allows both codes to be read -- thus making a third message available. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair, of course, (not to mention stupid) to credit the 
Weimaraners with having "influenced" Wegman's art. But the fact remains that 
the dogs have played a more active role in Wegman's production than Picasso's 
mistresses did in his. And, certainly, by choosing to collaborate with a 
creature from another genetic universe. Wegman created one of the great comedy 
teams of the late 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of Abbott and Costello, and the Smothers Brothers, Wegman and 
Ray exploit the relationship between a manipulative sadist and a passive 
masochist. The humor arises from the fact that the passive partner, no matter 
what indignities the manipulator inflicts upon him, remains benign (if often 
confused) and incapable of being manipulated in a satisfying manner. The 
relationship is continually redeemed by his absolute refusal to acknowledge 
darker aspects of his sidekick's personality. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott and Costello, of course, fight the never-ending battle between endomorph 
and ectomorph; Tom and Dick Smothers exploit their already extant sibling 
rivalry. But that between Wegman and Ray is the more profound one between 
species. Ultimately, it pits the society and intimacy that Wegman and Ray share 
against the culture that they do not. The running joke has to do with Wegman's 
relentless, futile attempts to anthropomorphize the dog by re-encoding his 
image. 
</P>
<P>
He tricks the dog up with all manner of cultural iconography and disguise, 
detains him in any number of "formal contexts" and, in every case, fails 
miserably to possess him. Man Ray remains firm in his adamantine, loving 
dogginess through it all. To err is human, the subtext goes, to forgive canine. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite of all these hilariously unsuccessful efforts is "Bad Dog," a large 
Polaroid in which Man Ray, decked out in devil drag, is placed theatrically 
behind a roaring fire. Unfortunately, Man Ray gazes through the fire with a 
look of such benign doggy distress as to render the accouterments of 
metaphysical evil in which he has been disguised profoundly ludicrous. Nature 
and culture don't mix in these works, and, however fortunate or tragic one 
might take this to be, one's final memory of "Bad Dog" is not that funny at 
all. It is a vision of two creatures gazing longingly at one another, through a 
maze of technological and linguistic barricades, across a stormy, genetic 
Bosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, then, you have to admire the tenacity with which Wegman has held his 
position at the unstable intersection of culture and society. On the one hand, 
he has exploited their discontinuity to give us a comic vision of their 
reconciliation. On the other, he has provided us with a chilling demonstration 
of the ways that culture endeavors, in the absence of social values, devolve 
into manipulative pet tricks. It is not a particularly fashionable task, nor a 
very funny one, but it is one worth doing.
