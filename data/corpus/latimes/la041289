DESPITE SMITH'S 32 POINTS, CLIPPERS LOSE

PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Smith scored 32 points and backup center Ken Bannister, starting in 
place of ailing Benoit Benjamin, had 21, but the Clippers still lost to the 
Portland Trail Blazers, 126-102, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin suffered an allergy reaction and did not play. 
</P>
<P>
For Portland, Clyde Drexler scored 24 points and Terry Porter had his second 
triple-double of the season as the Clippers fell to 18-58. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler scored 10 points in the second quarter, helping the Trail Blazers build 
a 66-42 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Porter finished the game with 10 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds for 
Portland, which improved its lead over the Dallas Mavericks to three games with 
six to play in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 points were a career high for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers built a 30-22 lead after one quarter, then outscored the 
Clippers, 16-8, in the first six minutes of the second period. Porter and 
Kersey had consecutive layups to give Portland a 46-30 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Portland took its largest lead, 70-44, early in the third quarter before the 
Clippers used a 28-16 spurt to close the gap to 86-72. But that was close as 
the Clippers could get in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Portland got balanced scoring. Kevin Duckworth had 21 points, Jerome Kersey 18 
and the bench 45. Clipper reserves had 27. 
</P>
<P>
For Porter, it was his sixth career triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
"We really tried to concentrate and get off to a good start, which we did," he 
said. "We weren't going to let them get back into it like we did before." 
</P>
<P>
Porter was referring to a 133-123 loss to the Clippers at the Sports Arena last 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Clippers, 50-34, and blocked 11 shots, 
including three by Sam Bowie, who missed the previous nine games with a 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny Young and Sam Bowie played well off the bench," Portland Coach Rick 
Adelman said. "I was especially pleased to see Sam move as well as he did after 
the long layoff. Jerry Sichting was also moving well after such a long layoff 
and I want to give him some time before the playoffs."

CAVALIERS STAY IN DIVISION RACE BY EDGING 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons have not yet wrapped up the Central Division title or 
secured the best overall record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Cavaliers, after a 92-90 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers 
Tuesday night at Richfield, Ohio, are hanging on in the division race, but only 
barely. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nance, after resting his aching legs for a week, came back strong to 
score 20 points and make the key defensive play in the stretch to lead 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had wasted a 13-point, third-quarter lead and the teams were 
tied, 88-88, with two minutes remaining. Nance deflected a Philadelphia pass to 
Ron Harper, who drove to the basket for the layup that put Cleveland in front 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
With six games remaining, the Cavaliers trail the Pistons by 2 1/2 games. 
However, two of the Cavaliers' remaining games are against the Pistons. The 
first is tonight at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers are hoping to avoid playing the Pistons in the opening round of the 
playoffs. If they had pulled this one out, they would just about have achieved 
that goal. If the 76ers finish ahead of Boston and get the seventh playoff 
spot, they won't play the division winner. Now, the 76ers are just 2 1/2 games 
ahead of the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Celtics, 9-28 on the road, play four of their last seven away from 
home, while the 76ers play four of their six at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers won because they kept the ball away from Charles Barkley, who was 
magnificent. In 46 minutes, he scored 23 points, had 15 rebounds, stole the 
ball twice and had five assists. He made 11 shots, but was able to get only 15 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a great defensive job on me," Barkley said. "They were double-teaming 
me, and I didn't get the shots down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 125, New Jersey 93 -- The Bucks are bidding for fourth place in the 
East, which would give them the home-court edge in the opening best-of-five 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
Two spurts broke the game open at Milwaukee. The Bucks went on a 20-9 run in 
the last five minutes of the first half, then opened the third quarter with a 
19-9 run. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, who battled the Celtics all the way Monday night only to lose in the 
closing seconds, wore out after about 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks (47-28) must finish ahead of Atlanta (47-29) and Chicago (45-30) to 
finish fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 108, Indiana 99 -- Mike Woodson, who had started all but one game this 
season before this one at Houston, came off the bench to sink seven consecutive 
shots in the first quarter and put the Rockets in command early. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Chaney had felt that Woodson's legs were getting tired, so he gave 
him two days off, then brought him in off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Houston forward Buck Johnson held Indiana star Chuck Person to just 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 114, Miami 98 -- It's hard to get up for a team as weak as Miami, 
and the Warriors struggled a bit at Oakland, making 20 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But Chris Mullin and Terry Teagle scored enough to win the sloppily played 
game. Mullin made eight of 15 shots and wound up with 25 points. Teagle came 
off the bench to score 24 points. DAN HAFNER

BRUINS ELIMINATE SABRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Buffalo Sabres trounced the Boston Bruins, 6-0, at Boston in the first 
game of their playoff series, it looked as if a sweep was in the making. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who were 0-5-3 against the Sabres during the regular season, looked 
pitiful in the playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
But Boston regrouped behind Cam Neely as the resurgent Bruins won four in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Boston, Randy Burridge scored a short-handed goal in the 
second period, but it was Neely who applied the clincher in a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Neely's fifth goal, with 6:56 remaining in the second period, gave the Bruins a 
3-0 lead. With Andy Moog playing his third consecutive solid game in the nets, 
it was all over. Twice earlier in the series, Neely scored the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"My question to the players (after the opener) was, if it's important to you, 
you have to play like you want it," Coach Terry O'Reilly said. "They did." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who finished second in the Adams Division, will meet the Montreal 
Canadiens, the division winner, in the next best-of-seven series. It will not 
begin until Monday. Last year the Bruins knocked out the Canadiens in the 
second round and made it to the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres began to lose some of their offensive thrust when Christian Ruttu 
suffered a shoulder injury in the second period of Game 2 and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We shut down their offense pretty well in the last three games," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, Washington 5 -- In helping his Flyers take a 3-2 lead in the 
series, Ron Hextall made history when he became the first goaltender to score a 
goal in Stanley Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Two late goals by Pelle Eklund had given the Flyers a 7-5 lead at Landover, Md. 
But the desperate Capitals were working on a power play and pulled goalie Pete 
Peeters. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall stopped the puck behind the net, skated to the goal line and fired the 
puck at the empty net. Nobody touched it and into the net it went. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, who has made a career of handling the puck well up the ice, was the 
first goalie in NHL regular season to score a goal, too. He did it, in similar 
fashion against Boston, Dec. 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth game will be played at Philadelphia Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Minnesota 1 -- The Blues also moved into the second round of 
Stanley Cup competition by whipping the North Stars, four games to one. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Zezel made this one at St. Louis the easiest win of all. He scored three 
goals and had two assists. Two of the goals and an assist came in a four-goal 
outburst in the second period. He completed the hat trick in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues won the first two games at home in overtime, then scored a 5-3 
victory at Minnesota before losing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, Vancouver 0 -- Goaltender Mike Vernon decided to take matters into 
his own hands as this series returned to Calgary. On home ice, he was flawless, 
stopping 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in this series, the Flames resembled the team that posted 
the best record in the league during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
They outplayed the Canucks from the start to take a 3-2 series lead. They can 
clinch it with a win at Vancouver Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Nieuwendyk, with his third playoff goal, gave Vernon all the help he really 
needed before the game was six minutes old. But the Flames never took the 
pressure off. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen, Mark Hunter and Hakan Loob, who assisted on the first goal, added 
goals and kept making it a little easier for Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Chicago 4 -- Petr Klima and John Chabot scored 59 seconds apart in 
the third period at Detroit to keep the Red Wings' playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who led, 4-3, before Klima scored at 7:23, lead the series, 
3-2, and can wrap it up Thursday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings are trying to become only the sixth team in Stanley Cup history 
to win a series after trailing, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings beat goaltender Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against them 
after the Blackhawks acquired him from Winnipeg late in the season. DAN HAFNER

NEWSMAKERS: HE'S AT OUTS WITH INNER CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Kenneth Galbraith, a lifelong Democrat, was an unlikely recipient of an 
embossed invitation to join the "exclusive" Senatorial Inner Circle, a GOP 
group whose annual dues go toward getting Republicans elected to the Senate. 
Even so, Galbraith quickly responded with an acceptance and then went on to 
give Vice President Dan Quayle a lecture on the ethics of offering dues-payers 
access to privileged "closed-door" briefings. "Thus far we've not received his 
check for $1,000, so his acceptance sounds a little hollow," Quayle's press 
secretary, David Beckwith, said. In fact, when about a third of the Inner 
Circle's 6,000 members were in Washington for various briefings and a cocktail 
party at the vice president's residence, Galbraith, who supported Massachusetts 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' 1988 presidential bid, was absent. Still, the group 
does not regret its invitation to the economist. "We don't really consider his 
invitation a mistake in that a number of very prominent Republicans were once 
Democrats," said Wendy DeMocker, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party group. 
"Look at Ronald Reagan." 
</P>

 -- Johns Hopkins University trustees have renamed the international studies 
school The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. Dean George 
R. Packard said the vote was not sought by Nitze, a co-founder of the school in 
1943. The school, located in Washington, is a graduate school of international 
affairs affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, conceived 
by Nitze in 1957. Nitze, 81, headed arms negotiating teams from 1981 to 1984 
and for five years was an arms negotiations adviser to former Secretary of 
State George P. Shultz.

 -- Officials in Baton Rouge, La., are looking for someone to make rhyme or 
reason out of events in the state. And they have high standards. "We are 
looking for someone like a (Carl) Sandburg, a T.S. Eliot or a Robert Frost" to 
be poet laureate, Ray Beasley of the Department of Culture, Recreation and 
Tourism said. The state Arts Council is looking for a poet to serve as the 
state's chief balladeer, extolling the virtues of Louisiana and the state's 
"literary excellence and understanding of the literary arts," Beasley said. The 
position, created in 1942, has been empty since Jean M. Boese of Alexandria 
left office last year. Gov. Buddy Roemer will name the poet after receiving 
recommendations from the arts panel. SHIRLEY MARLOW

MATILDA CLOUGH, WHO AMUSED THE STARS FOR FLO ZIEGFELD, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florenz Ziegfeld did two things for Matilda Clough when she first began working 
in his office at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
When introduced to her, he immediately renamed her Goldie, beseeching nobody in 
particular: "God Almighty. Who would name a kid Matilda?" 
</P>
<P>
Thus edited, he hired her as his private secretary. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1923 and she was to remain with the flamboyant entertainment 
entrepreneur until his death nine years later. 
</P>
<P>
For Mrs. Clough, a widow who died April 3 in Santa Monica Hospital at the age 
of 87, the decade of the 1920s was the most enchanting of her life. 
</P>
<P>
For $35 a week ("big money" in those days, she recalled in a 1976 Times 
interview), she chatted with Fanny Brice, Marion Davies, Eddie Cantor, W. C. 
Fields, Will Rogers, Fred and Adela Astaire, Helen Morgan and all the rest of 
the Follies stars who went in and out of Flo Ziegfeld's office each day. 
</P>
<P>
When not on the phone or typewriter, she helped arrange the burgeoning 
collection of carved and molded elephants he kept in his office ("Mr. Ziegfeld 
thought elephants were lucky") and sorted through vases of flowers, plucking 
out the red ones ("Mr. Ziegfeld didn't like red and wouldn't have anything red 
around"). 
</P>
<P>
Part of her job was to keep half the entertainment world amused each day as 
they waited for Ziegfeld to appear in his office in the New Amsterdam Theater 
on West 42nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Customarily, Mrs. Clough remembered, he wouldn't arrive "until 4 or 5 in the 
afternoon. He stayed in bed and called on the phone and dictated letters. He 
would say the same things over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
After Ziegfeld's death, Mrs. Clough became a theater manager in Times Square 
and then moved to Los Angeles with her second husband. Here she became an 
assistant to the president of Radio Recorders, a Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1976, she was honored by the Southern California Floral Assn. as 
"Secretennial Rose Queen," in honor of the organization's bicentennial 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Her apartment was heaped with flowers in all manner of array. 
</P>
<P>
There even were red ones.

THE CHANGING SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the construction of Friant Dam in 1946, the San Joaquin River has 
been little more than a ditch for salt-laden irrigation water draining from 
farms along the east side of the San Joaquin Valley. Virtually the entire 
natural flow of the San Joaquin, which rises just west of the Mammoth Lakes 
area in the central Sierra, has been diverted for farm use during the 
irrigation season. The San Joaquin's salmon run has been decimated, and the 
polluted water that does reach the river's historic outlet of the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta contributes to the severe water-quality problems 
in the delta. 
</P>
<P>
Blind to such facts, the U.S. Department of the Interior maintains there is no 
need to conduct a formal environmental study into the effects of renewing 
irrigation water contracts for San Joaquin waters for another 40 years. The 
department's bureau of reclamation has argued that since the contract terms are 
essentially unchanged from those of four decades ago, there is no legal basis 
for triggering the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) into play. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts may be essentially unchanged, but the river certainly is not. The 
effects of the irrigation project are dramatic and far-reaching. They are 
far-reaching enough for the Environmental Protection Agency to call for an 
environmental impact study under NEPA. With the two federal agencies at odds, 
the President's Council on Environmental Quality has stepped into the issue. 
The council will hold hearings in Washington and Fresno before settling the 
dispute. It should not be difficult for the council to decide that a formal 
environmental impact study is in order. 
</P>
<P>
The instant controversy involves the renewal, approved Tuesday by Secretary of 
Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., of an irrigation water contract between the bureau 
of reclamation and the 500-farm Orange Cove Irrigation District in Fresno and 
Tulare counties. The decision is expected to be extended to 28 similar water 
contracts coming up for renewal in the Friant Unit of the federal Central 
Valley Project. In all, about 1.5 million acre-feet of water are involved 
annually, which is nearly twice as much water used in the entire city of Los 
Angeles each year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Cove case already has been argued in the courts, with a coalition of 
conservation groups suing to block contract renewal without an environmental 
impact statement. A federal judge permitted the bureau to proceed with the 
contracts with the understanding that any pact would be made subject to the 
final decision of the court. 
</P>
<P>
In offering renewal of the contract, Lujan directed the bureau of reclamation 
to conduct an "environmental assessment" and to explore opportunities for 
recovery programs in the San Joaquin River basin. Such an assessment, however, 
would not provide for the extensive public comment required by the more 
rigorous environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
During a court hearing, Richard Moss of the Friant Water Users Authority, 
argued that the challenge to the contract renewal poses a threat to 
California's farm economy and the rural way of life enjoyed by farmers 
receiving heavily subsidized federal irrigation water. 
</P>
<P>
But an environmental impact study by itself would pose no such threat, nor 
would it necessarily result in the farmers getting less water. The process is 
designed to identify environmental impacts of a proposed federal project and to 
propose mitigating actions that would offset such damage. One example cited by 
state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who is pushing for an environmental 
study, is that the bureau might require farmers to adopt water conservation 
techniques. The water saved could then be used to help restore fisheries or 
riparian wildlife and waterfowl habitat on the San Joaquin. 
</P>
<P>
The rural life and economy of the San Joaquin Valley cannot -- and will not -- 
be wiped out in an attempt to rectify half a century of environmental neglect. 
But the federal government cannot renew these contracts without an assessment 
of mitigation measures that could restore some vitality to an important 
California river.

There was once a time when the United States had a fair and just legal system 
based on presumption of innocence and limits on the coercive power of 
prosecutors. Those were the days before the racketeering statute known as RICO, 
the ambitions of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, the government's blackmail of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the frame-up of its "junk bond" king, Mike 
Milken. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ralph Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co., Milken's 
trial is a political trial, complete with the media equivalent of a KGB 
pre-trial beating and torture. Milken intends to defend himself in court, but 
if he were to ask the Soviet Union for political asylum, no one could blame 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, judged by his market value, is the most productive human in history. In 
1987 he was paid $550 million in salary and bonuses -- enough to spark the envy 
of billionaires David Rockefeller, the epitome of old, established wealth, and 
Donald J. Trump, the epitome of new money. Rockefeller thought Milken's pay was 
evidence of an unbalanced financial system. Trump said, "You can be happy on a 
lot less money." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who arouses the envy of billionaires hasn't a chance with ordinary 
people. That makes him an easy mark for politically ambitious prosecutors such 
as Giuliani, who is expected to run for mayor of New York. Giuliani, playing on 
the proclivities of ordinary people to attribute such success to Milken's greed 
and fraud, decided to ruin him as a steppingstone to his own ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's other enemies include the entrenched managements of poorly run 
companies, old-line Wall Street firms displaced by Drexel and Milken's genius, 
and young lawyers and journalists whose education consists of being 
indoctrinated to equate wealth with crime. The lawyers at the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice sincerely believe that 
there is no honest way to make large sums of money and that a large income is 
proof of "white collar" crime. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's great crime is that he provided stockholders with a way to get rid of 
managers who run corporations for their own benefit. He developed a bond market 
to finance takeovers, thus putting corporate assets in the hands of more 
efficient management and forcing others to clean up their acts. Milken's 
activities added billions of dollars to stock values, enriching shareholders, 
and that explains his high pay. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in an unprecedented action in U.S. legal history, his firm Drexel was 
blackmailed with the approval of the attorney general. To avoid being 
prosecuted as a racketeer and having all its assets seized prior to trial or 
conviction, Drexel had to admit (probably falsely) that it was guilty of 
criminal actions, pay the government $650 million and fire Milken and withhold 
from him his pay for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Since it has no real case against Drexel or Milken, the government's tactics 
have been to force them into a plea bargain and admission of guilt in order to 
settle the case without trial. From the beginning, the U.S. attorney and the 
SEC took every possible step to ruin the reputations of their victims with two 
years of "leaks" and innuendoes prior to filing charges. Once charges were 
filed, the government tried to keep the basis of the charges as secret as 
possible from the indicted victim. 
</P>
<P>
In a civilized land, such extraordinary breaches of legal ethics would bring 
down the government.

SOVIET ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People in the United States can draw inspiration from the recent Soviet 
elections. Suppose in the voting booth we could express our dissatisfaction 
with a slate of candidates by casting a negative vote for all of them. I bet 
there would be greatly revitalized interest in voting among the vast numbers of 
people in our electorate who don't vote out of a conviction that the Democratic 
and Republican candidates they must choose between are as alike as two 
competing brands of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
The disaffected in our electorate, like the citizens of the Soviet Union, would 
overwhelm the polls to cast decisive votes against entire slates of candidates. 
And if no one could gain a majority mandate to govern, the election results 
would show very powerfully that the United States also needs its own vigorous 
program of glasnost and perestroika.

LOCKYER'S BILL ON WAITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockyer writes, and acts, on the frustrations of doing business in today's 
society. As a state senator, he has introduced a bill giving the consumer power 
to penalize businesses which do not keep their appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Hurray for him. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, some amendments I'd like to suggest. Certainly deserving of 
heavy fines are the people who promise to "get back to you," and are never 
heard from again. Also those who leave the phone to determine a fact and leave 
you fuming for five minutes or so before you get notified by the buzz that your 
"conservation" is over (this tends to happen on toll calls). Perhaps an even 
higher fine for those who do finally return to the phone with patently false 
information that they could not possibly have retrieved from any source better 
than the office coffee machine. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, Sen. Lockyer; may you achieve success before you get cut off.

LOCKYER'S BILL ON WAITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Bill Lockyer is right on target with his bill that would require 
businesses to specify a two-hour "window" during which they will appear at a 
home ("At Last, Revenge on Those Who Make Us Sit and Wait," Op-Ed Page, March 
23). I would suggest he go a step further and require all public utilities to 
provide turn-on service on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
How many of us have had to spend a day off work waiting for the gas or 
electricity to be turned on? 
</P>
<P>
If the utilities were truly public-service oriented, they wouldn't need a law 
to force them to provide this service. They would do it because it's reasonable 
and good business!

SOVIET ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent election of the Soviet Congress of Deputies has generated some of 
the most starry-eyed Western political commentary since the portrayal of Yuri 
Andropov as a jazz-loving closet liberal. Although the election does represent 
a departure from the previous status quo, we should not allow it to distract us 
from the important continuities in the Soviet political situation. The election 
did not alter the fundamental fact that Soviet political events reflect 
primarily the interests and desires of the ruling elite. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Communist Party candidates' 90-plus percent majorities were taken 
as a mockery of democracy. Boris Yeltsin's 89% seems to have fallen a point 
short of the level necessary to raise eyebrows. Although the size of Yeltsin's 
majority does not necessarily imply fraud or manipulation of the electoral 
process, we should think twice before we take his election as evidence of an 
emerging democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Yeltsin scenario, from fall to resurrection, may well have been 
orchestrated to maximize the political benefit to Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin's 
ostracism for being "more Gorbachevian than Gorbachev" was never very 
convincing. Furthermore, the political latitude given to the Yeltsin campaign 
-- including the organization of demonstrations -- represents a degree of 
tolerance tantamount to an endorsement in the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
The re-emergence of Yeltsin as the figurehead of a leftist movement offers 
substantial political benefits to Gorbachev. Playing the leftist "opposition" 
against the right will allow him to assume the role of the indispensable 
moderate who can mediate between the otherwise irreconcilable extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, with Gorbachev's passive blessing, has become the first Soviet leader 
with a primarily popular, as opposed to a Communist Party, base of support. The 
cultivation of a popular movement in a nation without a tradition of free 
political expression represents a gamble of sorts. Such a movement could well 
spin out of control, particularly in sensitive areas such as ethnic minority 
affairs. The willingness to accept these risks probably reflects the depth of 
Gorbachev's need to recruit support in the struggle against the conservative 
entrenched bureaucracy. He knows that the genie of popular political expression 
will be difficult to control once let out of the bottle; it would be even more 
difficult for a Brezhnev-style conservative opposition to suppress. 
</P>
<P>
When viewed in the contest of current political conditions, the recent Soviet 
elections cannot be seen as a step towards popular democracy. They can be 
viewed more accurately as a release of popular political pressure calculated to 
strengthen the hand of the reformist leadership. The true test of the limits of 
Soviet electoral politics will be the extent to which glasnost is extended to 
potentially popular opponents of Gorbachev's policies of perestroika.

BINDING UP HAITI'S WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things seem finally to have calmed down in Haiti after a week of attempted 
coups led to exchanges of gunfire between rival factions of that nation's 
military. But the tensions that led to the most recent violence remain. 
</P>
<P>
Since the corrupt Duvalier family dictatorship was overthrown three years ago, 
Haiti's 7,000-man army has become the country's only powerful institution. 
While the current leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, says he is trying to lay the 
groundwork for a transition to democratic, civilian government, there are still 
factions in the military that don't want to give up the power and wealth they 
accumulated under the Duvaliers. Much of the political turmoil in Haiti since 
the departure of Francois (Baby Doc) Duvalier has resulted from the infighting 
among these military factions. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the first of two coup attempts last week was launched by a trio 
of colonels who were removed from their commands by Avril because they were 
suspected of drug smuggling. Avril loyalists defeated that faction. But within 
hours another, less well-organized group of soldiers took it upon themselves to 
try to oust the reformist general. The standoff that resulted between the 
second group of rebels and Avril's Presidential Guard lasted several days and 
cost many lives. It also ended with Avril still in control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
But no one can say how long this latest period of peace will last. Avril, 
however good his intentions, is trying to control an inherently unstable 
situation. His nation is bankrupt and so desperately poor that only substantial 
aid from abroad can improve the situation. And the governments that could 
provide that aid, particularly the United States and France, refuse to send it 
until they see evidence that Haiti is further along the road to democracy than 
it is now. That tough stance is necessary given the Haitian military's 
reputation for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department officials are for the time being funneling what 
humanitarian aid they can to Haiti through international relief agencies like 
the Red Cross. But that only helps bind up the wounds left by the latest 
crisis. Long-term solutions to Haiti's turmoil will be found only when Haitians 
elect their own leaders rather than having them emerge from periodic infighting 
among the nation's elite and its military caste.

JACK SMITH: NOBODY GOES 'SO I SAYS TO HIM' ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My contention that the cuckoo bird goes "cuckoo," rather than says "cuckoo," is 
confirmed by several obviously literate readers. 
</P>
<P>
You may remember that in writing erroneously about the predacious habits of the 
cuckoo bird, I pointed out what I took to be a simple, observable fact -- that 
the cuckoo bird goes "cuckoo." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth A. Ross, a senior biology student at UCLA, not only corrected my 
errors about the bird's predations (which are bad enough, in any case), but 
advised me that the cuckoo is a cuckoo, not a cuckoo bird, and questioned my 
use of the verb goes, asking if it had somehow replaced says. 
</P>
<P>
Further, in response to my revelation that a big, glossy, black bird that goes 
caw is a crow, she observed that it might well be a raven, thus leaving me 
pinioned on three counts. 
</P>
<P>
I replied that a cuckoo is indeed a bird; that goes is more appropriate than 
says for the sounds made by a bird (or any animal), and that she evidently was 
not aware that among the young, goes has indeed replaced says as a verb. 
</P>
<P>
First, John Degatina comes to my defense: "Show me one half-way intelligent 
person who doesn't know that ravens say 'Nevermore.' Do you think our great E. 
A. Poe would write a haunting, elegiac poem about a bird that says 'caw?' No 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Juliana T. Gensley of Calabasas says, "Jack, you were right! Crows say caw. 
Ravens say wac, pronounced walk." Dr. Gensley also notes several other obvious 
differences between the birds. For one thing, she says, "Ravens seem to have a 
sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, David J. Flood of Thousand Oaks also says of ravens, "I believe that 
they have a sense of humor." He recalls that last summer he saw a raven flying 
below a red-tailed hawk, trying to emulate the hawk's "easy gliding flight. I 
could almost hear the raven saying to the hawk, 'See, big guy, even a raven can 
do those lazy circles in the sky.' " 
</P>
<P>
Flood disagrees with my defense of the verb goes, however. "We look to 
columnists of your ilk (or is it stature?) to keep the language pure and devoid 
of youthful aberrations." He was right the first time. I have ilk, not stature. 
</P>
<P>
Flood also says that ravens have brains "as large as dogs," which I rather 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently by coincidence, Kenneth Green, counselor at Cal Poly Pomona, notes 
what he calls "a linguistic phenomenon most notable among high school and 
college-age young people -- I refer to the frequent use of the verb to go 
instead of the verbs to say and to think. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, a student might say, 'So when he told me he had to break our 
date, I go, "Look, I'm getting tired of being treated like this." He goes, "I 
can't help it." I go, "This is the last time he is ever going to do this to 
me." ' " 
</P>
<P>
Green says he is never sure whether the student means says or thinks when he 
says goes. 
</P>
<P>
We have no more than established the usage, however, than Bob Brigham of 
Manhattan Beach reports that "goes is now archaic in teen-speak." Hard to keep 
up with the in-speak of the young. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Norman Felton of Malibu notes that what started all this, Nancy 
White's questioning of a theory that the earth is an eggshell, with a chick 
inside, and that someday the mother bird will come to break it out, is derived 
from a story by Nelson Bond, in which astronomers spy a gigantic bird zooming 
in toward the Earth. He said it was often told by Nelson Olmsted on NBC's 
"Story for Tonight" in the 1940s, which Felton produced. 
</P>
<P>
(Ms. White made it clear that she had heard the story on radio. She did not 
pretend to have invented the theory herself.) 
</P>
<P>
Ms. White, by the way, shows her own expertise on birds by quoting from a 
copyrighted book of limericks about animals that she is writing and 
illustrating: 
</P>
<P>
 The owl from his perch in the trees, 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't bother to prey on his knees; 
</P>
<P>
 Preferring instead 
</P>
<P>
 To rotate his head 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred and sixty degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 And the literate owl goes "To whit, to whom!"

VITAMIN C HINDERS BUILDUP OF DEPOSITS IN ARTERIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is it true that taking Vitamin C can help prevent heart attacks? A 
nurse tells me that this is the case. I've heard that Vitamin C is good for 
colds, but I've never heard that it can keep a person from having a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your friend may have deen referring to a study that showed that eating 
foods high in Vitamin C may increase the amount of high-density lipoproteins 
(HDL) cholesterol (the good cholesterol) in the blood. HDL cholesterol has been 
found to prevent the buildup of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the 
arteries, and therefore decreases the possibility that the arteries will become 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Whenever I go shopping, I become confused by the number of different 
products to choose from, all of them claiming that they are the best. With 
cereals, for example, there seems to be a hundred different kinds on the 
shelves. And when I shop for salmon, there's the red and the pink variety. I 
usually go by which is cheaper, but is one better than the other? 
</P>
<P>
A: From a nutritional standpoint, there isn't a great deal of difference 
between red and pink salmon. They both contain about the same number of 
calories and they both contain about the same amount of calcium and other 
minerals and vitamins. However, the red salmon does have a little more of the 
fish oil that may be medically important. 
</P>
<P>
Pink salmon is more common than red salmon and, therefore, less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter wants to lose some weight, so she goes in a lot for low-calorie 
foods. I don't mind this so much except that all she looks at are the calories, 
without giving any thought to anything else the food might or might not 
contain. Are calories the only thing a person on a diet should worry about? 
</P>
<P>
A: The fact is that some low-calorie foods should be avoided by some dieters. 
For example, many low-calorie frozen dinners are high in sodium. The same holds 
true for a number of sugar-free diet soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
I look upon dieting as a means of enhancing the health of my patients. Any diet 
that does not have this as a goal is probably not worth following. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any logical reason why so many people in some of the smaller 
countries of the world seem to suffer so much from blindness? Aren't eyes in 
one country the same as eyes in another country? 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the most common causes of blindness in the developing countries is 
cataracts. While cataract surgery is a fairly simple operation in the United 
States, many of the developing nations do not have the surgeons needed to 
perform the operation. The result is blindness that is preventable. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have heard a lot of talk about skin cancer, but I'm not certain what it 
means. Would you please explain? I would also like to know if all skin cancer 
is the same. 
</P>
<P>
A: Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in one of the layers of the 
skin. There are several different types of skin cancer, but the most common 
ones are basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common; squamous cell 
carcinoma; and malignant melanoma.

INTO THE NIGHT

The Scene: A late-night bash Monday at the Hard Rock Cafe for Spin magazine's 
third annual swimsuit issue. There were no bathing beauties, but plenty of 
leather-clad men and women shouting above Tone-Loc and Fine Young Cannibals 
being blasted through mega-sized speakers. Music industry execs looking ill at 
ease in suits mingled with shag heads with tattoos and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz:The appearance of Harry Connick Jr., the Hot Young Thing from New 
Orleans who plays standards and blues with a passion that belies his age (21). 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The Del Rubio triplets (wearing snakeskin skirts and little 
silver boots), Stacey Q, supermodel Beverly Johnson, David Weiss of Was (Not 
Was), The Real Roxanne, Corey Haim, Spin Publisher Bob Guccione Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Half the crowd came dressed for the heavy metal scene at Cat House, 
with studded leather jackets and belts, shredded jean jackets, bandannas and 
long, stringy hair. Men layered vests over big shirts; girls paired long 
dresses with anklets and mary janes. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Not a huge spread -- fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese. Was the Hard Rock 
trying to teach these people to eat healthy? 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: Harry Connick Jr., solo and with Tony Bennett, a truly inspired 
pairing. After a break came the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The other show was in 
the women's bathroom, where females crammed themselves into a room measuring 
6x6 feet and asphyxiated one another with hairspray. 
</P>
<P>
Justine Bateman Watch: We were getting worried, not having seen Miss B at 
parties recently. But the actress/poet did show with boyfriend Leif Garrett, 
who finds that always wearing a scarf around his head is a sure remedy for male 
pattern baldness. While Leif happily shook his bootay while the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers played, Justine demurely nodded her head in time to the music. Maybe 
Tony Bennett was more her style. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Getting the audience to go wild over Harry Connick Jr. and Tony 
Bennett and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bennet must have felt good getting 
cheers from a new generation of twentysomething fans. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: At the Hard Rock they love loud music, which is fine if there's some 
place to go to escape it. Unfortunately, that only leaves the bathroom or 
outside the restaurant. It was audio claustrophobia. JEANNINE STEIN

Singer-actress Grace Jones was freed from jail Tuesday in Kingston, Jamaica, 
after a court granted her $2,700 bail on a charge of possessing cocaine. Jones 
had been held in a police station cell since Saturday, when police say they 
found 0.006 ounces of cocaine wrapped in two $2 Jamaican bills in her purse. 
The singer was not asked to enter a plea. If convicted, she probably will be 
fined rather than jailed because of the small quantity of the narcotic 
involved, court observers said. Her lawyer told the court the entertainer is 
not a drug user, and is involved in the campaign against drug abuse. ALEENE

Officials in Stockholm expelled Liza Minnelli's dog from Sweden Tuesday, saying 
she smuggled it into the country in violation of quarantine laws while on tour 
with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Minnelli took the shaggy Scottish 
terrier, Lilly, into Sweden aboard a car ferry from Denmark and the pet was 
discovered at Minnelli's hotel in Stockholm on Monday night. Two customs 
officials arrived to seize the dog, but Minnelli refused to hand over Lilly and 
threatened to cancel her show Tuesday night with Sinatra and Davis. The 
officials guarded her room all night until Minnelli agreed to fly the dog out 
of the country with one of her assistants Tuesday morning. To keep Sweden free 
from rabies, a dog has to spend four months in quarantine before it is allowed 
in the country.ALEENE MacMINN

Terry Hands, the artistic director of London's Royal Shakespeare Company, will 
resign from the post in 1991, the government-subsidized company said Tuesday. 
No reason was given, and there was no word on plans for a successor. Hands

In a week in which all three network news anchors were in Cuba for Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit, Peter Jennings' "ABC World News Tonight" 
narrowly edged Dan Rather's "CBS Evening News" and won the week's ratings, A. 
C. Nielsen Co. figures showed Tuesday. Jennings' broadcast averaged a 10.1 
rating, while Rather's got a 9.9. Tom Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News," usually in 
third place, was there again, averaging an 8.9 for the week ending last Friday. 
It was the second time in four weeks that Jennings' newscast has topped the 
network news ratings.ALEENE MacMINN

OPERA, SYMPHONY SEASONS GIVE GLIMPSE INTO SOVIET FESTIVAL 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A heavy dose of Russian music, visiting Soviet musicians, and a more 
adventurous sampling of modern musical styles will mark the 1989-90 seasons of 
both the San Diego Opera and the San Diego Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to unveiling their more ambitious programming, recent announcements 
by the opera and symphony of their upcoming seasons have fleshed out the 
details about this fall's San Diego Arts Festival, "Treasures of the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
As previously announced, San Diego Opera's production of Mussorgsky's "Boris 
Godunov" will inaugurate the Soviet festival Oct. 21. Soviet bass Alexander 
Morozov will sing the title role opposite soprano Irina Bogacheva as Marina; 
both singers are from Leningrad's Kirov Opera company. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of American and Soviet singers will be directed by American 
Nathaniel Merrill; Jansoug Kakhidze of the Tblisi State Theatre will conduct 
the opera orchestra. These five "Boris Godunov" performances also open the 
opera's five-opera 1989-90 International Season, an increase of one additional 
production compared to the local company's last several seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Over the three weekends following the "Boris Godunov" opening, the San Diego 
Symphony will present an impressive variety of Soviet music. Utilizing Symphony 
Hall's original function as a movie palace, the symphony will present Sergei 
Eisenstein's classic silent film "Alexander Nevsky," with Soviet conductor 
Evgeny Kolobov leading the orchestra and the San Diego Master Chorale in the 
landmark score that Prokofiev wrote for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 2, guest conductor Pavel Kogan will conduct the West Coast premiere of 
Rodion Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto, with Nikolai Petrov as soloist. 
Shchedrin's opera "Dead Souls" was one of the most respected works presented in 
last year's Soviet-American arts festival held in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Vassili Sinaisky, the Moscow conductor who made his American debut with the San 
Diego Symphony in February, will return Nov. 10 to conduct Stravinsky's "The 
Rite of Spring" and two world premieres commissioned by the San Diego festival. 
American composer Joseph Schwantner and Soviet composer Max Tarnopolsky will 
provide the new works. For this concert, the Soviet chamber orchestra, the 
Soloists of Leningrad, will join the San Diego Symphony, and the concertmaster 
of each orchestra will solo in J. S. Bach's Concerto for Two Violins. 
</P>
<P>
To sharpen its focus on contemporary trends, the symphony will inaugurate its 
Pulitzer Prize Series held at UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium. Starting 
next January, three American prize-winning composers -- Charles Wuorinen, 
Stephen Albert, and Ned Rorem -- will be featured in single concerts devoted to 
their music. Each composer will be present to discuss his works, and Wuorinen 
and Albert will also conduct their programs. 
</P>
<P>
The accent on 20th-Century music in the arts festival is also reflected in San 
Diego Opera's choice of Francis Poulenc's "Les Dialogues des Carmelites." 
Written in 1956, it will receive its first local performance Feb. 11, a new 
co-production with Houston Grand Opera designed by Gunter Schneider-Seimssen. 
Poulenc's opera will be the company's first offering of a major contemporary 
opera not from the pen of Gian-Carlo Menotti in over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Dialogues" will present Nova Thomas in her local debut as the main character, 
Blanche de la Force, as well as several returning singers: Maureen Forrester, 
Carol Neblett and Cheryl Parrish. Australian conductor Richard Bonynge will 
conduct, and Bliss Herbert will be responsible for the stage direction. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera's new season will also include the reprise of Puccini's "La 
Boheme," opening Jan. 20, in a new production designed by John Conklin. Soprano 
Ilona Tokody) and tenor Dennis O'Neill will share the leads, with Edoardo 
Muller conducting and John Copley directing. Donizetti's "La Fille du Regiment" 
will open March 3, starring Nova Thomas. Bonynge will again conduct, and Lou 
Galterio will return to direct this comic opera. 
</P>
<P>
The company will conclude its season with Mozart's "Die Zauberflote," which 
will open April 14, 1990, with a cast that includes sopranos Hei-kyung Hong and 
Virginia Sublett, tenor Denes Gulyas, and bass Kenneth Cox. Karen Keltner, San 
Diego Opera's associate conductor, will lead the orchestra, and Rhoda Levine 
will do the stage direction. The set, on loan from Houston Grand Opera, was 
designed by popular illustrator Maurice Sendak.

FINAL REEL RESTORED TO GLORIA SWANSON'S SILENT 'SADIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Vagabond Theater on Wilshire Boulevard is presenting through Saturday 
Gloria Swanson's 1928 silent version of "Sadie Thompson" along with "Sunset 
Boulevard." One of the finest of the late silents yet long unavailable, "Sadie 
Thompson" has for years been missing its final reel. Two years ago Kino 
International underwrote a restoration, supervised by Dennis Doros, in which 
production stills were used to fill out the missing footage. 
</P>
<P>
Having left Paramount for United Artists, Swanson was determined to put her 
clotheshorse days behind her. It was director Raoul Walsh's inspired idea that 
Swanson should do a screen version of "Rain," a legendary portrayal of the 
shady lady stranded in Pago Pago, based on a Somerset Maugham short story. 
Acting as her own producer and signing Walsh to co-star as the marine sergeant 
"Handsome" O'Hara as well as to direct, Swanson embarked upon a project which 
required her to go to such courageous, daring and cunning lengths as to seem 
absurd today. Having charmed Hollywood's morality czar Will Hayes, Swanson had 
to make only one small concession -- to change Rev. Davidson to Mr. Davidson -- 
a change which makes the ominous, self-appointed guardian of public morals seem 
all the more hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
With her enormous expressive eyes, Swanson is a terrific Sadie, the good-time 
girl who has fled San Francisco, where clearly she worked as a prostitute, for 
reasons she would rather not reveal. Her Sadie, vulnerable beneath a breezy, 
uninhibited facade, is a triumph of subtle yet wide-ranging silent-screen 
acting, and Walsh's virile O'Hara is a perfect foil, as is Lionel Barrymore's 
remorseless, spirit-crushing Davidson. Yet Swanson is not actually as ideal a 
Sadie as Joan Crawford was to be a mere four years later. Sadie's hearty 
earthiness, innocent vulgarity and scarred-by-life quality was very close to 
the real Crawford. On the other hand Swanson's less-flashy, more refined Sadie 
shows the actress at her sexiest, free at last from the heavy makeup and 
bizarre trains and headdresses of her De Mille period. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson had hoped to film in Pago Pago, but when that proved impossible she 
hired William Cameron Menzies, the distinguished pioneer production designer, 
to create a convincing South Seas village, principally on Santa Catalina 
Island. Swanson may have been the prime mover of the production, but "Sadie 
Thompson" is also one of Walsh's best films, directed with his characteristic 
verve and compassion. There's a wonderful moment when the pelting sound of the 
incessant tropical rains is echoed by the tapping of Davidson's fingers on a 
table as he hounds the hapless Sadie. Among Swanson's films "Sadie Thompson" is 
as timeless as "Sunset Boulevard" is itself. 
</P>

3 PREMIERES IN UMBRELLA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The diversity of California was the made-to-order theme of the latest Green 
Umbrella program Monday night at Japan America Theatre. David Alan Miller 
conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group in premieres by three 
very different composers, all with at least a remote connection to the Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast premiere of David Lang's "Are You Experienced?" (1987) for 
narrator, amplified tuba and chamber orchestra with synthesizer and electric 
guitar proved the most ambitious undertaking. Titled after the first album of 
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, these six movements -- four with texts -- confuse 
and disorient both intentionally and unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
The listener anticipates references to Hendrix's music, but none occur -- save 
a short humorous episode where the amplified tuba is used to manipulate 
feedback from an amplifier. The text proceeds with a deadpan monologue about 
being on the verge of unconsciousness after a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Lang read his texts mixing the monotone narrative styles of William Burroughs 
and Laurie Anderson, but humor and shock value faded quickly, as did interest. 
Meanwhile, an otherwise inventive style of composition with single-note 
repetitions and carefully structured rhythms relentlessly pulsated and at times 
loudly banged. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a wild electronic solo in the "Dance" movement, Jay 
Rozen's tuba-playing went largely unnoticed. Conductor Miller's apt attention 
to the score yielded an accurate, polished reading. 
</P>
<P>
Another West Coast premiere, Steven Stucky's modest "Sappho Fragments" (1982) 
-- a setting of five short text fragments attributed to Sappho for soprano and 
small chamber ensemble -- proceeded with conservative, carefully wrought 
instrumental materials. Here, Stucky used additive processes common to the 
Minimalist school in a way consistent with his own mainstream, atonal style. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Jennifer Trost convincingly conveyed the demanding vocal part, singing 
in both the original Greek and an English translation. Again, Miller led his 
forces admirably. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. premiere of Finlander Kaija Saariaho's "Lichtbogen"(1985-86) for 
flute, electronics and chamber ensemble, demonstrated an intelligent use of 
microtonal passages and sonorities in a Ligeti-inspired sonic portrayal of an 
arctic landscape. GREGG WAGER

A former security guard for a Westlake Village stock brokerage firm surrendered

T. Silberman launder $300,000 from an undercover agent who had described the 
money as coming from Colombian cocaine traffickers.

money-laundering operation allegedly orchestrated by Silberman -- surrendered 
at U.S. District Court at 2 p.m., accompanied by Los Angeles attorney Robert L. 
Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee allowed Nakatsuka to remain free on a 
$200,000 personal surety bond co-signed by his father and secured by a family 
home in Los Angeles. Prosecutors did not oppose his release and Nakatsuka was 
directed to return to court for a preliminary hearing April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka 'Surprised' 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Nakatsuka said he was "surprised" when friends called him 
Friday night and told him he was being sought by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the office on Friday when I heard," said Nakatsuka, a slight man 
dressed Tuesday in a stylish gray-striped suit and white shirt. "I didn't know 
what to think. . . . I really don't know anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka, who described himself as director of security for Hamilton-Williams 
&amp; Co. stock brokerage firm in Westlake Village, north of Los Angeles, said 
he was acquainted with Jack Norman Myers, who is among four individuals charged 
in the alleged money-laundering scheme and was still at large late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But he declined to comment on his ties to Silberman and the charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Silberman -- the husband of County Supervisor Susan Golding and a 
longtime fund-raiser for statewide and local Democratic candidates -- resigned 
Tuesday as director and officer of Yuba Natural Resources Inc., a company 
principally involved in gold mining with land holdings north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Chairman Elected 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting, the company's board of directors formed a committee to 
investigate Yuba's potential involvement in the alleged scheme and elected 
Peter L. Jensen chairman of the board 
</P>
<P>
and chief executive officer. A company spokesman declined any specific comment 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 59, was arrested Friday at the Hyatt Islandia hotel while allegedly 
negotiating to launder $1.1 million in funds an undercover agent told him were 
proceeds from Colombian cocaine sales. His arrest -- which was videotaped -- 
capped a 2 1/2-year investigation by FBI agents who stumbled upon Silberman 
while trailing Chris Petti, a reputed organized crime figure. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 62, an alleged associate of the Chicago La Cosa Nostra crime family and 
once convicted of bookmaking, was also arrested Friday. Both Petti -- who is 
being held without bail -- and Silberman face charges of conspiracy, money 
laundering and violating laws requiring all transactions involving sums 
exceeding $10,000 be reported to the federal government. They could be 
sentenced to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A 76-page federal affidavit released Monday provided a rich, detailed look at 
the case against Silberman, a powerful political figure who was once a close 
adviser to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. The document, filed in support of 
search warrants, is based on six months of wiretapped telephone conversations 
and meetings between the undercover FBI agent and Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Silberman asked Petti -- whom he allegedly has known 
for 15 years -- to help arrange a money-laundering deal in mid-1988. Silberman 
boasted that he had laundered money in the past and sought new connections from 
Petti because he wanted "some diversification," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not my first go-around," Silberman is quoted in the affidavit as 
telling the agent. "I've been here before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transactions Described 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit describes two laundering transactions between the FBI agent and 
Silberman, who stood to earn a commission of between 6% and 12% on each of the 
alleged deals. 
</P>
<P>
The first, on Nov. 30, involved $100,000 picked up by Nakatsuka at the Airport 
Hilton in Los Angeles. Those funds were apparently to be used in a stock swap 
involving Yuba American Gold, a subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources, though 
prosecutors say specifics of the deal remain murky. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 22, the second deal occurred when another $200,000 in federal money was 
given by the undercover agent to Myers and Nakatsuka at the Hyatt Islandia. The 
two men indicated in conversations with the agent that they had done such work 
for Silberman before. That money was exchanged for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon 
bonds through an employee of the Hamilton-Williams stock brokerage house, Terry 
Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of wiretapped conversations between Silberman and the agent suggest 
Silberman believed the money came from Colombian drug traffickers, who, 
according to the cover story provided by the agent, needed it hidden in 
investments in the United States. The affidavit alleges that Silberman 
frequently asked the agent not to mention the word "drugs" or "cocaine" in 
their discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, a person need not be laundering actual drug money to be 
convicted. Silberman needed only to believe its source was narcotics 
trafficking to be charged, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Called 'Very Strong' 
</P>
<P>
Evidence against the powerful political fund-raiser, a La Jolla resident whose 
wealth was once estimated at as much as $25 million, ranges from the extensive 
wiretap transcripts to videotapes of the cash transactions. Prosecutors have 
characterized the case against him as "very strong." A grand jury indictment is 
expected within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka, whose role as described in the affidavit appeared limited to cash 
pickups and deliveries, worked as a security guard at the Hamilton-Williams 
stock brokerage firm but quit last week, a broker there said Tuesday. The 
company, located on Triunfo Canyon Road, changed its name to Adams Securities 
about a week ago, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler -- who allegedly set up the purchase of bonds in the second laundering 
transaction -- was a "part-time analyst" for Hamilton-Williams until he quit 
last week, said the broker, who declined to give his name. Ziegler has not been 
charged but remains the target of a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the allegations involving the brokerage house, the broker 
said, "Nothing went through this firm." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman said Myers was negotiating for his surrender. The spokesman 
said he believed Myers was being represented by attorney Howard Weitzman, who 
defended John Z. Delorean against cocaine-related charges. But Weitzman's 
secretary said Weitzman had not been retained. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said Myers, 43, of Malibu, has been associated with Silberman 
since both men raised campaign funds for Brown. Myers is the former son-in-law 
of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman; he and Wasserman's daughter, Lynn, divorced 
about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, meanwhile, a spokeswoman for noted criminal defense attorney 
Milton J. Silverman said he had not yet decided whether to represent Silberman. 
Silverman, who handled the controversial Sagon Penn police shooting case, made 
a special appearance for Silberman at his arraignment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekend Release 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Friday, Silberman spent the night at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center before his release Saturday on a $500,000 personal surety bond co-signed 
by Golding. On Tuesday, some attorneys expressed surprise that a magistrate 
agreed to free Silberman over the weekend, while others said it was a common 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had anybody released on the weekend in 17 years of practicing law," 
said defense attorney Jan Ronis, noting, however, that he had never had a 
client "of that stature" arrested on a Friday evening or weekend. 
</P>
<P>
At least one prosecutor, who asked not to be named, also said the procedure had 
never been used for a defendant in any of his cases. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran defense attorney John Cleary, however, said he has frequently obtained 
the release of clients on Saturdays and Sundays -- including low-income clients 
he represented while working for Federal Defenders Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"If the case has merit, and the client can make bail, I don't hesitate," Cleary 
said, adding that he has driven to the homes of judges after hours and once 
tracked a magistrate to a golf course to obtain the signature needed to permit 
the release. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, they are eminently reasonable about it and understand that people 
don't like to sit in jail all weekend if they don't have to," Cleary said. He 
noted that prosecutors have a say in the decision and argued that the system is 
"heavily weighted in favor of caution." 
</P>
<P>
Magistrate McKee, who arranged Silberman's release at the request of defense 
attorney Lou Katz on Saturday, said he has approved weekend releases six or 
seven times since the first of this year. He said magistrates serve on a 
two-week rotating stint, during which they must be available for nighttime and 
weekend requests for release as well as for search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the proposals made sense, so I did it," said McKee, adding that 
his primary concern is being assured the person will return to court. "If 
someone else had been on duty they would have made the decision."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SOLACE FOR SILBERMAN COMES FROM THE SOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Dozzell figured it was the right thing to do, so he didn't hesitate. He 
headed straight for the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego on Monday to 
offer support for his longtime friend and customer, Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
When the two embraced, Silberman lost his public composure for the first time 
since his shocking arrest Friday on money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
"When a man is down real bad, like Richard is, that's when he needs people," 
said Dozzell, 70, who operates a shoeshine stand at the Town &amp; Country 
Hotel in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"When my daughter was so sick and needed a doctor, Richard offered to do 
whatever I needed to help her," he said. "That's the kind of man he is. All 
this other stuff on television and in the paper, that's not Richard." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, Silberman has had a standing appointment on Saturday 
morning to have his shoes (mostly Guccis) shined. "When he didn't arrive on 
Saturday, I knew something was very wrong," Dozzell said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Little Rock, Ark., Dozzell was a dining-car waiter on the Rock 
Island Railroad and then a shoeshine proprietor at the Hanalei Hotel for 18 
years before moving to the Town &amp; Country in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
In four decades in San Diego, he's seen them all -- lawyers, politicians, 
business tycoons, civic leaders. And he has also seen how even the mighty can 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
For many years Dozzell had the town's most respected banker as a steady 
customer: C. Arnholt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calling the Literati 
</P>
<P>
The Fessenden Review, the irreverent-irrelevant La Jolla-based publication that 
bills itself as "The Noisiest Book Review in the Known World," has hit 
financial problems and asked its readers (whoever they might be) for help. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 editions, the quarterly has provided scholarly insight into books that 
the larger reviews ignore: among them, minor works on environmental topics, 
offbeat poetry, Liberace and scientific concepts such as "randomly rotating 
phreatic fields." 
</P>
<P>
But now the capital assets of The Fessenden Fund, named for turn-of-the-century 
physicist Reginald A. Fessenden, have gone dry. A three-page, fund-raising 
letter has gone forth, on pea-green paper, complete with quotes from Malraux 
and Mailer. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range future is uncertain but, at least, edition 13 will soon be 
available. Featuring reviews of "Red Flower: Rethinking Menstruation," "The 
Faber Book of Seduction," "Intercity Bus Lines of the Southwest" and "Flowers 
from the Royal Gardens of Kew." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaker Out of the Cold 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet invasion continues. 
</P>
<P>
Vista High School next week is having its annual student body election, this 
year with a United Nations theme, so who better to invite as a keynote speaker 
than Stanislav Levchenko, the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect? 
</P>
<P>
Levchenko, who recruited politicians and journalists in the Far East as spies, 
was given political asylum in this country in 1979. He tells all for $5,000 a 
lecture, plus expenses. Corporate sponsors are bankrolling his Vista trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E in the Glare 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said the utility business was going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech to an American Bar Assn. conference on electricity law and 
regulation, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Senior Vice President and General 
Counsel Stephen L. Baum warned his fellow lawyers to beware of a press backlash 
in the event of an attempted merger. 
</P>
<P>
Baum said the SDG&amp;E-Southern California Edison merger attempt has produced 
"so much negative reporting that speculation within the company is that the 
local papers' reporters have been directed to write one negative story each day 
about the merger." 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he continued, "some employees are only too willing to assist 
by funneling internal gossip and documents to the press to fuel the fires." 
</P>
<P>
Edison executives are being driven batty by "living in a fishbowl," Baum said. 
To SDG&amp;E, it's business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to it, having been company non grata for years."

STATE PANEL REJECTS GIVING WEIGHT TO CITIZENS' VOTE ON SDG&amp;E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Senate committee Tuesday rejected legislation that would have required the 
California Public Utilities Commission to weigh the results of an advisory vote 
of San Diegans before acting on the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric and Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee approved two other measures designed to ensure 
that San Diegans and their environment are not harmed by the merger, which, if 
approved by the PUC, would create the largest electric utility in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), author of the advisory-vote measure, blamed 
his bill's defeat on the considerable clout Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric wield in the Legislature. The vote was the first test of strength on 
an issue that will probably dominate San Diego politics for most of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Good at It' 
</P>
<P>
"These are non-competitive monopolies," Stirling said of the utilities, which 
annually spend hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying the Legislature and 
the PUC. "They make their money not by providing a competitively priced product 
but by manipulating the government. I think you've seen a strong indication 
today that they are very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling said he hopes San Diego County will still call for a vote on the 
issue, even if the utilities commission is not be required to consider the 
result as part of its deliberations. He also proposed that all San Diegans 
write the words "No Merger" on the outside of their envelopes before mailing 
monthly payments to SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"Elected officials in Sacramento are not able to deliver the votes to do 
anything about Edison through the legislative process," Stirling said. "So it's 
up to every San Diegan to stand up and be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill, as it was introduced, would have given San Diego voters veto 
power over the merger. But the lawmaker, in the face of the utilities' 
opposition and a legislative counsel opinion suggesting that the measure would 
be unconstitutional, amended the bill to allow only an advisory vote, which the 
PUC would have had to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E still argued against the measure, contending it was an 
unnecessary intrusion into the PUC's regulation of utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill would just confuse the issue," said Mary Wood, assistant general 
counsel for SDG&amp;E. "Present law gives (utility customers) the protection 
that they need." 
</P>
<P>
The bill received only two votes from the nine-member Energy and Public 
Utilities Committee. The measure needed five votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition to the two bills the committee approved was not as strong. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bills, by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) establishes 10 
standards for the PUC to use when weighing a proposed merger. Four of the 10 
would be mandatory: The merger would be required to benefit customers, to be 
"fair and reasonable" to employees, to be fair to stockholders and to not 
"adversely affect" competition. The six other standards, involving utility 
service, management and the local economies, would have to be met "on balance" 
in the judgment of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said the bill is needed to ensure that the utilities are forced to 
keep the promises they are making as they argue in support of the proposed 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC has absolutely no statutory criteria for determining what conditions 
must be met before a utility merger is approved," Rosenthal said. "The whole 
process is unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Edison opposed the measure, but a lawyer for the company said he believed the 
utility could "live with it." The bill passed on a vote of 8 to 1 and was sent 
to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Require Study 
</P>
<P>
The third bill, by Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) would require the preparation 
of an environmental impact study before the PUC could approve the merger. The 
bill, which would apply only to the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger, was approved 8-1 
and forwarded to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who left the Capitol to return to San Diego 
before the vote on Stirling's bill, said she was encouraged by the committee's 
approval of Rosenthal's measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point, the only players have been the PUC and Southern California 
Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric," O'Connor said. "Now you're seeing a 
big push here to make sure that the ratepayers get some kind of a voice." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, whose bill might be reconsidered by the committee in May, also said 
he was encouraged by the success of Rosenthal's bill, although that measure 
still gives the PUC great leeway in deciding whether to allow the merger to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the bills are a step in the right direction," Stirling said. "The PUC 
process has not worked for the people of San Diego. We had the highest rates. 
When they started down again, the guys with the highest rates come in and take 
us over. It's not a working system."

COASTAL PANEL RIPS PROPOSED SMOG RULES FOR DRILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission on Tuesday approved a tough slate of comments 
criticizing proposed federal smog regulations on derricks planned along the 
coast, including those envisioned in San Diego County waters. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted unanimously to approve the remarks, which brand the 
proposed federal rules as inequitable and significantly weaker than 
pollution-control standards enforced on land. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that prevailing winds in California's coastal area blow toward shore, 
bringing offshore pollutants onto the land, the 47-page report drafted by the 
state agency's staff suggested that new oil rigs could add to pollution 
problems in parts of Southern California already burdened by the worst air 
quality in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The document represents perhaps the harshest and most wide-ranging assault on 
the federal air-quality plan for offshore oil operations issued by the 
Department of the Interior in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll take our comments seriously," said Susan Hansch, the 
commission's energy and ocean resources manager. "As they are written now, 
these rules promise only to exacerbate the serious existing problem with 
onshore air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Department of the Interior officials in Washington could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday. Officials of the agency's Mineral Management Service in Los 
Angeles said they had not seen the commission's remarks and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a Coastal Commission workshop Monday, an Interior Department official 
said the federal agency would carefully consider the commission's remarks along 
with others received before the April 17 deadline for comments on the proposed 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"This rule is not cast in stone," said Michael Poling, a deputy assistant 
secretary of Interior. "What we have is a starting point." 
</P>
<P>
Although the recent oil-tanker accident in Prince William Sound off the Alaskan 
coast has focused attention on the dire effects of spills, air pollution from 
oil exploration and operations represents an equally vexing environmental 
threat, experts contend. 
</P>
<P>
If an Interior Department plan to lease oil tracts in federal waters off the 
Southern California coast goes forward, a fleet of new platforms would sprout 
from the sea, each belching pollution during drilling operations and attracting 
a swarm of support ships to add to the smog, critics argue. 
</P>
<P>
The federal drilling proposal for California waters is on hold while a 
presidential task force studies the offshore oil issue, but some state and 
local officials remain concerned that the plan could be revived, and many see 
the air-quality issue as perhaps the best avenue of attack. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed federal rules stem from nearly a decade of unsuccessful efforts to 
devise a palatable strategy for con 
</P>
<P>
trolling pollution from oil rigs off California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the state sued the Interior Department over the issue. As a result, 
negotiations were launched in 1986 among officials of local, state and federal 
governments, industry and environmental groups. After two years, however, a 
consensus had not been reached, and the Interior Department dropped the effort 
and set about drafting the existing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from criticizing the proposed rule as "significantly weaker" than onshore 
pollution regulations, the commission suggested that the plan would allow broad 
exemptions and disrupt efforts to meet air-quality standards on land. 
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, thousands of tons of nitrogen oxides would be permitted, 
causing "an adverse impact far exceeding any gains" that some regions would 
hope to make by regulating pollution sources such as factories and automobiles, 
according to a commission report. 
</P>
<P>
The result would be "deteriorated human health, deteriorated agricultural 
productivity, and economic and social costs," including possible bans on 
industrial and residential development on the coast, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notable Exemptions 
</P>
<P>
Among the exemptions in the federal rule is air pollution emitted by support 
vessels as well as ships and equipment used by oil companies during exploration 
and construction of offshore platforms, it said. 
</P>
<P>
If the exemptions are allowed, more than 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxides will be 
permitted in each air basin along the coast, according to the report. That load 
of pollution is the equivalent of adding 125,000 cars traveling 10,000 miles a 
year to a region's roads. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, construction of a typical dual-platform project would result in about 
620 tons of nitrogen oxides in a year, equal to adding 77,500 vehicles 
traveling 10,000 miles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission report also said the federal standards lack strong monitoring 
and enforcement provisions and leave too broad a decision-making role to the 
regional director of the federal Minerals Management Agency, the oil 
exploration arm of the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
The report also criticizes the Department of the Interior for suggesting that 
an environmental review of the proposed rule is not needed because it "does not 
constitute a major federal action affecting the quality of the human 
environment."

HAZARDOUS CARGO HEADED FOR TREATMENT PLANT BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The load of a truck pulling a 40-foot trailer carrying illegal drug-lab 
chemicals to a Chula Vista toxic-waste storage and treatment plant caught fire 
Tuesday morning near the entrance to the plant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in less than two months in which the county and 
city's hazardous-materials teams had to be called to the plant, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A hazardous-materials team and three companies from the Chula Vista Fire 
Department answered a call shortly after 8 a.m. near the site of Appropriate 
Technologies II after a small fire erupted in the rig's trailer as it climbed a 
hill on Maxwell Road, said Sam Lopez, Chula Vista fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
The truck's driver heard a loud pop, jumped out and saw smoke coming from the 
trailer, Lopez said. The truck was carrying about 70 five-gallon containers and 
55-gallon drums of drug-lab chemicals. About 30 of the containers were to be 
delivered to Appropriate Technologies II, said Ken Kazarian, president of the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals -- primarily ether, acetone and other solvents -- had been seized 
by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the U. S. Department of 
Justice, Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had controlled the small blaze by 10 a.m., after dousing a number 
of flare-ups and moving the rig to the plant's site in the 1700 block of 
Maxwell Road, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials closed off Maxwell Road and the Otay landfill until about 11 
a.m. and evacuated workers at nearby auto-salvage yards and the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The truck and its cargo were scheduled to stay at Appropriate Technologies II 
until today, when teams from the county Environmental Health Services 
department will oversee the repackaging of the chemicals, Kazarian said. He 
said the repacked load will be trucked to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarian said the 55-gallon barrel that caught fire was bound for another San 
Diego toxic site, Pacific Treatment in Logan Heights. The rest of the load was 
bound for the Casmalia hazardous-waste site in Santa Barbara, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dan Farr, Pacific Treatment's general manager, said his company was 
not scheduled to receive any shipments of toxic waste from the Los 
Angeles-based Disposal Control Service, which was delivering the load. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriate Technologies II, which has been in operation since 1981, leases a 
2-acre site from the county and stores and treats household toxics, such as 
chlorine or pesticides, in addition to chemicals used in making illegal drugs 
that have been seized by law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fined Last Month 
</P>
<P>
The company was fined $25,000 by the county health department last month for 
operating without a permit after concerns were raised following two chlorine 
leaks at the plant in February. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Chula Vista City Council unanimously passed a resolution urging 
the state and county to close the site because its operators had failed to 
ensure the safety of residents who live less than a mile away. The council also 
passed a resolution asking that the site be relocated away from residential 
areas.

DEVELOPMENT'S FOES WIN ANOTHER ROUND; 
</P>
<P>
APPEAL COURT UPHOLDS DRIVE FOR MIRAMAR RANCH REFERENDUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeal court Tuesday refused to block a citizens group's drive for a 
referendum on the Miramar Ranch North housing project, setting the stage for a 
San Diego City Council decision on whether to place the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal refused to reconsider Superior Court Judge 
Kevin Midlam's April 3 decision that a petition drive by the Save Miramar Lake 
Committee was conducted legally. 
</P>
<P>
James Milch, attorney for the developers of the project, BCE Development, said 
Tuesday that he plans to take the battle to the state Supreme Court today. 
Milch said he will argue again that the petition drive was invalid because each 
of the 37,718 signers was not shown the entire 25-page development agreement 
that authorized the project north of Scripps Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The development agreement between BCE and the city sets the terms for 
construction of the Miramar Ranch North project, which consists of 3,360 homes 
on 1,200 acres. It calls for BCE to construct certain improvements, including a 
road, a library, two parks and a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed to Part of Project 
</P>
<P>
The Save Miramar Lake committee is not opposed to the entire development, only 
to 658 of the homes, a four-lane road and an industrial park planned on the 
hills of the lake's northern shore. But the group said it had no choice but to 
seek rescission of the entire development agreement in order to make the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling sends the issue to the council, which on Monday will be asked to 
decide whether to place the referendum on the ballot or rescind the development 
agreement. Councilman Ed Struiksma, a strong supporter of the development in 
his district, announced unexpectedly last week that he would ask the City 
Council to rescind the development agreement if the appeal court upheld 
Midlam's decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the Save Miramar Lake Committee's attorney said Tuesday he will urge the 
council to put the issue on the ballot, unless repeal of the development 
agreement includes provisions to protect the hills north of the lake from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma's plan to send the issue to a task force of Scripps Ranch community 
groups is merely an attempt to delay the issue and keep it off the September 
ballot, on which he is running for re-election in the city's first 
district-only elections, said Bob Glaser, the attorney. Slow-growth activists 
have targeted Struiksma for defeat, and at least one poll has shown him to be 
vulnerable on the Miramar Lake issue. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

BOULEVARD'S OLDEST SHOP STILL AN OASIS OF STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its original neighbors have drifted off like smoke in the wind -- giving way to 
mini-malls and office buildings and glitzy boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest shop on Ventura Boulevard has changed very little in 62 years, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Gus' Smoke Shop has occupied the same tiny clapboard storefront in Sherman Oaks 
since 1927. And its owner says it's there to stay, no matter how fast the pace 
of redevelopment becomes along the 17-mile-long boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week, someone is in here wanting to buy the place," says Jim Hurwitz, 
who is Gus' fourth owner. "I say I'm not interested. I bought this place 
because I was afraid it might be sold to a developer. It has too much charm and 
character to be turned into another mall." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of talk is music to the ears of Sherman Oaks residents, who have so 
far fought a losing battle to keep neighborhood shops in their community. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the objections of homeowners, a row of 1940s-era boulevard shops 
several blocks west of Gus' are being evicted this month to make way for a new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Gus' started out as Boyd's Smoke Shop. Along with cigars and candy, the owner 
sold live chickens at his 10-foot-wide store, Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The shop was owned for 10 years starting in the mid-1930s by Gus Pfender. The 
next owner was Norman Fudge, an Englishman who sold it to Hurwitz in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been a customer for 10 years, and it bothered me to hear developers 
talking about whether they should tear this place down from the front to the 
back, or from the back to the front," said Hurwitz, a Calabasas resident who 
had been an assistant vice president of Aaron Brothers Art Marts. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz, 38, said he also was worried about losing his supply of favorite pipe 
tobacco, Ancient Mariner, if the store fell to developers. 
</P>
<P>
It's sturdy enough to stand up to time, however; Gus' is constructed of durable 
redwood. The closet that Boyd used as a coop for his chickens is now used for 
the storage of tobacco and the repair of pipes. "They say that when this place 
was remodeled, feathers came out of the ceiling," Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
At the rear of the shop, in an area once used as Boyd's living quarters, a log 
helps hold up the roof. A blue-tinted 1920s gas stove that is still used to 
heat coffee stands in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Shop manager Dennis Spike and clerk Chuck Fayne share space in the front of the 
store with a 40-year-old wooden Indian, 1,000 pipes, containers of 125 tobacco 
blends and 5,000 cigars. Behind the counter is a brass-plated 1910 cash 
register that is sometimes used. 
</P>
<P>
"It works perfectly," Fayne said of the hand-cranked machine. "Of course, at 
the end of a busy day, you'd have a right arm the size of Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz said the shop draws second- and third-generation customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the middle-aged guys used to come in here as kids and buy penny 
candies. Now they come in for $3 or $4 cigars. Lots of people have said they 
used to come in with their grandfathers." 
</P>
<P>
Customer Jim Benjamin of Sherman Oaks grew up in the area and remembers Gus' as 
one of the few stores he'd pass by when he traveled from Coldwater Canyon to 
Tarzana in the late 1930s to buy cider. 
</P>
<P>
"This store's like a second home to me," Benjamin said Tuesday. "Some people 
drop in here every afternoon. It's like old home week. It has the greatest 
atmosphere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Customer Valentine Mayer of Studio City said the familiar surroundings are 
appropriate. "Smoking is centuries old. It's only fitting there should be some 
real character here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I come here not only for the quality product but for the friendship. It's 
almost like a gentleman's club here." 
</P>
<P>
Such atmosphere helped Hurwitz win a tobacco industry trade publication's award 
as 1988 pipe retailer of the year. He said he has managed to increase business 
by 300% since taking over the store -- despite the general downturn of the 
tobacco business and tightening restrictions on smoking in public. 
</P>
<P>
When Hurwitz tried last year to sponsor a balloon release at his 12-year-old 
daughter's school, officials balked at having a cigar shop's name imprinted on 
the balloons. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll stay as long as it's legal to sell tobacco," he vowed. "We want to keep 
alive the tradition that this building represents."

JUDGE SENTENCES TERMINALLY ILL WOMAN TO PRISON FOR 2 MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who has sickle-cell anemia and says she will die within five years was 
sentenced Tuesday to 17 years to life in prison for killing her former lover 
and his new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Ashmann imposed the maximum penalty for 
second-degree murder on Charisse Lewis, 33. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis originally was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of her 
ex-boyfriend, Jewel Purde, 34, with whom she had lived for two years, and 
Shirley Marie Johnson, 35, both of Panorama City. If found guilty of those 
charges, Lewis could have received the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Baron agreed to allow the defendant to plead 
guilty to the lesser charge. He said that considering Lewis' expected life 
span, she received what amounted to a death sentence. "She will die before she 
gets out of prison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest Lewis could be paroled would be in about 14 years, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated at Age 9 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Lewis first received treatment for sickle-cell 
anemia, a usually fatal degenerative disease, when she was 9. She told 
authorities she had suffered two serious heart attacks caused by the disease 
and would die within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was arrested last October when she sought treatment for the disease in 
Chicago, where she had fled after the July 17 killings. Lewis had moved her 
belongings out of the Panorama City apartment she and Purde shared July 15, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
She became angered when she saw Purde and Johnson returning from a trip to the 
grocery store and killed them, police said. Both were shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Baron said the weapon used in the killings, a .38-caliber revolver, is believed 
to have belonged to Purde. The gun was never recovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Dennis G. Cohen, who defended Lewis, asked the judge for 
leniency because he said Lewis feared Purde. He said Purde had threatened Lewis 
with a gun shortly before the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
But Baron called the slayings "cold-blooded murders."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ZONING APPEALS BOARD'S VOTE BLOCKS ENCINO MOVIE 
COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners attempting to block construction of three movie complexes in Encino 
won their first battle Tuesday as Los Angeles officials voted against allowing 
a five-screen theater at the northeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and Gaviota 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Board of Zoning Appeals had voted 2 to 1 against the project March 
28 but needed a third vote to defeat the proposed Mann Theaters development. 
</P>
<P>
The necessary vote came Tuesday when board member Joe Mandel sided with BZA 
President Nikolas Patsaouras and member James D. Leewong in opposing the 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Jason Heltzer will have 15 days to appeal the vote to the City 
Council after the board ruling is formally issued, said board secretary Terry 
Speth. 
</P>
<P>
Heltzer could not be reached for comment. But he has looked to the 1,500-seat 
theater complex as the centerpiece for his proposed $22-million "Encino 
Marketplace" project. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers are planning a 1,600-seat complex on the north side of Ventura 
east of Encino Avenue and an 1,800-seat complex north of Ventura east of 
Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted," said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino. 
"This will set a model in terms of community opposition to the other two 
theater proposals."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VALENCIA MAN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Valencia man who says he was once a Golden Gloves amateur boxing champion 
knocked out a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy with one punch early Tuesday 
and was arrested after four deputies wrestled him to the ground, a sheriff's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sheriff's deputies responded to a 1:45 a.m. call of a possibly armed man 
creating a disturbance at a home in the 24400 block of Vista Ridge Drive in 
Valencia. They were confronted by Frank Kucera, 45, a resident of the house, 
Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
While deputies searched his outer clothing for a weapon, the 6-foot, 2-inch, 
230-pound Kucera punched Deputy George Guevara, 32, in the face and knocked him 
out, Hom said. Deputy John Bomben knocked Kucera to the ground and was still 
wrestling with him when three other deputies showed up to help. 
</P>
<P>
During the struggle, Kucera and Deputies Michael Reddy and John Prentice 
received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies were treated and released at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in 
Valencia. Kucera was treated at the hospital and transferred to the Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center jail ward. He was held there on suspicion of felony 
assault on a police officer. Bail was set at $3,000.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;

<P>
SALKELD SUPPLIES THE FAST TIMES AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Introducing Roger Salkeld, the man with the golden arm -- soon to be pitching 
in a major league ballpark near you. The memories are waiting -- or so it 
assuredly seems. 
</P>
<P>
For Salkeld, Saugus High's 18-year-old, 6-foot-5 senior right-hander, deciding 
whether to attend college before signing a professional baseball contract, 
seemingly, is his only pressing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Who wouldn't give their right arm to have Salkeld's right arm? Life must be 
tough, eh, Rog? 
</P>
<P>
"What more can you ask for?," Salkeld says, sounding almost embarrassed. "I 
feel really lucky. Before, I played baseball because I liked to play it and be 
around my friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, I feel like I have a chance to play as a career." 
</P>
<P>
The list of teams keeping tabs on Salkeld reads like a list of some of 
baseball's top organizations -- which it is. The Dodgers, Yankees, Athletics, 
Royals, Reds, Padres, Phillies, Orioles, Mariners, Indians, White Sox -- all 
have expressed interest in Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
He is 6-0 with 88 strikeouts and an 0.52 earned-run average in 50 1/3 innings 
this season. His fastball has the velocity of a rocket, his changeup the speed 
of a hot-air balloon. And the combination has earned Salkeld his wings as, 
perhaps, the best high school pitcher in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most dominating pitcher I have ever seen," Saugus Coach Doug Worley 
said. "When he was a sophomore he would overpower seniors. He's so tough and he 
will go after you. He's got that great fastball and everything sets up off of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball America magazine ranks Salkeld third nationwide among high school 
prospects, and although he is considering attending USC or Arizona State, 
Salkeld admits he is leaning toward pursuing a professional career in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's said, 'Do this' or 'Do that' and that's the way I like it," he said. 
"It's really my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Packed grandstands greet Salkeld wherever he throws. Frequent viewers include a 
group of straw-hatted gentleman toting black suitcases that bear major league 
insignias. Rarely does a Salkeld fastball go undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, for instance, a firing squad of five scouts aimed their radar guns 
at Salkeld as he warmed up for the Centurions' showdown with cross-town rival 
Canyon. Salkeld's first fastball registered 88 m.p.h. Later in the game, some 
pitches exceeded 90. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-degree heat, Salkeld maintained a minimum velocity of 85 m.p.h. 
while posting a one-hit shutout with seven strikeouts -- his lowest total in a 
start this season. Saugus (5-0) defeated Canyon, 5-0, to take a one-game lead 
in the Golden League standings. 
</P>
<P>
It was a busy week. Three days earlier, Salkeld struck out six in three innings 
in relief to earn a victory against Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year letterman also topped the 300 career-strikeout mark (306) and 
established school records for complete games (23) and wins (23). Salkeld's 
career record is 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
But what about developing a sore arm, the bane of young flame throwers? Many 
pitchers' dreams have gone up in smoke because of a burned-out arm. And that's 
one reason Bill Salkeld does not object to the thought of his son skipping 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"Colleges have a tendency to burn out a lot of young pitchers," he said. "Roger 
would prefer to go pro, and, being his parents, if that's what he wants, OK." 
</P>
<P>
But no decision about his future will be made too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't decide until when and if I get drafted," Salkeld said."

DIGEST: HALL WALKS OFF SOFTBALL TEAM AT NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Hall, captain of Cal State Northridge's top-ranked softball team, has left 
the team, citing a conflict with Coach Gary Torgeson. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a senior, was an All-American candidate at third base after batting .300 
as a junior with 46 runs batted in. She was batting .341 with 15 RBIs this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sorry to see her go," said Torgeson, whose team is 37-13. "She's been a 
part of my teams -- here or in ASA ball -- for seven or eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said quitting was the only way for her to "get out and not hinder the rest 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
"It probably was a surprise to the rest of the team, but not him," Hall said, 
referring to Torgeson. "Little things between him and I have been brewing for 
some time." She declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said part of the problem was difficulty she experienced assuming a 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't believe in me," Hall said of Torgeson. "I was trying my hardest and 
it just wasn't working. He just couldn't take 'I don't know' and 'I can't' for 
an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Krista Miller, a junior who is batting .260, will start at third base, Torgeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has postponed a women's tennis match against UC Riverside, 
scheduled for today, because Coach Tony Davila suffered broken bones in his 
left arm in an accident Sunday at his home in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Davila was trying to stop his car from rolling down his driveway when his arm 
was pinned between the vehicle and the garage. Both major bones in his left 
forearm were broken. A steel plate will be inserted into the arm during an 
operation scheduled for April 17. 
</P>
<P>
The match has tentatively been rescheduled for April 22 at CSUN. The Lady 
Matadors' next match is Saturday at home against Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Steve deLaveaga, a 6-foot-4 senior guard who averaged a team-high 28.1 points a 
game, has been selected as Cal Lutheran's most valuable basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga also shared a leadership award with guard Jeff Logsdon. Brad Adam was 
honored as the most improved player and for having the highest grade-point 
average. Mike Demeter won the coaches' award. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark College, which will field men's and women's soccer teams next season 
for the first time, has selected coaches for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Parodi, former coach at Mission College, will head the men's team. Daniel 
Ohayon, coach at Culver City High the past seven seasons, will run the women's 
team. Both selections are subject to approval by the Ventura County Community 
College District, which will next meet on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Bernardi, 30, a former Cal State Northridge defensive back, has been hired 
as football programming director at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said Bernardi's duties will include coordinating fall 
camp, team meals, housing, the annual spring coaching clinic, the summer camp 
and serving as a liaison between the athletic department and the university. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Mertes and Jason Willis, two of the top athletes on the Chatsworth High 
track team, have regained their academic eligibility, according to Coach Myron 
Gibford. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes, a junior, placed second in the high jump in last year's City Section 
championships and tied for sixth in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, a senior, won the City title in the Class B 400 in 1988 and has a best 
of 49.68 seconds in that event. 
</P>
<P>
Both athletes, whose 30-week report cards met academic requirements, are 
expected to compete against Taft on April 21.

U.S. RENEWS 40-YEAR CALIF. WATER PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major blow to environmentalists, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. 
signed a precedent-setting contract Tuesday to renew federal water subsidies to 
growers in California's San Joaquin Valley for the next 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's abrupt action rejected concerns raised by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which had urged the Interior Department to study the environmental 
impact of the subsidies before signing the Orange Cove Irrigation District 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
A White House advisory panel, the Council on Environmental Quality, had agreed 
to arbitrate the dispute and had scheduled public hearings to begin this week. 
But Lujan called reporters to his office Tuesday to announce that he had signed 
a contract requiring only an after-the-fact environmental assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is a victory for Central Valley farmers, guaranteeing them a 
continuing source of water, despite objections from environmental groups. 
Environmentalists regard the subsidies as a setback to water conservation 
efforts and fear that continued diversion of San Joaquin River water under the 
contract could endanger valuable fisheries and wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The action still could be overturned by a federal court in California, which is 
considering a lawsuit filed by the Natural Resource Defense Council. The suit 
argues that the Interior Department is obligated by law to conduct an 
environmental study before signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden decision by Lujan, who had expressed willingness to compromise on 
the issue less than a month ago, represents a significant hardening of the Bush 
Administration's position. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan acknowledged that he intended the decision to be a precedent to be 
followed in coming years as dozens of other long-term water contracts come up 
for renewal in actions that would lock up federal water rights for decades to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
The newly signed contract calls for water users to pay the federal government 
$14.84 per acre foot of water -- a more than fourfold increase over the $3.50 
price that has been in effect for the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan described the price increase as an attempt by the federal government to 
encourage water conservation. A senior project attorney for the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, however, noted that the price was "the lowest 
possible he could have set under federal law." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Hal Candee, said that the true value of the water was nearly $50 
per acre foot. "The new prices still represent a huge taxpayer subsidy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary argued that the federal government has a "legal and moral 
obligation" to renew the contracts to the area's water users, who first 
obtained the rights in a 40-year contract signed in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"Failure to meet that obligation," Lujan said, "would be devastating to the 
economy of the entire area and would represent a severe breach of faith." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan earlier had told a Senate panel that he would accept a proposal calling 
for the contract to be renewed for just 10 years. But he said Tuesday that such 
a plan would make it impossible for farmers to make long-term plans and that 
they would "raise economic chaos in that whole area." 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout came after heavy lobbying by Gov. George Deukmejian, Sen. Pete 
Wilson and some other California political figures who urged Lujan to approve 
the 40-year renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said that he was sensitive to environmental concerns in making the 
decision, noting that the contract now requires an assessment of its 
environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
But critics noted that the contract obliges the federal government to defend 
the interests of growers if the State of California seeks to reduce the supply 
of water to them. 
</P>
<P>
A number of politicians and environmentalists denounced the Lujan action, 
charging that his preemption of the review by the White House advisory panel 
demonstrates a lack of sympathy for environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Time after time, political pressure from the White House and the big farmers' 
lobbyists has overridden sound environmental judgment," said California Rep. 
George Miller (D-Martinez). "And sadly, this case doesn't seem to be any 
different." 
</P>
<P>
"If this is to be the new federal role in environmental matters," said Sen. 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), "it's almost enough to make you long for the (Ronald) 
Reagan years." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Sawyers, an attorney for the Friant Water Users Authority, said that his 
client is "obviously pleased" by the 40-year renewal and welcomed indications 
that the plan would be used as a model for other agricultural water contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Contractors have long believed this kind of contract appropriate throughout 
the San Joaquin Valley," Sawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Friant authority represents the Orange Cove district. Both are part of the 
Central Valley Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Not Resolved 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Cove contract was referred to the White House panel after 
negotiators for the EPA and Interior were unable to resolve a dispute over the 
conditions under which the contract should be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
EPA had urged that a broad environmental impact study be completed before a 
long-term contract was signed, while Interior said that it did not believe such 
a study was required by law. 
</P>
<P>
While the matter was under review early this month, the judge in the California 
case issued a ruling permitting the Administration to sign the contract pending 
his final decision. Interior Department officials said they regarded that 
decision as a go-ahead for Tuesday's action, but critics said that they were 
shocked by the Lujan "power play" that preempted the recommendation Council on 
Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of action, CEQ officials indicated that they planned to proceed 
with their study, which is to include hearings in Washington on Thursday and in 
Sacramento next week. CEQ counsel Dina Bear acknowledged, however, that the 
panel could not overrule the Interior decision. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials expressed anger at the Interior decision to preempt the 
arbitration procedure and voiced strong hopes that the federal court would 
overrule the department's action. "This action," one official said, "was less 
than collegial."

TALKS DEADLOCK; EASTERN ACCORD MAY BE DOOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter V. Ueberroth's effort to acquire Eastern Airlines appeared doomed early 
today after a rancorous battle in which lawyers for the strikebound carrier 
rebuffed union efforts to wrest control of Eastern from its current owners even 
before it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is dead," a well-placed source close to Ueberroth said early 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth himself could not be reached for further comment at his Manhattan 
apartment after a midnight Tuesday deadline for all parties to agree to the 
sale passed inconclusively. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland ordered 
lawyers to return to his office at 8:30 a.m. for a "status conference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Looks Bad' 
</P>
<P>
But a short time earlier, a dramatic late-night meeting of the judge, Ueberroth 
and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., ended with the 
former baseball commissioner declaring: "I'm not optimistic." One of his aides 
added: "It looks bad." 
</P>
<P>
The deal appeared to turn on the naming of a trustee to run Eastern while the 
airline remains in bankruptcy, a demand made by the airline's unions in return 
for wage concessions. But serious doubts also were raised by Eastern's 
creditors committee about whether Eastern would be a viable company if the 
Ueberroth deal is consummated. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group said its proposal depended on approval by the unions and 
Texas Air, owner of Eastern, by midnight, and both sides reserved the right to 
back out. But it remained to be seen whether the passing of the deadline indeed 
doomed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my deadline," Lifland said just before midnight. "There was an 
earlier deadline for certain things that I set and it was met." He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
James Linsey, one of the lawyers for the pilots union, said: "I don't think any 
single person has the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a trustee to run the airline in the next 60 to 90 days while 
the company is reorganized in bankruptcy was described as an absolute condition 
of the unions' agreement to a deal with Ueberroth. They are adamant that 
Lorenzo and his management not be allowed to continue to run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and his lawyers have objected because it would mark their loss of 
control over Eastern even before ownership of the airline shifted to 
Ueberroth's group. 
</P>
<P>
Two union lawyers and a Ueberroth lawyer said they thought there was a 
possibility that Lifland would appoint a trustee if he came to the conclusion 
that Lorenzo was "the roadblock" to a deal being concluded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Procedure 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unusual for a trustee to be appointed in a voluntary bankruptcy 
proceeding, according to Robert J. Rosenberg, one of Ueberroth's lawyers. 
However, he said, it was warranted under the circumstances in part because "our 
partners -- the unions -- insist on it." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Guerrieri Jr., a Washington lawyer representing the machinists, said he 
believed that Lorenzo opposed the appointment of a trustee because he not only 
would lose control of Eastern's operations but power over its reorganization 
plan in bankruptcy court. It could also foreclose other options he might have 
in determining the company's future, Guerrieri said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, lawyers said Lifland told them he was reluctant to name a 
trustee if Lorenzo would contest it in court. The judge said he would prefer 
that both sides reach an agreement on whether to name a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
After a full day of hotel-room meetings aimed at meeting the midnight deadline, 
Lorenzo, Ueberroth and their advisers arrived at the federal courthouse in 
lower Manhattan about 7:30 p.m. to discuss the trustee issue. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Lorenzo's advisers had told him by phone that there was an urgent 
need to talk with the judge about the trustee issue. Lorenzo was accompanied by 
Phil Bakes, the president of Eastern. Ueberroth was joined by partner J. Thomas 
Talbot. 
</P>
<P>
About 9:30 p.m., Lorenzo and Ueberroth left the judge's office. Then someone in 
the hallway said: "The judge is calling you back in." Lorenzo re-entered the 
office, but Ueberroth said to an associate: "I'm not going back in. . . . Let's 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Then Lorenzo and Philip Bakes emerged again and left the building. Lorenzo, 
surrounded by a throng of reporters and cameramen shoving microphones in his 
face, declined to comment on the elevator ride down to the lobby or on his way 
to a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
None of the parties would discuss the meeting with Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves grew frayed and tempers got short as another long day without a 
completed sale wore on at the federal bankruptcy courthouse. In the morning, 
negotiations were held at the Vista International Hotel in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lifland was overheard by reporters in a hallway as he shouted at 
Harvey Miller, Eastern's chief bankruptcy lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn it, Harvey, if you want the planes in the air, all you have to do is sign 
the paper," Lifland yelled at Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland has repeatedly voiced his desire to get Eastern -- which the judge has 
described as a "national asset" -- flying again. Eastern has had to cancel 
about 90% of its flights since a strike was launched against the company by the 
International Assn. of Machinists on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, David Shapiro, a Washington lawyer serving as a special 
court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, tried to get Miller's 
attention as Miller walked by in the courthouse hallway. 
</P>
<P>
"Harv," Shapiro shouted. Miller looked at him and declared: "Shove it, David," 
before stalking away. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, a machinists union official, LeRoy Washington, said: 
"Lorenzo's trying to pull the plug on the deal. He thinks if the unions will 
give concessions to Ueberroth, they ought to give concessions to him." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the fact that Eastern's machinists, pilots and flight 
attendants have agreed to give the Ueberroth group $199.6 million in annual 
wage concessions for the next five years in return for a 30% ownership interest 
in the newly re-formed company, to be called the Eastern Airlines Employees 
&amp; Service Co. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said that $168 million of those wage concessions would be 
given yearly by the machinists, $28 million annually by the pilots and $3.6 
million by the flight attendants. Additionally, sources said that Eastern's 
11,000 non-unionized workers would be asked to make about $10.4 million in 
concessions annually, coming from their current benefits, not from their wages. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots' union, said the pilots agreed to sign 
off on the concession deal at 4 a.m. Monday in Washington when they were told 
by Shapiro that he would fly to New York that day and recommend to Lifland that 
a trustee be appointed to run the company. Former Defense Secretary Frank C. 
Carlucci flew to New York with Shapiro, Bavis, Ueberroth and the other key 
figures in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I understood that he (Shapiro) had extraordinary powers," Bavis said, 
explaining that he expected that a trustee would be appointed. But lawyers for 
Eastern and Texas Air balked Monday and the transaction was delayed, 
necessitating further talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pissed," Bavis said. He said it was essential to get Eastern planes flying 
quickly because the airline has been losing "a million dollars a day" as well 
as market share during the strike, and that its value continues to diminish. 
</P>
<P>
In order to save the airline, he said, Eastern must start flying before the 60 
to 90 days it would take to consummate the Ueberroth deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bavis said that starting up operations now represented "a risk" to the 
employees because the Ueberroth deal was not finished. He said it was a risk 
they are only willing to take if Lorenzo is out. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people aren't going to take that risk for the guy they hate the most -- 
Lorenzo. Giving up $210 million a year in concessions is quite a bath. Our deal 
is with Peter." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Joel Zweibel, the chief lawyer for the 15-member Eastern 
creditors committee, presented a resolution to lawyers for Ueberroth, Texas Air 
and Eastern, as well as Lifland, expressing reservations about "certain 
significant aspects" of the Ueberroth deal. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said the creditors committee had not been given "any 
demonstration . . . of the economic viability of a business plan for a 
reorganized Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer of Assets 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Zweibel said the committee was disturbed "by the apparently 
substantial transfer of assets from Eastern to Texas Air without equivalent 
value" being given to Eastern from Texas Air. The Ueberroth purchase plan calls 
for a transfer of $79 million of Eastern's assets to Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee also expressed reservations about Eastern incurring an 
additional $100 million in new debt as part of the Ueberroth deal. 
</P>
<P>
Zweibel said he thought the issues raised by the creditors committee were 
significant, but he said he did not think they were the principal reason why 
the deal had not been consummated. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Ueberroth acknowledged that creditors have significant statutory 
rights in a bankruptcy proceeding and could present a significant obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, after consulting by phone with 
Lifland, said he planned to release his ruling this morning on whether 
Eastern's pilots should be forced back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, speaking to reporters and lawyers for both sides in his chambers, said 
he had decided to delay his ruling Tuesday to give Lifland more time to work 
out a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have determined that it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with 
the negotiations that are ongoing tonight," said Davis, who signed his ruling 
and sealed it. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he would again delay his ruling if both Eastern and the pilots 
union requested it. Eastern lawyer David Ross said the airline did not want any 
further delays in the release of Davis' decision.

In its suit, Eastern has asked Davis to order its 3,400 pilots to end their 
walkout in support of striking machinists. The company contends the pilots 
union is conducting an illegal strike in pursuit of its own contract goals, 
while union leaders say it is a legal sympathy walkout.

RACKETEERING CHARGED BY U.S. IN S &amp; L FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Stepping up the stakes in their war on fraud in Southern California's troubled 
thrift industry, federal prosecutors Tuesday unleashed a powerful 
anti-racketeering law against the former operators and associates of North 
America Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-count racketeering and fraud indictment, returned by a federal grand jury 
in Los Angeles against former executive consultant Janet F. McKinzie and five 
others, alleges that the now-defunct Orange County financial institution 
operated as a fraudulent enterprise almost since its inception in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which represents the first use of racketeering laws against a 
failed savings and loan on the West Coast, alleges that top management of the 
Santa Ana-based institution looted more than $16 million from depositors in a 
systematic attempt to use the troubled institution as a front for bogus real 
estate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 39, and North America's now-deceased founder and chairman, Duayne D. 
Christensen, are accused of using part of the fraudulent earnings to make it 
appear to regulators that the rapidly failing institution was adequately 
capitalized long after it began sinking into the red. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder, federal prosecutors allege, was used to finance expensive homes 
in Newport Beach, a pair of new Rolls-Royces and other luxuries for McKinzie 
and Christensen, who was 57 when he died in an early morning car crash just 
hours before state regulators seized the institution in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner said in Los Angeles that a 15-month FBI 
investigation concluded that the failure of North America, described by state 
regulators as the worst case of insider fraud ever uncovered at a California 
savings and loan, could be directly traced to the fraudulent activities of the 
institution's management. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government already has spent $120 million to bail out insured 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a very serious problem, one that ultimately affects the 
integrity of our financial institutions," Bonner said at a news conference 
announcing the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the federal racketeering statute's tough forfeiture provisions, 
prosecutors will stand first in line to recover assets and liquidated funds 
from the failed lending institution, including Christensen's $10-million life 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, whose sole beneficiary was McKinzie, Christensen's confidante, 
executive assistant and sole heir, has been placed in the custody of the court 
along with other remaining North America assets. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors are asserting a claim on the policy based on allegations 
that its premiums were paid with the fraudulent proceeds of a criminal 
enterprise, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Nancy Wieben Stock, who will 
prosecute the case. Most of the remaining North America assets, she said, have 
already been liquidated and are under the stewardship of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiffer Penalties 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering law also provides for stiffer penalties than those available 
under standard fraud and conspiracy laws. McKinzie faces up to 20 years in 
prison if convicted on the racketeering count alone. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie surrendered to a federal magistrate in Santa Ana on Tuesday and was 
released on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., as receiver for North America, 
has filed a civil racketeering suit against McKinzie claiming that she aided 
Christensen in defrauding the savings and loan out of more than $40 million. 
The suit is pending in Los Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement Tuesday, McKinzie's lawyer, Michael Essmeyer, denied the 
allegations in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the evidence will show my client had no culpable mental state, and 
therefore will be found not guilty of all these offenses that have been 
alleged. She had no intention to commit a crime against anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, a former Westminster dentist, was new to the financial industry 
when he chartered North America in 1983. McKinzie, a real estate broker, acted 
as Christensen's executive assistant and was a paid consultant with offices in 
the executive wing of the institution's Santa Ana office. The FSLIC claims 
McKinzie was "de facto vice chairman." 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie and Christensen, named as an unindicted co-conspirator, are charged 
with operating North America as a racketeering enterprise through most of its 3 
1/2 years of operation, diverting federally insured deposits for their personal 
benefit at the same time they were artificially inflating the institution's net 
worth to create the illusion of profitability. 
</P>
<P>
One of the schemes charged in the indictment alleges that a series of phony 
commercial real estate escrows were created, into which $11 million in North 
America funds were deposited and ultimately diverted to the benefit of 
Christensen and McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $5.6 million was allegedly lost through the creation of false 
billings in order to charge fictitious construction expenses to North America 
for development of two real estate projects in San Jose and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversion of Money Told 
</P>
<P>
The money actually was diverted to Plaza Group, an Elk Grove, Calif., company 
owned by McKinzie that was also involved in the phony escrows, Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the indictment are Victoria R. Walker, 46, office manager for 
Plaza Group; David L. Morgan, 52, Little Rock, Ark., accused of acting as a 
prospective buyer for the allegedly phony escrow properties; Frederick 
Youngdahl, 53, of Newport Beach; Armando J. Vasquez, 52, of Irvine and Thomas 
C. Clarke, 63, of Vista, all contractors who, investigators said, participated 
in the phony invoices scheme. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Davis, chief deputy commissioner of the state Department of Savings 
and Loan, said he was delighted with the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see more criminal prosecutions. The problem is . . . the justice 
system is slow," he said.

HISTORY OF NORTH AMERICA S &amp; L ASSN. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1983: Duayne D. Christensen, a Westminster dentist, invests $6.37 
million to open North America Savings in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1986: North America, now based in Santa Ana, loses $8.9 million for 
the first 11 months of 1986 and has a negative net worth of $1.5 million by the 
end of November. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1987: Christensen is killed when his car crashes into a bridge support 
on the Corona del Mar Freeway. Within hours, North America Savings is declared 
insolvent by state regulators. When evidence of widespread fraud is detected, 
the state turns the institution over to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp., and the FBI and the state attorney general's office begin criminal 
investigations. Charles Bottomley is hired by the FSLIC to manage the savings 
and loan. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1987: Federal regulators sue Janet F. McKinzie, Christensen's 
business manager and executive consultant, charging that she and Christensen 
defrauded the institution of more than $20 million and caused its collapse. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1987: Lawyers for federal regulators operating the savings and loan 
revise the amount missing up to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1987: After moving to new offices in Costa Mesa, North America puts 
its art and collectibles up for auction. Regulators estimate the savings and 
loan paid more than $250,000 for the office decorations. 
</P>
<P>
June, 1988: Federal regulators announce that they will close and liquidate 
North America Savings &amp; Loan, along with another Orange County institution, 
American Diversified Savings Bank, and distribute $1.3 billion to depositors. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1989: A federal grand jury in Los Angeles returns a 40-count 
racketeering indictment against McKinzie and five other former principals of 
the savings and loan, alleging they looted the institution of more than $16 
million.

JUDGE REJECTS 8 WITNESSES TO SPEED MCMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing concern about "the real possibility of a mistrial," the judge in the 
McMartin Pre-School molestation proceeding -- certain to become the longest 
criminal trial in U.S. history -- angrily eliminated eight prospective 
witnesses from the defense roster Tuesday and cautioned that the jurors appear 
to have lost interest and no longer even bother to take notes. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders, in blunt comments 
made while the jury was excused from his courtroom, said he was "desperately 
concerned" that there might not be enough jurors left to deliver a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The trial in the highly publicized case started two years ago with the 
painstaking selection of 12 jurors and six alternates. Four alternates since 
have been excused -- two for medical reasons, one because of career 
difficulties posed by the case's duration and a fourth who was deemed 
inattentive to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
If a minimum of 12 jurors cannot be maintained, the judge would be forced to 
declare a mistrial in a case that already has cost county taxpayers $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an obligation to see that it's a fair trial and that it gets to a jury 
that's still there," Pounders told defense attorneys as he eliminated the eight 
prospective witnesses. "I am desperately concerned that we are not going to 
have a jury to complete this case, the most illogical case that's ever gone to 
a jury." 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that several of the remaining jurors have asked him to call 
their irate employers because the proceedings have lasted far beyond the 
original estimate of one year. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said that at the present pace a verdict might not be reached before 
1990, even if he continues to eliminate all witnesses whose testimony he deems 
"frivolous and unnecessary." The defense, he said, has yet to call such 
critical witnesses as the two defendants, Raymond Buckey, and his mother, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, two former defendants and at least one physician to rebut 
medical evidence presented by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which so far has introduced testimony from 37 witnesses, has not 
made public a full roster of the witnesses it wants to call. 
</P>
<P>
When the defense concludes its case, a prosecution rebuttal will follow and 
take an estimated two months. After that, there is expected to be a month of 
defense rebuttal, followed by jury instructions and deliberations. A three-week 
vacation is scheduled for mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Goes Down With the Ship' 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he had just talked with fellow judges at a weekend conference 
about the need for them to take control of of their courtrooms, and then 
observed ruefully of his own trial: "I'm the captain and the ship is sinking, 
and the captain goes down with the ship." 
</P>
<P>
At another point, his voice raised and his face reddened with apparent anger: 
"I will not allow it to run into a situation where it has to be mistried. It 
should have been tried in much less time." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case lasted more than 14 months as it sought with a total of 
61 witnesses to prove 65 counts of molestation and conspiracy against the 
Buckeys. Nine children testified that they had been raped, sodomized or forced 
to have oral copulation, that they were photographed nude during "naked games" 
and that they were terrorized into silence by threats from Raymond Buckey, who 
allegedly made them watch as he mutilated and killed animals. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also called the alleged victims' parents, who testified about 
behavioral changes in their children; a physician who examined all of them and 
testified she found physical evidence of molestation in most; and videotaped 
interviews in which they first disclosed their nursery school experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-examination of several of the witnesses was lengthy. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has been putting on its case for nearly six months. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders directed his stern lecture to the defense attorneys. He warned that, 
because of time, the jurors might return a verdict based solely on "gut 
reaction," but that if they do not reach a quick decision and sift through the 
mountains of evidence instead, "it could well take them into 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you have the attention of the jury anymore," Pounders told the 
defense attorneys. " . . . It is boring. There are a lot of aspects that put me 
to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vigorously Denied' 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as the defense asked Pounders' approval of eight prospective 
witnesses: five parents, a woman who interviewed the alleged victims and two 
court administrators. The motions were "vigorously denied" by Pounders, who 
said he was angry and insulted by the continued waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis that he has grown 
weary of giving them warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used the scalpel," he said, referring to limits he has placed on the 
scope of certain testimony. "Now the ax." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will refuse to admit testimony from any witness he deems "not 
critical" and told the lawyers they do not have to present "every scrap of 
evidence. . . . At some point you exceed what is relevant and necessary. . . . 
We've covered all the bases." 
</P>
<P>
He said much of the testimony presented by the defense has been "collateral, 
cumulative and time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't start rattling sabers about constitutional rights," Pounders shouted at 
Davis at one point in the heated proceedings. "I know the law. I've studied it 
for two decades." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who represents Raymond Buckey, said he fears that "our presentations are 
going to be inhibited by the anger of the court." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Pounders tersely: "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Gits said he felt "like the guy that happened to be under the 
piano when it fell. The prosecution got to put on their case for 14 months. 
We've been responding to their case 5 1/2 months. We're on the receiving end of 
the scalpel." 
</P>
<P>
Gits said the complicated nature of the case has prolonged the defense, as the 
attorneys have attempted to anticipate and provide answers for all questions 
jurors might take into deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Lael Rubin said, "The stall-and-delay tactics by the defense are 
finally over. There is now a real end in sight to this case." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of next week, the McMartin trial will become the longest criminal 
trial in U.S. history, surpassing that of Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, who 
was convicted after a trial that consumed two years and two days.

SUPREME COURT ASKED TO VOID DECISION ON 'PORN ZONING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a pivotal test of "porn zoning" laws, the state Supreme Court was asked 
Tuesday to overturn a lower-court ruling that government officials contend 
severely inhibits cities from regulating the showing of sexually explicit 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, issued in 1981 by a state Court of Appeal, held that 
municipalities may bar adult theaters from a certain locale only when they show 
a "preponderance" of X-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the city of Long Beach told the justices that the ruling had 
made it virtually impossible to enforce zoning ordinances regulating adult 
theaters. If theater owners can show prohibited films 50% of the time and still 
evade an ordinance, such laws become meaningless, said Deputy City Prosecutor 
Gerry L. Ensley. 
</P>
<P>
"Porn zoning in California is dead under (the ruling)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ensley encountered a wave of skepticism from the justices when he 
urged the court to allow cities to act against theater owners for only a single 
showing of a sexually explicit movie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Posed 
</P>
<P>
Newly appointed Justice Joyce L. Kennard, sitting on the high court for the 
first time, asked the attorney how a single such showing could adversely affect 
a community. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of material, ipso facto, attracts crime, blight and juvenile 
delinquency," Ensley replied. "We're not banning such theaters, we're 
restricting their location. . . . People shudder and think of us as modern-day 
Puritans, but we're not." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fleishman of Los Angeles, attorney for the theater owners in the case, 
urged the court to uphold the 1981 ruling or, better yet, strike down 
porn-zoning itself as a violation of free speech under the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The city, Fleishman said, was trying to use zoning laws to close adult theaters 
they have been unable to ban under obscenity laws. "It's an end run -- an 
unconstitutional attempt to achieve indirectly what the city can't do 
directly," the attorney said. "The U.S. Supreme Court has approved 
(porn-zoning), but that doesn't mean you have to under the state Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
The justices, meeting in Los Angeles, heard arguments in a 12-year battle over 
a Long Beach ordinance that prohibits adult theaters within 1,000 feet of a 
public school or religious institution and within 500 feet of a residential 
area. A decision in the case is due by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called porn zoning concept was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 
landmark 1976 ruling. While adult theaters cannot be banned, their location can 
be restricted by cities -- either by concentrating them or dispersing them 
within the community -- so long as there are reasonable alternative sites, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, cities in California and elsewhere have had difficulty in 
drafting laws that meet court approval. And the courts themselves have been 
divided on key questions raised by such ordinances -- such as how many X-rated 
movies must be shown to constitute a prohibited adult theater. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1981 decision, the state Court of Appeal, ruling on a Covina ordinance, 
held that a theater must show a "preponderance" of sexually explicit films 
before it would be subject to municipal regulation as an adult theater. But the 
court did not say how "preponderance" was to be further defined. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, another Court of Appeal, ruling in an earlier case involving the Long 
Beach ordinance, refused to follow the 1981 ruling and held that the 
prohibition of a single showing of a sexually explicit film does not violate 
the First Amendment right of free speech. But later that year, the state 
Supreme Court barred that ruling from being applied as a binding precedent in 
other cases. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials then brought misdemeanor charges in an effort to enforce 
the city's porn-zoning ordinance on the Lakewood Theater, a movie house located 
near Long Beach City College that had been showing X-rated films on one screen 
in the theater and R-rated films on another screen. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack M. Newman blocked the city from 
prosecuting the theater owners, finding that X-rated films were not in 
predominant use as required by the 1981 appellate court ruling. The next year, 
another appellate court upheld the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's hearing, several justices raised the possibility of seeking middle 
ground in defining adult theaters that would enable cities to regulate movie 
houses that "customarily" or "ordinarily" show X-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
But Ensley replied that such a standard could be attacked as too vague and 
stood by his plea for the single-showing definition. If such an approach is 
found later to inhibit free speech, he said, "we can strike it down later." 
</P>
<P>
Several court members continued to press the attorney on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you saying that if a theater decides to show a sex movie once a year, on 
Halloween, that that is a blight on the neighborhood?" asked Justice Stanley 
Mosk. 
</P>
<P>
Ensley replied that he thought authorities would be unlikely to prosecute for 
single showings. But he said that any other standard would invite widespread 
violation of zoning laws.

TREATMENT OF RARE DISEASES FOUND BY PANEL TO BE ILLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years after passage of a pioneering law aimed at providing drugs for rare 
diseases, up to 20 million Americans still face often insurmountable obstacles 
in having their diseases diagnosed and treated, a federal commission reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is no longer a simple absence of drugs, the National Commission on 
Orphan Diseases found. Instead, medical care is hampered by uninformed 
physicians, a paucity of research and the unwillingness of some insurers to pay 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a mainstream medical disease, you are in big trouble today," 
said Andrea Hecht, a Los Angeles County woman with a rare condition called 
Cushing's syndrome. " . . . Every American should look at this (issue) as 
something that they have a stake in." 
</P>
<P>
The commission was formed by Congress in 1985 to examine the medical care of 
patients with rare diseases -- some 5,000 known conditions ranging from various 
cancers to Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis, each affecting fewer than 
200,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Among the commission's findings: 
</P>
<P>
* One in seven of the 801 patients with rare diseases surveyed by the 
commission said it took them six or more years to have their disease accurately 
diagnosed. Nearly a third of the patients surveyed said it took them between 
one and five years. 
</P>
<P>
* Nine percent of the patients had no health insurance; another 7% had 
inadequate insurance. Patients with rare diseases "are often uninsurable 
because third-party payers lack information about their disease or will not 
insure pre-existing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
* Insurers often refuse to cover the costs of experimental treatments -- 
sometimes the only available therapy for people with rare diseases. Or, they 
refuse to reimburse for marketed drugs and devices not approved specifically 
for use against rare conditions. 
</P>
<P>
* More than half of the $1.3 billion spent by the federal government on 
rare-disease research in fiscal 1987 was spent on about 200 rare forms of 
cancer, leaving just $640 million for the remaining 4,800 other rare diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's fear of a disease governs where biomedical research money is 
spent," said Abbey Meyers, a commission member and executive director of the 
National Organization for Rare Disorders. "The more the public fears a disease, 
the more funding it gets." 
</P>
<P>
The commission concluded: 
</P>
<P>
"Information of all kinds, for patients and their families, physicians, 
researchers, insurers, and the public is lacking or poorly disseminated. . . In 
short, the needs of patients with rare diseases are not being adequately met." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Hecht's case, as she recounted it to The Times, is a typical example. 
</P>
<P>
A 36-year-old president of a public relations firm in Sherman Oaks, Hecht first 
developed symptoms of her disease in 1976. Newly married and new to California, 
she began losing strength in her legs. Within months, she could not swing her 
legs out of a car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Takes Toll 
</P>
<P>
Her body temperature and blood pressure went out of whack. She gained 75 
pounds, her skin broke out, purple streaks appeared under her arms. Again and 
again, physicians failed to diagnose her problem. They gave her hormone shots, 
diuretics, creams for her skin. 
</P>
<P>
After two years, a doctor finally recognized Hecht's condition as Cushing's 
syndrome, which results from an excess of certain hormones secreted by the 
adrenal gland. The cause of the disease can be tumors of either the adrenal 
gland or the pituitary gland. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons removed Hecht's adrenal glands -- a treatment that stopped her 
symptoms but reduced her ability to fight infections. For the next nine years, 
Hecht resumed a relatively normal life -- until one day in 1987 she began 
losing peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was traced to a tumor on Hecht's pituitary gland; it was impinging 
on her optic nerve, Hecht says. The tumor, which was removed, turned out to 
have been the cause of Hecht's disease. The removal of her adrenal glands had 
been unnecessary, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"People believe that whatever goes wrong with their body, their local doctor is 
going to know what it is and know the latest treatment," said Hecht, who has 
since founded the National Cushing's Assn. "That is the biggest myth that the 
American public has been sold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommendations to Congress 
</P>
<P>
The federal commission's 54 recommendations to Congress include establishment 
of a federal office to oversee issues concerning rare diseases, increased 
research funding and efforts to ensure that insurance plans don't discriminate 
against people with rare diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the problems are unique to people with rare diseases," Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a sponsor of the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, said of the 
commission's findings. "But other problems, such as insurance, are not unique." 
</P>
<P>
The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for pharmaceutical companies to 
develop products to treat rare diseases. Waxman said the commission grew out of 
the realization that the difficulties of people with rare diseases extend 
beyond a lack of available drugs.

1,500 FLEE SATICOY CHEMICAL PLANT FIRE THAT INJURED 17 FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>

<P>
Firefighters Tuesday extinguished an industrial chemical fire in Saticoy near 
Ventura that had sent 1,500 residents fleeing to emergency shelters Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Ventura County firefighters were taken to local hospitals after 
exposure to unidentified poisonous gases at Pacific Intermediates, a company 
that has been frequently scrutinized for alleged hazardous materials 
violations, according to Fire Department officials. No injuries were reported 
among residents. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours after the fire started at 6 p.m. Monday, Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies rode through the streets of the agricultural settlement just 
east of Ventura, blaring their vehicle sirens and urging over public address 
systems that people evacuate the area. Residents, who reported an acrid smell 
in the air, were not permitted to return until about 5 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not yet determined a cause for the fire, which closed State 
Highway 118, destroyed two small businesses and burned part of an industrial 
park with flames that at times leaped 100 feet into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything burn like that," said Battalion Chief Bob Mumford, 
one of about 150 firefighters on the scene. "It glowed and swirled like a 
tornado, and went straight up." Fifteen of the firefighters seen by doctors 
were returned to duty at the fire scene. Reservist Jim Greer was kept for 
observation in Ventura County Medical Center and Capt. Sam Turner was taken to 
Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for treatment in a 
hyperbaric chamber to re-oxygenate his blood, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze was particularly difficult to control because 
many chemicals thought to be on the premises would "react violently" to water 
or synthetic fire-retardants. Companies from the city of Ventura and units from 
Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties soaked nearby structures and 
dug a deep ditch to trap toxic runoff from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Vacuum trucks from IT Corp. of Los Angeles on Tuesday scooped up thousands of 
gallons of the tainted runoff, which included the contents of ruptured chemical 
drums and the comparatively little water that had been sprayed inside, for 
transport to a hazardous-waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Intermediates, which mixes compounds for pharmaceutical companies, is 
"absolutely loaded with a tremendous variety and quantity of extremely 
hazardous materials," Battalion Chief Dick Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said a departmental investigation will try to determine whether the 
company has properly stored, maintained and kept track of its hazardous 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
The company's owner, Benjamin L. Adams of Newbury Park, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Intermediates has been under investigation by the Fire Department, the 
Ventura County Environmental Health Department and the Ventura County district 
attorney's office for alleged offenses involving toxics, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two county fire inspectors were injured at the plant last summer when a 
55-gallon drum "spontaneously vented," spraying the inspectors with a caustic 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has not been cooperative with inspectors," said Perry, noting that 
fire inspectors "are under court order not to enter without a warrant." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor also plans to scrutinize safety and training 
procedures at the company, said Donald C. Jackson, a Los Angeles-based 
compliance officer for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trooped to Shelter 
</P>
<P>
Among the temporarily displaced Saticoy residents, most spent the Monday night 
with friends or relatives, according to Red Cross spokeswoman Lenore Gabel, but 
more than 300 trooped to a shelter five miles away in Ventura's Buena High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of scary at first," said Joe DeLeon, 17. "We didn't know what was 
going on. The sirens were going and you could see kind of a glow in the sky. 
The first thing I thought about was my dogs -- will they make it?"

WOMEN'S HORSESHOE CHAMP GETS TRIP TO WHITE HOUSE

"Never in my wildest dreams did I picture myself as a guest of the President in 
the White House. Yet, there I was. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Diane (Buzz Saw) Lopez, 42, proudly showed off a photograph of herself with 
George Bush on the White House lawn. The President had his arm around her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just an average person with a job that doesn't pay very much, an inspector 
in a small factory," Lopez said. "Out of the clear blue, I'm back in Washington 
with President and Mrs. Bush. I petted Millie, their dog, and saw the new pups. 
I was at a barbecue at the White House with the First Family. All because of 
horseshoes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was horseshoes that brought the 5-foot-1, 125-pound Lopez to the White House 
from this small Central California town. The reigning women's world champion 
horseshoe pitcher, Lopez got her nickname because of the speed with which she 
tosses the iron shoes. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush is the biggest boon to horseshoes since Harry S. Truman. They are 
the only two Presidents to have horseshoe pits installed on the White House 
lawn. An avid pitcher, Bush formally unveiled his horseshoe pit earlier this 
month and invited the world's five best men players and the four best women to 
join him. That's how Diane Lopez happened to be invited to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Santa Barbara and graduate of Santa Barbara High School's class of 
1965, Lopez didn't start pitching horseshoes until six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in my family ever pitched horseshoes that I know of," recalled Lopez, a 
divorcee. "I pitched slow-pitch softball for 16 years. On Memorial Day weekend 
in 1983, I was with my softball coach, Brian Dunavan, and his wife, Debbie, and 
they introduced me to horseshoes. Brian told me to pitch the horseshoes the 
same way I pitch baseballs and I did and started making ringers right away." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez pitches her shoes in an unorthodox manner. She throws a backward 2 1/2 
flip, which means she throws the shoe underhand with her thumb down. Most 
players throw the shoes with their hand and thumb up with a 1 1/4 or 1 3/4 
flip. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after throwing her first shoe, Lopez won the 1985 California women's 
state championship in Stockton. She was state champion again in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Lopez entered her first world's championship tournament in 
Pleasanton, Calif., and placed first, winning $2,400 and a trophy. Jim Knisley 
of Bremen, Ohio, won $3,500 and a trophy as the men's world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was four days of really grueling competition. To win the world's 
championship I won 14 games and lost one in the finals," Lopez said. "The only 
game I lost was to 10-time world champion Vickie Winston of La Monte, Mo. She 
beat me 40 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Vickie pitched 34 straight ringers . . . at one point. We had 11 double dead 
ringers, that is each one of us pitched 22 ringers in a row with our ringers 
canceling each other's points." 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez did better in the overall tournament and won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she is the top woman professional in her sport, Lopez has won less 
than $5,000 in prize money. The state championship's top prize was only $300. 
In most states, the top players are awarded trophies, not money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much-Needed Boost' 
</P>
<P>
"No one earns a living pitching horseshoes," Lopez said. "We're all hoping the 
President's interest in the game will really give it a much-needed boost. I'd 
like nothing better than to devote my full time to pitching and making a living 
at it the way people do bowling, playing tennis, golf, baseball and other 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and the other eight top horseshoe pitchers invited to the White House 
paid half of their own air fare. The rest was paid by the National Horseshoe 
Pitchers Assn., which has 15,000 dues-paying members and high hopes that the 
President's interest will give the sport a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
Association President Dave Loucks, 51, editor and publisher of the group's 
monthly magazine, put Bush on the cover of his January issue. And when Loucks 
learned that the President was installing a horseshoe court on the White House 
lawn, he wrote offering technical assistance and thanking Bush for helping the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush wrote me a letter and in it said when the weather gets a little 
warmer he wanted to have me and a few others come pitch with him at the White 
House," recalled Loucks. Ten days before the dedication of the White House 
horseshoe pit, the President called Loucks and invited him and the nine top men 
and women professional players to be with him for the unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Biggest Asset' 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is the biggest asset to the sport imaginable," said Loucks. 
"Our long-range goal is to get sponsors to put a professional tour together 
with television coverage, to enable professional pitchers to derive an income 
from the sport which isn't possible now." 
</P>
<P>
The makers of horseshoe equipment are equally hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful what President Bush is doing for the sport of horseshoe 
pitching," said Nanette St. Pierre, 44, marketing director for St. Pierre 
Manufacturing Corp., of Worcester, Mass., the world's leading maker of 
horseshoe pitching gear. 
</P>
<P>
The company is gearing up for an anticipated surge in sales because of the 
attention focused on President Bush playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sport anybody can afford," St. Pierre insisted. "Our official back 
yard set that includes horseshoes and two solid steel stakes retails for under 
$20."

U.N. RAISES FLAG IN NAMIBIA; REBELS SLOW TO SEEK REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

OSHIKANGO, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers had just stepped down from their trucks in remote 
bushland on the Namibian border here Tuesday when they had their first run-in 
with South African troops -- over where to put up the blue-and-white U.N. flag. 
</P>
<P>
The South Africans had constructed a sturdy flagpole, next to their own flag, 
for the banner marking the opening of a U.N. assembly point for South-West 
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) rebels seeking refuge and safe passage 
back into Angola. 
</P>
<P>
But Australian army Sgt. Dave Sinai, of the U.N. contingent, was worried that 
the guerrillas would shy away if the U.N. flag were flying too close to the 
South African bunkers. So the U.N. flag was hoisted in the highest branches of 
a dead tree a short walk away. 
</P>
<P>
"The colonel was very upset that we didn't use his flagpole," Sgt. Sinai said 
with a shrug. 'But this whole thing is a trust game. And SWAPO may be afraid to 
come to us if we're too close to South African bases." 
</P>
<P>
Across northern Namibia on Tuesday, the United Nations opened nine gathering 
places like this one in a sandy clearing only 150 yards from the border with 
Angola. The U.N. goal is to restore peace in the territory and resurrect the 
Namibian independence process, which was jeopardized as it began April 1 when 
hundreds of SWAPO insurgents crossed into Namibia. That invasion touched off 10 
days of fighting and a death toll of more than 250 rebels and 27 members of 
South African-led security forces. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the fighting had ended, and roads that carried fast-moving military 
convoys only a few days ago were mostly quiet. Both SWAPO President Sam Nujoma 
and representatives of South Africa, Angola and Cuba, architects of the 
Namibian peace plan, had called for an end to the warfare and the return of 
SWAPO fighters to their bases in Angola. They will be allowed into Namibia 
legally, without their weapons, in mid-May under Namibia's U.N.-monitored 
independence plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One Reports In 
</P>
<P>
In the first hours of the informal truce Tuesday, not one SWAPO insurgent had 
reported to the U.N. assembly points, a U.N. spokesman said. It may be several 
days before the rebels begin to report to the U.N. troops, and many may also 
return to Angola on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as they see white faces around, they will be suspicious and hesitant," 
said Oole Eriksson, a Lutheran missionary in Oniipa. "People might turn around 
and say, 'This is a trap by South Africa.' They will watch and find out if it's 
really safe." 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is broadcasting appeals to the rebels in local languages, 
but SWAPO spokesmen have said their soldiers remain confused about the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are giving them the opportunity. That's all we can do," said Sgt. Sinai at 
the new U.N. post in Oshikango, about 360 miles north of the capital, Windhoek. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which will control this territory until the U.N.-supervised 
November elections, has said it wants to verify the SWAPO departure and make 
sure that the rebels do not leave arms caches behind. Pretoria says there will 
be no cease-fire in Namibia, and no return to bases for its troops, until it is 
satisfied that the insurgents are confined to bases about 150 miles inside 
Angola, as called for under the transition plan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. assembly point here consists of a green tent and a long table with 
three chairs made of stacked sandbags. A beacon light, perched on a small 
tower, will mark the spot at night, when the U.N. flag is not visible. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them blundering into your position late at night," Sinai told 
one South African officer. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. J. J. Hougaard, commander of South African troops in northern Namibia, 
said his orders are to leave SWAPO alone around the U.N. assembly points. 
</P>
<P>
"If we find SWAPO tracks going north (toward Angola) or within (three miles) of 
any monitoring point, our orders are to leave them alone," Hougaard said. "If 
we find tracks going south, we are to approach the SWAPO elements, speak to 
them and try to convince them to go back." He said his troops, and Namibian 
forces led by his men, would fire only if fired on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
S. African Troops Reduced 
</P>
<P>
The South African Defense Force has reduced its troop strength around the U.N. 
monitoring posts in the war zone, Hougaard said. About 45 South African 
soldiers are stationed near Oshikango's monitoring post. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. base here, which will remain open up to a week, is manned by five 
Australian soldiers, five British soldiers and five Pakistani monitors, all 
wearing U.N. blue berets. They were sitting in the shade Tuesday, cleaning 
their American-made M-16 rifles and writing letters home. 
</P>
<P>
If SWAPO members surrender themselves here, they will be allowed to rest for an 
hour or so and then be escorted past South African troops and barbed-wire 
checkpoints across the border, where they will be met by Angolan troops. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. assembly points were set up primarily along a 200-mile stretch of the 
border east and west of here, where most of the heavy fighting occurred. Delays 
in the arrival of U.N. troops have left the U.N. Transition Assistance Group 
undermanned. Only about a fourth of the 4,650 U.N. troops are already in 
Namibia, and many of them have been rushed to the border to work at the 
assembly points. 
</P>
<P>
The Australians in Oshikango, for example, were brought to Namibia as 
engineers. But they were pressed into service as infantrymen because of the 
manpower shortage. 
</P>
<P>
After their early disagreement over the flag, relations between the newly 
arrived U.N. troops and the veteran South Africans improved through the 
afternoon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we'll have any problems with them," Hougaard, the South 
African commander, said. "We are soldiers. They are soldiers. We have our 
orders. They have theirs." 
</P>
<P>
But their missions here in the Namibian bush still set them apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going home soon, sir?" Sinai, the U.N. sergeant, asked a South African 
lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
"Not for a long time," the lieutenant replied.

Firebombs damaged two bookstores in attacks that may be connected with the 
controversy over Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," Scotland Yard 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Scotland Yard spokesman said police discovered a fire and a broken window at 
Dillon's University Bookshop in London's West End late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire began at Collett's Bookshop on Charing Cross Road about one minute 
later, shortly after a witness saw two men in the shop doorway. 
</P>
<P>
"The shop is very badly damaged . . . ," said Monica Wanninger, store manager 
of Collett's, which sells exclusively the books of Rushdie's publisher, Viking 
Penguin. "We'll be shut for six to eight weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary leader, said Feb. 14 that he should be killed 
because his novel has blasphemed the Prophet Mohammed.

SOVIETS, IN MAJOR REFORM OF LEGAL CODE, SOFTEN RULES ON POLITICAL CRIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union, in a major reform of its legal system, put into force Tuesday 
new legislation that more narrowly defines political crimes, requires fuller 
proof for conviction and provides for lighter sentences for those found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet legal authorities described the move, part of the broad political 
liberalization here under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as an important step 
toward allowing greater political pluralism and even as protecting the right of 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
As an amendment to the country's criminal code, the new legislation replaces a 
previous statute that outlawed, with little definition, "anti-Soviet agitation 
and propaganda" and defamation of the Soviet state or political system. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it specifically prohibits public appeals for undermining or 
overthrowing the Soviet state and political system or for the commission of 
terrorism, treason or subversion -- and any actions aimed at arousing racial or 
inter-ethnic hostility. 
</P>
<P>
In a further attempt to strengthen civil rights here, the legislation also 
requires proof of public actions and premeditation for conviction under this 
part of the criminal code, legal authorities said. Punishment is now set at 
three to 10 years' imprisonment, with the possibility of a fine instead, 
depending on the severity of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of political dissidents were jailed and sent into internal exile for 
up to 15 years under the old law; the last 40 or so were freed and allowed to 
return from internal exile at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The old law was itself a reform of a previous decree by dictator Josef Stalin 
under which thousands of people were arrested, summarily convicted of 
anti-state activities or propaganda and then executed in the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my deep conviction that all (of the provisions of the new legislation) 
are more democratic and, I would say, more clearly and coherently worded than 
in previous laws," Vladimir N. Kudryavtsev, director of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences' Institute of the State and Law, said in an interview published by the 
Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Letter of the Law' 
</P>
<P>
"This is very important for preventing ambiguities or any broad interpretations 
or vagueness, because every letter of the law means a man's fate and any 
imprecise wording is unacceptable here." 
</P>
<P>
But the legislation also prohibits, in a very broadly worded section, "public 
insults or the discrediting" of the Soviet government, its various bodies and 
its elected and appointed officials as well as "public organizations," such as 
the Communist Party, that operate under the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
This could be used, some political activists fear, to restrict the increasingly 
free public give and take on a broad range of issues where Soviet officials, if 
not government institutions as well, often come in for harsh criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Those convicted of violations under this section can be jailed for up to three 
years or fined the equivalent of $3,200, which is about eight months' pay for 
an average worker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pure Stalinism' 
</P>
<P>
"This is Stalinism, pure Stalinism," Arvydas Juozaitis, a member of the 
Lithuanian Reform Movement, known as Sajudis, commented in Vilnius, Lithuania's 
capital. "There is no conceptual difference between the new decree, the old one 
and the one that Stalin used." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Podrabinek, a former political prisoner who edits Express-Khronika, 
an underground newspaper, said the law seems intended to control all political 
debate. "Any criticism or disagreement can be considered as an attempt to 
discredit the government or insult one of its officials," he said. "So what 
will matter most of all is the way this law is implemented. The implementation 
will really show what their intention is." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of prolonged political and legal debate as well as discussions with 
Western countries pressing Moscow for a greater commitment to honoring human 
rights, the legislation was adopted as a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme 
Soviet, the country's Parliament, on Saturday and went into effect with its 
publication Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the law contains specific provisions to curb ethnic violence, such as 
that in the southern Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and now Georgia, 
officials stressed that its adoption over the weekend as demonstrations reached 
a peak in Georgia was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes have been a long time in coming," Yuri Reshetov, chief of the 
Soviet Foreign Ministry's human rights division, said. "They are a new 
manifestation of the democratization and humanization of our legal system, and 
they bring it into closer conformity with international practice." 
</P>
<P>
Kudryavtsev, one of the country's most prominent reformers, said that he 
expects the new Supreme Soviet to amend the law further when it reviews the 
legislation, probably later this year or early next.

IN SIGN OF BUDGET CRUNCH, SOVIETS WILL SHUT SPACE LAB 
</P>

The Soviet Union's three-year-old orbiting space station Mir will be evacuated 
at the end of this month and mothballed, Soviet authorities disclosed Tuesday 
amid indications that the Kremlin is sharply scaling back its ambitious space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Mission control has ordered the three cosmonauts aboard Mir to begin shutting 
down and putting into protective wrappings the station's scientific, flight and 
control systems, according to the official Tass news agency. In addition, the 
scheduled April 19 launch of a three-man replacement crew has been canceled. 
Space officials were saying as recently as a month ago that the mission would 
proceed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"New tasks will be found for the Mir," Radio Moscow said late Tuesday, implying 
in its announcement that the space station will remain unmanned for some time, 
although it was designed and placed in orbit as the centerpiece of the Soviet 
manned space program. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to enlarge Mir with two new modules -- one small factory for growing 
crystals in conditions of zero gravity and the other adding more scientific 
equipment to the space laboratory -- have also been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
These actions, so far not officially explained, may reflect the Kremlin's 
determination to reduce its huge budget deficit, estimated at $160 billion this 
year, as well as a rising popular demand that the space program be cut so that 
more money and resources can be allocated to meeting consumer needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tackling more problems in the Soviet Union, but it is equally true that 
we are not used to counting our expenses," a science commentator in the 
government newspaper Izvestia wrote recently. "There is actually no system yet 
that would enable a quick transfer of space achievements to our economy on a 
commercial basis." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. space experts, the Soviet Union spends more than $30 billion 
a year on its combined military-civilian space program. 
</P>
<P>
During parliamentary elections last month, the once-prestigious Soviet space 
program ranked close to the government's bloated bureaucracy and its massive 
military spending as the most frequent targets for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying we should abandon space research -- just stretch it out," said 
Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist who won 89% of the vote in Moscow for a 
seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies. Explaining what he felt could be 
cut to improve the availability of consumer goods, he added, "Mars, Venus, the 
stars will be there 10 years from (now), just as they are today." 
</P>
<P>
Another critical element, however, may be the failure of two Soviet probes 
launched toward Mars last July with the goal of landing on the Martian moon 
Phobos. The first was lost in October due to a ground controller's error, and 
radio contact was lost with the second in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Those setbacks have brought into the open a serious debate among Soviet 
scientists over the course the space program should take, and the Soviet press 
has suddenly been filled with critiques of the program from half a dozen points 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
"Some time is needed to assess the results of the Mir program, to measure them 
against our goals and decide how to proceed, and we do not need to keep men in 
space for that," one well-informed Soviet official commented. "But there 
already is agreement that we do not need to keep Mir manned all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The manned space program has been strongly criticized within the Soviet Academy 
of Sciences as expensive and less and less useful scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
But manned missions have also had strong supporters, not only in the scientific 
community but also in the Soviet military.

NORTH CLAIMS HE IS BEING UNFAIRLY PROSECUTED;

Oliver L. North, with his defense that he was merely a political pawn under 
intense attack, declared in federal court Tuesday that he had been singled out 
unfairly for prosecution and told his chief accuser, prosecutor John W. Keker: 
"You know it." 
</P>
<P>
Bristling under Keker's caustic cross-examination about false statements he had 
made to Congress, the retired lieutenant colonel said that he had been involved 
in "political warfare" between the White House and Congress for which he was 
ill-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
He exclaimed that candor has never been the rule in such exchanges between the 
White House and Congress and that "nobody else has ever been prosecuted" for 
sending a misleading letter to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the trial of the former White House aide has been dominated by dry 
recitations of events and citations of documents by persons who worked with 
North, the fired National Security Council aide and a central figure in the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggestions Shake North 
</P>
<P>
But Keker, like North a former Marine who served in Vietnam, Tuesday pushed up 
the emotional temperature of the proceedings, shaking the defendant's stolid 
bearing with suggestions that he had betrayed the principles of his military 
education and lined his own pocket with money that had been collected for the 
Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
North's anger began to swell as Keker pressed him on his experience at the U.S. 
Naval Academy, where North had proudly told jurors that he had been educated. 
</P>
<P>
"At the U.S. Naval Academy, you would be kicked out for this, wouldn't you?" 
Keker asked, referring to North's admissions that he had sent "factually 
incorrect" letters to congressmen about his secret efforts to support the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"At the Naval Academy," North retorted hotly, "no one taught me how to run a 
covert operation. I was trying my ever-loving best to get it done. And nobody 
in the U.S. Naval Academy teaches you about internecine political warfare." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that then-National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane had asked him 
to write the misleading letters. "I did not consider the fact that any letter 
from a Cabinet officer to a congressman could possibly be unlawful," North said 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Then, glaring at Keker with his voice rising, he added: "Nobody else has ever 
been prosecuted for it, and you know it." 
</P>
<P>
"How about McFarlane?" Keker replied calmly. 
</P>
<P>
"He pleaded guilty," North said. 
</P>
<P>
"And Admiral Poindexter is being prosecuted, isn't he?" Keker asked, referring 
to former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, whose separate trial in 
the Iran-Contra scandal is scheduled to follow North's. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first two that I know about," North said. 
</P>
<P>
North reiterated that he had only reluctantly drafted false and misleading 
answers for McFarlane to send congressmen who were asking about his activities. 
He said he had argued that McFarlane should provide no information at all and 
should cite then-President Ronald Reagan's right to withhold answers on grounds 
of executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
But North, for the first time Tuesday, contended that his draft answers were 
not original. He said that McFarlane had told him what to say. 
</P>
<P>
North has claimed that McFarlane and William J. Casey, the late CIA director, 
both authorized his efforts to help raise private funds for the Contras and to 
help resupply them with weapons purchased abroad at a time when Congress had 
prohibited U.S. military aid for the rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked About Moral Qualms 
</P>
<P>
The two officials told him also that former President Reagan did not want to 
share information with Congress about private fund-raising for the Contras, he 
has testified. 
</P>
<P>
In taking North line by line through a written draft of one of his letters to 
Congress, Keker asked at one point: "Did you have any moral qualms about being 
mixed up in this? Did any moral bells go off in your head?" 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be proper to use the word 'moral,' " North said, then used the 
question to explain why he had worked so hard for the Nicaraguan rebels after 
Congress had banned military aid for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was extraordinarily immoral for the United States to put forces 
in the field, to equip them . . . and then to leave them in the lurch. I 
thought it was heinous." 
</P>
<P>
When North repeated that McFarlane knew all about his activities but still told 
him to draft responses to Congress, Keker asked: "Did he tell you he wanted the 
answer to be a lie?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall his using those words," North said with some irritation. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he say he wanted the answer not to be truthful?" Keker continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall those words," North said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell interposed his own question: 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever in your mind consider not doing it, just saying: 'No, I won't do 
it?' " 
</P>
<P>
"No, I did not," North replied.

Prosecutor John W. Keker added some humor Tuesday to the tense proceedings at 
the Oliver L. North trial when asking North about a code word that he and 
associate Richard V. Secord used for their CIA contacts. 
</P>
<P>
North conceded that the word was "fools." 
</P>
<P>
"But I certainly didn't think that about the director (the late William J. 
Casey)," North added quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the rest of the CIA?" Keker asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there probably are some people there that fit the category," the 
defendant replied. 
</P>
<P>
Keker asked if there was another code word and handed North a document obtained 
from his files. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a profanity I would not choose to use in the presence of ladies," North 
said, bowing his head in a courtly manner. "It was male language used among 
friends. If you want to use it in this courtroom, you may, Mr. Keker." 
</P>
<P>
"Does it start with an 'a' "? Keker asked with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," said North. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that describe what you thought of them?" Keker continued. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, yes," the retired Marine replied.

NEGOTIATORS NEAR AGREEMENT ON BUDGET

Congressional and White House negotiators neared agreement Tuesday night on a 
preliminary budget plan that would narrow the deficit by about $27 billion, 
sources said, with President Bush accepting about $4 billion less than he had 
proposed for defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
In the tentative accord, expected to be announced as early as today, Democrats 
have agreed to pursue more than $10 billion in domestic spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement would set the broad outlines of spending priorities for the 1990 
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and improves the chances that Congress will 
avoid an impasse with the White House over the budget. But such a plan must 
still clear a number of hurdles and does not address many specifics of programs 
that are subject to future legislative wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grab Bag of Tax Changes 
</P>
<P>
Previously, budget negotiators had agreed to raise about $14 billion from a 
variety of revenue measures, including a grab bag of tax changes worth about 
$5.6 billion to go along with additional user fees and sales of government 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, led by Richard G. Darman, director of the White House 
Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 
demanded that any tax changes approved by Congress be limited to relatively 
minor loophole closings so that Bush's "no new taxes" campaign pledge would not 
be violated. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, congressional aides said, Administration officials dropped 
their insistence that lawmakers accept the White House contention that its 
capital gains tax cut proposal would raise $5 billion next year. But the 
Administration told lawmakers that Bush would continue to pursue his plan to 
limit capital gains to a maximum of 15%, less than half the current top rate. 
</P>
<P>
The military, according to both Administration and Capitol Hill sources, would 
receive authority to spend about $305 billion, a $4 billion cut from the $309 
billion Bush said was necessary just to keep up with inflation. Bush met with 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney Tuesday to discuss the new limits on Pentagon 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), the top-ranking Republican on the House Budget 
Committee, said that negotiators are hoping to reach agreement soon on the 
overall plan. He suggested that only minor stumbling blocks remain. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said that negotiators are 
working on a number of "loose ends" and are consulting with other congressional 
leaders about the outlines of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
On the domestic side of the budget, negotiators had agreed earlier to extract 
about $2.7 billion in savings by holding down spending on the Medicare program 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Bush originally had sought almost $5 billion in Medicare cuts. Democrats wanted 
to limit the budget savings to about $2 billion, which would have meant almost 
no changes in the way the government currently pays hospitals and doctors. 
Lawmakers also refused to accept a Bush proposal to require state and local 
government employees to pay Medicare taxes, congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, while couched in general terms, also calls for making cuts in farm 
support payments and other government benefits programs. 
</P>
<P>
But even after reaching the tentative agreement, the spending blueprint 
ultimately could fail to meet the $110-billion deficit ceiling that the 
Gramm-Rudman budget law requires if interest rates do not fall from current 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
That means lawmakers may be forced to seek additional savings during the summer 
and early fall to escape the automatic spending cuts that Gramm-Rudman would 
impose if Congress does not adopt a budget by Oct. 1 that meets the 
$110-billion target. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative budget plan, the Pentagon would fail to keep pace with 
inflation for the fifth year in a row, losing almost 2% of the substantial real 
spending increases it achieved from 1980 through 1986.

OPPOSITION MOUNTING TO CIVIL RIGHTS CHOICE; 
</P>
<P>
LUCAS' SELECTION BY THORNBURGH AS CHIEF ENFORCER IS VOTED DOWN BY HOMETOWN 
CHAPTER OF NAACP

<P>
William Lucas, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's choice to be the nation's top civil 
rights enforcer, is being opposed by his hometown chapter of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People -- signaling possible trouble for his 
controversial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Tillery, executive secretary of the Detroit chapter, said Tuesday that 
its board voted, 68 to 2, Monday night to oppose Lucas, a black, citing concern 
over his "competence" and sensitivity to civil rights. Tillery said that the 
appointment of Lucas as assistant attorney general and head of the Justice 
Department's civil rights division represents too great "a risk" after eight 
years of Ronald Reagan Administration cutbacks on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
A history professor at Wayne State University, Tillery said that the Detroit 
board expressed its view in response to a request from the NAACP's national 
office in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin L. Hooks, NAACP executive director, said that he was "not in a 
position" to say whether the national organization would follow suit, but that 
a decision could come today. 
</P>
<P>
Althea T. L. Simmons, chief Washington lobbyist for the civil rights 
organization, said that Lucas' "background does not fit the job. It fits law 
enforcement, and that's a different kettle of fish." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh was speaking in Pittsburgh Tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment but he has not wavered in his support for Lucas, contending that the 
opposition is largely "partisan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gubernatorial Candidate 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 61, is a former sheriff and county executive of Wayne County, Mich. He 
ran unsuccessfully in 1986 as the Republican candidate for governor of 
Michigan. He switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Burstion-Wade, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the Detroit 
chapter's action was "a disappointment, but it doesn't change anything." She 
said that Lucas' nomination is expected to be made formally by President Bush 
"in a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official said that the NAACP opposition did not come as a 
surprise because of what he said was the organization's liberal Democratic 
leanings. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has come under fire for inflated job descriptions that have appeared on 
some of his resumes. He also has been criticized in a jail overcrowding case 
and for his acceptance, while sheriff, of free air transportation and a Las 
Vegas hotel room in the mid-1970s from a Detroit man indicted but not convicted 
on federal gambling conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will review the nomination, 
said that the opposition by the Detroit NAACP chapter "to the extent that it 
represents broad opposition in the black community in Detroit would be 
troubling." A similar move by the national office "would have a strong adverse 
effect," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Another committee staff source said that the panel "will begin its 
investigation when it gets the nomination," indicating that members have not 
yet focused on Lucas' selection, beyond reading press accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who would not talk to a reporter directly, said through Burstion-Wade 
that he had not been invited to the Detroit chapter's board meeting but that he 
would have appeared if asked. He is a longtime NAACP member. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had discussions with Mr. Lucas," Tillery said. "He has a lot of friends 
in the NAACP but there was not sentiment (expressed at the meeting) in favor of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Tillery said that there was the feeling at the meeting that Lucas would not 
have been opposed for other Administration jobs.

By 7 a.m. Tuesday, the Wileys, mother and daughter, and their neighbors, also a 
mother and daughter, were prepared for a special occasion. 
</P>
<P>
They sat in a row behind a folding table in their room at the Elegant Manor 
Social Center, a half-timbered mansion on West Adams Boulevard available for 
weddings and dances. Hot coffee, peanuts and corn chips had been set out. An 
American flag hung outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
The four women were giving an election. But none of the guests had appeared. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nothing else to do," said Gwen Wiley (the daughter). "So we said, 'We 
might as well vote.' " 
</P>
<P>
Five hours later, only 32 more of the precinct's 300 voters had come by. Wiley 
looked at her mother Ruth's watch and yawned. 
</P>
<P>
"High noon," she said. "Eight more hours to go." 
</P>
<P>
Across the city, the scene was similarly quiet in the school auditoriums and 
auto dealerships, churches and synagogues, fraternity houses, garages and sun 
porches that become polling places on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Few Los Angeles residents were lured by the opportunity to vote for mayor, city 
attorney and representatives for City Council, school and community college 
boards or to decide on six ballot propositions. By 7 p.m., only 18.3% of the 
voters in a city clerk's sampling of 75 precincts had cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Precinct judges and inspectors said municipal elections always have lighter 
turnouts than elections with federal and state races on the ballot. But even 
taking that into account, the showing was skimpy. 
</P>
<P>
Some election workers blamed the mist and drizzle, others the lack of 
excitement in the various contests. 
</P>
<P>
Precinct judge Barbara Grunner blamed the candidates themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their fault," she said as she sat in front of a gold 1934 Oldsmobile at a 
Mission Hills car showroom and watched four empty cardboard polling booths. 
"They didn't have debates. A lot of issues could have been brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the precinct workers decided not to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in this," said Melanie Mullins, a 26-year-old precinct 
judge at Charles Maclay Junior High School in Pacoima. "I'm just not." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the voters who did arrive at the polls said they came to show their 
reverence for the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harris, for example, pulled his right ear forward to reveal a small, thin 
scar. 
</P>
<P>
"I came because of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Nashville, Tenn., policeman's club inflicted the scar in 1963 when Harris was 
registering blacks to vote, he said. As soon as Harris was old enough to vote 
in 1964, he did so. He is 47 now, and "I haven't missed one since," he said 
outside the Mid-Wilshire wedding chapel that served as his precinct Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Cook, a retired city street maintenance worker, likewise votes every 
time he is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's my duty as a citizen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He tries to be first at his Pacoima precinct every year. This time, he was 
late: No. 6. But as in the past, he saved his stub to carry with him for a 
while and then add to the collection in his dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
Cora Lee Johnson votes out of habit. When she lived in Kansas City decades ago, 
she learned to cast a ballot each election "because if you didn't vote, they'd 
vote your name for you." She can remember people approaching the polls there 
and forgetting who they were supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, it was discontent that drew voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of Tom Bradley and all of his friends," said Lindy Willingham, a 
Sherman Oaks free-lance paralegal. ". . . I think that the city's going to pot. 
The other issues are no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
She said she voted for former county Supervisor Baxter Ward for mayor over 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Zajac, who voted near the Westside Pavilion in Rancho Park, said she 
wanted Laura Lake to replace Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. Lake had attacked 
Yaroslavsky for letting the shopping center and other developments be built in 
his 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Zev's a little burned out," Zajac said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the loyalists were out. Jim Burley, who voted at Elegant Manor, said he 
remembers when Bradley was a police officer on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been knowing him a long time," Burley, 59, said. "It's true he hasn't 
done much for his people, but we don't want Nate Holden. He was up north (in 
Sacramento as a state senator) for years, and he didn't do nothing either." 
</P>
<P>
Mix-ups made the day more exciting at about half a dozen precincts that opened 
late, said Joseph Giles, who heads the city clerk's election division. At a 
Hollywood elementary school, voters said about 45 people were turned away 
because the precinct inspector was home sick. After angry residents called City 
Hall to complain, the site opened at 11 a.m. Another precinct in a private home 
was late opening because the owner was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
At one polling place, in a Tarzana garage, election workers were elated when 
more than 30% of their voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a very civic-minded area," said Manny Bernstein, who 
owns the precinct site, "except when it comes to volunteering your garage for 
the vote. Nobody else would do it." 
</P>
<P>
But at most of the 2,730 polling stations, the day was unrelievedly dull. 
</P>
<P>
At the Riddick Youth Center in Rancho Park, precinct workers ate oatmeal 
cookies baked by a precinct judge's wife. At Tete A Tete Hair &amp; Nails in 
Sherman Oaks, the refreshments were pastries and coffee, and the entertainment 
was provided by precinct judge Lloyd Zimmer's two children, who visited along 
with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Richards at Maclay came prepared with three mystery novels, a jug of 
water and a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have plenty of time to do whatever we want," she said. "Shop, knit, 
crochet, give birth to a baby. It's a fun day." 
</P>
<P>
Della R. Avila, a precinct judge in her home near USC, was not so sanguine. 
Only the day before, she had received a certificate from the county 
registrar-recorder's office for her 30 years of election work. When the polls 
closed at 8 p.m., only 31 people in her precinct -- out of 880 registered -- 
had voted. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a minute to count the votes," she said. "We even double-checked." 
</P>

SURVEY SEES CHILD-CARE CRISIS BREWING IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 40% of the nation's working parents, rich and poor alike, are so 
dissatisfied with child care that the situation has become a "national crisis," 
according to a poll released Tuesday by Louis Harris &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The survey results -- telecast by satellite from New York to five cities around 
the country, including Los Angeles and Mission Viejo, also revealed that single 
and black parents are paying more for child care than white married couples. 
</P>
<P>
The poll showed broad national backing for federal support of day-care 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an area where people wake up every day, 19% of the population, and 
say, 'What will I do with my kid today?' " Harris said during the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Credits 
</P>
<P>
If there is no action soon from Congress enacting new tax credits for child 
care, "I tell you all hell will break loose," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's reached crisis proportions," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' firm from Dec. 22 to Feb. 8 questioned 4,050 adults on national 
policies toward child care and also asked a sample of those, 2,009 adults with 
a child under the age of 6, to describe their experience with child care. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that although 53% of those surveyed thought the child-care 
system was working "somewhat well," 38% said it was working "not very well" or 
"not well at all." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the negative numbers indicate that parents are putting up with 
a "just tolerable" situation. 
</P>
<P>
In comments on his survey during the telecast, Harris described those surveyed 
as having "a deep, deep unease over the plight of children generally" and said 
they worry that "most children in the United States today are short-changed." 
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents believed that the overall quality of life for children has 
deteriorated. Sixty-three percent said children are "objects of neglect," and 
65% said children were worse off today than when they were growing up. Only 
"the poor" and "the elderly" were ranked more neglected than children. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the poll showed that 47% of those surveyed believed that 
most children had loving parents, 44% believed that they received medical 
treatment when needed and 42% believed the statement that most children "are 
basically happy." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also looked at typical costs of child care, reporting the mean cost 
for all those surveyed as $190 a month or $2,280 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris discovered an irony: "Many of those who can least afford to pay, in 
fact, are paying almost as much as the very wealthiest families do for child 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Single mothers pay $211 a month and black parents pay $258, but business 
executives pay $244, professionals pay $226 and married couples pay only $185, 
according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the disparity, the survey noted: "Parents pay what they have to in 
order to get proper care -- if they can find it. . . . However, even when 
parents pay high sums for child care, there is no guarantee they will receive 
high quality or real value for their money." 
</P>
<P>
Added Harris, when asked to explain why blacks were among those groups paying 
top dollar for child care, "It's very difficult for them to find child care, 
and they've got to pay through the nose. It's an old, old story in this country 
-- you gotta pay more to be poor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Ideas 
</P>
<P>
Parents of all income levels had strong ideas of what they wanted in a day care 
center. Ninety-seven percent cited as a key concern "the quality of people 
running the center." But in answer to a national policy question, Harris noted 
that nine in 10 of those surveyed agreed that better day-care workers must be 
attracted "by higher pay, not paid the level of a parking attendant, as today." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also asked all its respondents to consider President Bush's 
child-care program -- a tax credit of up to $1,000 a year for low-income 
parents -- as well as the Democratic alternative of providing funds to low- and 
middle-income parents for child care and setting uniform federal standards for 
providers. According to the Harris survey, those polled favored both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was commissioned by Philip Morris Cos. of New York.

GUARD SURRENDERS IN CASE TIED TO DRUG MONEY PLOT

<P>
A former security guard for a Westlake Village stock brokerage firm surrendered 
Tuesday to federal authorities, who allege that he helped launder $300,000 from 
undercover agents who had described the money as coming from Colombian cocaine 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles -- portrayed by FBI agents as a "bag man" in a 
money-laundering operation allegedly orchestrated by prominent San Diego 
businessman Richard T. Silberman -- surrendered at U.S. District Court, 
accompanied by Los Angeles attorney Robert L. Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee allowed Nakatsuka to remain free on a 
$200,000 personal surety bond co-signed by his father and secured by a family 
home in Los Angeles. Nakatsuka was directed to return to court for a 
preliminary hearing April 21. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Nakatsuka said he was "surprised" when friends called him 
Friday night and told him he was being sought by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the office on Friday when I heard," said Nakatsuka. "I didn't know 
what to think . . . I really don't know anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka, who described himself as director of security for Hamilton-Williams 
and Co. brokerage firm in Westlake Village, said he was acquainted with Jack 
Norman Myers, who is among four individuals charged in the alleged 
money-laundering scheme and was still at large late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Nakatsuka declined to comment on his ties to Silberman and the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Silberman -- a leading fund raiser for statewide and local 
Democratic candidates and a close adviser to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- 
resigned Tuesday as director and officer of Yuba Natural Resources Inc., a 
mining company with holdings in Northern California. Also, the company's board 
of directors formed a special committee to investigate Yuba's involvement in 
the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 59, was arrested Friday at a San Diego hotel while allegedly 
negotiating to launder $1.1 million in funds an undercover agent told him were 
proceeds from Colombian cocaine sales. His arrest capped a 2 1/2-year 
investigation by FBI agents who stumbled upon Silberman while trailing reputed 
organized crime figure Chris Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 62, was also arrested Friday. Both he and Silberman -- who is married to 
San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- face money laundering charges as 
well as charges of violating laws requiring all transactions involving sums 
exceeding $10,000 be reported to the federal government. They face a maximum of 
20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A federal affidavit released Monday said Silberman conducted two transactions 
with the FBI agent, in November and February, involving a total of $300,000 in 
federal money. Prosecutors say wiretapped telephone conversations between 
Silberman and the agent make it clear that Silberman believed the money came 
from Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, a person need not be laundering actual drug money to be 
convicted. Prosecutors say that Silberman needed only to believe its source was 
narcotics trafficking to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit spells out in intriguing detail the alleged laundering scheme, 
which Silberman says in taped conversations that he plotted to have "some 
diversification." Silberman stood to earn a commission of between 6% and 12% on 
the two transactions. 
</P>
<P>
In meetings with the agent, Silberman repeatedly boasted that he had laundered 
money numerous times before, saying, "This is not my first go around. I've been 
here before." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence against the powerful political fund raiser, a La Jolla resident whose 
wealth was once estimated at $25 million, ranges from extensive transcripts of 
wiretapped telephone conversations to videotapes of the cash transactions. 
</P>
<P>
A broker at the Westlake Village office of Hamilton-Williams -- which in March 
became a branch of Adams Securities -- said Nakatsuka worked as a security 
guard at the company's offices on Triunfo Canyon Road but quit last week. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ziegler -- another Hamilton-Williams employee alleged to have played a 
role in the operation -- was a "part-time analyst" for the company until he 
quit last week, said the broker, who declined to give his name. Ziegler has not 
been charged. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says Ziegler invested $200,000 Silberman obtained from the 
undercover agent in zero coupon bonds. Asked to comment on the allegations, the 
broker said, "Nothing went through this firm." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman said Myers was negotiating for his surrender.

PADRE CATCHER PARENT FINDS IT'S HIS TURN TO SUPPORT OLD FRIEND

<P>
The old lady and the kid. That's what they were to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parent was a runny-nosed 17-year-old baseball player who never should have 
left his high school coach, or his mother. Rhoda Polley was a retired legal 
secretary who had agreed to join the Padre front office as a general manager's 
assistant, sorting contracts, filing papers and, most of all, watching over 
kids such as Parent. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1979; his first, her first. 
</P>
<P>
Remembers Parent: "She was the one person in the front office you could talk 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Remembers Polley: "He was the one who received about four perfumed letters 
every day from his girlfriend. After delivering all those, I'm glad she finally 
became his wife." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years passed, and it became obvious that the old lady and the kid 
were not that much different. They were both role players, little-known 
reserves. Neither was going to be made a millionaire by this game. Neither was 
going to be famous. 
</P>
<P>
Parent was a solid catcher missing the required flash. Every year he showed up 
and played hard. But if the Padres ever noticed, they had a funny way of 
showing it, running off to Latin America to sign more catchers than they now 
know what to do with. 
</P>
<P>
Polley learned the inner mechanisms of the game and became as much of an expert 
on front office rules as any general manager. But her general manager became 
Jack McKeon, and although he constantly tried to pass on the credit, he became 
the folk hero, and she became the one lost in all that cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
So the old lady and the kid formed a bond. They never talked about it, never 
wrote anything down -- it was just there. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when Parent was fed up with minor league life and decided to quit, Polley 
talked him out of it. She then made a habit of sending along sweet notes every 
winter with his contract, assuring him that he was being paid fairly, assuring 
him he would one day make the big leagues. He would see her every spring 
training. He would wave to her in the stands, stay late talking to her in the 
offices, promise her that yes, one day he would make it to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
And today, Mark Parent has made it. He is beginning his second major league 
season as one of the better backup catchers in baseball. Soon his contracts 
will be done in big negotiations with big agents, and all sweet notes will cost 
extra. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something missing. It's the old lady. Last week, the day after 
another season opened, Rhoda Polley unwillingly resigned from the Padres at age 
65 to concentrate on a battle with a cancer that is spreading through her body. 
</P>
<P>
You might remember Polley from opening day. She was the woman being helped to 
the pitching mound before the game by Parent, Garry Templeton and Tim Flannery. 
She's the woman you've never heard of who threw out the first ball. George Bush 
did it in Baltimore, the old lady did it in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parent would like you to hear about her. Hours after her resignation, he 
hit a home run against the San Francisco Giants. As he crossed the plate into 
the warm arms of teammates and loud cheers of fans, there was only one thing he 
could think of. Is Rhoda watching? 
</P>
<P>
"I was home, trying to watch on TV, but my sleeping pills got me, and I was 
sleeping," Polley said the next day. "But I still saw him. I don't need to be 
watching Mark to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Parent hopes she keeps watching. The kid has dedicated his season to Polley. He 
figures she would do the same for him. That is, if she hasn't already done the 
same for him. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Polley's story is a simple one. She was baseball fan, grew up in San 
Diego, became so enamored that she and her husband bought a house five minutes 
from the ballpark so she could walk to the games. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband died in 1974. She retired from her job as a legal secretary and 
became a baseball freak. She had no children, so she saw the Padres as her 
children. She attended every spring game, every home game. She became one of 
those fan fixtures who attach themselves to every club . . . and then in the 
spring of 1979, Bob Fontaine, then the general manager, suddenly plopped down 
next to her in the Yuma box seats. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he needed a secretary, somebody to help out," Polley remembers. "I 
asked him, when do I start?" 
</P>
<P>
She has since been through seven managers, three club presidents and two 
full-time general managers. Her job was, among other things, to mail the 
contracts and keep track of the incentive clauses in those contracts. She once 
worked out the language in Alan Wiggins' guaranteed contract so that it made so 
much sense, it was sent to the Players' Assn. as a model. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, and she played mother to the Padres' minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into a fight with a manager in double-A in 1982, and they wanted to 
suspend me, and then send me down, and I told them to stick it," Parent 
recalled. "I was on my way to quitting . . . and then Rhoda called. She told me 
I was better than that. She told me I was blowing my one chance. She wanted me 
to act like a man." 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Polley: "I gave him this speech, and all he said was, 'Yes ma'am.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Parent took the demotion to Class-A Salem. By the next year, he was back in 
double A. And from then on, they shared a trust. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a person in the front office I always believed," Parent said. "She 
treated me like I was no different than Dave Winfield. During spring training, 
she would holler at me from the stands, which was nice when you had nobody 
else. She was much better for me than I ever was for her." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, but was like one of my sons," Polley said. "He treated me like I was 
special." 
</P>
<P>
That's why she fretted this winter when, after being diagnosed with cancer, she 
could not reach Parent in the Dominican Republic, where he was playing winter 
league. It wasn't until Parent returned to the United States in January and 
called her about spring training reservations -- and the annual players' pool 
tournament she sponsors in Yuma -- that he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny, but she told me, and it was like I couldn't get her off the 
phone fast enough," Parent said. "She told me I was the last person she would 
tell, and it got all emotional, and I could tell it was killing her, so I 
wanted her to hang up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had anybody around me sick like this. I'm not sure how to handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres showed how they handled it on opening day, when Polley threw out the 
ball at owner Joan Kroc's request. After an off-season spending spree that 
might put the Padres in contention, Kroc could have made the pitch and probably 
still be hearing the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"But they asked me instead, and I got so excited," Polley said. "Imagine me, 
throwing out a first ball." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the least we can do," McKeon said. "Rhoda has constantly made my job 
easier. I was a rookie general manager, and she guided me through the hard 
times. I remember, and we all remember. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get lucky enough to make the playoffs or World Series, you bet your life 
she'll be right there with us. Even if I have to carry her there." 
</P>
<P>
Despite needing help reaching the mound opening night, it was Polley who 
carried the three players when, while still on the mound, they were surprised 
by the loud noise from surprise pregame cannon shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard this boom, and all of us jumped, but Rhoda," Parent said. "We all 
hung on to her." 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong," Polley said. "We hung on to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parent: "You have to understand, I really can't tell her I'm dedicating 
this season to her. I don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. "Maybe I can just show her. I show her, she'll know."

Nicole Anderson of La Jolla High School said Tuesday she will sign a national 
letter of intent to play basketball at UCLA. Anderson said she will sign with 
the Bruins today, the first day athletes can sign letters of intent during the 
national spring signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who visited San Diego State, USC and UCLA, was a second-team 
all-section selection as a junior. This season, Anderson, a 5-foot-4 guard, was 
averaging 22 points in 12 games before cracking a bone in her hand against 
Serra in January. JIM LINDGREN

DAVE DISTEL: NO TRADE IN SIGHT, MURPHY BRAVES ANOTHER SEASON IN ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a picture is worth a thousand words, as thousands of photographers insist, 
then I'll give you an instance when the lack of a picture is more telling than 
millions of words. 
</P>
<P>
The place-this-picture-isn't is on the cover of the Atlanta Braves 1989 media 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
This picture that isn't on the cover of said media guide is a picture of Dale 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you say, so Ted Turner's picture is on the cover. That shouldn't be 
particularly surprising, given his ego and the fact that he does own the team. 
</P>
<P>
Except Ted Turner's picture is not on the cover either. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves' cover boys this year are, roll the drums, Gerald Perry, Tom 
Glavine, Ron Gant, Pete Smith and Andres Thomas. It should be a "Who's Who?" -- 
note the question mark -- rather than a media guide. 
</P>
<P>
On this cover, there was no room for a guy coming into his 14th season with 
1,675 games played, 1,005 runs scored, 334 home runs hit and 1,004 runs batted 
in . . . all with the aforementioned Braves. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to get the impression that the Braves did not really expect Murphy 
to be with them when the season started. I checked inside under Dale Murphy and 
found six pages of biographical material and statistics, but I presume they 
were perforated for easy removal. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Padre fans would love to see that biographical material and 
statistics plunked into the middle of their media guide. Murphy does get a 
mention there under the heading of "Most Home Runs Against San Diego" by active 
players: 49. But that's not the same as having him listed on an alphabetical 
roster between Carmelo Martinez and Mark Parent. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for much of the 1988-89 off-season, San Diego was awash with rumors 
that the Padres were going to acquire Dale Murphy. Many folks confidently 
talked of when it would happen rather than if, and their dreams danced with 
visions of Tony Gwynn, Jack Clark and Murphy in the same batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Zap! Boom! Pow! 
</P>
<P>
These would be real bat men. 
</P>
<P>
It was not to happen, and won't for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta showed up this week for its first San Diego visit of the year with its 
non-cover boy in center field and its media guide intact. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that Murphy endured a very sub-par year in 1988, batting 
.226 with 24 home runs and 77 RBI. It was following such a year that it became 
obvious that Atlanta general manager Bobby Cox was shopping his erstwhile star 
like a grocery store coupon, looking to get three or four for the price of one. 
</P>
<P>
This type of experience, the bad year followed by an uncertain winter, was a 
bit different for a player and man of Murphy's stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting winter," Murphy said. "There's not too much to say now, 
but I told Bobby earlier that I'd consider it if something came up. I could 
pretty much say yes or no. But I'm not thinking of any of that stuff now. My 
main focus is the ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
As a 10-year veteran with five years with the same club, Murphy can approve or 
disapprove of any trades. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, there have been no trades for him to consider. 
</P>
<P>
And so Murphy remains an Atlanta Brave, which is what he has always been. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could be happier with where he's at," Murphy said. "I might not be in 
the big leagues if it weren't for Atlanta sticking with me and giving me a 
chance. The whole thing for me is to concentrate on where I am and what my job 
is." 
</P>
<P>
That's a problem now, because Murphy's job is to hit and he isn't. He was three 
for 24 for a .125 average through Monday night. All three of his hits were 
singles, and he had no RBI. This was no way to bounce back from the 
disappointment of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to take better swings," he said, "and I haven't been." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Padres, such ardent suitors through the off-season, seem 
inclined to go with the players they have. Catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., the 
organization's most valuable superfluous commodity, is playing in Las Vegas and 
hoping to be traded, but McKeon views him as money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"My thinking has changed drastically," Manager Jack McKeon said. "I'm satisfied 
with the four outfielders we've got. I feel if I sit on Alomar a little longer, 
maybe June or July or August, I'll need something more important (than an 
outfielder). I have plenty of time to weigh all my options." 
</P>
<P>
It would seem, further, that these negotiations, such as they were, have been 
dead for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to the Braves since the first week of March, when I told them 
I was interested," McKeon said. "If they wanted to do something, all they had 
to do was call me. They've never called." 
</P>
<P>
Things are going reasonably well these days for the Padres, who could probably 
still use a Dale Murphy despite McKeon's insistence that he is comfortable with 
what he has. 
</P>
<P>
Things are not going very well these days for Dale Murphy, who maybe deserves a 
fresh start despite his insistence that he is happy with an organization that 
seems intent on getting rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
However, as things stand now, this Brave's new world will not be in San Diego.

FRANCE WANTS TO SLAM EUROPE'S OPEN DOOR TO U.S. TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The rally was called by an organization with a French revolutionary name, the 
States General of Culture, and the several hundred French screenwriters, actors 
and directors gathered in the old Mogador Theater were in a rebellious mood. 
</P>
<P>
However, the main target of their wrath Monday night was not the Bourbon 
monarchy, but the American television industry. 
</P>
<P>
They were assembled in a last-minute appeal to the government to change its 
mind about a compromise decision it made in the European Commision last month 
to eliminate quotas on non-European -- mainly American -- programs on European 
television. A critical vote on the proposed "Television Without Borders" 
project of the European Commission is scheduled for Thursday or Friday in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
For years, a large segment of the French film community, including such famous 
actors and directors as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Claude Berri, has called for a 
quota on non-European content of televised features. The artists see the quota 
as a protective measure for their national industries, especially when the 
commission-sponsored "Television Without Borders" project takes effect in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the 12-nation European Community, particularly Britain and West 
Germany, opposed the quota system. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently, the French government had backed the artists in their 
demands, calling for 60% European content. Because news, sports, commercials 
and even such things as quiz shows would not be counted in the formula, the 
quota would mainly affect television series and feature films, the main imports 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On March 13 in Brussels, the French government gave up the fight, agreeing to a 
vaguely worded proposition that only requires that European television networks 
"whenever possible, by means available," attempt to achieve a majority of 
European produced programming. 
</P>
<P>
"France was totally isolated on this point," Edith Cresson, French minister for 
European affairs, explained in an interview in the newspaper Le Monde. Cresson, 
who has been the object of fierce criticism in the French press for giving up 
the quota, said the government decided not to exercise its veto." 
</P>
<P>
However, the States General of Culture, which claims to represent more than 
6,000 artists in France and Europe, urged Cresson to reconsider, using the veto 
if necessary, when members of the Council of European Ministers meet again 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The March 13 decision," said States General leader Jack Ralite, a former 
Communist Party minister in government, "is a virtual coup d'etat against the 
cultures of European countries." 
</P>
<P>
He and other impassioned speakers at the Mogador Theater, including actor 
Claude Pieplu, singer Guy Beart and actress Genevieve Fontanel, portrayed a 
bleak future for the already troubled European film industry if "Television 
Without Borders" is implemented without a quota system. 
</P>
<P>
The organization claims that more than 60% of all films distributed in Europe 
originate from the United States, an increase of 50% in the last decade. In 
addition, they say that more than 40% of all audio-visual purchases consist of 
purchases of American programs by Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the appeal, officials in Brussels said Tuesday tat they think the full 
text of the proposal will be approved this week "with only minor changes."

68TH BOWL SEASON LOOMS LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 63 concerts this year, growth has become a way of life at Hollywood Bowl, 
the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, when Philharmonic General Director Ernest Fleischmann had his third 
summer there, he supervised 35 events that attracted a total attendance of 
250,000 -- attendance of 2,000 or less was not uncommon in the 18,000-capacity 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
In the record-breaking summer last year, he oversaw 58 concerts, given before a 
total audience of 761,199. 
</P>
<P>
This year's season, running July 3 to Sept. 16, will be the 68th musical summer 
at the Bowl. Highlights of this 11-week season include guest appearances by the 
Montreal Symphony, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Boston Pops Esplanade 
Orchestra; a five-concert jazz series; appearances by conductors Yuri 
Temirkanov, L.A. Philharmonic Music Director Andre Previn, Edo de Waart, Neeme 
Jarvi, Henry Mancini, John Williams and David Zinman, among others, and 
numerous pianists, violinists, singers and instrumental soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of activity at the outdoor amphitheater, Fleischmann told The Times 
in a phone interview Tuesday, "helps reduce" the stress of the L.A. 
Philharmonic Assn.'s financial situation. In a budget in excess of $26 million, 
the Bowl operation accounts for 40% of that budget, while bringing in "60% of 
our revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Those revenues include, Fleischmann said, large contributions from the 1989 
corporate sponsors and donors: American Airlines (sponsoring six concerts); E. 
Nakamichi Foundation (activities of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute); 
JVC (JVC Jazz at the Bowl concert); W.M. Keck Foundation (Open House at 
Hollywood Bowl); KFAC-FM (two concerts); Southern California Nissan Dealers), 
and Warnaco Inc. (uniforms for Bowl ushers and service personnel, contributed 
by Chaps by Ralph Lauren). 
</P>
<P>
None of these contributions pay totally for any single event, Fleischmann 
specified. "In total, these are contributions in the hundreds of thousands, not 
in the millions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann, who shares responsibility for the operation of the Bowl with 
outgoing Philharmonic General Manager Robert Harth, also commented that the 
price of success in these two decades is sometimes a negative: "As a physical 
facility, the Bowl is beginning to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five to 10 years, it will take a tremendous amount of dollars 
and refurbishing just to maintain the integrity of the place." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of outdoor entertaining, Michael Auten, the owner of Fiddler 
Enterprises, which operates the Hollywood Bowl Patio Restaurant and all Bowl 
food concessions, said food service has increased to the point where "we are 
serving more meals now in a typical busy weekend -- 15,000 to 18,000 meals 
total on Friday and Saturday -- than the previous food management used to serve 
all summer long."

<P>
Hardly a week goes by without some organization's handing out miniature cowboy 
hats, gramophones, astronauts or Elvises to gleeful musicians, who thank God 
and/or their fans before the cameras on a televised awards spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
This week alone, viewers could subject themselves to four televised music 
awards shows: Sunday's Stellar gospel awards on KTLA Channel 5, Monday's 
Academy of Country Music's Hats handed out on KCBS Channel 2, tonight's Soul 
Train Music Awards (televised in Los Angeles on KTTV Channel 11 at 8 p.m. on 
Thursday) and Friday's World Music Video Awards at 11:30 p.m. also on Channel 
11. 
</P>
<P>
On top of those, nominations will be announced this week for the first 
recipients of the new Elvis statuettes to be awarded May 31 on ABC's 
International Rock Awards. 
</P>
<P>
And the major attraction of two of the shows this week (Soul Train and the 
World Music Video Awards) will be special presentations of achievement awards 
to Michael Jackson -- who was given a similar award on the American Music 
Awards show in January in a lavish, loving 20-minute segment that led some to 
dub the proceedings the American Michael Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, anyone who wins one will say that awards are good things. But has it 
become too much of a good thing? 
</P>
<P>
It depends on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole process is going down the tubes," said Don Cornelius, who will 
preside over the third annual Soul Train Music Awards at the Shrine Auditorium 
tonight. The problem, he said, is that the glut of shows has diluted their 
importance in the minds of many of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more fashionable these days, particularly with the major shows, not to be 
there, rather than to be there. So what we end up doing is selling a package to 
a network or advertiser that makes a promise it can't keep." 
</P>
<P>
But Cornelius said the specialized nature of his Soul Train awards show is an 
attraction to black musicians, who feel slighted by some of the other 
generalized awards shows. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of the major stars who won't go to anything, everybody 
wants to be at this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Solters, senior vice president of music for MCA, who deals with awards 
shows, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soul Train awards are real good," he said. "Those people really want to be 
there and it seems like it means something. It's not just a trumped-up TV 
show." 
</P>
<P>
But Solters was less enthusiastic about the career benefits of some of the 
other awards. "It only really means something in an artist's bio," he said of 
winning even a top award, such as a Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
What is more important today is the chance to perform on a show. 
</P>
<P>
"The exposure is important," Solters said. "It's much harder to get the 
exposure with the loss of shows like 'Solid Gold' and the old variety shows." 
</P>
<P>
References to the old variety format were frequent among people connected with 
the awards shows -- some complementary, others not so. 
</P>
<P>
"Variety show producers are so creatively constipated," said Michael Greene, 
president of the Grammy-sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences. "They say, 'Gee, what can I do a show on? How about an award?' They 
decide to come up with an award in order to have the stars come out." 
</P>
<P>
Greene argued that there is a glut of awards shows that lessened the value of 
established awards, such as the Grammys. The recording academy, he noted, 
devotes considerable time and research to the nomination and voting process. 
The number of awards that have sprung up in the Grammy's wake have capitalized 
on the recording academy's efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the awards business, though, say it's the very nature of the Grammys 
that has brought about the rise of competing shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grammys is absolutely the show that is most meaningful and important to 
anyone in the music business," said Al Schwartz, who for the past 14 years has 
produced the American Music Awards for Dick Clark Productions and also produces 
the Academy of Country Music's show and the MTV awards show. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Grammys have a terrible job. They have to cover areas that aren't 
necessarily as popular with the public. We have an advantage that we can 
concentrate on the things the public is familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
The Grammys' inability to devote much time to any one area of music was also 
cited by the people behind the new International Rock Awards as the genesis of 
their show. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grammys don't really recognize rock," said John Hamlin, ABC-TV vice 
president of special programs, who is overseeing the upcoming telecast of the 
International Rock Awards. "So that's why we're doing this show." 
</P>
<P>
But the recording academy's Greene said the trend toward specialized awards 
shows makes the Grammys' broad spectrum more important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"This country is being narrowcasted to death, to the point that people can 
choose to become unicellular people if they want," he said. "Technology has 
homogenized culture out of regionalism, and one of the things the Grammys does 
is point out the diversity of music." 
</P>
<P>
But judging by the ratings, specialization seems to be working. The Grammy 
broadcast in February was watched in just 14.5 million homes, down from last 
year's nearly 19 million. But the American Music Awards' January telecast 
reached almost 19 million homes, up 3 million from 1988. More specialized shows 
such as the syndicated Soul Train awards and the International Rock Awards are 
not expected to get ratings to match those shows, but the very focused nature 
of the programs is appealing to advertisers wishing to target specific 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the feeling in the industry is that the shows are approaching a point of 
diminishing returns. 
</P>
<P>
"The formula is growing tired," said Tisha Fein, who procures the performing 
talent for many awards shows, including the Grammys and Friday's World Music 
Video Awards. "For my money there's much too many. I think a lot of them will 
fall by the wayside. The ratings will go down and then it'll just be the 
Grammys and a few others." 
</P>
<P>
But the lesson of the shows is this: As long as ratings stay high enough, stars 
will turn out, which will help the ratings stay up, which means the shows will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
And even the recording academy's Greene admits that there's plenty of room for 
quality shows that focus on music. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that helps the music industry, the academy is 100% behind," he said, 
singling out the American Music Awards as particularly valuable. "That show 
helps sell records and give exposure to the artists."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: SOME WILD PITCHES THAT GOT AWAY 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's that time of year again. The networks are moving in replacement series to 
fill out the present season while mulling other new series for the coming fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
As always, however, they've completely missed the boat by arrogantly rejecting 
my very best suggestions. As always, I give them the pearls, and they ignore 
them: 
</P>
<P>
"Late Night With Ayatollah Khomeini": Very high concept. America's first talk 
show from Iran, with subtitles. Guaranteed to knock Johnny Carson, David 
Letterman, Pat Sajak and Arsenio Hall off the air. With various mullahs as his 
sidemen, the Ayatollah reveals his playful side while interviewing an exciting 
array of Islamic fundamentalists. ("So tell me, Ashmad. . . .") The wit just 
shines. On the premiere, Khomeini brings down the house when he jokes: "The 
world has many infidel nations. Take Iraq -- please!" 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty and the Falcon Breast": Part One of an NBC package, this sophisticated 
continuing drama is about greed and intrigue in California's silicone-implant 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Supreme Court Cuties": Part Two of the NBC package is an unforgettable sitcom. 
Mini-skirted, garter-belted former go-go dancers who know their briefs, legal 
and otherwise, show their stuff as appointees to the high court. Barbara Eden 
as the braless chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve Garvey Playhouse": Part Three of the NBC package is strictly for after 
hours and not for kids. Stories from Steve's personal journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Roe vs. Wade Boggs": Beset by scandal, the Boston Red Sox star leaves baseball 
to star in this drama series about a social activist who begins his career by 
leading a pro-vasectomy march on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Snow White Meets the Village People": Allan Carr presents a weekly series 
showcasing the best of Walt Disney. It opens with the Seven Dwarfs singing 
"Y.M.C.A." 
</P>
<P>
"Roseanne's Baby": A horrifying science-fiction spinoff from "Roseanne." After 
being impregnated by the devil, Roseanne gives birth to a baby that looks and 
sounds like . . . her. 
</P>
<P>
"Married ... With Mildreds": Adorable sitcom. A very stupid couple 
absent-mindedly names their three daughters Mildred, resulting in hilarious 
high jinks. Sample dialogue: "Oh, Mildred!" "Yes, mother." "No, not you, 
Mildred, the other Mildred." "Me, mother?" "No, not you, Mildred, the other 
Mildred!" "Me, Mother?" "Yes, you, mother." "No I'm Mildred, you're mother." 
</P>
<P>
"Designing Warthogs": Urbane comedy about four Southern women who manage to 
operate a successful designing business and look chic despite having broad, 
flat faces, large tusks and warts. 
</P>
<P>
"Murder, She Writ": Mystery series. A very bad mystery writer is also a very 
bad amateur detective, botching grammar and cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Gassing Pains": Uproarious comedy. While Mom pursues her career, Dad stays 
home and does the cleaning and cooking. The real fun comes when the dish he 
makes night after night is beans. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Do You Think You're Fooling, You Rotten Scum?": Provocative talk show. 
Normal people who are not criminals, crime victims, cross dressers, 
transsexuals, druggies or satanists are put on the hot seat and berated and 
humiliated by a skeptical Geraldo Rivera, who makes them account for their 
routine lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Break My Nose, Break the Bank": Unique and exciting prime-time game show. 
Contestants compete for cash prizes by throwing chairs at Geraldo in hopes of 
breaking his nose. It's risky, for if contestants fail (a certified radiologist 
will be on hand to examine X-rays of Geraldo's nose) they must pay a penalty. 
They are grilled by Geraldo about their sex lives and must show Geraldo their 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital Punishment": Another exciting game show offering cash prizes to 
winners. Again, losers pay a terrible penalty, this time by having to spend 24 
hours alone with TV sports commentator Dick Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
"Moving In on the Movies": Theatrical movies are transformed into rotating 
weekly series: 
</P>
<P>
"Private Fly ('The Fly')": Science-fiction mystery/adventure. An otherwise 
normal private detective turns into a disgusting-looking fly when angered or 
provoked. Although it helps him when in surveillance, there are constant 
perils. In the pilot, he becomes a fly to eavesdrop on mobsters, but is 
immediately swatted. Concept may need reworking. 
</P>
<P>
"Bedtime for Kong ('Gorillas in the Mist')": Cute sitcom. A woman and her 
400-pound pet gorilla live in a cabin on a mountain. Their peace and serenity 
are repeatedly disrupted by their zany neighbor, who is always popping in 
unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dukes of Mississippi ('Mississippi Burning')": A slapstick, but socially 
significant sitcom about a couple of good-old-boy FBI agents who cause havoc in 
the Deep South by racing after leggy young women and outwitting a dimwitted 
sheriff.

Three Israeli Jews "who may have some connection" with the slaying of a 
Palestinian outside the Old City of Jerusalem have been taken into custody, an 
Israeli police spokesman said. Khaled Shaweesh, 26, was killed Monday night, 
apparently by an Jewish gunman. Three other Arabs were seriously wounded. A 
mysterious Jewish group, the Sicarites, called Israel Radio for a second time, 
claiming responsibility for the shootings. The caller said the attack was to 
avenge the stoning of Jews by Arabs on Friday at the Western Wall. About 1,300 
Arab mourners, some waving the banned Palestinian flag, took part in the 
funeral procession for Shaweesh.

The Federal Aviation Administration told Congress that it soon will order more 
than 160 structural changes in Boeing Co. planes and more later for other 
manufacturers to deal with America's aging aircraft. Anthony Broderick, the 
FAA's associate administrator for regulation and certification, also testified 
before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee's aviation 
subcommittee that his agency hopes by the end of 1990 to have added nearly 
1,000 inspectors, bringing its total to nearly 3,000.

The 62-year-old manager of a Burger King suffered a fatal heart attack while 
two gunmen were robbing his fast-food restaurant, San Jose police said. The 
gunmen could face murder charges when apprehended, Lt. Darrel Richter said. 
Karl Schmity, was counting receipts when one of the robbers slipped into the 
restaurant through a door left open by an employee taking out garbage. The 
gunman forced three employees to lie on the floor, then confronted Schmity and 
marched him to the dining area at gunpoint, Richter said. "He started to suffer 
a physical attack then," the lieutenant said.

The father of a missing Fresno baby was found dead and his wife unconscious at 
a Visalia motel in what police said might have been a suicide pact. Fresno 
police said John Ray, 32, apparently killed himself with an overdose of 
prescription drugs on Saturday -- the day he was to take a lie detector test in 
connection with the disappearance nearly two weeks ago of 4-month-old Cindy 
Ray. Janine Ray, 26, was revived and interviewed briefly by a detective who 
said she was not yet sufficiently recovered to tell him anything "substantive." 
Fresno Police Sgt. Mike Guthrie said Visalia police found in the motel room 
"documentary evidence" that could lead to the missing child. Police said John 
Ray had a record of abusing his wife, leading to the suspicion that someone may 
have taken the child to protect her.

Former Oakland drug dealer Rudy Henderson has been sentenced to 25 years in 
prison, five years more than recommended by the U.S. attorney's office in a 
plea-bargaining agreement. An angry Henderson had tried to change his plea, but 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected the request. "One can't have 
one's cake and eat it too," she said. Henderson, 40, and eight co-defendants 
pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to several drug conspiracy charges in exchange for 
dismissal of other charges. Henderson pleaded guilty to possessing for sale 
seven kilograms of cocaine and evasion of $115,000 in taxes. He was to be 
sentenced to 20 years in prison and also agreed to forfeit his $1-million 
mansion in Sonoma County. Patel sentenced him to 20 years in prison for the 
drug charge and five more years to be served consecutively for tax evasion.

The largest Tamil militant group in Sri Lanka rejected a one-week cease-fire 
offered by President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who sought to end six years of 
ethnic violence that has claimed 12,500 lives. "The government is only 
interested in getting our weapons and has not put forward anything worthwhile," 
said a leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Foreign Minister Ranjan 
Wijeratne had told reporters Monday that during the truce, the rebels should 
give themselves up at 228 centers across the country. Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka 
launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent homeland, citing discrimination 
by the Sinhalese in employment and education.

Voters in Deadwood, S.D., the Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was shot 
to death in a card game, approved a return to legalized gambling. City leaders 
hope games of chance will revive the economy and plan to use proceeds to 
restore historic buildings and public facilities. The measure to legalize 
poker, blackjack and slot machines received 690 votes to 230 votes against. 
Hickok, a U.S. marshal and frontiersman, was shot in the back of the head in 
1876 during a poker game in a saloon called No. 10. Legend has it he was 
holding a pair each of aces and eights, known since as the "dead man's hand."

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the U.N. secretary general that Israel does 
not need its help for now in advancing the ideas of Mideast peace. At a meeting 
in New York initiated by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Shamir said 
he is still against convening a U.N.-backed international peace conference on 
the Middle East. An Israeli spokesman said Perez de Cuellar took a great 
interest in Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections in Israeli-occupied 
territories. Meanwhile, Zehdi Terzi, the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
observer at the United Nations, said the secretary general would meet with PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat later this month in Europe.

CASH, COCAINE SEIZED IN MAJOR BUST; 11 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested 11 Colombians, seized almost 1,200 pounds of 
cocaine and recovered more than $100,000 in cash in one of the largest drug 
busts in the history of Los Angeles County law enforcement, Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were followed by an unrelated raid during which two men were taken 
into custody and more than 200 marijuana plants were confiscated at what 
investigators described as a sophisticated, hydroponic farming operation at a 
luxury home in San Dimas, according to sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the suspects in the cocaine case were "top-level people" in the 
distribution of drugs shipped into the Los Angeles area from overseas, probably 
through Mexico. He said a major share of the cocaine confiscated probably had 
been destined for transshipment to other cities across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the cocaine arrests late Monday ended a two-month investigation by 
narcotics officers that began as the result of information received by 
detectives. He did not explain how this information was received. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the chief said, undercover officers followed Claudio Martinez, 26, 
to a shopping center in Westminster in Orange County, where he met with Luis 
Monsalve, 22, and Juan Casanova, 34. Officers said they moved in and arrested 
the three, confiscating about 950 pounds of cocaine from a van driven by 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
After those arrests, Gates said, search warrants were issued for residences in 
Burbank, Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Westminster, Huntington Beach and Torrance. 
The chief said another 220 pounds of cocaine was found at a home in 
Westminster, and $102,895 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills was discovered at a 
home in Torrance. Eight motor vehicles were impounded. 
</P>
<P>
Flor Restrepo, 30, and her sister, Luz Restrepo, 33 -- described by Gates as 
the leaders of the gang -- were arrested at an apartment in the Cahuenga Pass 
area, along with Carlos Montoya, 32, and a 16-year-old girl.

Faber Restrepo, 26, was arrested at an apartment in Burbank and Olga Garcia, 
32, was arrested at a home in Huntington Beach. Arolino Montoya, 37, was 
arrested at an apartment in Pico Rivera and Janeth Garcia, 30, was arrested as 
she drove away from her home in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.5-Million Bail 
</P>
<P>
All the suspects were booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent 
to sell. Bail for each was set at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said no further arrests were expected in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said officers from the state Bureau of 
Narcotics, the federal Drug Enforcement Adminstration and a task force of 11 
San Gabriel Valley police agencies joined deputies Tuesday morning to raid the 
$2-million hilltop home in San Dimas where the marijuana was being grown 
without soil in tanks containing nutrient-enriched water. 
</P>
<P>
Ducoulombier said that, in addition to the marijuana plants, some of which were 
5 to 6 feet tall, officers confiscated $350,000 in cash and more than 60 
pistols, rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Rollin Scott Forteville, 38, and Jeff Jenkins, 26, were arrested at the home 
and booked on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Bail for each was set at $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine seizure by Los Angeles police apparently was the sixth largest by 
the department or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Cocaine Seizure 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Los Angeles police confiscated 2,135 pounds of the drug at two 
locations in the San Fernando Valley in what is believed to be the record drug 
bust in the area. It came just five months after the Police Department had 
seized 1,900 pounds in another raid in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,800 pounds of the drug was seized in Anaheim by Los Angeles police in 
April, 1986, and 1,760 pounds of cocaine was confiscated by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies in a home in Maywood in November, 1987. Los Angeles police 
recovered 1,333 pounds of cocaine in a North Hollywood parking lot in December, 
1986.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA MAYOR'S TRUCK SET ABLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of an often-contentious reelection campaign, Pomona Mayor Donna 
Smith awoke early Tuesday to find her truck burning in her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a 'whoosh' and the front of the house lit up," said Smith, 34, who 
looked out to see her 1986 Chevy Blazer engulfed in flames. She and her husband 
put out the fire with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators have not determined the cause of the fire, Pomona Fire 
Department Inspector Ron Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor G. Stanton Selby, Smith's opponent in next Tuesday's run-off 
election, expressed disgust with the incident. "It's terrible," Selby said. "I 
hope it doesn't have anything to do with the election, for God's sake." 
</P>
<P>
Since her election as mayor two years ago, Smith has often been the target of 
criticism by some community activists who complain that she too strictly 
enforces a five-minute limit on public comments at council meetings. Smith said 
she has received several "strange" phone calls during the campaign, but no 
explicit threats.

3 HURT IN ACID SPILL AT COCA-COLA PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,200 gallons of phosphoric acid gushed out of a valve Tuesday at a 
Coca-Cola USA bottling plant east of downtown Los Angeles, injuring three 
workers who inhaled the potentially toxic fumes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred shortly before 1 p.m. when a worker left the valve open on 
one of two tanks used for mixing chemicals, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty workers were evacuated and 12 were examined by paramedics. Two women and 
a man, who complained of chest pains or respiratory problems, were treated at 
White Memorial Medical Center. Nine others were to undergo further examinations 
by a doctor at the company's clinic, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
At full strength, phosphoric acid can burn skin and eyes and is harmful if 
inhaled, but the spilled acid was partly diluted and therefore the hazard was 
reduced, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant borders the Los Angeles River, but there were no reports that the 
acid had entered the flood control channel. Most of the spill ended up in the 
sewer system, Wells said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPANY WORKING ON METRO RAIL FINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal safety officials have fined a subcontractor $10,000 for allowing 
workmen in an unshored 12-foot trench on the Metro Rail project near downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman Frank Gravitt said 
Tecumseh Construction Co., which is doing electrical work for the subway 
system, was cited for knowingly placing employees in a life-threatening 
situation despite warnings from safety engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Gravitt said the employees were working early last month in a trench that was 
not properly sloped or shored. Inspectors found them at the bottom of the 
excavation without any protection against possible cave-ins or earth slides, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tecumseh was warned of the potential danger by the safety engineer for 
Tutor-Saliba-Perini, general contractor for Metro Rail but failed to correct 
the situation, the OSHA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractor has 15 working days to correct the violations and pay the 
fines or to contest the citation before an OSHA review commission in 
Washington.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATE PANEL OKS CROAKER FISHING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Senate panel Tuesday approved a ban on commercial fishing of white 
croaker in Santa Monica Bay. The Senate Committee on Natural Resources and 
Wildlife, in an 8-0 vote, approved a bill that also would prohibit commercial 
fishing of white croaker near the White Point Sewage Outfall near the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of the water in the area show it has "extremely high levels of toxic 
contamination" and that the white croaker species in particular is "unfit for 
human consumption," said Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who authored 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities thought commercial fishing near the outfall had stopped 
after tests disclosed the problem in 1985, they found evidence last year that 
fishermen were catching white croaker and "those fish are sold to unsuspecting 
consumers," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his bill, which was sent to the Senate Appropriations Committee for 
another vote, was limited to white croaker because it is not a transient 
species and therefore susceptible to site-specific contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill approved by the committee would authorize the state director of 
fish and game to close contaminated areas to commercial fishing.

U.S.-L.A. TASK FORCE DEPORTS 175 WITH TIES TO DRUG, GANG ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force of federal immigration agents and Los Angeles police investigators 
has deported 175 illegal aliens involved in gang and narcotics activities since 
the unit was expanded last December, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 111 of the deported gang members were "involved one way or the other 
in drug use and trafficking," Harold Ezell, Western regional commissioner for 
the U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service, said at a news conference. INS 
officials said the deportees also had criminal records for felonies ranging 
from murder to possession of stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the gang members -- a majority of whom were identified as 
Mexican and Salvadoran nationals -- were either sent back to their homelands 
after serving prison terms for felony counts or were picked up in street 
round-ups and deported by immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deported to Many Nations 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said that 77 alleged gang members were deported to Mexico. 
Another 56 were sent to El Salvador, 15 to Honduras and less than 10 each 
returned to Guatemala, Colombia, Jamaica, Belize, Costa Rica and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Though authorities did not provide specific details on the crimes committed by 
the deported gang members, they said that in one case, the task force decimated 
the leadership of Mara Salvatrucha, a Salvadoran street gang. John Brechtel, 
assistant district director for INS investigations in Los Angeles, said that 
more than 20 key members of the gang were deported. 
</P>
<P>
The INS increased the number of its agents, from two to eight, on the 
interagency task force last December, officials said, after a boost in federal 
funding. INS agents have also begun to work with sheriffs' deputies and 
suburban law enforcement agencies in a similar capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targeted for Deportation 
</P>
<P>
Under the task force program, INS agents, police and sheriff's deputies target 
illegal aliens known to be gang members for deportation. Some are deported 
after they are arrested and charged with crimes. But in some cases, INS agents 
have deported gang members even if police have been unable to charge them with 
any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"If a gang member is out on the street and the police can't make a charge, we 
will go out and deport them for being here illegally if they fit that 
criteria," Brechtel said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a similar program, 50 INS agents are assigned to interviewing 
undocumented immigrants and lawful resident aliens serving time on felony 
convictions in state and federal prisons. The felons are given deportation 
hearings while in prison, then sent back to their homelands as soon as they are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that about 9,000 aliens with felony convictions have been deported 
in the last six months from the INS Western Region, which encompasses 
California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam. Of those, 2,058 were deported 
from Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immediate Benefit 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Bernard Parks said the deportations allow "our 
officers to concentrate on gang members in another fashion." The most immediate 
benefit, Parks said, was the ability to remove illegal alien gang members from 
a community even if police had not been able to develop charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
"The positive impact on the system is that we don't have to go out and look for 
that person again after they've been deported," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
But social workers and others who work with gang members suggest that the 
program is flawed because gang members can quickly return to a community soon 
after they are deported. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've found is that after they're deported, they surface within days back 
in the community," one official with the California Youth Authority said.

EX-PRIEST SOUGHT AS RINGLEADER IN CHILD PORN RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIESON HIMMEL and JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Roman Catholic priest described by neighbors as a "perfect gentleman" 
is one of two men being sought in connection with a ring that allegedly made 
pornographic videotapes of young boys in Mexico and Southern California and 
distributed them worldwide, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Bauer, 52, was said by officers to have preyed on juveniles in Hollywood 
in recent years and to have owned porn shops in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, the alleged ringleader, is believed to have fled the country after 
slipping through police hands several months ago. Also being sought -- and also 
thought to have fled the country -- is Victor Feliciano, 29, a Rosemead 
handyman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Under Arrest 
</P>
<P>
Two other men are under arrest, however, said Detective Sgt. Ralph Bennett, of 
the Police Department's Exploited Child Unit. They were identified as Jerry 
Houchens, 49, of Santa Ana, and David Negrette, 26, of Huntington Beach, a 
former assistant Boy Scoutmaster. 
</P>
<P>
Negrette was being held on $150,000 bail. He faces a preliminary hearing on 
April 21. Houchens is in jail with bail set at $200,000. He is to be arraigned 
today. 
</P>
<P>
All four suspects have been charged with conspiracy to distribute child 
pornography. Bennett said they are members of the North American Man-Boy Love 
Assn., an organization of pedophiles that circulates child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said the suspects apparently picked up boys aged 8 to 14 on the streets 
of Ensenada and took them to motel rooms there to videotape them in sexual 
encounters with each other and with at least three of the four men. The boys 
were paid a few dollars apiece, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said the case came to police attention last summer when a young boy 
told authorities at Children of the Night, a Hollywood shelter for runaways, 
that he had been picked up by Bauer and taken to the ex-priest's apartment 
nearby, where he saw photographs of nude boys. 
</P>
<P>
Officers went to the apartment in the 1500 block of North Martel Avenue and 
removed a truckload of videotapes, videotaping equipment and other material. 
They also reported finding some marijuana plants. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer was arrested Aug. 23 on suspicion of cultivating marijuana. He posted 
$1,000 bail and disappeared. It was not until after he had left -- apparently 
for Europe -- that officers were able to go through the seized material and 
realize that pornography charges could be filed, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman staff member at the Hollywood shelter said Tuesday night that police 
told her "this guy (Bauer) has been doing it (videotaping young boys) for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard about him from more than one child," said the woman, who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Hotnog , the manager at the apartment building where Bauer lived, 
described him as "a rather attractive gray-haired gentleman with glasses." She 
said he appeared to be a retiree and that he told her that he "accrued a lot of 
money -- T-bills, trust funds. He often swam in the daytime, or lounged by the 
pool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Remodeled 
</P>
<P>
Bauer's apartment was remodeled before his arrest, Hotnog said, "but when the 
construction workers went in, there were no pictures or unusual plants. I had 
no suspicion. I didn't see him with one child, only with adult friends." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Chew, a neighbor, remembered Bauer as "the guy who was always wearing 
Hawaiian shirts. The only people I saw him with were his age -- older guys." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1984 article in Chic magazine, Bauer was ordained in 1963. His 
support of several activist causes, such as the gay rights movement, eventually 
brought him into conflict with his church superiors. He left the priesthood in 
1970 and took a teaching position at Montana State University.

25 IN S. AFRICA CONSULATE PROTEST ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A planned weeklong sit-in at the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills was 
cut short Tuesday when a federal official placed 25 of the student protesters 
under citizen's arrest for obstructing access to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four juveniles and one adult member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition 
were arrested shortly after noon by a member of the U.S. State Department, said 
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert P. Curtis. The protesters, who began their 
sit-in Monday morning, were booked at the police station for investigation of 
misdemeanor charges of obstructing a person's access to a public place, Curtis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When consul employees tried to enter the building, they were denied access. So 
(the protesters) were advised if they did not allow them access they would be 
arrested," said Curtis, who added that the students were told several times 
before their arrest that they could leave the building. Instead, "they quickly 
stood and blocked all the doorways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beverly Hills police had been present at the consulate since the 
sit-in began, the protesters were placed under arrest by Douglas Rosenstein, a 
special agent with the Los Angeles office of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, 
after he was prevented from entering. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morris, special agent in charge of the bureau's Los Angeles office, said 
he did not know whether consulate officials had asked Rosenstein to make the 
arrest. The consulate declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. Tuesday, most of the juveniles had been released into the custody of 
their parents, Curtis said. The one adult, Steven J. Hodges, 19, of Van Nuys, 
was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition member Melissa Kievman said the arrests will not stop future 
protests. "We'll be back. (We'll) return until the consulate is out of Los 
Angeles."

SOME SPORTS IN GUTTER BUT GOLF LOOKS UP; 
</P>
<P>
SCANDALS HAVE ERODED THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN OTHER SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golf has a conscience and a trust that is indomitable. It stands as a bastion 
of decency in sport, worthy of awareness and emulation by an otherwise troubled 
sports world that is in danger of caving-in and bringing about its own 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Evening Sun, in a series of interviews with some of golf's most 
renowned players, found them proud of their individual accomplishments but, 
more importantly, concerned with upholding what they inherited from the 
founders of an ancient game, which historians tell us dates back to the reign 
of King James II of Scotland in 1440. 
</P>
<P>
King Jack of America, last name Nicklaus, winner of more major championships 
than any golfer since time began, is aware of the scandals that have eroded 
public confidence in other sports. But golf has been able to hold its head 
high. There's nothing suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's a precious keepsake," he said. "Golfers make and enforce their own 
rules. We enjoy and appreciate that right. It's a shame some unfortunate things 
have happened in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
Golf is a game in which the country club crowd and public course players have 
been known to bet a dollar or two on the outcome of a match between a foursome 
involving 20-handicappers who can't hit the ball out of their shadows. 
</P>
<P>
So it might be expected that an insidious gambling influence could infiltrate 
the sport at the professional level. Odious fixes have happened in baseball, 
football and basketball, after all. 
</P>
<P>
But not in golf. "A couple of times players have been caught cheating, but we 
participants on the tour handled it quietly and it was taken care of that way," 
Nicklaus explained. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, who hustled his way from retrieving balls at a driving range to 
the heights of international acclaim, has earned a reputation for fun, frolic 
and rarely taking himself too seriously. But he's not trying to draw laughs 
when he boldly and assuredly predicts, in a voice that rings with strong 
conviction, that "golf will never have a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
That statement circles the globe because golf is played on every continent. 
"Golfers are raised differently," he insists. "We want to be golfers and 
realize what the game means. If golfers came out here gambling or had drug 
problems they wouldn't last long. These players are wise." 
</P>
<P>
Then he took to personalizing a story about a letter he received from a child 
wanting an autograph and a cap. "I thought and wondered about that kid and how 
he would feel if a week later I got busted. That wouldn't happen in golf. We 
police each other." 
</P>
<P>
As for dealing with gambling, Nicklaus says the most he ever played for in a 
match was a $20 Nassau with a special friend named Arnold Palmer. "Usually, 
it's a $10 bet in a practice round but not any more than that," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when a tournament is underway, the purses are in the hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, the players might have bet each other more than what they 
were playing for in championship prize money," adds Nicklaus as he recollects 
how far golf has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but no flaws have been found in how the game is contested. The strength of 
golf's true character is to play by the rules and not dare to bend or break 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Crenshaw, a player who could shoot par in a blindfold, points to golf as 
"one of the few games where you call penalties on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
What about the potential of cheating, such as improperly marking a ball or 
improving a lie or conveniently failing to remember a penalty stroke for being 
out-of- bounds? 
</P>
<P>
"If that happened," answered Crenshaw, "the guilty player would be ostracized. 
We have a strict code we all understand must be recognized. We are deeply proud 
of our profession." 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara, another world class player, was asked if there was much locker 
room discussion about the respect golf enjoys? "No, not really, but it 
shouldn't be since this is a game of integrity and this, again, is what it's 
all about. It just goes without saying. 
</P>
<P>
"We players are aware, without talking about it, that so many major 
corporations and sponsors, investing millions of dollars in backing 
tournaments, would not be interested if there was any type of a scandal," 
O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone bent the rules out here we would know about it and not stand for it. 
That would be jeopardizing the credibility that is absolutely vital to all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson, another golfer of championship distinction, is fully aware of 
golf's reputation. It's honest and fair. "This is all wrapped up in the nature 
of the game," he recounts. "If a player was messed up on drugs, for one thing, 
it would immediately show. Golf, historically, has men you can look up to and 
respect. And it's such a tough game. There would be no point in betting on 
yourself or each other." 
</P>
<P>
It all evolves into what has been nurtured so deeply into the roots of a game 
that has never been under suspicion during the long centuries of its gallant 
and gentlemanly traditions. 
</P>
<P>
This has been mainly fostered through the guidance and care of the supervising 
Royal and Ancient Golf Club, the USGA and PGA, but the players have readily 
accepted an equally important role. 
</P>
<P>
They have set an impeccable standard of ethical behavior. Golf shall never fall 
from grace.

MIKE DOWNEY: HRUDEY HELPS SAVE THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coming into this game, Kelly Hrudey was hready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
He was pumped. He was psyched. Pick any typical jock expression with regard to 
being excited about a big game, and it applied Tuesday night to the King 
goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
On his way to 32 saves, some of them spectacular, in a 4-2 Game 5 victory over 
the Edmonton Oilers that gave the Kings a stay of execution in the National 
Hockey League playoffs, Hrudey was never more sharp than he was toward the end 
of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
They came at him three on one. They came from his left and from his right. One 
minute Normand Lacombe came at him, the next minute Craig MacTavish came at 
him. Whoever and wherever they were, Hrudey handled the situation. He turned 
them away like a bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the second period ended -- remember, the game still had 20 minutes to 
go -- Hrudey took the puck and flung it into the Forum crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the few times you will ever see me hot dog it," Hrudey said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't resist. Whatever the Oilers were going to throw at him, Hrudey was 
prepared to handle it. His hockey team's survival depended on him, and, at long 
last, Hrudey felt well enough to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
The flu could not have come at a worse time. Just when the Kings had the Oilers 
right where they wanted them -- an event that occurs about once a decade, if 
that often -- illness overwhelmed several of the key King players, including 
Hrudey, their goaltender, who had to sit out Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the first time in several days Hrudey had felt even "halfway 
decent," he said. He had no appetite. He felt weak. The last thing he felt like 
doing was abandoning the Kings in their hour of need, but better to play 
somebody else than to have your goalie do you-know-what into his mask. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings picked him up, Hrudey was going to be the last piece of the 
puzzle, the goalie who could take them to Stanley Cup paradise. He was 
impressive in his days with the New York Islanders, and everybody around the 
league seemed to think it was Bruce McNall's best deal since the Big One with 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
But when Edmonton moved out to a 3-1 lead over the Kings in the playoffs, it 
was just like old times. Bad old times. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey hardly felt responsible, but he did feel he wanted to do something about 
it. Just as he feels he wants to do something about postponing the end of the 
season Thursday night, when the Kings play Game 6 at Edmonton's chamber of 
hockey horrors. 
</P>
<P>
Soon as someone mentioned the obvious, that Edmonton never seems to lose a 
playoff game on its home ice, the first words out of Hrudey's mouth were: 
</P>
<P>
"That's good." 
</P>
<P>
That's good? 
</P>
<P>
"That's good," he said. "Odds are, they're due to lose one." 
</P>
<P>
That's what you're hoping, anyway, someone said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hoping," Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
You're not? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go up there and try to make it happen," he said. "I'm not going 
to wait for Lady Luck to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey likes to be logical about things, doesn't like people generalizing. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he is getting tired of hearing about what a lousy break for the 
Kings it was drawing Edmonton as a first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing people say it's rare to have two teams of this caliber meeting 
in the first round of the playoffs. Well, I would like to contradict that," 
Hrudey said. "I've been in the Patrick Division. Sometimes we've had the best 
and third-best teams in hockey meeting in the opening round. So, this is 
nothing new, speaking for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Trust us, Kel, it's new for a lot of the Kings. And it's definitely new for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings came out checking and hitting and belting Tuesday night, obviously 
eager not to give up without a fight. A couple minutes into the game, when Tim 
Watters and Tom Laidlaw laid out friend-turned-foe Jimmy Carson, you knew the 
Kings meant business. 
</P>
<P>
They got another good game out of the Great One, too. No, not Wayne Gretzky. 
The Great Kontos. Whatever got into this Kontos kid, the Kings hope it keeps 
getting into him. The kid has got six goals in five games, and he is skating 
about two inches off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Still Pretty Darn Good Gretzky had his best night of the 
playoffs, scoring a goal and assisting on two others. It's crunch-time in the 
National Hockey League, boys and girls, so look for Wayne to be earning his 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, what else inspired the Kings in this game? Luc Robitaille's first 
score of the playoffs? Sure, why not? 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got that truck off my back," said Robitaille, who always has an 
interesting way of putting things. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille was asked if that good-luck letter from the former President of the 
United States and Mr. Hockey himself, Ronald Reagan, had anything to do with 
the Kings' success. 
</P>
<P>
"It was neat," Robitaille said. "Of course, he didn't score any goals." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille also said he had never heard of anybody called the Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
"Gipper? I like it. Hey, I've learned another new word," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All this aside, the man of the hour clearly was Hrudey, who coined a new jock 
expression himself in the locker room, saying the Kings "have to take this 
thing one period at a time." 
</P>
<P>
One of his teammates came by his locker at that point, singing: "Hey, hey, 
Kelly Hrudey, you really are a cutie." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are alive; longer live the Kings.

WALTON, GRACE HIT HOME RUNS; CUBS WIN 4TH STRAIGHT 
</P>

Jerome Walton and Mark Grace both have something to prove. Each made his point 
Tuesday as the Chicago Cubs won their fourth straight game with a 5-4 victory 
over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, a rookie who earned the center field job in spring training, hit safely 
in his seventh straight game, homered and scored three runs, including the 
tie-breaker in the eighth inning. Grace, who joined the Cubs last season, hit 
his first homer in Wrigley Field and drove in three runs, including the 
game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got something to prove," said Walton, who's trying to make the jump from 
the double-A Eastern League. "Everybody said the Cubs were rushing me. All I'm 
trying to do is prove I can play in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
"He's been outstanding," Cubs Manager Don Zimmer said. "he has played seven 
games as good as you can play." 
</P>
<P>
Walton and Mitch Webster drew walks off losing pitcher Jose DeLeon, 1-1, to 
open the eighth. DeLeon was relieved by Todd Worrell and Walton and Webster 
pulled off a double steal. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg fouled out and Andre Dawson was walked intentionally to fill the 
bases. Ken Dayley, a left-hander, came in to pitch to the left-handed-hitting 
Grace -- with Worrell moved to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Grace grounded into a force play at second as Walton scored the tie-breaking 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost worked," said Herzog, who was looking for a double play. "Grace just 
didn't hit the ball hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog said he's switched a pitcher to the outfield "seven or eight times in 
the past." Zimmer said he wasn't surprised by the switch and had done the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"That move has been going on as long as there's been baseball," said Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Grace hit seven home runs as a rookie last year -- all on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about it," said Grace of his lack of power at Wrigley Field 
last season. "I knew it would happen eventually. The law of averages you know." 
</P>
<P>
Grace's homer, which gave the Cubs a 4-3 lead, came on a 3-0 pitch with two 
outs in the sixth after Dawson had singled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to know Zimmer has confidence in me," said Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Schiraldi, 1-0, was the winner and Mitch Williams picked up his third 
save. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals tied it 4-4 with a run in the seventh. Terry Pendleton led off 
with a single, chasing starter Greg Maddux, and Schiraldi walked Brunansky. 
Milt Thompson drove in the run with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Walton led off the Cubs first with his second homer, extending his hitting 
streak to seven games. He is hitting .357. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals went ahead 2-1 in the third when Vince Coleman singled and Pedro 
Guerrero hit his third homer, a 400-foot-plus drive that cleared the wall in 
left-center and landed on Waveland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs tied it in the bottom of the third. Walton beat out a bunt single, 
went to third on DeLeon's throwing error and scored on a bunt single by 
Webster. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals regained the lead in the sixth on successive singles by Thompson, 
Jose Oquendo and Tony Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux struck out six but gave up 11 hits before he left in the seventh.

EBERSOL IS NAMED HEAD OF NBC SPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, one of the creators of "Saturday Night Live," Tuesday was named 
the president of NBC Sports, effective May 1. 
</P>
<P>
He will replace Art Watson, who has been president of the network's sports 
division since 1979 and has been with NBC since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 54, will remain with the network as an executive vice-president until 
his anticipated retirement next year. In his new position, Watson will continue 
to be involved in rights negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol, 41, started at ABC Sports in 1967 as an Olympics researcher and became 
executive assistant to Roone Arledge, the department's president, in 1971. 
Ebersol also was a college football producer. 
</P>
<P>
At 28, Ebersol became an NBC vice-president after he and an independent 
producer, Lorne Michaels, created "Saturday Night Live" in 1975. Ebersol, 
currently the producer of "Later With Bob Costas," is married to actress Susan 
Saint James. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise. It had been speculated that when 
Watson retired, either Ken Schanzer, current executive vice-president of 
sports, or Al Barber, the network's executive vice-president who oversees 
sports, would become president. LARRY STEWART

DAVIS PREPARES FOR PROXY FIGHT BY SUING NWA OVER 'POISON PILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millionaire oilman Marvin Davis sued NWA Inc. on Tuesday in an attempt to 
overturn the airline company's newly adopted "poison pill" defense in what is 
shaping up as a fight for control of NWA's board. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the poison pill stands in the way of a proxy fight he "expects to 
conduct" at the airline company's May 15 shareholders meeting. A spokesman for 
Davis would not elaborate on the statement, which strongly suggests that Davis 
plans to nominate his own slate of directors for NWA's board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NWA sued Davis to try to stop him from talking to its unions. NWA 
charged that Davis illegally interfered with its relationship with its unions, 
which represent 34,000 of its 38,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Davis said Davis will fight the suit, which is scheduled for 
a hearing Thursday in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis. The spokesman said 
the unions have a right to "satisfy themselves about the plans and intentions 
of a new owner." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits came four days after NWA rejected as inadequate Davis' 
$2.62-billion bid for the company, which owns Northwest Airlines. Davis, whose 
empire includes a Denver oil company, California golf courses and Colorado ski 
resorts, offered $90 a share for the airline company. Northwest has more 
flights to Japan and other North Pacific points than any other U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle apparently helped drive up the price of NWA shares, which rose 
$1.25 Tuesday, closing at $88.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Observers said it would be hard for Davis to mount a successful proxy fight so 
quickly. "If he spent enough money to publicize it, I suppose he could do it," 
said Louis A. Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with the investment firm 
of Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
NWA made no comment on Davis' lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware, where NWA 
is incorporated. The plan would place special stock-purchase rights in the 
hands of shareholders in the event of a takeover, making the company more 
expensive to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has not disclosed how he would finance the acquisition, although he said 
he would not sell airliners or routes to do it. He is widely expected to sell 
the airline's Japanese real estate, which airline analysts say is worth between 
$350 million and $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who owns 3% of NWA's shares, is not the only one interested in buying 
Northwest. The company said previously that it had been approached by a group 
that owns 4.9% of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
The group includes Los Angeles investor Al Checci and Gary Wilson, a former NWA 
director and chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co., according to William 
Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's airline division. The Teamsters 
represent Northwest's flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
NWA is also considering a management buyout that would include an employee 
stock ownership plan for its pilots, Genoese said. 
</P>
<P>
Genoese said he has talked briefly with representatives of the Davis group and 
with the Checci group, and said "we can work with" either one. He said he is 
disenchanted with Steven Rothmeier, NWA's chairman, in part because he has 
insisted on a two-tier pay scale for flight attendants. "He's not a people-type 
guy," said Genoese. 
</P>
<P>
The union official said Davis indicated that he is willing to consider doing 
away with the two-tier pay scale, under which newly hired employees are paid 
according to a scale substantially lower than the one covering other workers. 
Genoese said he could not disclose what he discussed with Checci's group. 
</P>
<P>
NWA is in contract negotiations with its pilots, and a company spokesman said 
an ESOP is under negotiation. However, the spokesman said that the company does 
not view an ESOP as a defensive measure. Several companies, most recently 
Polaroid, have successfully fought takeovers by placing large blocks of stock 
in employee hands. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Northwest's pilots said the union is interested in an ESOP but 
not necessarily to protect the airline company from a takeover.

FORMER CHIEF OF CONTINENTAL JOINS UEBERROTH'S TEAM

The slate of airline executives being put together by Peter V. Ueberroth to run 
Eastern Airlines began to take shape Tuesday with the confirmation that he has 
recruited the highly regarded ex-president of Continental Airlines, Martin R. 
Shugrue Jr., to play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue left Continental -- which is owned by the same company that owns 
Eastern -- in February after reportedly being fired by Frank Lorenzo, the boss 
of parent Texas Air Corp. and the man negotiating the sale of Eastern to 
Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
The exact role that Shugrue -- who began his airline career as a pilot at Pan 
American World Airways in 1968 and became Pan Am's chief operating officer -- 
would play in the reorganized airline has not yet been defined. 
</P>
<P>
"He is working with us. He is part of our group," said J. Thomas Talbot, the 
Newport Beach real estate investor and former airline executive who is 
Ueberroth's partner in the airline venture. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Los Angeles over the weekend, Ueberroth said a number of airline 
executives were part of the group he is heading to take over the nearly idled 
carrier. On Tuesday, he confirmed that Shugrue, 48, was a member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We think very highly of him," said Ueberroth. "But no role has been spelled 
out for him." 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue, who was president of Continental for a year and who still has an 
office in Houston where Continental is headquartered, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
He left Continental when Lorenzo brought in D. Joseph Corr, who had been 
president of Trans World Airlines, as president. Some observers said at the 
time that he had been fired by Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Starkman, an analyst with Paine Webber, a New York investment company, 
said when Shugrue left Continental: "There are two kinds of people, those who 
get along with Frank Lorenzo and those who don't, and I guess he fits in the 
latter category. I would guess he was not satisfied in his role." 
</P>
<P>
At Pan Am, where Shugrue started as a pilot and flight engineer on a Boeing 
707, he moved into management but lost his job in early 1988 in a personnel 
shake-up at the financially ailing carrier. Analysts said he would be a 
valuable asset to Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty would be well suited," said Edmond Greenslet, an analyst with ESG 
Services of Cos Cob, Conn. "He has certainly had experience with troubled 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Another name mentioned on Tuesday as part of the Ueberroth team was William R. 
Howard, who resigned in 1987 as head of Piedmont Airlines when it was acquired 
by USAir. He then became chairman and chief executive of Airline Acquisition 
Corp., the company formed by the pilots of United Airline to take over that 
company. Had they been successful, Howard would have headed the airline.

IMF TO GRANT $4 BILLION IN LOANS TO MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENT SETS STAGE FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO REDUCE COMMERCIAL BANK DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico announced Tuesday that it has reached an agreement for $4 billion in 
loans from the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for negotiations 
with commercial banks and for Mexico to become the first beneficiary of U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's debt-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
The accord with the IMF marked a victory for the government of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, which had been hoping for a sign of debt relief from 
foreign creditors to bolster its standing at home. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreement should make it easier for the government to meet a July 31 
deadline to renegotiate a wage-and-price-control pact that is at the heart of 
its economic reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said Mexico will receive a three-year, 
$3.64-billion loan. He said the government expects another $500-million loan 
from the IMF in 1989 to compensate for foreign currency lost through lower oil 
prices during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Aspe said that a similar agreement with the World Bank is to follow soon and 
that he will begin negotiations with commercial banks on April 19. Mexico is 
seeking a total of $7 billion a year in new loans or reductions on its 
$102-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although bankers have made no promises to Mexico, they have indicated privately 
that they expect the talks to go smoothly. Aspe said the IMF agreement "will be 
a factor that plays in our favor" in negotiations with the commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
The accord with Mexico was the first that the 151-country IMF has completed 
since the Brady initiative was outlined on March 10. In line with the plan, the 
IMF indicated that Mexico could use a substantial portion of the money to 
underwrite debt reduction efforts, such as exchanging fresh government 
securities in return for banks' discounting their loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been eager to find a country that can benefit from 
the plan to prove the credibility of the proposal to other Third World 
countries. Many critics have charged that the plan is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Public Spending 
</P>
<P>
Aspe called the agreement "an endorsement of Mexico's economic strategy," and 
added, "It is a recognition by the international community of the efforts this 
country has made in the way of economic stabilization and structural change." 
</P>
<P>
A wage-and-price-control pact for the past 1 1/2 years has brought triple-digit 
inflation down to about 55% last year and a projected 18%-25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the Mexican government has dramatically reduced public 
spending through layoffs and the sale of state-owned businesses. It has opened 
the country's borders to imports and is in the process of liberalizing foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that any other Latin American country could quickly reach such a 
favorable agreement with the IMF because none has taken such radical steps. 
Venezuela has been cited as a possibility but would have to undertake major 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement makes no new adjustment demands on Mexico. It recognizes the 
country's need to stimulate a stagnant economy and a goal of 6% annual growth 
by the end of Salinas' term in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico says it has been paying 6% of its gross national product annually over 
the past six years to service its debt. The agreement acknowledges that the net 
transfer of resources out of the country should be reduced to less than 2%, 
Aspe said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not require an immediate major devaluation and could help 
Mexico repatriate the tens of billions of dollars that have fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is very positive for Mexico," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a 
private economic analyst. In making economic growth a priority, he said, "The 
IMF is making a U-turn with regards to adjustment programs." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico last signed a letter of intent for an IMF standby agreement in July, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial bankers have said they are looking for a "menu" of debt-reduction 
options from Mexico. The government has floated a plan to banks with four 
options for reducing medium- and long-term government debt that has met with a 
favorable preliminary response. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities include a swap of loans for new securities with the same face 
value but with interest rates at about half of the 11.5% Mexico now pays and an 
exchange of existing loans for new securities equal to about half the value, 
but with interest rates comparable to those Mexico now pays. 
</P>
<P>
Both options would include credit enhancement incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities are for new loans, including the capitalization of interest 
payments.

Damages Set in Butcher Case: U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar ordered C. H. 
Butcher Jr. and others to pay $19.3 million in damages for a plot to hide the 
bankrupt financier's wealth when his banking empire collapsed. A federal jury 
last month found that C. H. Butcher Sr. and two disbarred Atlanta lawyers 
conspired with the younger Butcher to help keep some of his wealth. The jury 
found the senior Butcher, Robert L. Schwind and David L. Hill guilty under the 
Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act. C. H. Butcher Jr. and his 
brother, 1978 Tennessee Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jake Butcher, were 
convicted in connection with the 1983 failure of their twin banking empires, 
Southern Industrial Banking Corp. and United American Bank chain.

Shell Denies S. Africa Pullout: Royal Dutch/Shell Group denied a South African 
radio report that it was about to pull out of South Africa. The announcement 
followed a report by state-owned South African Broadcasting Corp. that Shell 
was close to announcing plans to divest. Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, the 
world's largest oil company, has come under heavy fire from anti-apartheid 
campaigners around the world for doing business in South Africa, a move they 
argue helps perpetuate Pretoria's regime of racial segregation. Analysts say 
about 1% of worldwide Shell profits originate in South Africa.

HOUSE PANEL DILUTES PARTS OF S&amp;L RESCUE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A House panel, defying a threatened presidential veto, voted Tuesday to water 
down tough new capital requirements contained in the Bush Administration's 
savings and loan rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the subcommittee on financial institutions of the House Banking Committee 
later restored some of the capital provisions, and additional changes are 
expected as the panel continues its markup of the bill today. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation and the capital requirements it contains are the cornerstone of 
the Administration's effort to spend $50 billion to close or merge insolvent 
S&amp;Ls across the country. 
</P>
<P>
By a 24-23 vote, the subcommittee diluted a requirement to force thrifts to 
back loans with more of their own capital. The amendment, sponsored by Reps. 
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) and Stan Parris (R-Va.), provided a much looser 
definition of capital by including such items as goodwill, subordinated debt, 
deferred loan losses and mortgage servicing rights. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee later re-tightened the definition of capital involving 
subordinated debt and deferred loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the amended bill would allow institutions failing to meet the capital 
standard to grow by about 7% to 8% a year. The Administration wants to bar 
capital-deficient thrifts from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the full Banking Committee, said 
the key amendment approved by the subcommittee Tuesday embraces 
"smoke-and-mirrors accounting and smoke-and-mirrors capital." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate has yet to begin work on its own version of the complex 
Administration bailout plan, which would raise the funds needed to shut down or 
sell off some 500 insolvent thrifts and restore the integrity of the federal 
deposit insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials have been warning for a week that any move to dilute the key 
provision of the plan requiring savings and loan institutions to maintain 
capital reserves equal to 6% of their assets beginning in June, 1991, would 
draw a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
But a narrow bipartisan majority agreed to go along with the proposal by 
Annunzio and Parris to cut the requirement to 3% and to count as up to half of 
that 3% such non-cash assets as goodwill and long-term subordinated debt. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, opponents of the proposal said, the amendment would cut the capital 
requirement to 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, a consolidation of some 40 separate proposals to weaken the 
capital requirements, had been hammered out over the weekend in a series of 
meetings among senior subcommittee members. 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, it was still not clear whether the Administration would accept 
the amendment in its final form. But over lunch, subcommittee aides said, 
Richard C. Breeden, a White House assistant who specializes in the thrift 
industry, urged Republicans on the panel to oppose the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, seven Republicans joined 17 Democrats in supporting the change. They 
were opposed by 11 Democrats and 12 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's position was supported in a letter sent to the committee 
by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He said he would not like to see 
accounting tricks used to cover up the lack of adequate capital, which he 
defined as common stock, retained earnings and other genuine financial 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Any significant erosion of these provisions invites continuation of the 
conditions that have led to the present crisis," Greenspan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has said he may recommend that Bush veto 
the measure if the S&amp;L industry succeeds in an effort to win amendments 
that would relax the capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a veto threat hanging over this bill," Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) 
said.

Scott Paper Sells Northwest Land: Philadelphia-based Scott Paper Co. will sell 
194,000 acres of timberlands in western Washington to Crown Pacific Ltd. for 
about $230 million. Scott first announced plans to sell its Northwest 
timberlands in 1983, and the agreement with Crown, of Portland, Ore., 
represents all but about 16,000 acres of the land to be sold. Pulp and paper 
manufacturing at Scott's Everett, Wash., mill, which typically receives only a 
small amount of its wood fiber from the Northwest timberlands, will not be 
affected. The agreement calls for Crown to supply wood fiber to the mill from 
the purchased land. The sale, which is subject to approval by Scott's board, is 
expected to be completed this summer.

PURCHASE DEAL IS RENEGOTIATED; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN SAVINGS ELECTS ROUSSELOT CHAIRMAN

<P>
Former congressman John H. Rousselot, who is leading a bid to buy Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan, was elected chairman and chief executive of the Irvine 
thrift on Tuesday. At the same time, Rousselot said he has renegotiated his 
purchase agreement with the S&amp;L's parent firm. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal reduces the purchase price by $88 million to $200 million; removes 
four employees of Lincoln and its parent, American Continental Corp., from the 
investor group, and turns the deal more favorably toward Rousselot and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Necessary 
</P>
<P>
Both Rousselot's election and the new deal are designed to win quick regulatory 
approval of the troubled sale, said Rousselot and Mark M. Connally, a spokesman 
for Phoenix-based American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of Lincoln, Rousselot replaces Robin S. Symes, who resigned in 
mid-January. As chief executive, he replaces Ray Fidel, who quit as president 
and chief executive Friday. The position of president will remain vacant for 
now, Connally said. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, who has been working daily on the sale with staff members of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said changes in management and terms were 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank board made it clear last week that the application would not be 
making progress if it included members of Lincoln and American Continental," he 
said. "The bank board made it clear it wanted all new people." 
</P>
<P>
Connally said Fidel, who previously had hoped to stay on with Lincoln, stepped 
down as part of the effort by the S&amp;L and its parent "to convey that we are 
willing to make the changes necessary" to get the sale approved. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, who would be chairman of Lincoln after the proposed purchase, would 
give up his post as chief executive to a manager approved by regulators. One of 
the new terms, he said, is that all directors and top officers would be 
"pre-approved" by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Other new terms include: 
</P>
<P>
* The purchase price was reduced to $200 million from $288.75 million, and the 
non-voting preferred stock that American Continental would get in return would 
not pay a dividend unless Lincoln is profitable. Charles H. Keating Jr., 
American Continental's chairman, picked up Lincoln in late 1984 for $51 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* American Continental would put $50 million in cash or securities into Lincoln 
to recapitalize the S&amp;L and would get nothing in return. Previously, the 
company was to put in $15 million and two New York businessmen were to put in 
$35 million, and all three were to receive preferred stock. The New York 
businessmen are no longer part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
* The new buyers would raise up to $150 million in new capital over the next 
three years. No such commitment existed previously. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and his family would personally guarantee repayment of $428 million 
in promissory notes that American Continental would give for the acquisition of 
three major Lincoln assets: the Phoenician Resort and the Crescent Hotel, both 
in the Phoenix area, and a 20% stake in General Oriental Investments Ltd., run 
by British financier Sir James Goldsmith. The $215-million note for the GOIL 
stock would be paid in three years instead of 10 years and other terms were 
tightened in an effort to persuade Keating to repay the notes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
* Lincoln would be converted into a federally chartered S&amp;L and would 
return to the San Francisco supervisory district, from which it was removed 
last year after complaints from Keating about hostile treatment. 
</P>
<P>
* Four employees of Lincoln and American Continental who were to run the 
S&amp;L are out. Rousselot has brought in new investors with no connection to 
the company or the S&amp;L, but the names are being withheld temporarily. Four 
of them, however, could be California businessmen who have agreed to join the 
board with Rousselot, who will give them the option of investing. 
</P>
<P>
The four are Thomas Kemp, former chief executive of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of 
Los Angeles and brother of U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack 
Kemp; Edward Barker, former commissioner of the State Department of Savings and 
Loan under former Gov. Ronald Reagan; Jerry Niemeyer, former chairman of Sears 
Savings Bank, and Ralph Alfieri, an Arcadia builder. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln operates 29 branches throughout Southern California and had $5.5 
billion in assets at the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental posted a $36-million loss for the third quarter and 
financial analysts are waiting for its annual filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. That filing is due Monday and is widely expected to 
contain more bad news.

PRIME SEEKS BIDS TO BEAT MAI'S OFFER 
</P>

Prime Computer, trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid from MAI Basic Four, 
announced Tuesday that it is seeking buyout proposals from investors willing to 
pay more than MAI has offered for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the bitter takeover battle began in November, Prime has contended 
that the offer from Tustin-based MAI, which amounts to $1.3 billion or $20 a 
share, is too low. But Tuesday's announcement that Prime has directed its 
financial advisers to actively negotiate with potential buyers marked the first 
time that the Natick, Mass., company has publicly stated that it is open to 
friendly offers. 
</P>
<P>
New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of MAI, said in a statement that 
MAI will continue to pursue its tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We enthusiastically endorse their proposal if they intend to sell Prime to the 
highest bidder," LeBow said. "However, if this is another one of Prime's 
delaying tactics, we intend to vigorously oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Prime closed at $19.875, up $1.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, 
and shares of MAI rose to $8.75, up 87.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts labeled Prime's move as a stall tactic aimed at buying time for Prime 
to find another bidder or coax MAI to increase its offer. In its announcement, 
Prime said it rescheduled its annual meeting from May 12 to June 14 to provide 
more time for negotiations to sell the company. The move also delays the 
anticipated shareholder vote on a proposal by MAI to replace Prime's board with 
a new set of directors. 
</P>
<P>
That delay, some analysts said, could hurt MAI's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bagner, an attorney for MAI, said the company is skeptical about Prime's 
motives for seeking a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the company asked for bidders now because the 
upcoming proxy fight on the makeup of the company's board will take place 
before the end of the second quarter, when Prime expects to show the results of 
cost-cutting measures taken last year.

TIME'S CHIEF DEFENDS MERGER WITH WARNER

Noting the continuing sales of American media and entertainment properties to 
foreign buyers, Time Inc. Chairman Richard C. Munro on Tuesday called the 
proposed $18-billion merger of his company with Warners Communications Inc. 
"good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
He made the assertion -- and took indirect shots at network critics of the deal 
-- in a speech in which he ticked off 10 entertainment or book companies that 
have been or will be bought by foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world seems to already understand that, by the middle of the 
next decade, the communications business will be composed of a limited number 
of global giants," Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Time-Warner merger "guarantees that at least one of the giants is 
going to be American," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The merger, announced March 5, will create the world's largest media and 
entertainment conglomerate, with interests in cable programming, cable systems, 
books, magazines, records, movies and television programming. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last week, CBS Inc. President Laurence A. Tisch 
slammed the proposed merger as a poor deal for Time shareholders and dismissed 
as "nonsense" the companies' argument that media companies must combine to 
compete globally in today's markets. 
</P>
<P>
Munro, speaking at a luncheon held by the Cable Advertising Bureau at the 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, didn't specifically respond to the comments of Tisch, 
who was in Los Angeles on Tuesday addressing a luncheon of the Hollywood Radio 
and Television Society. 
</P>
<P>
But Munro dryly noted that "some of our domestic competitors don't like this 
deal" and drew laughter when he said they are "suffering from what Sigmund 
Freud might describe as a chronic case of merger envy. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice to them is to save their energy to invest in finding the kind of 
match that will help keep them competitive in global markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three major networks actually has said it opposes the Time-Warner 
merger, which still faces Federal Communications Commission and shareholder 
approval. But CBS and NBC each say the merger illustrates their need to be 
freed from government restrictions on their participation in ownership of 
programs and cable-TV systems.

FALL FASHION: A BICOASTAL BLITZ; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA DESIGNERS SHOW HERE AND, IN BREAK WITH TRADITION, IN THE BIG APPLE; 
SUITS REIGN

In a bold move that challenges an outmoded stereotype, five Los Angeles 
designers showed their fall fashion collections in Manhattan Tuesday, right 
along with the biggest names from Seventh Avenue. Rosemary Brantley, Mark 
Eisen, Karl Logan, Antony Moorcroft and Glenn Williams sent their styles down 
the runway at the Manhattan Theatre Center, just days after most Los Angeles 
designers showed their fall collections in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to include California designs that the New York fashion press would 
take seriously," said Joie Davidow, editor-in-chief of L.A. Style magazine, 
which sponsored the show featuring tailored sportswear. "In New York they still 
think of Los Angeles as a place to buy fun dresses, but not suits, jackets or 
tailored pants. I hope to wake up the members of the Eastern fashion press who 
don't even know that L.A. designers have fall collections." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there was reason to wonder. The city's cutting-edge designers 
built their reputation on lightweight, unconstructed clothes better suited to 
Sunbelt climates. They left heavy fabrics and precision tailoring to the East, 
and put their strongest efforts into spring collections, since that was what 
store buyers and the national fashion press expected of them. This first effort 
gets mixed reviews. While the designers proved they can make clothes to 
withstand East Coast winters, they betrayed their contemporary roots with 
styles much less sophisticated than those of the New York designers. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Brantley made the strongest presentation. She showed easy-cut 
trousers, swing jackets and ankle-length pleated skirts in soft fabrics and 
finished each outfit with a bowler-style hat. The audience liked her best. It 
was a young crowd, with more retailers than fashion press. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eisen, whose styles have been featured at Bergdorf-Goodman, showed 
charcoal denim suits. 
</P>
<P>
Antony Moorcroft was the wit of the show. His fake fur mini-dress with matching 
turban made the audience giggle with delight. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Logan used banker's gray flannel for suits with jackets that draped and 
folded, usually once too often. 
</P>
<P>
And Glenn Williams played it too safe with his dark navy blue suits. 
</P>
<P>
The show followed Calvin Klein's fall collection, which didn't serve it well. 
After Klein's meticulous tailoring and exquisite fabrics, the Los Angeles 
designers seemed out of their league. Ironically, they may have been cast in a 
better light if they had shown with their LA contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, a number of LA designers, including Mark Eisen, staged their 
showings here, in their traditional, more informal way. 
</P>
<P>
The fall lineup started Thursday with Jill Richards making her comeback after a 
year's absence. During a cozy show in her Beverly Hills home, the red-haired 
designer proved she is still "Ruffles Richards." Among her best entries is a 
black chiffon jumpsuit with ruffle-covered legs, jeweled buttons, white satin 
collar and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Richards also offers sleek gowns and cocktail suits in satin and velvet 
combinations. She shares what looks like a Los Angeles fascination with the 
Great White Blouse. Richards had two versions: white satin worn with black, 
all-over sequin pants, matching bolero jacket and beret, as well as embroidered 
organza, with balloon sleeves, worn under rhinestone-decorated overalls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tailored Suits 
</P>
<P>
At the California Mart the following evening, the Great White Blouse appeared 
under the jacket of a wool suit, by Dorothy Schoelen for Platinum, that had a 
"Dangerous Liaisons" neckline. Along with the neckline, favored by a number of 
designers, the show was filled with vests and pants of various lengths and 
fullness, ranging from basket-weave culottes by Kristin J. to tight, stove-pipe 
knits from Perry White. Mignon showed beautifully tailored suits both with long 
skirts and long, almost bell-bottom trousers. 
</P>
<P>
At Union Station Saturday night, over 500 people sat in the heat and tried to 
imagine a time when the fall fashions on the runway would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Sharp's version of the great white blouse was worn under a period-piece 
velvet vest. Buttons, some jeweled, some gold, played a role in many 
collections and showed up well on black suits by Lisa Ann. Saelee put 
interesting collars on white blouses and used huge hats to top off the "Little 
Dorrit" velvet riding suits. Mark Eisen's collection included denim suits 
(pants and skirt versions) as well as wool boucle suits with matching coats 
that have striking satin linings. 
</P>
<P>
David Dart's collection for Force One was ethnic-tinged; the silky pants 
ensembles in orange-and-raspberry paisley print were seductively wrapped in 
stoles or shawls and tied with fringed cord belts. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the L.A. collections, fall will be rich with very suitable suits 
-- a particularly strong theme among those who showed in New York. Also 
plentiful were pants (nearly all of them cropped above the ankle), ethnic 
prints, tapestry patterns, scarfs (tied in unusual configurations and often 
draped like serapes), lightweight topcoats and enough white blouses to sink a 
Pilgrim ship.

FALL FASHION: A BICOASTAL BLITZ; 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAZA'S THE PLACE AS MANHATTAN'S FINEST GET COLORFUL, BUT MAINLY PLAY IT 
SAFE

<P>
As the fall fashion showings continue through this week, many of them at the 
Plaza Hotel, Ivana Trump is a frequent hostess. Since her husband, Donald, 
purchased the hotel last summer, she is its president. And she has taken front 
row seats at the shows held there, careful to change her outfit several times a 
day so that her labels match those on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"When my husband bought the Plaza I thought to myself, 'I like fashion,' " she 
said, suggesting how it happened that more than a dozen designers are launching 
their fall lines in the hotel's regal public rooms. (In seasons past, their 
shows have occurred all around town.) 
</P>
<P>
But Ruth Finley, who publishes the Fashion Calendar and schedules the 
semiannual New York shows, said there was more to it than that. "Ivana is 
anxious to make the Plaza a fashion hotel," she explained. The cause? 
Socialites-for-style. 
</P>
<P>
Designers with some of the strongest social connections in the country are on 
the hotel's fashion roster this week. Among them, Carolina Herrera, who dresses 
Jacqueline Onassis, and Arnold Scaasi, preferred by Mrs. Bush. Bill Blass, a 
favorite of both the current and the previous First Ladies, showed his 
collection at the Hotel Pierre across the street, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Agreement 
</P>
<P>
These designers agree about certain things. Skirts for fall are narrow and knee 
length or thereabouts. Legs are covered with thicker hosiery, some of it ribbed 
like celery. And a woman can't have enough cashmere crewneck sweaters in her 
wardrobe. (Herrera tied them around the waistline of trousers, adding a gold 
brooch near the knot for decoration. Blass showed them in trompe l'oeil 
effects, for a sweater-over-the-shoulders illusion knitted into one garment.) 
Suits with pants, especially cut on the wider side, are still more popular than 
skirts. And colors are monochromatic from the shoulders to the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
As statements go these fashion views are as safe as saying all the right things 
at a society dinner. But then, there are suggestions of individuality. At Blass 
they took the form of animal print silk items in iridescent gold, copper and 
bronze for evening. He mixed long, flowing animal-print skirts and matching 
stoles with simple cashmere sweaters, or animal print metallic blazers and 
matching gloves with short, black skirts for a sporty elegant effect. 
</P>
<P>
For his California customers, including Nancy Reagan and friends, Blass showed 
a sleeveless sheath with a triangle-shaped cut-out in back between the 
shoulders. He featured it in glen plaid, soft gray and camel color wool. 
</P>
<P>
Star watchers were not happy that Blass separated his celebrity customers from 
the press, showing his collection at 10 o'clock for them, and noon for 
everybody else. That cut down considerably on the glitterati in the 
media-filled audience. Perhaps Tina Brown, editor of Vanity Fair magazine, was 
the hottest name at the later show. Her suit was scarlet and so were her 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera invited everybody at the same hour. But Paloma Picasso and Brooke 
Hayward quietly took the last row, far away from the press. Among media stars 
at that show, Anna Wintour, the controversial new editor of Vogue magazine, sat 
in front with her sunglasses on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fashionable Departures 
</P>
<P>
Herrera's personal fashion departures were all in color. She tied cableknit 
sweaters around the waist of jewel-neckline shifts, mixing violet with aqua or 
burgundy with powder blue for a vibrant alternative to the little black dress. 
But her show stoppers were a group of motorcycle jackets in black velvet, 
decorated with brass nailheads and bold scale zippers. The big question in the 
audience at that show: "Will Jackie Onassis wear one?" 
</P>
<P>
Scaasi's best ideas were colorful evening outfits. He showed color-block 
chiffon gowns, green with blue or orange with violet. Other entrance makers 
were his simply shaped ball gowns in rich brocade fabrics. He showed soft gray 
suits and fitted, knee-length gray dresses with deep, mink toques as afternoon 
wear fit for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The New Guard 
</P>
<P>
Two designers who showed earlier this week are described as part of New York's 
"new guard." One, Charlotte Neuville, started out in fashion as an assistant to 
the late Perry Ellis and now has her own label. The other, Marc Jacobs, is 
actually replacing Ellis in his own company. Jacobs showed his first collection 
under the Ellis banner this week. 
</P>
<P>
Neuville designs clothes with a thrift shop, menswear feeling that look right 
for college girls or young career women. For fall her suits, in unusual shades 
of mustard or mauve, went with skirts hiked well above the knees, and oversized 
jackets nearly as long as the skirts. Her pants were often cut wide and cropped 
above the ankle, like vintage menswear. 
</P>
<P>
She featured sidewalk-sweeping steamer coats in colors such as Army green. And 
she mixed color in creative combinations -- burgundy with plum and deep 
chartreuse for a pant suit with a tailored blouse -- which Ellis also did well. 
</P>
<P>
In this collection she topped several short-skirted suits with sporty, celery 
green or smoky gray fox coats from her fur collection, a new addition to her 
label. Her evening clothes in particular were reminiscent of the sort of 
menswear items that women like for themselves. She showed extra-long jackets in 
iridescent fabrics, over matching pants with cuffs, and men's "bathrobe" coats 
in translucent fabrics to wear over matching pant suits. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Jacobs' collection promised to be the most exciting of the day, but it was 
actually disappointment for many. Jacobs, who turned 26 on Sunday, kept up the 
young, witty attitude his pre-Ellis collections have been known for. And 
certain items in this show worked well. But not all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Hits List 
</P>
<P>
His hits included allusions to summer camp clothes -- satin, jewel-toned parkas 
and satin life-vests like those required for river raft trips, gave a new look 
to his skin-tight, suede jeans. A stars 'n' stripes stole in oyster and black 
was a playful piece that he wrapped around a strapless, vertical-stripe evening 
dress in black and white. And his egg-shaped, mohair sweaters that grazed the 
thighs looked young and lively over tights and thigh-high suede boots. In the 
audience, actress Susan Sarandon, who is about to have a baby, said the big 
sweaters were just what she would like to wear these days. 
</P>
<P>
Less successful were the neo-hippie wrap skirts with rows of multicolor fringe, 
the heavy tweed pant suits with knickers, and the '60s-inspired, tight pants 
tucked into tall boots, worn with fitted, tailored shirts and vests in what 
appeared to be aggressively haphazard combinations. 
</P>
<P>
But the mistakes at this show began well before the clothes came down the 
runway. Getting inside the building was like passing inspection for a snooty 
night club. On windy Lafayette Street, outside the door, ushers as young or 
even younger than Jacobs himself cruised the long line of people holding 
tickets and pulled out their favorites, hustling them quickly inside. Store 
retailers seemed to have special clout. The ushers wore T-shirts that read 
"Verry Ellis." But people who knew Ellis to be a gracious man were put off 
before they saw even one of the not-very Ellis fashion designs inside.

IRVINE CITY COUNCIL DEBATES REMOVAL OF GAYS CLAUSE IN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Irvine City Council, faced with a petition by a traditional-values group 
calling for the removal of a clause on homosexual rights from the city's 
human-rights ordinance, was debating late Tuesday night whether to seek further 
study of the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
The council was faced with either eliminating the wording or putting the issue 
on the citywide ballot after the group, the Irvine Values Coalition, submitted 
a petition with valid signatures of more than 10% the city's voters last month. 
</P>
<P>
A third alternative under consideration late Tuesday night was delaying a vote 
until the city attorney could study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The council could place the measure -- which would remove the words sexual 
orientation from a city ordinance banning discrimination against a number of 
groups -- on the Nov. 7, 1989, ballot in conjunction with a school district 
election. Or, it could set the referendum for a vote on June 5, 1990, the next 
City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Peotter, president of the coalition, said Tuesday that he favors the 
June, 1990, election because he does not want the ballot measure to cost the 
city money. It would cost $35,000 to consolidate it with the school election 
and $65,000 to hold a special election, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Peotter had only a handful of supporters with him at the council session, 
saying a show of force was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for further discussion because his group has accomplished its 
goal of requiring a citywide vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (council members) have limited choices," Peotter said. "It's no longer 
if, it's when." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance forbade discrimination on the basis of race, color, 
religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status and physical handicaps -- 
provisions relatively non-controversial nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
But the ordinance also forbade discrimination on the basis of "sexual 
preference," and a religion-based opposition soon arose, protesting that the 
ordinance, in effect, endorsed homosexuality as a socially acceptable life 
style. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ordinance came before the City Council in July, the Irvine 
Values Coalition had been organized to fight it. Religious leaders and 
conservative family groups dominated a 5-hour council hearing on the ordinance, 
denouncing the measure as protection for perversity. But the City Council voted 
4 to 0 to adopt the ordinance, which went into effect in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Peotter, 31, an architect and father of two, the 
coalition began circulating referendum petitions. Support came from a group of 
Orange County's most conservative legislators -- Reps. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) and William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), and Assemblymen Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
After 6 months of work, the coalition submitted petitions containing about 
7,000 signatures, far more than the 5,381 needed to force action by the City 
Council. City Clerk Nancy C. Lacey announced March 29 that the signatures had 
been verified and the matter put on Tuesday's City Council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the council had little discretion: It was mandated by 
law to either remove the reference to "sexual preference" as the referendum 
demanded, or place the issue on the city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
According to James Meeker, associate professor of social ecology at UC Irvine, 
about 100 cities in the United States have adopted laws protecting homosexuals 
from discrimination -- among them Los Angeles, San Francisco and Laguna Beach 
-- and Wisconsin has passed a law.

INSURERS' COURT VICTORY STIRS ANGER;

RULING ENRAGES FAMILIES SEEKING PAYOFF FOR CRACKS

Katherine Weatherill was leafing through the morning paper Tuesday when she saw 
the story and lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impulse was rage," she recalled. "I couldn't believe it. The 
insurance companies had won again at our expense." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherill and her husband, Bill, a retired aerospace engineer, are among 
several hundred homeowners who in recent years have waged a costly and 
emotionally draining legal struggle with insurance carriers to win compensation 
for damage to their homes in La Palma, Cypress and parts of southeast Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walls, Foundations Crack 
</P>
<P>
Like many neighbors in the 27-year-old tract on La Palma's west side, the 
Weatherills have witnessed the foundation of their two-story home bulge and 
break apart and seen cracks appear on interior walls. 
</P>
<P>
Theories about the cause are as numerous as reports of damage in the 
upper-middle-class neighborhood of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little disagreement among the Weatherills and their friends on 
Bellhaven Street as to who should pay to repair their homes: insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Weatherill's emotions boiled over Tuesday as she read the paper. In 
San Francisco, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld a lower-court 
decision that denied insurance benefits to another La Palma couple who filed a 
claim after finding cracks in the foundation of their home. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was denied by State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., which said the 
damage was caused, at least in part, by earth movement, specifically the 
expansion and contraction of the soil under their foundation -- a condition 
excluded from coverage in their homeowners policy. 
</P>
<P>
The couple argued that earth movement is the result of sulfates in the soil, 
allegedly a condition covered by the policy. 
</P>
<P>
But State Farm maintained that because non-covered earth movement caused the 
cracks, it had the right to withhold benefits, no matter what other factors 
contributed to the earth movement. 
</P>
<P>
This position has been widely adopted in the industry, with an estimated 90% of 
homeowner policies in California today incorporating the principle. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling was widely viewed in legal circles as a significant victory for 
insurers because it may further limit the companies' obligation to make good on 
claims of property damage. A federal court interpreting state law cannot bind 
state courts, but its rulings can be influential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 30 Ruling on Damage 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, in another blow to policyholders, the state Supreme Court limited 
the ability of homeowners to collect property damage caused by landslides, 
earthquakes or other natural disasters by ruling that insurance companies must 
pay only when a policy covers the "predominant" or primary cause of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage for disasters is excluded under most standard policies, also called 
"all-risk" policies. 
</P>
<P>
But some lower courts have held that homeowners can collect benefits when 
damage results from a combination of covered risks, such as faulty 
construction, or uncovered risks, such as earthslides. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based attorney Patrick E. Catalano, who specializes in insurance 
litigation, said Monday's decision could further erode the value of homeowner 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has taken the position that your homeowner's policy is basically 
worth only the paper it is written on," he said. "And that may not be much 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several major insurance companies disagreed and 
characterized dire warnings of reduced coverage as political hype meant to 
rally the public against an industry already under fire on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bash the Insurance Industry' 
</P>
<P>
"It has become fashionable to bash the insurance industry," a State Farm 
spokesman said, "and there are those who will take this ruling and run with it, 
attempting to make great hay at our expense. In our eyes, the ruling simply 
defined a gray area in the law, and from that standpoint it was important." 
</P>
<P>
The significance of Monday's ruling was not lost on Weatherill. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband bought their five-bedroom house 26 years ago. It was their 
ticket to retirement, an investment they hoped to cash out once their two 
children had grown and Weatherill's husband retired from aerospace work. The 
children have grown, and Bill Weatherill quit work at Northrop last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the couple said they cannot sell the house, not with a crumbling foundation 
and cracks throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's distressed property," Katherine Weatherill said. "No one is going to buy 
it, not unless they are a gambler, a contractor or crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The Weatherills own one of 426 homes built by the Landmark Co. in the middle 
1960s in La Palma. A decade later, many of the homeowners began to notice 
cracked tiles, bulges in the floors and fissures on walls. 
</P>
<P>
In some homes, the damage was so severe the owners had to move out while 
extensive reconstruction costing up to $100,000 was completely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Homes Rehabilitated 
</P>
<P>
Ann Polonis, president of the development's homeowner association, said about 
200 homes in the area have undergone rehabilitation in recent years. But she 
said scores of homeowners such as herself have done nothing, because they have 
been trying to settle claims with their insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long, long struggle for most of us," said Polonis, who estimated 
that it will cost $130,000 to $150,000 to fix the foundation, plumbing and 
walls in her home. "The house needs paint on the outside. But I'm not going to 
put one dime into this place." 
</P>
<P>
Geologists, soil scientists and engineers have generally agreed that the 
problems stem from the soil. But the exact cause is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the soil contains too much clay; others believe it contains too much 
sand. Like a sand castle that crumbles when it dries, sandy soil may shift as 
it alternately becomes wet and dry. 
</P>
<P>
Still others blame sulfates in the soil. Polonis said they have "eaten away" 
the concrete foundations, driveways and decks supporting the homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$350,000 Study of Soil 
</P>
<P>
To pinpoint the cause and perhaps shed light on who is ultimately responsible, 
a $350,000 study of soil conditions in the area is under way by Cal State Long 
Beach scientists. Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), whose district 
includes La Palma, introduced a bill last year that paid for the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is about time we get some answers," Allen said Tuesday from Sacramento. 
Reacting to Monday's appeals court decision, she said it is unfortunate that 
people buy homeowner policies, believing that they are adequately covered, when 
they are not. 
</P>
<P>
But Tustin attorney Robert E. Beekman, who is representing 62 La Palma 
homeowners in cases against insurance carriers, blames state lawmakers for 
failing to stand up to insurers. He said the Legislature, influenced by the 
insurance lobby, has not taken the initiative to make insurers respond to 
public needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts," Beekman said, "are not the appropriate place to decide disputes 
of public policy, like insurance questions."

LAWSUIT ALLEGES COUNCIL ILLEGALLY SEATED COSGROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alleging that Cameron Cosgrove obtained his seat on the Irvine City Council 
illegally, two residents have filled suit seeking to unseat the councilman and 
to have a special election held in November. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Klein and Cristina Bustos-Thomas, the plaintiffs, allege that Cosgrove 
violated a city measure when he was sworn in 9 months ago. They are supported 
by Irvine Pride, a community action group. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Irvine voters approved Measure D, which stated that if a council 
member is elected mayor, the top unseated vote-getter for the council will 
succeed to the vacant seat. The measure, however, also stated that if a 
petition is filed by July 15 with the signatures of 7% of the voters, the city 
must hold a special election to fill that seat. 
</P>
<P>
Petitions were filed within the deadline and before Cosgrove was sworn in, but 
the City Council said Measure D was not yet in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Measure D pertained to the June, 1988, election or just to subsequent 
elections is the main question in the case, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Another question, according to Cosgrove, is whether the petitions were legal, 
because signatures were gathered before Measure D was certified by California's 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
If the suit is decided in favor of Klein and Bustos-Thomas within the next few 
months, a special election will be held in November. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove said that if the suit succeeds, he will run in that election. He said 
he already plans to run for reelection in June, 1990.

MICHIGAN ESCAPEE HELD AFTER CHECK OF LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fountain Valley police arrested an escaped felon from Michigan early Tuesday 
after running a routine check of his license plate. 
</P>
<P>
Juan J. Mireles, 25, was arrested without incident along with three other men 
from Michigan as they walked to their car in the parking lot at the Econo Lodge 
near Magnolia Avenue and the San Diego Freeway shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold said an officer spotted the 1976 
Cadillac with Michigan license plates and found that a warrant had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles had been serving a sentence of 5-15 years for breaking and entering an 
occupied home, Michigan State Police Sgt. Bill Sholten said. He said Mireles 
escaped from Camp Tuscola, a minimum-security prison camp in Caro, Mich., on 
Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles was being held without bail Tuesday in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The other three men, all from Michigan, were arrested on suspicion of aiding an 
escapee. They were also held in lieu of $10,000 bail in Orange County Jail.

POLICE SEIZE 950 POUNDS OF COCAINE FROM VAN, ARREST 11 COLOMBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After stopping a van in Huntington Beach loaded with 950 pounds of cocaine, 
police arrested 11 Colombians and recovered nearly $103,000 in cash in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties in one of the largest drug seizures ever in Southern 
California, police officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the suspects in the cocaine case 
were "top-level people" in the distribution of drugs shipped into the Southland 
from overseas, probably through Mexico. He said a major share of the cocaine 
confiscated probably had been destined for transshipment to other cities across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cocaine found in the van, which was stopped at a Huntington 
Beach shopping center on Beach Boulevard near the San Diego Freeway, another 
220 pounds were found and one suspect was arrested at a Westminster home in the 
15900 block of Prince Circle. In all, almost 1,200 pounds of cocaine were 
seized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the cocaine arrests late Monday ended a two-month investigation by 
narcotics officers that began as the result of information received by 
detectives. He did not explain how this information was received. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Huntington Beach and Westminster said their roles in the 
investigation and subsequent arrests and seizure were minimal. In both cases, 
Los Angeles police telephoned the local departments and informed them of Monday 
night's surveillance operation. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the chief said, undercover officers followed Claudio Martinez, 26, 
to the Pavillion Shopping Center in Westminster, where he met with Luis 
Monsalve, 22, and Juan Casanova, 34. Officers said they moved in and arrested 
the three, confiscating about 950 pounds of cocaine from the van driven by 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Following these arrests, Gates said, search warrants were issued for residences 
in Burbank, Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Westminster, Huntington Beach and 
Torrance. Besides the 220 pounds of cocaine found at the Prince Circle home in 
Westminster, police discovered $102,895 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills at a home 
in Torrance. Eight motor vehicles were impounded. 
</P>
<P>
Flor Restrepo, 30, and her sister, Luz Restrepo, 33 -- described by Gates as 
the leaders of the gang -- were arrested at an apartment in the Cahuenga Pass 
area in Los Angeles, along with Carlos Montoya, 32, and a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Faber Restrepo, 26, was arrested at an apartment in Burbank and Olga Garcia, 
32, was arrested at a home in Huntington Beach. Arolino Montoya, 37, was 
arrested at an apartment in Pico Rivera and Janeth Garcia, 30, was arrested as 
she drove away from her home in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster arrest surprised neighbors, who said the homeowners recently 
moved to Lake Elsinore and rented out the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a lot of cars around here or anything," said one neighbor who 
did not wish to be identified. "This is a clean neighborhood, we haven't drugs 
or anything like that around here. But we're glad the police arrested them." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, where another suspect was arrested in the 8100 block of 
Marseille Avenue, the former homeowner said she and her family moved out a week 
and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
They sold the home to Connie Castillo and her husband, who buy homes and then 
rent them. Castillo said she rented the home to two Spanish-speaking women who 
had answered an advertisement in a Santa Ana newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Can't Go Too Deep' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," Castillo said. "We painted the house and rented it. You know, 
nowadays, you can't go too deep about someone's personal life and their 
background." 
</P>
<P>
All the suspects were booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent 
to sell. Bail for each was set at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said no further arrests are expected in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were followed by an unrelated raid during which two men were taken 
into custody and more than 200 marijuana plants were confiscated at what 
investigators described as a sophisticated, hydroponic farming operation at a 
luxury home in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said officers from the 
state Bureau of Narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, plus 
a task force of 11 San Gabriel Valley police agencies, joined deputies Tuesday 
morning to raid the $2-million, hilltop home where the marijuana was being 
grown without soil in tanks containing nutrient-enriched water. 
</P>
<P>
Ducoulombier said that, in addition to the marijuana plants, some of which were 
5 to 6 feet tall, officers confiscated $350,000 in cash and more than 60 
pistols, rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Rollin Scott Forteville, 38, and Jeff Jenkins, 26, were arrested at the home 
and booked on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Bail for each was set at $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine seizure by Los Angeles police apparently was the sixth largest by 
the department or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Cocaine Seizure 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Los Angeles police confiscated 2,135 pounds of the drug at two 
locations in the San Fernando Valley in what is believed to be the record drug 
bust in the area. It came just five months after the Police Department seized 
1,900 pounds in another raid in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,800 pounds of the drug were seized in Anaheim by Los Angeles police in 
April, 1986, and 1,760 pounds of cocaine were confiscated by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies in a home in Maywood in November, 1987. Los Angeles police 
recovered 1,333 pounds of cocaine in a North Hollywood parking lot in December, 
1986.

SPEEDUP IN COUNTY CIVIL CASES IS CALLED 'REMARKABLE' SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot program to speed the pace of civil cases in Orange County Superior 
Court has proved so successful that four more judges will be added to the 
project, a participating judge said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley, who has been involved with the program 
since its inception, said that while the program has showed encouraging 
results, it has also meant a much heavier workload and a resulting increase in 
office staff. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Woolley said he was "gratified" at the findings of a report by the 
National Center for State Courts that singled out the county for "remarkable" 
results. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the study released Tuesday said, 83% of the civil cases under 
the new system were completed within 1 year of the time the suit was filed; 
just 23% of such cases handled under traditional systems elsewhere were 
completed in that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite encouraged by the report," Woolley said. "I think we can lay our 
success to the cooperation between the bench and the bar. We have had very good 
cooperation with the attorneys involved." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley said that in the 15 months since the expedited trial program began, the 
four judges involved have been assigned 650 cases, and two of the departments 
have disposition rates of more than 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Four more judges will join the project in June. The other Superior Court judges 
now in the program are Robert A. Knox, Judith M. Ryan and Gary L. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year project was required by a state law, effective Jan. 1, 1988, in nine 
counties with the heaviest backlogs of civil cases. Other counties have begun 
speedup programs on their own. 
</P>
<P>
A key feature of the program, which most of the nine counties have adopted, 
includes assigning individual judges to handle or monitor each case at all 
stages, rather than the standard system of assigning each phase of a case to a 
different judge, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Judges are also setting deadlines for different stages of each case and 
requiring attorneys to give reasons for failing to meet a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The study also found gains in Los Angeles County, where court delays have been 
the state's most serious, and in four other urban counties: San Diego, 
Riverside, Sacramento and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But in Alameda, Contra Costa and Kern counties, civil cases moved no faster in 
the last year, chiefly because judges and courtrooms have been occupied with a 
heavy load of criminal cases and other high-priority matters going to trial, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It also said that despite the speedup in handling cases in most areas, all of 
the counties in the project feared future slowdowns because of a lack of judges 
to bring all the cases to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The study did not mention a recent development in San Diego County, where a 
backlog of criminal cases and a shortage of judges forced the presiding 
Superior Court judge to block new civil trials from starting in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
The delay-reduction program got a mixed reaction from 486 lawyers questioned, 
with 61% saying their time standards under the program are too stringent and an 
even split on whether the delay-reduction program lessened the quality of 
justice in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Woolley said, however, that the system has not proved detrimental to the 
quality of justice in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If attorneys feel that the pace does not fit the case," he said, "they can 
petition and suggest a new time line for handling (cases). The quality will not 
be affected by rushing things through too fast because they can request a 
slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, civil cases continued to take 3 to 4 years to complete, 
but the average time was reduced by 7 to 10 months in the first year of the 
program.

WHETHER THEY'RE RETIRED OR FIRED, FORMER COACHES NEED TIME TO ADJUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
As the last glimmer of sunlight faded on the stucco, Ken Bell sat in his back 
yard relaxing. A book in his hand, a cold drink close by, he was enjoying the 
mid-summer evening. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Bell realized he was no longer the Buena Park High School 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized if I was still coaching, I would be at a summer league game," said 
Bell, who resigned in the spring of 1988 after 19 seasons at Buena Park. "It 
made me smile. And, yet, I was a little sad." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches who leave coaching -- whether it's their own decision, a principal's 
request or mutual agreement -- face drastic changes in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
For most, the adjustment is as easy as teeing up a golf ball or casting a 
fishing line. A few find the sudden free time too much and search for other 
avenues to fill the void. And it's not only the coaches who are fired or asked 
to resign who have difficulty adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
There always are reminders. 
</P>
<P>
Kids, whose athletic careers they once controlled, still ask advice. Parents, 
some who might have questioned decisions in the past, still ask questions. And 
then there's always the painful task of watching their former teams play and 
someone else being called "coach." 
</P>
<P>
"I got completely away," said Gene Lloyd, who coached basketball at Brea-Olinda 
for 12 seasons. "That's the most healthy situation. I didn't want people to be 
confused who was running Brea's program." 
</P>
<P>
But to do that, Lloyd had to leave the school entirely. After he resigned in 
1986, he sold life insurance for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd returned to teaching in 1987, but at Brea-Olinda Junior High School. A 
place where he could still distance himself. 
</P>
<P>
Others, who remain at their schools teaching, don't have it as easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't just walk away from teaching," said Bill Crow, former Mission Viejo 
football coach. "I would miss the interaction with the kids. Whether it's 
teaching in the classroom or coaching on the field, those relationships are too 
valuable. Besides, I'd make a terrible salesman." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, Crow resigned, turning the program over to Mike Rush, 
who had been an assistant at Mission Viejo for 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, who won one Southern Section championship, held a team meeting to 
announce his decision and then got as far away from the program as he could. He 
felt that in order for Rush to be successful, he could not have the "former 
coach" hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
"I never went to any of the practices, although I did see about half the 
games," he said. "It was difficult being totally removed. I always see the kids 
around school and around town. But you have to give the new coach room." 
</P>
<P>
Bell teaches health at Buena Park High School and his classroom is located 
right next to the gymnasium. It might as well be a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Bell didn't stick as much as a big toe -- let alone a big nose -- inside the 
gymnasium for the first three months of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
If the new coach, Ed Matillo, wanted some advice, that was fine. Bell would 
offer if requested, but he didn't want the players to see him hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure the kids understood who was the coach," Bell said. 
"Finally I couldn't resist, I slipped in there one day to see how things were 
going. I was impressed with what I saw and left." 
</P>
<P>
Staying away can be easier for a coach who is asked to leave. They not only 
don't want to be there and don't exactly feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Al Herring said he was asked to resign as the Irvine basketball coach in 1987 
because of the team's lack of success. Irvine had never qualified for the 
Southern Section playoffs during Herring's nine seasons as coach. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Mark, played on the team in 1987-88, so Herring attended all the 
games. When Mark graduated in 1988, Herring had no desire to see any games, let 
alone sneak a peek at practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I really kept a low profile," Herring said. "Probably because of all the hard 
times we had to go through (with being fired). You sort of divorce yourself 
from the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished second in the South Coast League and reached the Southern 
Section 5-A championship game last season. Yet, to Herring, it was just another 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I followed the team in the papers," Herring said. "I'm a spectator now." 
</P>
<P>
Crow has said those words on a few occasions, usually to parents. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 season, Crow was approached at times by parents who questioned 
how Rush was handling the team. Most disagreed with how their kids were being 
used. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a guy who had been the coach for a long time, I knew I would be put in 
those situations," Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would usually be something like, 'Why isn't my kid on the first team?' I 
would stop them at that point and tell them, 'Coach Rush is who you need to 
talk to.' I didn't want to be in the middle of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lester, who coached El Modena's football team for 20 years, has stayed out 
of the fray between parents and Coach Bill Backstrom since resigning in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Lester still teaches physical education, but has never wandered out to the 
practice field. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Lester, who teaches physical education at El Modena, rarely attends 
games. And when he does, he stands on the opponents' sidelines, where he's out 
of sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't deal with any parents and I don't go to booster meetings," said 
Lester, who guided the Vanguards to three Southern Section championships. "I 
just teach now. Of course, there's always some irate people who don't like how 
you teach. But in football, your product is on the field every Friday night and 
there are 3,000 pros sitting in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, El Modena still has a real good football team. I think that makes 
it easier for the parents to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
But while parents are easy -- and sometimes preferable -- to avoid, kids are 
not. Giving advice to former players can be tempting and delicate. 
</P>
<P>
After all, most players still regard former coaches as mentors. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a couple of seniors come to me this year," Bell said. "They told me they 
didn't want to play basketball anymore. It was a tough thing to deal with, you 
don't want to push them away. But I had to to tell them to talk with their 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
Crow often talks to players, usually about such subjects as picking a college. 
But he stays away from discussing the team situation, although those sort of 
problems rarely come up. 
</P>
<P>
However, his relationship with players has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I use to spend four or five hours a day with them, now I'm more like a 
friend," Crow said. "They'll come to my office every now and then or drop by 
the house just to see how I'm doing. But they're not constantly on my mind like 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Which, in some cases, might be good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly not their boss anymore," Lester said. "When I was coaching and 
one of my players did something during school hours, I would usually get a note 
from a teacher telling me about it. I was responsible for them, now I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
And with fewer responsibilities comes more free time. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches, who once spent several hours a day in practice, viewing film and 
preparing game plans, have to find ways to fill their time. For some, it's 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, my biggest worry now is who I'm going to play golf with each day," Lester 
said. "You're talking about a total success story." 
</P>
<P>
Lester, who will retire after next year, has had three years to find ways to 
occupy his time. Besides golf, he hunts and fishes. 
</P>
<P>
However, coaches who have recently resigned have found adjusting a little more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"You're on a different schedule," Bell said. "All of a sudden it's 3 p.m. and 
you're done for the day. There's no practice to go to, no games. You're 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Bell has taken a second job for the afternoon. After he's done teaching, he 
works for a sales representative for a trophy company. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something, I might as well get paid for it," he said. "My tennis 
game has also gotten a little better and my wife likes me a little more. So I 
guess things are working out." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd also needed something to do with his time, so he volunteered to sponsor 
the junior high's baseball card club called the 52 Mantle Club (named after the 
1952 Mickey Mantle card, which is worth approximately $6,200 today). 
</P>
<P>
Well, volunteered is not exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"My son and the principal's son started the club eight or nine years ago," 
Lloyd said. "(Principal) Mike Condiff was the sponsor, but when I came back to 
teach here, he asked me to co-sponsor the club. That was the last I saw of 
Mike." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lloyd's not complaining. The club fills up one afternoon per week. The 
rest of his time? Well, there's always basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd spent too many years coaching the game to walk away from it completely. 
He attends all of Brea's home games and also goes to other high school games in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I really miss is the game itself," Lloyd said. "I see all the 
Brea home games. I can just sit and watch a game now and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Most former coaches can't resist going to see their old teams play. And for 
some, it's a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I never realized how many things were going on at a football game," Crow said. 
"I went to the opener last season. I had just sat down and they announced, 
'Everybody stand up for the kickoff.' I didn't know what the heck was going on. 
Do they always do that? 
</P>
<P>
"When you're coaching, your mind is always focused on the game. You don't hear 
or see the things that are going on, off the field. I loved the halftime show 
with the band. I'd never seen one before." 
</P>
<P>
But watching the team play also can bring the itch to coach again. And few 
former coaches are ready to rule out that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's etched in stone," Bell said. "One of these days I may get back into 
it." 
</P>

COACHES WHO REPLACE LIVING LEGENDS CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN NO-WIN SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty McWhinney knows what it's like to come in on the heels of a legend. And 
he wouldn't wish the experience on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
McWhinney, who two weeks ago was hired to replace Jerry Howell as football 
coach at Foothill High School, accepted his first head coaching job 20 years 
ago at El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
McWhinney, then only 25, took over for his former high school coach, Ernie 
Johnson. In his 14 years at El Rancho, Johnson had led the school to five 
Southern Section championship games, winning three. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it as if it were yesterday. There was just an incredible amount of 
pressure (to win)," McWhinney said. "I was in way over my head. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure was so enormous . . . I don't think it wasn't until the fourth of 
fifth game of the season that I could actually smile." 
</P>
<P>
Many county high school coaches can relate to that experience. And most agree, 
replacing a successful coach is not always an easy thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Barrett, Ocean View's baseball coach, knows the feeling. Barrett replaced 
former Seahawk Coach Bill Gibbons after Gibbons was fired last June. 
</P>
<P>
(Gibbons said his removal stemmed from incidents during a San Luis Obispo 
baseball tournament last spring in which three Ocean View players were 
suspended for violating team rules). 
</P>
<P>
In his eight years coaching at Ocean View, Gibbons led the Seahawks to three 
Sunset League championships since 1985, and guided the team at least as far as 
the Southern Section quarterfinals every year since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Gibbons is like a living legend around here," he said. "I mean, he won 
the Sunset League in 1985, '86 and '87. No one wins the Sunset League three 
times in a row. It's a tough act to follow." 
</P>
<P>
So far under Barrett the Seahawks are 12-4 overall and lead the Sunset League 
with a 4-1 record. Barrett said the success has made the transition much 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing though we've had more Ws than Ls," he said. "If we didn't, I 
think they'd be calling for my neck. I'm serious. People around here expect 
results, and they expect them quick. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lost here, it wouldn't be accepted. Even the principal here (John 
Meyers) called me in and said he expected to have a winning season. He said, 'I 
expect results and then we'll talk (about having a job at the end of the 
season)'. In other words, don't go out and mess up a good program." 
</P>
<P>
At Whittier Christian, basketball Coach Bob Brown replaced Bill Cuccia last 
year after Cuccia resigned. In nine years, Cuccia's teams won seven Olympic 
League championships, compiled a 180-49 overall record and reached the Southern 
Section final three times. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who coached the Heralds' freshman and junior varsity squads for 11 
years, said when he took the job, he believed that most of the loyalties of the 
team and their parents were still with Cuccia. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was a very popular coach here with the kids and the parents," Brown said. 
"He turned a program that once had problems having a winning season into a 
program that was a big winner. When he finally resigned in October, it was a 
big disappointment for the kids, most of them were seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty sure that all of the basketball parents wanted Bill to come back. 
Not that it was any ill will toward me -- I don't think it was. I just knew 
they favored Bill to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the season hit a low point when Orange Lutheran -- a longtime rival 
-- defeated Whittier Christian for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big disappointment because the kids had really wanted to win league 
and losing to them twice was a major setback toward the goal," Brown said. "I 
think if there was a time that people might have second-guessed me, that 
could've been it." 
</P>
<P>
But, after an inspirational post-game talk, which Cuccia attended, Brown said 
the players were remotivated to win a Southern Section championship -- 
something no Whittier Christian team had done. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, the Heralds won the 2-AA title. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be one of those storybook seasons, really," Brown said. "I 
couldn't believe what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches, especially those who had been on the staff for a long time before 
accepting the head coaching job, say replacing a very successful coach was not 
much of a problem at all. The transition, they say, was surprisingly smooth 
because they shared many of the same philosophies and strategies as the former 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
After spending 11 years as his assistant, Bill Backstrom replaced Bob Lester as 
El Modena football coach in 1985. Lester, who had been the coach since the 
school opened in 1966, won three Southern Section titles in that time and lost 
two others in overtime. His career record at El Modena was 157-58-8. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bob asked me if I would take over, I had no intention of being the head 
coach," Backstrom said. "I talked to all the other assistant coaches, and they 
said if I would take the job, then they would stay on at least three more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Under those circumstances, I accepted. At least with having the others there, 
it wasn't like bringing in an entirely new program. That makes a big 
difference, I think." 
</P>
<P>
But in Backstrom's first season, the Vanguards failed to advance to the 
Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem I was feeling was that we always expected so much success at 
El Modena," Backstrom said. "In one period of years from 1978 to 1985, we had a 
run of eight straight years where we were in at least the semifinals every 
year. . . . In that sense, my first year was tough." 
</P>
<P>
But Backstrom said he never heard any grumbling from the players, their parents 
or the administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone understood the situation," he said. "The thing was, they 
wanted Bob to continue coaching, but they also realized that (his years of 
coaching) were numbered. Basically, I was the young guy coming in and I don't 
think they wanted to hurt the future. It was a sensitive situation." 
</P>
<P>
Many county coaches side with Backstrom in that replacing a successful coach 
isn't too difficult -- especially when the former coach helps when he can. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Paul Orris replaced Jack Errion, who retired after 11 years as 
Corona del Mar's basketball coach. In that time, Errion led Corona del Mar to 
three Southern Section championship games, of which the school won two. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack made it very easy for me because we had worked together (at Corona del 
Mar) for 11 years," Orris said. "We sat down every day during our office period 
and bounced things off each other. He always made me feel like I was part of 
the decision making, and kind of groomed me for the job, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year I was varsity coach, he was still teaching on campus, so I 
could go to him for help and he welcomed it. That wealth of knowledge, that's 
what I miss the most, though he still comes over and talks to us sometimes. And 
he still yells at me if I do something wrong, and still pats me on the back 
when I do something right." 
</P>
<P>
At Mission Viejo, Mike Rush took over last season for Bill Crow, who had 
coached football at Mission Viejo for 18 years, including the last eight years 
as head coach. In that time, Crow had won a Central Conference title, and 
finished runner-up once as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Rush, who had been an assistant to Crow for 10 years, said the pressure was 
minimal, if any. Especially because the Diablos finished last season 12-1 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't had a winning season, I'm sure there might have been complaints," 
Rush said. "Nothing cures more ills than success . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But if there was any pressure, it was self-made. When you talk about legends, 
as coaches, we're all legends in our own minds."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY WINS, 2-0, IN BATTLE FOR FIRST

<P>
Fountain Valley High School, turning the Sunset League title chase into an arms 
race, continued to get impressive pitching Tuesday in a 2-0 victory over Ocean 
View at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Steve Montgomery allowed only two hits and struck out five 
as Fountain Valley (10-4, 5-1) gained sole possession of first place in the 
six-team league. Montgomery (4-1) gave up a bloop single in the first inning 
and a single that glanced off his glove in the seventh in completing his first 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Fountain Valley's third shutout in its past six games and marked the 
third time an opponent has failed to advance a runner to third base against the 
Barons. What's more, Fountain Valley has allowed only four earned runs in its 
past six games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around baseball a long time, and I've never seen pitching like 
this," said Ron LaRuffa, Fountain Valley's coach. "I knew pitching would be one 
of our strengths, but I never expected anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit a couple of fisted balls or Montgomery could have had a no-hitter. 
Steve's fastball had good pop, and he was jamming people all day." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery retired 14 consecutive batters after giving up a scratch single to 
Dan Hernandez in the first inning. Gary Christopherson collected Ocean View's 
other hit, a hard-hit grounder that glanced off Montgomery's glove. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bats are laying in the rack right now, we're not getting any production 
from the top of our lineup," said Steve Barrett, Ocean View coach. "We didn't 
hit the ball hard all day. Montgomery ate up some pretty good hitters today." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (12-5, 4-2) has found it difficult scoring runs on the road. Last 
week, the Seahawks lost to Edison, 1-0, on a disputed home run. But the team's 
best pitcher, Randy Karliner, is expected to return Saturday after a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley scored the only runs of the game in the second inning when 
LaRuffa sent Steve Lancaster home from first base on a double by Mike Walcott. 
Ocean View shortstop Dan Hernandez appeared to have Lancaster out at the plate, 
but Hernandez's throw glanced off Lancaster's helmet and sailed to the backstop 
as Lancaster scored. 
</P>
<P>
Walcott moved to third on Hernandez's throwing error and scored on an infield 
out by Garren Ito that moved Fountain Valley ahead, 2-0. Later, LaRuffa 
admitted that sending Lancaster home was a big gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make the play, he's out by a mile," LaRuffa said. "My philosophy has 
always been to force an opponent to make the plays. We put the pressure on 
them, and we were fortunate to get two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 8, Marina 3 -- Chris Larson and Ryan Klefko each had three hits, 
including a double, scored two runs, knocked in two runs and stole a base for 
host Westminster (10-6-1, 2-4). Pitcher Mark Murphy got the victory and Brett 
Grebe the save. Marina is 9-8, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 3, Edison 2 (8 innings) -- Brian Wright, who had three hits, 
scored the winning run on a passed ball. Pitcher Josh Faur came on in the sixth 
inning to get the victory for visiting Huntington Beach (6-10, 2-4). Edison's 
only score came on J.J. Thobe's two-run homer in the first inning.

EX-CONGRESSMAN TO HEAD LINCOLN SAVINGS OF IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Rep. John H. Rousselot, who is leading a bid to buy Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan, was elected chairman and chief executive of the Irvine thrift 
Tuesday. At the same time, Rousselot said he has renegotiated his purchase 
agreement with the S&amp;L's parent firm. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal reduces the purchase price by $88 million, to $200 million; 
removes four employees of Lincoln and its parent, American Continental Corp., 
from the investor group, and turns the deal more favorably toward Lincoln and 
Rousselot, who was a Republican congressman from Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Both Rousselot's election and the new deal struck this weekend are designed to 
win quick regulatory approval of the troubled sale, said Rousselot and Mark M. 
Connally, a spokesman for Phoenix-based American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of Lincoln, Rousselot will replace Robin S. Symes, who resigned in 
mid-January. As chief executive, he will replace Ray Fidel, who quit as 
president and chief executive Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The position of president will remain vacant for now, Connally said. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, who has been working daily on the sale with staff members of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said changes in management and terms were needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank board made it clear last week that the application would not be 
making progress if it included members of Lincoln and American Continental," he 
said. "The bank board made it clear it wanted all new people." 
</P>
<P>
Connally said Fidel, who had previously hoped to stay on with Lincoln, stepped 
down as part of the effort by the S&amp;L and its parent "to convey that we are 
willing to make the changes necessary" to get the sale approved. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, who would be chairman of Lincoln after the proposed purchase, would 
give up his post as chief executive to a manager approved by regulators. One of 
the new terms, he said, is that all directors and top officers would be 
"pre-approved" by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Other new terms include: 
</P>
<P>
* The purchase price was reduced to $200 million from $288.75 million, and the 
non-voting preferred stock that American Continental would get in return would 
not pay a dividend unless Lincoln is profitable. Charles H. Keating Jr., 
American Continental's chairman, picked up Lincoln in late 1984 for $51 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* American Continental would put $50 million in cash or securities into Lincoln 
to recapitalize the S&amp;L and would get nothing in return. Previously, the 
company was to put in $15 million, two New York businessmen were to put in $35 
million and all three were to receive preferred stock. The New York businessmen 
are no longer part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
* The new buyers would raise up to $150 million in new capital in the next 3 
years. No such commitment existed previously. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and his family would personally guarantee repayment of $428 million 
in promissory notes that American Continental would give to acquire three major 
Lincoln assets: the Phoenician Resort and the Crescent Hotel, both in the 
Phoenix area, and a 20% stake in General Oriental Investments Ltd., run by 
British financier Sir James Goldsmith. The $215-million note for the GOIL stock 
would be paid in 3 years instead of 10 years. Other terms were tightened in a 
bid to persuade Keating to repay the notes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
* Lincoln would be converted into a federally chartered S&amp;L and would 
return to the San Francisco supervisory district, from which it was removed 
last year after complaints from Keating about hostile treatment. 
</P>
<P>
* Four employees of Lincoln and American Continental who were to run the 
S&amp;L are out. Rousselot has brought in new investors with no connection to 
the company or the S&amp;L, but the names are being withheld temporarily. Four 
of them, however, could be California businessmen who have agreed to join the 
board with Rousselot, who will give them the option of investing. 
</P>
<P>
The four are Thomas Kemp, former chief executive of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of 
Los Angeles and brother of U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack 
Kemp; Edward Barker, former commissioner of the State Department of Savings and 
Loan under former Gov. Ronald Reagan; Jerry Niemeyer, former chairman of Sears 
Savings Bank, and Ralph Alfieri, an Arcadia builder and developer. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp and Barker have also been appointed previously by the bank board as 
temporary directors of seized S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's stewardship of Lincoln has been marred by confrontations with 
regulators, particularly over his use of expanded investment powers that 
California law gives state-chartered S&amp;Ls. That law allowed him to invest 
S&amp;L deposits in hotels, in other real estate ventures and in equity stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Those direct investments, as well as others, brought on a bitter and rancorous, 
2-year examination by regulators, who doubted the value and wisdom of such 
assets. Before that examination ended last year, Keating decided that he wanted 
to sell the S&amp;L and get out of the regulated industry. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the company has suffered reverses. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental posted a $36-million loss for the third quarter. Financial 
analysts are waiting for its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. That filing is due Monday and is widely expected to contain more 
bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln operates 29 branches throughout Southern California and had $5.5 
billion in assets at the end of December.

HYATT TO PROVIDE LUXURY HOUSING FOR RETIREES; 
</P>
<P>
HOTEL CHAIN BELIEVES ITS EXPERTISE WILL GIVE IT EDGE IN RUNNING RESIDENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hyatt Corp., the hotel chain renowned for stunning glass atrium lobbies, swank 
service and pricey rooms, is planning to try its hand at luxury group-housing 
for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Pritzker, member of the billionaire family that controls Hyatt, said the 
Classic Residence subsidiary she heads is part of a broader trend by big 
business to get into the fragmented but potentially lucrative market of 
residences for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Classic Residence "was a family-generated idea," she said. "I was very much 
involved in it, but we do things as a family." 
</P>
<P>
Those things include 95 U.S. hotels and 50 abroad, a Chicago law firm, casinos, 
farmland and about 60 industrial concerns. The Pritzkers are also known for 
dabbling in takeover situations, most recently the MCorp banks of Texas and 
Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study of Housing 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt researchers found that the top 10 providers of group housing for senior 
citizens had less than 10 facilities each, Penny Pritzker said in a telephone 
interview from Chicago, where the family's operations are based. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been basically a developer-driven business," she said, "and in our view 
it's a service business and that's something we know very well." 
</P>
<P>
She predicted there eventually will be "brand consolidation, and we'll be able 
to capitalize." 
</P>
<P>
"Our expertise in food and beverage and maid and linen service, and our general 
knowledge of consumer services, will give us an edge in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt is developing Classic Residences in Dallas, Reno and Teaneck, N.J., 
scheduled to open within weeks of each other this summer. Others are under 
construction in Riverdale, N.Y., and Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is to do four or five projects a year," Pritzker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas version includes an atrium, a trademark of Hyatt hotels, but that is 
just coincidence since the building was purchased by the company from another 
developer who originally intended it to be a condominium, said Gary Anderson, 
the director of the 147-room project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Not Cheap 
</P>
<P>
It won't be cheap to live in one of the Hyatt homes -- rents in the Dallas 
Classic Residence range from $1,800 to $2,600 per month. But Anderson said the 
cost is comparable to expenses for maintaining a house, buying groceries and 
paying for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
There will be maids, linen service, 24-hour security, planned activities, a 
library, 25 meals a month and a concierge to handle requests. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyatt got into the business because we think . . . our ability to provide 
quality service, as well as our brand recognition, is something that is 
familiar to seniors," Pritzker said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential residents are "individuals who have generally set aside some money 
for retirement," Anderson said. "We're looking for the retired school teacher, 
the guy who retired from GM . . . fairly everyday people." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is that retirees who have recently sold a house will have a large 
amount of cash that they can add to pensions and Social Security to afford the 
rent easily. 
</P>
<P>
"The only concern we have . . . is the real estate market," Anderson said. 
Houses in Dallas frequently sit unsold for months at a time, a consequence of 
the state's depressed economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a fact of doing business in Texas right now," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted Hyatt's Classic Residences will appeal to people who have 
sufficient resources to rent out their homes and live in luxury facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the rent is long-term care insurance, which will pay residents $40 
a day toward nursing-home care should they need it eventually. Anderson said 
the insurance, combined with what residents already were paying in rent, should 
cover nursing homes charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt was able to buy the Dallas building, which is within a block of a nursing 
home and two blocks of a major Dallas hospital, for less than it could build a 
in a similar location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt has reached agreement with the nursing home to provide assistance to any 
residents who might need it. In other planned locations, a section of the 
residence will be set aside for people who need "assisted living." 
</P>
<P>
The Teaneck project already is 25% to 30% leased, and "we're very pleased with 
that," Pritzker said.

OFFICE LEASING GOING WELL, BUT VACANCY RATE IS STILL HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Landlords leased 1.1 million square feet in Orange County's larger office 
buildings during the first 3 months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But office buildings were still 22% vacant on the average because so many new 
buildings are going up, Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This means that rents did not rise very much during the quarter, the commercial 
brokerage said at a quarterly briefing on the local market. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that the next 3 quarters will be as busy. Grubb &amp; Ellis 
estimates that tenants will lease 3.6 million square feet of office space in 
1989, about the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate was actually down from a year ago, when it was 25%. And 
tenants looking for upscale office space around Anaheim will probably find the 
market tight this year and rents beginning to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing will be built in the Anaheim area for the next 18 months, according to 
Lonnie J. Riddle, a senior marketing consultant at the Grubb &amp; Ellis office 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Since four big new office buildings opened in the area, developers have delayed 
building new towers, and the market will eventually lurch toward fewer 
vacancies and higher rents until more buildings go up, Riddle predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, construction is booming, especially at the Irvine Co.'s massive 
Spectrum development at the junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
As subdivisions sprout in the relatively undeveloped southern half of the 
county, the office buildings are following them, according to brokers attending 
the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Developers plan to build another 14.6 million square feet of office space 
around the county. That's nearly a third of the county's present total, 46.6 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Rents were lowest in the western part of the county -- with a low of $1.26 a 
square foot -- and highest in the John Wayne Airport area, where the highest 
rent was $2.25 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, warehouses and manufacturers of low-technology products continue to 
leave for Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where land is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Yet certain types of industrial buildings -- like those favored by smaller 
research and development firms -- continue to lease well in the county, said 
Dennis W. Macheski, Grubb &amp; Ellis' regional director of research.

DELAY IN REFORM OF ITALY'S STOCK MARKET DECRIED; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS SAY CONDITIONS COULD PUSH THE EXCHANGE INTO FINANCIAL BACKWATERS

<P>
Political delays in adopting sweeping reforms of Italy's stock market threaten 
to push the exchange into the financial backwaters of Europe, brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals launched several years ago to concentrate all trading on the official 
market, set rules on takeover bids, regulate financial intermediaries and ban 
insider trading are still languishing in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"Reforming the stock market does not seem to rank very high on the government's 
agenda," said Alessandro Valeri, equity sales director for investment firm Sige 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
"Spain and Portugal are moving much faster than Italy in institutional reform," 
said Guido Feller, a senior executive at Arthur Andersen Consulting in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
The Milan-based Institute for Social Research said in a recent report on the 
Italian market: "Not one of the important (reform) questions identified in 1987 
as urgently needing attention has been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the growing frustration with the speed of reform, Sige General Manager 
Giorgio Mariotti said at a recent round-table discussion on the exchange: "The 
bourse (stock market) risks becoming provincial compared with other European 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Milla, vice chairman of Milan investment bank Euromobiliare SpA, said 
that although the exchange has been able to attract foreign investors in recent 
years, greater growth is at risk. "We risk losing out on the globalization of 
markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being the West's sixth largest industrial power, at the end of 1988 the 
Milan bourse ranked only eighth among Europe's 12 main securities markets in 
terms of listed companies, with 211. Moreover, it has no foreign companies 
listed, no futures market and is the only major European stock market still 
using the open outcry trading system instead of systems based on computer 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of Italy's high propensity to save (second only to Japan) and its 
advanced economy, the Italian capital markets are still relatively 
unsophisticated," the consulting group Arthur Andersen said in a report on 
European capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real gap between the industrial structure and financial markets," 
said Andersen's Feller. 
</P>
<P>
Its survey of 1,000 European operators found that respondents expect the 
Italian stock market to grow only moderately in terms of both capitalization 
and turnover. No more than 10 foreign companies may be listed in Italy in the 
next 5 years, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts say a major defect of the Italian market is that it still is 
dominated by a few large business groups such as Fiat, Ferruzzi and Generali. 
Fifteen companies represent two-thirds of the market's total capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Many large firms, mostly family owned, continue to shun the stock market. 
Feller said only 20 out of the top 100 Italian companies in terms of turnover 
are publicly quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, at least 70% of stock trades are done outside the official market, 
mostly by large banks. The market regulatory body Consob is seeking to bring 
all trading onto the official market and adopt an automated system. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago legislation was introduced to create multifunction securities 
intermediaries, called SIMs, which would be formed by stockbrokers, banks and 
commission dealers. 
</P>
<P>
SIMs would be allowed to do brokerage, market-making, underwriting, asset 
management and financial consulting. 
</P>
<P>
But operators -- echoing a fierce debate that occurred in France in the last 2 
years -- are bitterly divided over the issue. Banks have accused stockbrokers 
of fearing the loss of their monopoly on trading, while brokers say allowing 
banks to act as intermediaries creates potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible piece of legislation," Isidoro Albertini, one of Milan's 
leading stockbrokers, said at a recent conference. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many operators believe that the lack of a law regulating tender 
offers -- rarely launched in Italy -- and protecting minority shareholders in 
buyouts hurts the market. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation has been introduced that would require tender offers in certain 
circumstances.

TROUPE BORN TO LEND TRUTH TO FORMER LIE

Tina Ramirez says she founded Ballet Hispanico of New York in 1970 when she 
discovered that she was lying to her dance students. 
</P>
<P>
She had been training Latino children in dance for about 5 years, goading them 
with criticism of what was "professional behavior" and what wasn't, when a 
group of 13-year-old students told her that they wanted to be professional 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around and saw that I was leading them on the wrong path," Ramirez 
said in a recent phone interview from New York. "I had lied to them. There was 
no place they were going to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
"They were exotic-looking, Hispanic-looking, beautiful girls and men. (But) 
people were not hiring Hispanics then, at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went a little crazy. . . . That's when I decided I had to form a company so 
they could find employment." 
</P>
<P>
The New York State Council of the Arts helped by giving her $18,000 in seed 
money to form Ballet Hispanico, and Ramirez and her new company embarked on a 
trial by fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to work in hospitals and drug centers," she said. "They (also) 
spoke to me about a 2-week engagement doing street theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked every street in New York, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and I say it with 
pride, we did two shows a day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Street theater was difficult. The dancers learned immediately. If they didn't, 
retribution was at hand. You couldn't bore people at all. There was no boredom 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The 2 weeks stretched into 5 "because we were a great hit." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the company, which will appear at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton on 
Saturday, has grown up. 
</P>
<P>
The budget has reached $1 million. Ramirez's school includes more than 1,000 
students. Her 12 dancers have appeared across the country and are scheduled to 
go to Spain for the first time in July. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramirez's vision remains the same: to give Latinos a "voice in the art of 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
"People growing up (in New York) didn't have any image of themselves as dancers 
at all or of what they could do," she said. "We had no voice in the art of 
dance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But now we have given a lot of opportunity to Hispanics and to the general 
population, to any people who want to dance." 
</P>
<P>
In naming her company, Ramirez said that she chose the word Hispanic because 
she felt that "anyone who speaks Spanish should be represented" by the company. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic world is enormous," she said. "But there must be unity. There are 
different things that bind us: the language, the religion, love of family, love 
of home, love of dance. That's very important." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the name of the company has caused some confused expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a point (ballet) company," she said. "I feel that is something that 
throws people off. Ballet in Spanish means any type of dance that has a story 
line. Never did I think people would think we were a ballet company. Never did 
I think it was a folkloric company. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a contemporary dance company. I use ballet, I use modern and I use 
ethnic dance, but to form a (new) language. 
</P>
<P>
"I use Hispanic music and Hispanic themes, and New York themes because, after 
all, we are from New York." 
</P>
<P>
Works on the program at Plummer Auditorium include Graciela Daniele's "Cada 
Noche . . . Tango," Talley Beatty's "Tres Cantos" and Vicente Nebrada's 
"Batucada Fantastica." 
</P>
<P>
"I have always had guest choreographers," Ramirez said. "I never saw it as a 
company for my choreography. I always saw it as a repertory company." 
</P>
<P>
All three works embody a Ramirez principle, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel dance is drama," she said. "Nothing is abstract, even when you think 
you're doing abstract (dance). It comes from something. It doesn't come from 
empty, but from feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my dancers, 'If you do a feeling, it better be a strong feeling, a 
specific feeling.' 
</P>
<P>
"If the dancers feel it, the audience feels it. . . . What I like is dance 
drama that makes a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Among obstacles Ramirez had to overcome initially was some people's feeling 
that she was providing social welfare work for the Latino community more than 
artistic values. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when people were criticizing me -- that it was social -- I was getting my 
work done because I was teaching dance and creating professionals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when you have a community group, people sometimes equate 'community' 
with bad art, and that is not true for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We have less money to do the arts, and art is expensive," which is the reason 
Ballet Hispanico will be dancing to tapes on Saturday rather than live 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is that it takes you longer to get the work done. But there is a 
strength also in having the community behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet Hispanico of New York will dance at 8 p.m. Saturday at Plummer 
Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Works include Graciela Daniele's 
"Cada Noche . . Tango," Vicente Nebrada's "Batucada Fantastica" and Talley 
Beatty's "Tres Cantos." The event is sponsored by Cal State Fullerton. Tickets: 
$10 to $15. Information: (714) 773-3371.

SOUTH COAST WOODWINDS PLAY OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having endured several days of record-breaking (and energy-sapping) heat, 
visitors to South Coast Village in Santa Ana on Sunday enjoyed weather 
virtually perfect for an alfresco noon concert. 
</P>
<P>
Held on the shopping center's Village Green, the South Coast Symphony's free 
chamber concerts are relaxed, informal affairs in which listeners may enjoy a 
picnic lunch while sampling music. On this third of four programs in the 
series, the South Coast Symphony Woodwind Quintet offered a program as pleasant 
and soothing as the cooler but sunny weather itself. Distractions, all things 
considered, were relatively few and the audience remarkably attentive, though 
there were minor aerial disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
The first half, in which the players offered three works written specifically 
for wind quintet, proved stronger. Jacques Ibert's "Trois Pieces Breves" 
sparkled with ebullient vitality. Anton Reicha's Quintet in E-flat showed each 
player's expressive lyricism and the ensemble's rhythmic tautness. Malcolm 
Arnold's "Three Shanties" received crisp, witty and accurate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The post-intermission portion consisted entirely of transcriptions. In both 
Bach's "Little" Fugue in G minor and a Vivaldi concerto, a small number of 
technical blemishes and a tendency to allow tempos to drag detracted from 
otherwise-spirited playing. 
</P>
<P>
Sweelinck's Variations on a Folk Song fared better; here flutist Cheryl 
Strommen-Loofbourrow, oboist John Ralston, clarinetist Patty Hecker, bassoonist 
Phoebe Ray and hornist Linda DeRoche-Duffin showed just how well their 
instruments can blend. 
</P>
<P>
To fill out the program, the players added, probably to their regret, the first 
two movements of Beethoven's Sextet in E-flat, Opus 71, to their planned 
agenda. Rhythmic insecurity and a passel of errors marred this reading. 
</P>
<P>
They should have stopped after the preceding "Pink Panther" theme.

3 DEAD SEA LIONS ON SUNSET BEACH

Three dead sea lions washed ashore at Sunset Beach this morning, and a federal 
official said they probably had been trapped in fishing nets at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lion carcasses were discovered between 10th and 11th streets at Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"The sea lions probably died after being trapped in gill nets" of commercial 
fishermen, said Joe Cardaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service in Los Angeles. "About 99% of the sea lion deaths in January 
and February were because of fishing nets." In those months, the National 
Marine Fisheries Service counted about 50 dead sea lions in the area of Seal 
Beach, Sunset Beach and Huntington Beach.

Barbara Bush underwent radioactive treatment today to destroy her thyroid gland 
because it is producing excess levels of hormones, a condition that has 
irritated her eyes and caused her to lose 18 pounds in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just fine, piece of cake, never broke her stride," her press secretary, 
Anna Perez, said after the President's wife returned to the White House after a 
two-hour stay at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The radiation was administered in an iodine solution sipped through a straw. 
Mrs. Bush said it was a colorless liquid that tasted like water, Perez 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Mrs. Bush, 63, that the only side effect she may suffer is a 
slight pain in the neck for several days. "She cracked jokes about that all 
day," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
A White House statement said the procedure "has no significant side effects" 
and has been a standard treatment for 40 years for people suffering with Mrs. 
Bush's condition, known as Graves disease.

Muslim and Christian forces turned their howitzers on residential areas of 
Beirut today, killing 12 people in a withering attack that began on the eve of 
the civil war's 14th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Christian army said the fighting had reduced Lebanon to "a 
cadaver in a coffin" and urged the superpowers to help end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The shelling duel was the fiercest since the Arab League called a cease-fire in 
Lebanon a week ago. The sudden barrage, which shattered an overnight lull, took 
civilians by surprise and forced them to rush back to bunkers and underground 
bomb shelters.

2 MEN GUNNED DOWN IN SEPARATE EARLY-MORNING SANTA ANA SHOOTINGS

<P>
Two Santa Ana men were killed early this morning about an hour apart in 
separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Police received reports of gunfire in the 1500 block of South Standard Avenue 
about 1:30 a.m., Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Chavez said. When officers arrived, 
they found the body of Esequiel Martinez, 32, of Santa Ana lying in an alley. 
He had been shot once, Chavez said. Police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, Aaron Olivos, 32, was shot about 2:30 a.m. in the 1900 
block of West 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said Olivos was driving east on 1st Street approaching Daisy Avenue when 
he was cut off by another driver who had pulled out of a driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"Olivos honked, got out of his car and approached the other car. He was 
immediately shot one time from the passenger's side of the vehicle," Chavez 
said. Olivos suffered a single gunshot wound to the right side from a small 
caliber handgun and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw a red compact car drive east on 1st Street after the shooting, 
but they could not describe the passengers.

The bodies of imperial Russia's last czar and his family, previously believed 
to have been destroyed by acid, were found by a Soviet writer in 1979 but he 
dared not tell the world, a weekly newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow News said Geli Ryabov found the mutilated remains of Nicholas II, his 
wife, 5 children and servants, all murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, 10 
months after the revolution which overthrew the Romanov dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent challenge to the accepted Soviet version of events, Ryabov said 
the leaders of the fledgling Bolshevik state voted for the execution and local 
authorities concealed the pit where the bodies lay to prevent its becoming a 
shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago when we opened up the grave where the naked bodies were thrown . 
. . and even later, I just could not publish the result of my investigation," 
Ryabov said. "Times were different and nobody would undertake to identify the 
skulls and bones."

SOVIET LEADER SAYS CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE WON'T BE TOLERATED

<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his first public statement on 
nationalist unrest that left 19 dead in Soviet Georgia, appealed for calm today 
but stressed that he would not tolerate demands for independence. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Georgian people, Gorbachev said the clashes had damaged 
democratization and his perestroika restructuring drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand for the consistent expansion of the rights of the republics, of all 
national formations, for filling them with real content," Gorbachev said, in 
reference to growing demands in Georgia for greater autonomy from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Resolutely Against This' 
</P>
<P>
"Restructuring of inter-ethnic relations is not the replanning of the borders 
or the breakdown of the national-state structure of the country. We are 
resolutely against this," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
In the address, which the Georgian news agency Gruzinform said would be 
published in the Georgian press, Gorbachev appealed to Georgian patriotism "as 
a man who has deep respect for the traditions of the Georgian people, its high 
and noble qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on you to restore peace to Georgia. This is the moral duty of 
everyone who holds sacred the memory of his ancestors, who values peace and 
harmony in his homeland and, most of all, who thinks about his people, his 
future." 
</P>
<P>
His statement came as a Soviet spokesman announced that the death toll from 
Sunday's clashes when troops used clubs to break up a crowd of about 8,000 
people chanting nationalist slogans had risen to 19 with the death of a girl in 
a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people, most of them women, were killed during the clashes. Two more 
were later reported to have died in hospitals of injuries sustained during the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationalists Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev suggested in his statement that nationalists were responsible for the 
bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"The actions of the irresponsible people led to tension in the republic. False 
goals confused a section of the population; blood of innocent people was shed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The clashes followed a week of demonstrations in Tbilisi attended by up to 
100,000 people. Many of them held banners calling for "Russian invaders" to go 
home and waved black, white and red Georgian national flags. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news briefing 
today that the Communist Party leader in Georgia had offered to resign after 
the clashes and said the party authorities were considering his request.

CONCORDE LOSES CHUNK OF ITS TAIL

A British Airways supersonic Concorde airliner carrying 100 wealthy Americans 
on a round-the-world trip lost a section of its tail while traveling at nearly 
twice the speed of sound 47,000 feet above the Tasman Sea but landed safely 
here today. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't till we got out of the plane and saw the fire trucks and all the 
press . . . that we knew something was wrong," said conservative columnist 
William F. Buckley Jr., who helped organize the trip, which cost passengers 
$39,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers heard a "large thump," but members of the crew of the 15-year-old 
airliner told them they believed that the noise had been caused by air 
turbulence. It was only when the plane landed that the 9-foot-long tail section 
was discovered to be missing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Emergency' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a normal landing, there was no emergency," airline spokesman Peter 
Stanton said. "The pilot, Capt. David Leney, was told by the control tower that 
a piece of the tail was missing." 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries among the 100 passengers, all Americans, on the 
38,343-mile journey -- the first attempted supersonic circumnavigation -- that 
started April 1 in London. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a British Airways spokeswoman said the airline is sending out spare 
parts to Australia to repair the plane, which will go on to Perth, Australia, 
on Friday as scheduled and then to Africa before returning to London. Another 
spokesman said the tail sections of other Concordes are being checked. 
</P>
<P>
The Concorde had been trying to break the speed record on all stops, making 
about 12 in all. The planned three-week journey includes stops in exotic 
locations like Colombo, Sri Lanka and Mombasa, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Buckley planned to broadcast his television show "Firing Line" 
from Cape Town, South Africa, and Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that it was a plane that could manage without that much superfluous 
tail," Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had nose-dived . . . into the Tasmanian Sea, there would have been a 
considerable reaction. But one simply assumes that nothing fatal has happened 
if indeed there is no confirmation nor any visible invalidation of the ship's 
performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley said: "There is a possibility they (British Airways) will find a defect 
. . . that will result in the grounding of other Concordes. But obviously 
they're hoping that won't be so, that this is simply an eccentric fluke."

Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) urged an investigation today into the verification 
for banks and credit unions of Social Security numbers, which he called the 
"largest breach of privacy in the history" of Social Security . 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health, education and welfare, 
Pryor requested the inquiry by the HHS inspector general into the legality of 
the transactions and into the competence and credibility of its chief, Dorcas 
Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor's demand for an investigation stemmed from a hearing earlier this week by 
the Senate Aging Committee, which he heads, and at which Hardy, the veteran 
head of the Social Security Administration, testified. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, according to Pryor's investigation, the Social Security 
agency has verified from its magnetic tapes the Social Security numbers listed 
by applicants at banks and credit bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely concerned that the commissioner apparently had little 
knowledge of the many disclosures that have been taking place at SSA," Pryor 
said. "Her testimony raised serious questions about either her competence or 
her credibility on this issue."

Irish-based GPA Group Ltd., the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is 
about to place the biggest plane order in history, worth up to $20 billion, a 
GPA spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
James King, chief operations officer of the group formerly known as Guinness 
Peat Aviation, said about 200 aircraft will be purchased from the West European 
consortium Airbus Industrie and the U.S. giants Boeing Co. and the McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. A formal announcement is to be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturers tell us this would make it the biggest aircraft order in 
aviation history," King said. The largest so far is U.S. carrier Delta 
Airlines' $10.5-billion order last September which totaled 225 Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas aircraft, including options.

Gun importers are prepared to bring close to 1 million more semiautomatic 
assault-style rifles into the United States should the Bush Administration 
decide not to make its import ban permanent. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms now has applications pending for 
965,000 of the weapons, ATF spokesman Dick Pedersen said. "It appears there 
have been a lot more applications that came in after the ban," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary suspension imposed March 14 covered about 400,000 weapons, 
including about 300,000 for which import permits had already been approved. An 
expansion of that suspension last week covered another 240,000 weapons.

President and Mrs. Bush paid $62,106 in federal taxes last year on an adjusted 
gross income of $278,171, including his $115,000 salary as vice president, 
according to tax returns released today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush's salary, the couple also reported $155,662 in income from a blind 
trust they share, $7,147 in interest income and $12,362 in income from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes paid taxes equivalent to 21.6% of their total income. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who became a millionaire in the oil business in Texas, has a net worth in 
the range of $2 million, much of it wrapped up in the family's $3.5-million 
oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife Barbara claimed $65,365 in itemized deductions, which 
included $12,250 in contributions to 39 charities. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, also releasing his tax forms today, reported 
adjusted gross income of $156,546 for 1988. Quayle paid federal and Indiana 
state income taxes of $34,309, his office said in a summary of his return. 
</P>
<P>

DOW UP 8.07; TRADERS GROW MORE CONFIDENT

Stock prices rose today, extending Tuesday's gain in a quiet session marked by 
takeover deals and increased confidence about the outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.07 points to 2,319.65. Advances led 
declines by a 4-3 margin in active New York Stock Exchange trading of about 166 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
"Some buying was induced by the Dow closing above 2,310 Tuesday, but there was 
no aggressive trading either way prior to the economic data due out Friday," 
said Daiwa senior trader Ned Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said hopes seemed to be building that the market would get some 
favorable news on inflation when the government reports Friday on the producer 
price index of finished goods for March. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street estimates call for the index to show a rise of about 0.5%, down 
from 1% in both January and February. 
</P>
<P>
That would come as at least a tentative signal that the Federal Reserve was 
seeing some results in its efforts to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
Producer prices are a gauge of inflationary pressures, which can determine the 
direction of interest rates. Inflation also lowers the value of such 
fixed-income securities as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, brokers says that if progress remains slow in the 
anti-inflation campaign, fears could mount that the Fed might wind up pushing 
the economy into a recession with its credit-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
Among deals affecting the market were the merger of SmithKline Beckman and 
Britain's Beecham Group and Hewlett-Packard's $476-million deal to buy Apollo 
Computer. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell slightly in subdued early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue was off 9/32 point, or nearly $3 per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
its price, rose to 9.12% from 9.09% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
trading at 9 3/4%, unchanged from late Tuesday.

An Oklahoma football player testified today that he saw teammates Nigel Clay, 
Bernard Hall and Glen Bell sexually assault a woman in the athletic dormitory 
Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Fennell told a judge he was in the bedroom of Clay's dorm the night the 
woman said she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Fennell testified in the preliminary hearing involving his three teammates who 
are charged with first-degree rape in the alleged assault of a 20-year-old 
Oklahoma City woman. 
</P>
<P>
Fennell said Hall took the woman to the back bedroom and turned out the lights 
and a short time later he and others in the front room heard a scream. Fennell 
said he, Clay, Keith Traylor and Bell ran into the bedroom and he saw Hall on 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Fennell said Hall initially tried to have intercourse with the woman but was 
unsuccessful. He said Clay then attempted to have intercourse with the woman 
while Hall sat on her chest. He said Clay got up a short time later and Hall 
got back on and "that's when he penetrated her." 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Please, no, don't do this. I've never been with a guy before,' " 
Fennell said.

He said when Hall was finished, Hall got up and left the room. 
</P>

Fennell said Clay then engaged in sex with the woman, and Bell also did.

President Bush saluted University of Michigan's 1989 NCAA championship 
basketball team as "America's sports heroes" today -- and then upheld his own 
athletic reputation by sinking a crowd-pleasing foul shot. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who played first base on Yale's 1948 baseball team, stepped to the 
free-throw line of an impromptu basketball court in the Rose Garden, said 
nervously, "I'm going to live with this the rest of my life" and lofted the 
ball toward the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
The ball rolled half way around the rim before it dropped through to cheers 
from the White House gathering, which included Michigan's congressional 
delegation, Vice President Dan Quayle and members of three area high school 
basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Michigan's Rumeal Robinson, who tossed in the winning free 
throws against Seton Hall in the college championship game April 3, showed Bush 
the preferred way when he swished his shot. 
</P>
<P>
The President described the Wolverines as a blend of "shooting, intelligence 
and character."
