* Steve Valenzuela was targeted for success: student body president at 
Roosevelt High School and a Harvard scholarship. "There's no question I had 
expectations to live up to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Los Angeles in 1978 with a degree in government and spent the 
next nine years with a Westwood real estate firm. Now one of three operations 
directors at Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency, he manages a budget 
of $100 million and oversees city projects, including the Central Business 
District and a redevelopment study of the Eastside where he grew up. Such 
revitalization is crucial because, said Valenzuela, 33, "There can be no true 
political development without underlying economic development." 
</P>
<P>
* Since becoming the first Latina selected as an astronaut candidate this year, 
Ellen Ochoa somehow fits frequent public appearances in her "70-hour work week" 
as chief of Intelligent Systems Technology at NASA's Ames Research Center near 
San Jose. "It's fun to see how much interest students have in the space 
program," said Ochoa, 31, who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from 
Stanford. Ochoa, a Los Angeles native who grew up near San Diego, will train in 
Houston for a year before beginning a technical job leading to an assignment on 
a shuttle mission. EDWARD J. BOYER

KENNEDY'S BASEBALL COACH PRIZES INHERITANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fernando Dominguez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the one drawback to inheriting something valuable is keeping it that 
way once you have it. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel (Manny) Alvarado faced that challenge when he took over the perennially 
successful Kennedy (Granada Hills) High School baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly figured what to do with his hand-me-down. Last season, his first 
at the helm, he led the Golden Cougars to the City 4-A title with a 4-3 victory 
over Palisades in the championship game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question is, can he improve Kennedy's 22-7 overall record of 1989 and 
its 12-4 North Valley League-winning mark? Can his team repeat? 
</P>
<P>
"Our pitching is better than it was last year," said Alvarado. "And if Garrett 
Anderson and Lazaro Campos have the years they are capable of having, we'll be 
able to score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is an All-City center fielder who hit .362 and knocked in 31 runs in 
1989, and Campos is a three-year varsity catcher who batted .367 last season. 
"Campos is a potential All-City catcher. He's a big boy who has occasional 
power. He also handles the pitchers well," said Alvarado, 36. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado is concerned, however, with the inexperience of his team and with 
pitching-rich rival San Fernando. The Tigers finished 1 1/2 games behind 
Kennedy in league play last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think San Fernando is always going to be our toughest competition," Alvarado 
said of the school where he was an infielder in the early '70s and later an 
unpaid assistant to Coach Steve Marden before getting the Kennedy job. "I love 
playing against them. . . . It's like playing at home," Alvarado added. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy indeed made itself at home in the team's first game at San Fernando 
this season, beating the Tigers, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Bell High School soccer coach William Albano disagrees with the state 
interscholastic rule that gave his team a second chance at the 1989-90 City 
title game, but he nevertheless believes that it must be respected and 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy developed after Monroe's 2-1 victory over Bell in the playoff 
semifinals when someone told Albano that Monroe players Oscar Rios and William 
Leal had played on a club team during the high school season, which violated 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe was disqualified and Bell went on to win its first City soccer 
championship with a 1-0 victory over Kennedy (Granada Hills) on a head shot by 
Jorge Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the rule. We have been fighting it for 19 years and the state 
doesn't want to change it. It is impossible for a coach to know where all his 
kids are on a Sunday, but the rule is there and you have to live with it," 
commented Albano, who coached the team to an 11-1-2 record and the Southeastern 
Conference crown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we stole anything. I had a good team and I think it deserved to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The team was led by juniors Robert Estrada, the All-City Most Valuable Player, 
forward Jose Medina (14 goals) and Jose Flavio Rodriguez, a midfielder who 
scored eight goals and who Albano considers the "brain of the team." 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive season, the Roosevelt girls basketball team conked 
out at the doorstep of the City 3-A title. And it was Marshall who once again 
derailed the Roughriders. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt, 16-3 overall and Eastern League co-champions with Huntington Park at 
11-1, lost to Marshall, 49-47, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park also came up short with a 56-49 loss at the hands of a tough 
University squad in the other semifinal. Coach Bonnie Jones' team ended the 
season with an overall record of 16-5, and with two players on the All-League 
teams -- Maritza Cruz (first team) and Jeannette Vessells (second). 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt's setback to Marshall, which went on to win the 3-A title, prompted 
Coach Lorenzo Garcia to contemplate quitting because of the disappointment. But 
with All-League guards Rosa Mendez and Angie Quezada back next year, Garcia 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured maybe three's the charm," he said. "I'm going to give it one more 
shot."

INS CHIEF SEEKS BETTER VERIFICATION METHODS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: A MUCH-DEBATED PHONE SYSTEM IN WHICH EMPLOYERS WOULD CHECK 
DOCUMENTS LIKE THEY DO CREDIT CARDS IS ONE IDEA BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>

U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary said 
Wednesday that he favors reforms -- perhaps even a telephone verification 
system -- to close documentation loopholes that have allowed illegal immigrants 
to continue to find jobs in the United States by using phony paper work. 
</P>
<P>
Such new procedures, McNary said, could provide prospective employers with an 
efficient means of verifying documents demonstrating a person's eligibility to 
work in the United States, thus achieving two goals: reducing the job market 
for illegal immigrants and cutting down on discrimination against 
foreign-looking job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'd like to do is improve the verification system," he said during his 
first official visit to the U. S.-Mexico border zone in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
However, McNary, speaking from atop the southern levee of the Tijuana River, a 
major crossing area for the undocumented, said he is categorically opposed to 
any effort to create a national identification card -- a document that is 
anathema to civil libertarians and others who see it as an Orwellian intrusion 
into individual privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't and never have" supported a national ID card, said McNary, apparently 
reflecting the official position of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about alternate proposals, McNary said, "It might just take a phone 
call." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a projected telephone verification system -- similar to 
that used for credit cards -- that would allow employers to dial a number and 
quickly assess whether the paper work presented by a job applicant is forged or 
authentic. It is among the most popular of the ideas for improving the methods 
to root out the phony documents that are now in wide circulation. 
</P>
<P>
McNary did not fully back the telephone verification procedure, but he 
indicated that it is one alternative being seriously studied by authorities 
seeking to reduce the job market for the undocumented. It was the only 
alternative he mentioned during a news conference at the border, aside from a 
$1-million advertising campaign aimed at encouraging employers not to hire 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
McNary's comments were the strongest to date on the telephone verification 
concept, said Verne Jervis, the commissioner's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
However, a phone verification system is far from becoming reality, and many 
questions remain about how it would be put in place and how effective it would 
be. A central issue is whether such verifications would be mandatory for all 
employers -- something that many consider unlikely because of the burden to the 
employers and the expense of setting up such a system -- or whether employers 
could simply use the system as an option. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers have already said that such a system is doomed to failure, 
particularly if it is a voluntary process dependent on the good faith of 
employers who benefit from undocumented labor. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound like a cure-all to me," said Kitty Calavita, assistant 
professor of social ecology at University of California, Irvine, who has 
conducted extensive studies on the relationship between employers and 
immigrants. "For a vast number of employers in this area, it's just not in 
their interest to check." 
</P>
<P>
The document verification issue has been among the thorniest facing lawmakers 
since Congress began debating the reform of immigration laws early in the 
1980s. The debate intensified in 1986 with the passage of the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act, which, for the first time, made it a federal crime for 
employers to hire undocumented workers. However, the law established what many 
consider an inadequate, cumbersome and loophole-ridden verification system that 
officials concede has supercharged what was already a booming market for false 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies have shown that undocumented immigrants have managed to easily 
bypass the requirements by showing forged identification documents to 
prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
Most employers must now review a range of up to 17 documents -- from driver's 
licenses to passports to visas -- to verify eligibility for jobs in the United 
States. But there is a major loophole: Employers are not required to check the 
authenticity of the submitted paper work, beyond a cursory inspection for 
obvious forgery or other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, charged 
that the process has led to "widespread discrimination" against legal 
residents, particularly those who look foreign. Many employers are afraid to 
hire such applicants, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
A phone verification system, proponents say, would resolve matters quickly by 
allowing employers to dial a toll-free number, punch in identification codes 
and receive a timely answer about whether the documents submitted by the 
applicant were real and current. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, who has been the nation's top immigration officer since October, said 
the technology should not be a problem, but others have questioned the 
effectiveness of such a system. For one thing, a prospective employee may 
present a document that is indeed a valid one, but that could belong to someone 
else. Many undocumented job-seekers borrow legitimate documents or purchase 
them on the black market, studies have shown.

NAVY TO READY NUCLEAR-CARRIERS PIER BUT SAYS NONE TO MAKE IT HOME PORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy insists that there are no plans now to permanently dock 
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in San Diego, even though a $5-million 
contract is expected to be awarded soon to renovate North Island piers so they 
can accommodate a nuclear carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officers said the piers, which are expected to be ready for the new role 
in early 1992, will be used primarily for visiting nuclear carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature for somebody to put together that nuclear power is going 
to be there, and therefore the ships will be there," said Vice Adm. Jack 
Fetterman Jr., commander Naval Air Force Pacific. "Nothing I know about brings 
the ships here in the near term." 
</P>
<P>
With the Independence, a San Diego-based, conventionally powered carrier slated 
to move to Japan in 1991, San Diego is scheduled for the first time in more 
than 20 years to have only one carrier, the Ranger, making its home port here. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the home port for 15 nuclear-powered submarines and two nuclear 
cruisers, but it has never been the home port for a nuclear aircraft carrier. 
All of the carriers that have made their home port in San Diego have been 
conventionally powered by steam turbines. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction in the number of carriers now based here and the 
renovation work scheduled for the piers has led to speculation that the Navy 
will permanently assign a nuclear-powered carrier to San Diego. Such an 
assignment would be welcomed by local officials, who say it could inject 
millions of dollars annually into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) asked Secretary of the Navy 
Lawrence Garrett to consider sending a nuclear carrier to San Diego, saying: 
"With the nuclear upgrade of the pier facilities at North Island set to begin 
later this year, this would appear to be a prudent move." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett has not provided any firm information concerning the assignment of 
carriers, but he wrote Hunter last month, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that San Diego will continue to have some carrier presence. . 
. . San Diego has always been a very special Navy home, and we look forward to 
continuing our long and rewarding relationship with 'America's Finest City.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called for a moratorium on military 
construction in January, it is slated to be lifted May 1. Officials expect to 
invite companies to bid on the North Island pier renovation contract in July 
and award it in August, Fetterman said. The work is expected to be completed 
around March 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"This new program will allow ships to shut down and, like plugging in an 
extension cord, they will operate off the power we'll provide," said Ken 
Mitchell, a spokesman for North Island Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
With the new project, three carrier berths at North Island's key wall will be 
upgraded, said Capt. Dave Schlesinger, commanding officer of the Southwest 
Engineering division. The one berth slated to accommodate a nuclear carrier 
will be changed so it can provide 4,160 volts of electricity, instead of 480 
volts. This will allow the carrier to use shore power and not have to draw on 
its own power, Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to save money for the base. Under the new plan, 
Navy officials will purchase more high voltage power at a cheaper rate that 
will enable them to save $1 million a year, Mitchell said. "This will provide a 
major savings to the air station." 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders applaud the renovation project as luring vital resources to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are down to one or two carriers, and we are looking at the handwriting on 
the wall," said Pete Litrenta, vice president of military affairs with the San 
Diego Chamber of Commerce. "We want to have facilities capable of accepting 
nuclear carriers." 
</P>
<P>
With base closings proposed across the nation, a number of states are expected 
to vie for the carriers, which can mean $100 million each in contracts and 
payroll annually to the community that wins one. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda Naval Air Station, proposed to be shut in the more austere defense 
budget, has two nuclear carriers, the Carl Vinson and the Enterprise. If the 
Northern California base is shut, these carriers will be reassigned. And San 
Diego, with its newly renovated piers would be a good candidate for those 
carriers, some say. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is now studying the ramifications of closing the base. But Fetterman 
says he supports maintaining the air station. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Alameda is a viable base and my studies show that it's critical to our 
readiness equation and our ability to disburse carriers up and down the coast," 
said Fetterman, who was cautiously optimistic about the prospect of another 
carrier -- though not necessarily one from Alameda -- being assigned to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has been and will continue to be essential for naval training and 
deployment forces," Fetterman said. "I do not see that diminishing 
significantly in the future."

'LIVEABOARDS,' MARINA OWNERS EXCHANGE JABS; 
</P>
<P>
FEES: AT ISSUE ARE INCREASES THAT OPERATORS WANT TO LEVY ON BOATERS FOR LIVING 
ABOARD THEIR VESSELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saturday at Ventura West Marina, a group of sailors will give up a day on the 
ocean and instead walk the docks, trying to gain allies in an escalating war 
with marina operators. 
</P>
<P>
The "liveaboards" are protesting what many contend is an unreasonable increase 
in the fee they pay for the privilege of living on vessels tied up at the 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm irritated as hell," said Paul Bruer, a diver who lives on his boat. "I 
don't mind if they raised the rents, but I feel they should put the money to 
use here at the marina and not just pocket it." 
</P>
<P>
The increase sought by marina operators is between 9% and 10% of the present 
fees, which are $90 per month for each single, $135 for each couple. Also, 
marina operators are seeking a hike of 5% in slip fees. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the liveaboards say the increase, to be decided next week by the 
commissioners of the Ventura Port District, is unfair. They say maintenance at 
the marina should be improved first. 
</P>
<P>
Across the harbor, where 60 liveaboards at Ventura Isle Marina were assessed up 
to 33% monthly increases in January, boaters are also facing a proposed 5% 
increase in slip fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Every business analyzes its costs every year," said Randy Short, who manages 
700 slips for Almar Ltd.'s Ventura Isle Marina. "And it's been a year since 
Ventura Isle increased its slip rates." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kotal, manager of Ventura West's 545-slip marina, said boaters are 
independent-minded and expects they will protest. Kotal said he doesn't expect 
the Wednesday commission meeting to be smooth sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"It never is," Kotal said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebellious liveaboards of Ventura West plan to cite what they contend is 
poor maintenance, and burned-out parking lot and dock lights as primary 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not object to an increase," said Edward Grubb, skipper of the Great Dane 
and one of the authors of the petition. "But management is not spending time or 
money keeping the place up." 
</P>
<P>
Grubb and others interviewed Wednesday pointed to little things that add up to 
big headaches -- the shower that periodically breaks down on cold mornings, the 
lack of carts to get things to and from the parking lot, the spotty janitorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for liveaboards -- assessed on top of the slip rates -- is intended to 
offset extra utility and maintenance costs incurred by daily use of dock 
facilities. It is the liveaboards who are most vocal in opposition to rate 
increases at the harbor and critical of day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ventura West, David Rowe, owner of the Jembach, said: "Maintenance 
is marginal." 
</P>
<P>
"Facilities are clean but not well-maintained. It takes a long time to get 
things fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Kotal: "The water heater broke a month ago, and it was fixed within 
the hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Security is non-existent," Connie Breedlove complained. She and other boat 
owners cite vandalism in the parking lot as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the rent increase is earmarked for a night parking lot security guard 
at Ventura West, Kotal said. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, if approved, mean that a couple renting a 46-foot slip at 
Ventura West and living aboard would pay $550 under the new rates, an increase 
of $34. 
</P>
<P>
At Ventura Isle, across the harbor, the same couple, having experienced a 
liveaboard fee increase of $50 in January, would pay $578 for a 45-foot slip. 
Their costs will have risen $68 since this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Living aboard a boat is not cheap," said Breedlove, owner of the Principia, 
docked at Ventura West. "People think it is, but that's a myth." On top of the 
slip costs, most boat owners also carry heavy loans on their boats, she said. 
Also, Breedlove and some boat owners pay their own electricity costs. She said 
one of her recent electric bills topped $60. 
</P>
<P>
Short said the monthly electric bill for Ventura Isle is more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Isle's 25% to 33% liveaboard fee increase of January was a "catch-up" 
increase, Short said, adding that it had not been adjusted for six or seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone opposes the rate increase. "It's a free marketplace," said John 
Jensen, owner of the American Dream. "They feel they should raise the rents to 
whatever the market will bear, and they have that right." 
</P>
<P>
"Five percent is fair," said Chuck Jansen, owner of the Bordello, a cabin 
cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Harbor General Manager Richard Parsons said rate increase requests are 
usually granted by the commission. He said only one request has been rejected, 
that from a marina in bankruptcy.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 78TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
PARTISANS 'SPIN' ANALYSES OF UPSET PRIMARY VOTE RESULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after Republican Jeff Marston's upset first-place finish in the special 
78th Assembly District primary, his backers and those of his Democratic rival 
quickly turned their attention to June's runoff, casting one more subjective 
glance backward to chart their path. 
</P>
<P>
If Tuesday was the day for voters to speak in the race for the Assembly seat 
vacated by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate last December, 
then Wednesday clearly belonged to the candidates' "spin" experts, who sought 
to sell dramatically different interpretations of the primary -- analyses that, 
in each case, reflect most favorably on their chances in June. 
</P>
<P>
That task was admittedly more difficult for Democrat Mike Gotch, the former San 
Diego city councilman who was forced to try to put the best possible face on 
his second-place finish in a campaign that many of his closest backers thought 
he could win outright in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Democratic vote was divided among four candidates Tuesday, 
while Marston was the only active Republican in the primary, Gotch partisans -- 
offering their preferred "spin" on the story -- confidently predict that they 
will reverse the finish order June 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it an upset," Evonne Schulze, Gotch's campaign coordinator, 
said of the primary result. "We did very well, considering that there were four 
Democrats running, while the Republicans pulled behind one candidate. If all 
the Democrats had united behind Mike, there wouldn't even be a June runoff." 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing such arguments as mere what-if speculation, Marston preferred to 
bill his finish in the six-candidate race as a major upset that significantly 
shifts momentum in his direction as the runoff campaign begins. 
</P>
<P>
"I look upon it as a victory for me and, at the same time, something of a 
repudiation of Mike," said Marston, a former aide to San Diego City 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.). "Most of the 
people in this district know Mike's name and had a chance to vote for him 
Tuesday. The fact that so many didn't do that is significant." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial vote totals showed that Marston, who benefited from the withdrawal 
of his only two GOP rivals late in the campaign, received 13,073 votes (35.9%), 
far short of the 50%-plus victory needed for outright victory in the primary. 
Gotch, who began the race as a prohibitive favorite, qualified for the runoff 
by finishing second with 10,781 votes (29.6%), comfortably ahead of the 15.5% 
total of his nearest Democratic rival, lawyer Howard Wayne. About 1,000 votes, 
most of them absentee ballots turned in at the polls, will not be counted until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of the unorthodox rules governing special elections, Peace and 
Freedom Party member Jane Rocio Evans also will be on the June runoff ballot, 
despite drawing only 809 votes (2.2%) Tuesday. However, Evans -- who qualified 
for the June ballot simply because she was her party's only primary candidate 
-- is expected to be little more than a political footnote in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
As Marston and Gotch shifted their perspective to June, the two competing 
campaigns devoted much of Wednesday to the kind of point-counterpoint debate -- 
one that blends detached analysis with wishful thinking -- that frequently 
occurs the day after elections. Indeed, for virtually every theory that one 
side offered about either the primary's outcome or the prospects for the 
runoff, the other campaign was ready with a counter-argument. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if Marston wanted to savor his first-place finish as a possible 
harbinger of the June runoff, Gotch's aides were quick to note that, overall, 
Democratic candidates received nearly 55% of the primary vote -- more than 1 
1/2 times Marston's total. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had finished second, and more Republicans than Democrats had voted, then 
I'd be worried," said Gotch consultant Bob Glaser. "But this was a strong 
Democratic turnout, and that's an encouraging sign for June." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, although Gotch is counting on partisan loyalties to attract that 
Democratic support in June, Marston contends that many of the other Democrats' 
votes stemmed from an anti-Gotch sentiment that he can tap into in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly aren't conceding those or any other votes," said Marston 
consultant Sara Katz. "This is a district where voters are more issue-driven 
than driven by whether there's an 'R' or a 'D' after the name. Besides, a lot 
of those votes were cast by Democrats who obviously didn't think much of Mike 
Gotch." 
</P>
<P>
Though Democrats have held the 78th District seat since 1972, the party holds 
only a slim 45%-41% registration edge there -- making it the most heavily 
Republican Assembly district in the state represented by a Democrat during 
Killea's four terms. Combined with Marston's showing Tuesday, the Mid-City 
district's demographics create the potential for perhaps the most competitive 
election there since Democrat Larry Kapiloff, now a Superior Court judge, upset 
Republican Assemblyman E. Richard Barnes 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While their predictions differ, for obvious reasons, the two sides agree that 
the runoff hinges largely on where the supporters of Wayne and the other 
also-rans turn in June. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, who endorsed Gotch Wednesday, said he believes the two Democrats' 
partisan and ideological similarities will give Gotch an advantage over Marston 
in going after Wayne's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike stands for most of the things I stand for, and I'm going to do everything 
I can to make sure my supporters know that," Wayne said. "I suppose some of my 
votes may have been a protest against Mike. But those anti-votes had so many 
places to go, I'm not sure it counted for much of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the primary, Wayne sharply criticized Gotch, particularly over the 
former two-term councilman's vote for the controversial Belmont Park 
development in Mission Beach. Seeking to put those disagreements behind, Wayne 
added: "On most of the big things, Mike's vision is closer to my own. What it 
comes down to is, I think the district would be better served with him in the 
Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Gotch's strategists also are heartened by the fact that dramatically different 
dynamics will be at work in June than were evident in Tuesday's special 
primary. With the Assembly race being the only issue on the 78th District 
ballot Tuesday, voter turnout was only about 21.8% -- much lower than is 
expected in the normal statewide June primary. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the contested Democratic gubernatorial primary between former San 
Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp could enhance 
Gotch's candidacy by boosting Democratic turnout in June. In contrast, former 
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson is the presumptive GOP gubernatorial nominee, 
lessening Republicans' incentive to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a factor we'll have to deal with," Marston conceded. "The only way to 
do that is to work harder to get out Republicans and to appeal to Democrats. 
Obviously, we're not going to win without Democratic votes." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's inconclusive primary set the stage for a potentially confusing 
"double election" in June -- a political rarity as intriguing as it is 
perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
On the same June ballot on which Gotch and Marston will compete in the special 
runoff for the six months remaining in Killea's unexpired term, they also will 
be seeking their respective parties' primary nominations for the two-year term 
at stake in November. Moreover, the losers from Tuesday's special primary also 
will appear on the normal June primary ballots -- because, election officials 
say, it is too late for their names to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to get (the losers) off the ballot, because it's silly and confusing 
to have the names of people not really running on it," San Diego County 
Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack said. "But there's nothing we can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there is a remote chance that the victor of the special runoff 
could simultaneously lose his party's normal primary. Expressing a common 
concern, Gotch aide Schulze suggested that confused voters might inaccurately 
conclude that they must vote for different candidates in the two separate 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Though such a split decision seems doubtful, a more realistic possibility is 
that the winner of June's special runoff could be unseated in November -- by 
the candidate whom he defeated five months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to be the assemblyman for only six months," Marston said. "But 
the reality is that that's all you really win in June. It's only round one. 
It's a very important first round. But there's another big one waiting in 
November."

GUARDS START PATROL OF ENCINITAS CAMP; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: THE CITY HAS HIRED A SECURITY FIRM TO KEEP AN ENCAMPMENT OF CENTRAL 
AMERICANS OFF 18 ACRES OF MUNICIPAL LAND THAT OFFICIALS SAY HAS BECOME A HEALTH 
HAZARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With little fanfare, Encinitas on Wednesday began 24-hour security patrols on a 
secluded piece of city-owned swampland in an effort to extinguish a growing 
Guatemalan migrant community that has taken root there. 
</P>
<P>
In an early-morning fog, Joseph Canales eased his red, four-wheel-drive truck 
along a dirt road behind the Big Bear market near Interstate 5, scouting out 
Central Americans who might have set up camp in the dense undergrowth. 
</P>
<P>
Canales, the owner of Carlsbad Security Patrol, is a big man who wears 
sunglasses and a blue uniform but carries no gun. Over the next three months, 
his firm will be paid $31,000 by the Encinitas Sanitary District to put the 
word out to scores of Guatemalans seeking political asylum that their presence 
will no longer be tolerated on the property. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, Canales didn't have much to say. There were few migrants 
on the property, leaving Canales to chase three curious onlookers from the 
site, referring their questions to the Encinitas city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
"He's there as a security guard," explained Gloria Carranza, the city's 
transient issues coordinator, "not to answer to reporters." 
</P>
<P>
For city officials, Canales is part of the most recent attempt at a solution to 
the two-year buildup of trash and fecal matter on the property they say poses a 
public health hazard. The constant presence of migrants has also angered the 
local business community, which claims to have lost millions of dollars in 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan camp has become a major test for this North County coastal city 
in its efforts to control the influx of migrant laborers from Mexico and 
Central America. Their hastily constructed camps stand in stark contrast -- and 
often within several hundred feet of -- upscale housing tracts and condominium 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite $25,000 in city funds recently spent to conduct a sometimes daily 
cleanup of the area -- during which migrants' belongings were often thrown away 
after they left the area for the day -- the workers have persisted in 
rebuilding their makeshift hooches among the 18 acres of eucalyptus, bamboo and 
thick brush, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
So last month, in a controversial 3-2 decision, the sanitary district voted to 
hire security guards to chase laborers from the property before they even have 
a chance to spread out their belongings. Canales will meet with City Manager 
Warren Shafer next week to decide whether to cut patrols back to 16 hours a 
day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are opposing viewpoints to this plan -- even on the board," Carranza 
said. "We're not really addressing the question of where these people are going 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the political strife there, we can be assured, however, that these 
Guatemalans aren't going back home. Let's wait and see if this is the solution. 
I mean, everything else we've tried here hasn't worked." 
</P>
<P>
By 8 a.m., two hours after Canales showed up at the site, more than a dozen men 
were soliciting work along Encinitas Boulevard in front of the market, 
seemingly oblivious of his prowling of the nearby campsites. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledge that the men can legally solicit day labor on the 
street, and aren't affected by Canales' patrols during daylight. The first true 
test for the security guards, they say, will come when migrants return to the 
camp after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local business community's reaction to the new security presence 
was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Fritz, an assistant manager at a gas station and mini-mart next to the 
grocery store complex, said recent city efforts to discourage workers have cut 
down on the number of Guatemalans who normally gather outside each morning. 
</P>
<P>
"An average morning, we'll get 20 or 30 who come in to buy coffee and breakfast 
rolls, but I've only seen two or three today," he said. "These people don't 
bother me, what bothers me is the government's harsh treatment of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of shooting rockets to the moon, we ought to be taking care of 
problems like this right here on the ground. I've seen whole families -- men, 
women and children -- crawl out of that camp, even in the pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be providing some place for them to live, with proper toilet 
facilities, not running them out like animals." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria McGawley has a different fix on the situation. The owner of a nearby 
health food store says her female customers are afraid to ride their bicycles 
there because of cat-calling by the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Just last summer, she said, hundreds of men would gather in back of the complex 
on weekends to drink and play cards. One migrant was stabbed to death in a 
fight over money, she said. On other occasions, she added, women customers have 
been harassed by the workers at a nearby laundromat. 
</P>
<P>
For McGawley, it's all bad for business. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a small businesswoman, I'm concerned about self-preservation," said 
McGawley, who has chased migrants from the front of her shop. "I'm more 
sympathetic to these people than the others here. But, if it takes a security 
presence to move them on their way, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Elias, who owns a house overlooking the city's property, said he once 
walked to his job as a barber in the shopping center complex. But no more, not 
after the Guatemalans took over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen it go from a pristine area that was a natural place for kids to play 
to become nothing but a dump," he said. "I built a back porch to overlook the 
area, but now all I see are people urinating. That's the reality we have to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Elias and other business operators recently put pressure on the Sanitary 
District to move the migrants from the property. "Our culture is designed for a 
certain way of life,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We better ourselves, move into regular houses and pay taxes. This living in 
squalor isn't what we're about in this country. These people have become a 
visual problem we have just got to do something about." 
</P>
<P>
Some Encinitas Boulevard businessmen have complained that the city's crackdown 
at Big Bear will just move the migrant problem down the road -- possibly into 
their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mabee, president of Big Bear markets in San Diego, wasn't buying the 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent one heck of a lot of money trying to find a solution to this 
problem," he said. "If these people want to put their head in the sand and try 
to blame one merchant, then let them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's society's problem, but no one wants to do anything about it. Well, we've 
suffered hard-cash dollar losses. Until we find the final solution, what more 
can we do but move them down the road?" 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Raul Tomas stood in the Big Bear parking lot and admitted 
that he has mixed feelings about the city's recent get-tough tactics with the 
migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 18 months, the 26-year-old Guatemala native has worked as a 
security guard for the grocery store, using his native tongue to try to 
persuade the laborers to stop bothering customers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he has been forced to call sheriff's deputies to assist him with 
uncooperative workers. His efforts have been largely successful. But now, he 
says, the city is suddenly upping the ante. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, when I talk to them, my countrymen say, 'Hey, you're from our 
country. You're just like us, only you've got a uniform.' Sometimes they only 
listen to the Americans, the sheriff's men. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they'll get their chance (to listen) because there'll be lots of Americans 
in uniforms here. I can't do anything more for my countrymen."

He didn't exactly feel like a character profiled on the "America's Most Wanted" 
TV show. 
</P>
<P>
But when Robert Khourey saw his photo in The Times, he knew there'd be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
He had been spotlighted for catching the first fish off the newly opened 
section of the Santa Monica Pier on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He had also phoned in sick to school that day. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the pier was pretty important to me," explained Khourey, 18, 
who attends Newmark High. "I've been fishing there for a long time. You hear 
about kids involved in gang shootings and so on every day. This was a pretty 
good cause." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Kay Lachter couldn't help laughing about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him a hard time for being truant," she said. "But how long has it been 
since you've heard about a kid being truant for that reason? 'Refreshing' was 
the word one of the teachers used."

A literary crime wave is sweeping the beach cities, from T. Jefferson Parker's 
"Laguna Heat," to Sue Grafton's alphabet series ("A is for Alibi," etc.), set 
in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ferrigno's "Horse Latitudes" pays a surrealistic tribute to Long Beach's 
top tourist attractions: "He wished life were more like a Japanese monster 
movie. Then he and Michael could sit on the bluffs, drink a few beers, and 
watch the Spruce Goose break out of its dome and attack the Queen Mary. BATTLE 
OF THE BEHEMOTHS!" 
</P>
<P>
In Michael Katz's recently released "Last Dance in Redondo Beach," a pro 
wrestler dies mysteriously while paddling a raft in a network celebrities 
sports event. 
</P>
<P>
One of Katz's references is already outdated in these fast-changing times. A 
sportscaster depressed over being assigned the celebrities competition is 
reassured by a friend that "Brent Musberger used to do the Strongman 
Refrigerator Pull." 
</P>
<P>
After his axing by CBS, Brent may soon be back with the refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a real-life crime scene, set in L.A.: 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the store with a dope pusher, a punk conspicuous for his mouthful 
of gold teeth, and bought a packet of cocaine. Then the pusher and I dropped 
into the back room of a saloon, where another addict joined our party. He broke 
up the crystals in their paper wrapping, placed the powder neatly between his 
thumb and forefinger, and snuffed the cocaine up each nostril. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
It was a description by the late newsman Hugh Baillie of L.A. in 1912.

<P>
John Farrell of Lomita wondered why a pig's face is superimposed over the mug 
of Pirate Radio disc jockey Scott Shannon on several area billboards. So we 
phoned the folks at KQLZ-FM. 
</P>
<P>
Was it the work of a vicious competitor? we asked. 
</P>
<P>
Nope. "We did it ourselves," said a cheery spokeswoman. "Our slogan is, 'We're

Sorry we asked.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: RECYCLING OF PHONE BOOKS IS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County's first program for recycling telephone books will begin 
Saturday with a bonus of free oak seedlings for the first 2,000 recyclers 
arriving at seven drop-off points in the county's west end. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program is designed to keep last year's phone books out of the county 
landfill following the delivery by GTE and Pacific Bell of an estimated 250,000 
new books to residences in Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Camarillo and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents who recycle help the environment by conserving landfill space 
and saving trees, said Victoria Hand, county recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"Every ton of recycled paper saves 17 trees," Hand said. "This is a wonderful 
program during Earth Day month," she said, referring to April 22 and the 
activities planned in Ventura County and nationwide to focus attention on the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The county coordinated the phone book recycling program with help and donations 
from the Ventura Regional Sanitation District and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
E.J. Harrison, the trash hauler for much of the county's west end, will supply 
the recycling bins for most drop-off sites at no charge, but the cost to haul 
the books and prepare them for market costs $60 per ton, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell paid $2,000 for the seedlings, which are native trees that take 
relatively little water. Five hundred of the seedlings will be handed out at 
Bailard Landfill. Other sites will have fewer seedlings to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
The phone book recycling program, which officials hope will recoup up to 20% of 
those thrown out in the county's west end, will continue through April 29.

HARVESTS HEALTHY AT COMMUNITY GARDEN 
</P>

<P>
Just yards from busy, six-lane Telephone Road in east Ventura, nestled next to 
a barranca and tucked in behind brick walls, lies a peaceful, verdant tribute 
to Mother Nature and cooperative gardening. 
</P>
<P>
It's the city of Ventura's Cornucopia Community Garden, a two-acre parcel 
situated on an Edison Co. easement just east of Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
For $40 for six months, gardeners can lease an 18- by 25-foot plot, either 
organic or non-organic. The fee covers trash and water service, the use of some 
tools, as well as a monthly gardening newsletter published by the city's 
recreation department, regular meetings featuring guest speakers, and an artful 
gardening manual full of tips and advice. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Barnum, 61, of Ventura rents two adjacent organic plots. A veteran 
junior high school band leader, Barnum signed up for his gardens in November 
after a long-awaited retirement trip with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
His plots are two of the more productive in the garden, with peas, onions, 
beans and carrots sharing space with corn, potatoes and lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been eating broccoli like mad," Barnum said on a recent afternoon as he 
surveyed his efforts. "I've been giving away cabbage, and we have enough 
spinach to freeze." 
</P>
<P>
He attributes his garden's success to his daily visits to weed, water and 
harvest, and he reaps rewards beyond the bounty of the fresh vegetables that he 
takes home. 
</P>
<P>
"My health has always been good," he said, "but it's better now because of 
gardening. I have a passion for it. I almost think I would've been better off 
as an organic farmer instead of a music teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hendricks, 60, makes a regular commute from Channel Islands Harbor, where 
he lives on his sailboat, to care for his plants. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the community garden seems to be a haven for condominium and apartment 
dwellers who have precious little room for a garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here," Hendricks said while taking a break from turning over soil 
with a spade. "I like the sun, and my co-workers enjoy the tomatoes I bring in. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's nice to sweat once in a while," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As for watering the gardens in a city where a rationing program is soon to 
begin, recreation Supervisor Beth Cohen said no one has determined how to 
reduce the amount of water used by the gardeners by the mandated 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"We might end up cutting back on the number of plots we rent, or asking people 
to voluntarily cut back on the amount of water they use," she said. "But I 
don't think there are many drought-tolerant vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
Water problems notwithstanding, the city expects to rent nearly all of the 
plots this spring. Of the 69 available in the northern section, nearly half are 
taken. KAREN McKEAN

NAMES HAVE CHANGED, BUT PHILOSOPHIES STAY SAME IN DEL MAR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The more things change, the more they stay the same. And Del Mar voters seem to 
like it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Two soon-to-be-vacant City Council seats were filled in Tuesday's election by 
candidates endorsed by the outgoing council members, and a ballot measure 
limiting the height of houses was approved in this traditionally slow-growth 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is always sort of a very big high, and I'm still sitting on that 
high," said Rod Franklin who, along with Chris Helton, will fill council seats 
being vacated by John Gillies and Brooke Eisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin and Helton were the top vote-getters for two seats up for grabs in a 
three-person race for an at-large position. Franklin received 996 votes, or 
41.1% of the ballots cast, and Helton drew 745 votes. Lew Dominy came in last 
with 680 votes. 
</P>
<P>
All three candidates had pledged to preserve the small-town atmosphere of the 
coastal community, but they had differences in approaching that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Franklin and Helton favored Measure A, the ballot measure limiting 
houses to two stories that passed Tuesday, Dominy advocated allowing property 
owners to build as they wish so long as they did not interfere with the rights 
of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The election drew 39% of the 3,509 registered voters, lower than the city's 48% 
turnout two years ago, but still almost twice the turnout rate of the 78th 
Assembly race also held on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg, who is also the outgoing mayor and who supported both council 
winners, said she is pleased with the results and does not expect the council 
to make any dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think of it as a vote of confidence for my council," Eisenberg said 
of the similarities between the present council and the incoming panel. "I 
don't think they're going to be vastly different, and I hope they're not. I 
supported them because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin hopes to orient the council toward issues outside the city limits that 
are relevant to Del Mar, including roads and traffic throughout the city, 
airport issues and the San Dieguito Lagoon and River Valley Park that would 
extend from Del Mar inland to Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said he brings a background in finance to the council that will help 
guide the city in fiscal matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod (Franklin) and I both have slightly different financial backgrounds, and 
we will be adding that to the City Council in a time when it is clear that 
state and federal grant money is harder and harder to come by," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
Helton is an investment researcher at Security Pacific Bank, and Franklin is a 
management consultant at Digital Equipment Corp. They assume office April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Measure A claim that it will "preserve the intent" of existing 
legislation regarding so-called "above-ground basements." 
</P>
<P>
"It represents almost two years of work to clarify language and make the rules 
more understandable," said Councilwoman Jan McMillan. "I don't think it will be 
really restrictive, and some people feel that it would be less restrictive than 
what's already on the books." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the measure claimed that the language is convoluted and overly 
restrictive of certain architectural features.

ELECTIONS / LANCASTER COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BLACK WINS ALONG WITH ROOT, INCUMBENT RODIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in Lancaster elected the high desert city's first black councilman, one 
of two "managed growth" candidates who were elected along with an incumbent in 
the crowded race for three City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Henry Hearns, 56, finished second among 15 candidates in his first 
political bid, surprising many in the crowd watching the vote count Tuesday 
night at Lancaster City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The minister and former chief environmental engineer at Edwards Air Force Base 
appeared to strike a responsive chord with a campaign that emphasized his 
planning and engineering experience, his educational background and his 
religious vocation. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns and his integrated campaign team said he will provide a new voice for 
the growing minority population in the city of 90,000 residents, which 
incorporated in 1977. About 5% of its population is black. But they said that 
race was not an issue and that voters selected Hearns because of his 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters saw a good, honest man and they voted for him," said Milt Huckaby 
of the Lancaster Coalition of Neighborhood Organizations, a homeowner group 
whose endorsement boosted the candidacies of Hearns and fellow victor George 
Root over several better-financed candidates. "The man has got a tremendous 
amount of ability." 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, who retired in December after 32 years at the Air Force base, said at a 
quiet victory party in Lancaster early Wednesday that he was gratified by the 
response to his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give thanks to the community for trusting me the first time around," 
Hearns said. "What this tells me is that the people who know me know that I do 
my very best to be fair to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Root, a 59-year-old administrator at Edwards Air Force Base and mobile home 
tenant activist, was the leading vote-getter with 3,938 votes, or 14.7% of the 
vote, in his third council bid. Hearns received 3,261 votes, 12.2%. Incumbent 
Arnie Rodio got 3,212 votes, 12.6%, to eke out a narrow reelection victory over 
Frank Roberts, a dean at Antelope Valley College. Two other incumbents did not 
seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns and Root both said they spent less than $10,000 each in a race where 
some front-runners who were identified with real estate and developer interests 
spent double and triple that amount. Hearns and Root were the only candidates 
backed by vigorous grass-roots efforts of the homeowner coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Huckaby hailed the election as a clear message of dissatisfaction with a 
council that he said has been unresponsive to homeowners and overly influenced 
by developers in decisions regarding Lancaster's rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
Root and Hearns said in separate interviews that they will emphasize careful 
planning and environmental study of projects such as a recent council decision 
to allow high-density housing development under the flight paths of Air Force 
Plant 42. That move was approved despite opposition by Air Force officials and 
community activists, and both Root and Hearns said they would have voted 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
"The message was clear," Root said of the election results. "People resented 
the influence of developers. People felt they did not have a vehicle to be 
fairly represented. . . . You can't have slow growth; that's a misnomer. But 
you can plan for growth." 
</P>
<P>
About 10,005 of Lancaster's 39,336 registered voters cast ballots, a turnout 
that City Clerk Carla Johnson described as moderate.

ROMANIAN GIRL ARRIVES FOR LIFE-SAVING SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks in large part to the efforts of two San Diego disaster relief 
volunteers, a 14-year-old Romanian girl is getting another chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
Adina Kupa, who was scheduled to arrive in San Diego late Wednesday night, will 
be treated at UC San Diego Medical Center for a growth on her tongue that 
swells and impairs her breathing, said Karen Brookes, a spokeswoman for 
Southwest Medical Teams, a nonprofit agency based in San Diego that collects 
medical supplies, equipment and services for distribution to disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Without laser treatment, she would probably die," Brookes said. 
</P>
<P>
Adina and her mother, Silvia, are natives of Cluj, a city in the Transylvania 
region. They arrived in Los Angeles on Wednesday aboard Yugoslav Airlines, 
which provided them with free transportation. 
</P>
<P>
While Adina is being treated, she and her mother will live with the family of 
Ovidiu Talpos, a Romanian living in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Talpos is a volunteer for Southwest Medical Teams, which arranged to bring the 
teen-ager to San Diego with his help and that of another volunteer, Dr. John 
Lasiter, the group's medical director. The two traveled to Romania in January 
to deliver medical supplies and to assess the country's medical needs after the 
new democratic government was installed. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting the American Embassy in Bucharest, they encountered Silvia Kupa, 
who was pleading for help for her dying daughter. Lasiter and Talpos offered 
their assistance and helped arrange visas for the Kupas to come to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Brookes said Talpos told his wife, a physician at UCSD, about the situation and 
that the hospital agreed to perform the surgery for free. 
</P>
<P>
Adina is the first person from an Eastern Bloc country to come to San Diego for 
medical treatment through Southwest Medical Teams' efforts, but, in a tentative 
agreement with UCSD and Yugoslav Airlines, the group will attempt to make 
arrangements to bring other Romanians here, primarily for reconstructive 
surgery, Brookes said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of sending people there, we will bring a few here," she said. "They 
are 30 to 40 years behind us in medical technology. They need training in 
sterile procedures. The doctors there wear street clothes, and do not wear 
sterile gloves or use sterile instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Brookes said that, if everything works out with the Romanian government, more 
patients should arrive within the next three months. They will be placed with 
San Diego families, preferably ones that speak Romanian.

DECISION DELAYED ON 77-ACRE TRACT, MALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to postpone for two weeks a 
decision on a proposal to build a 77-acre residential and retail project on the 
northeast corner of Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was made at the request of Hardy Strozier, a consultant for the 
developer, Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Strozier said the postponement is needed to give city staff time to study two 
modification options to the project. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the project would include 454 residential units -- including 154 
townhouse condominiums -- and a 51,275-square-foot retail center. However, 
Strozier asked the council to consider two options: one would replace the 4 
1/2-acre retail center with an office building, the other with about 90 more 
condominium units. 
</P>
<P>
The project's retail center was criticized Tuesday by members of the Rio Lindo 
Neighborhood Council. Members of the residential group said they fear that the 
retail center would increase traffic in the neighborhood. Strozier said the 
number of traffic trips from the commercial center would drop to about 6,000 a 
day from about 8,000 by replacing the retail center with office space. The 
number of trips would drop to about 4,000 daily if the retail center is 
replaced with residential units, he said. HUGO MARTIN

SCHOOL'S ANNUAL RAFFLE BANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
A raffle held for the last 20 years that has raised $60,000 each year for a 
Catholic high school in Oxnard will be closed down under pressure from the 
district attorney's office, school officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Anne Eugene Metcalf, principal of Santa Clara High School, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Bose's April 4 letter declaring the school's spring 
fiesta raffle to be an unlawful lottery will not be challenged by the private 
school "at this point." 
</P>
<P>
However, Metcalf said, school officials will push for a change in state law 
that she said "would allow drawings and other lottery-type events for 
charitable organizations." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: DRESS CODE WOULD BAN GANG SYMBOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Elementary School District took the first step Wednesday toward 
adopting a dress code that would prohibit children in kindergarten through 
eighth grade from wearing clothing or accessories that symbolize gang 
membership or affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no recent incidents of gang activity in the schools, said 
Richard Duarte, director of pupil services for the district. 
</P>
<P>
But because of Oxnard's proximity to Los Angeles, the district wants the code 
in place in case it is needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar dress code is in effect in Oxnard high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The school board Wednesday gave preliminary approval to the dress code. The 
proposal is scheduled for final adoption April 25. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the dress code would bar the district's 12,000 pupils from wearing 
such items as bandannas or sashes bearing gang colors, T-shirts displaying gang 
slogans or any other items that are perceived to represent affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the code, articles of clothing advocating drug or alcohol use would also 
be banned. These would include T-shirts with slogans referring to substance 
use, jewelry in the shape of marijuana leaves or cocaine spoons. 
</P>
<P>
"If any article of clothing is disruptive to the orderly process of a 
classroom, then the student will be sent to a site administrator," Duarte said. 
Items such as halter tops, bare midriffs, "skirts or attire which expose any 
portion of the student's undergarments or body areas normally covered" would be 
prohibited. Clothing with slogans such as "Question Authority" may also be 
prohibited, depending on the site administrator's decision, Duarte said. MAJA

ELECTIONS PALMDALE; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE THREATENS SPLIT ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The apparent election defeat of two Palmdale City Council members by 
challengers favoring tighter controls on development appears to divide the once 
solidly pro-growth council in the rapidly expanding Antelope Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
Semiofficial results from Tuesday's election showed businessman James Ledford 
and high school teacher James Root, who ran a joint campaign calling for more 
controls on growth, defeating first-term incumbents Tom Smith and Daniel 
Becker, both considered pro-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three incumbents on the ballot, only Mayor William (Pete) Knight clearly 
won reelection, outdistancing two opponents. But voters rejected a city-backed 
ballot measure to lengthen the mayor's term in office from two years to four, 
beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the council race remained uncertain because Root led Smith by 
only 26 votes in the semiofficial tally, with an estimated 152 ballots 
uncounted. However, Smith said Wednesday he did not expect to overtake Root in 
the final tally, which is due by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The result would leave Palmdale, one of the fastest-growing cities in 
California, with a sharply divided City Council. All five incumbents had been 
considered pro-growth. But Ledford and Root, while not advocating "slow 
growth," have urged closer scrutiny of development projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like the people have spoken for a change in the direction our 
city's going to take. I think they're looking for a little more controlled 
growth," said Ledford, a city Planning Commission member and owner of a 
Palmdale bar and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Ledford and Root promised to increase the city's park 
space, reduce traffic congestion and force builders to better mitigate the 
impacts of their developments. Both had the backing of city homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Smith and Becker stressed the advantages of the city's growth, 
including a new regional shopping mall set to open this fall. They too had 
homeowner support, but their campaigns also were strongly backed by developers 
and development-related political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Smith blamed his apparent defeat on the changing makeup of Palmdale. He said 
the city has become increasingly populated with Los Angeles-area residents who 
moved to escape urban ills, but now want to "pull up the drawbridge." 
</P>
<P>
Becker blamed his loss on two mailers attacking his rivals sent out by a 
pro-development group -- the Southern California Caucus -- linked to his 
campaign. Becker insisted he did not authorize the mailers and said they 
produced a voter backlash. One disclosed Ledford had a 1983 drunk-driving 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But Ledford went on to get 20.7% of the vote, more than anyone else in the 
field of 10 candidates for the two council seats. He was trailed by Root with 
19.3%, Smith with 19% and Becker with 15.4%. None of the other candidates got 
more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Knight got 60.7% to win a second two-year term as mayor, beating Kamal Chalabi 
with 22.9% and Brian Spencer with 16.4%. Measure A, which would have given the 
mayor the same four-year term as council members, was rejected 64.8% to 35.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout in the election was just under 19%.

To Pass Spending Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 362 to 59, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 4404) providing 
$2.4 billion in extra federal spending this fiscal year. About $1.8 billion 
would be taken from the defense budget and the rest is to be newly 
appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's major foreign outlays are $420 million to Panama, $400 million to 
Israel and $300 million to Nicaragua. At home it provides additional funds this 
year for veterans' benefits, food stamps, federal judges' pay, disaster aid, 
federal firefighting and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said: "Now comes the time to follow 
through" on helping Panama and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Toby Roth (R-Wis.) said: "The American people are not in favor of the 
legislation being debated here today." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the extra fiscal 1990 spending.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE OKS ROSE FLOAT DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three giant raccoons frolicking on a log will be the featured characters on 
Torrance's 1991 Tournament of Roses Parade float entry, City Council members 
agreed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by C. E. Bent and Sons Inc., "Nature's Playground" had been 
recommended by the city's volunteer Rose Float Assn. as best representing next 
year's Pasadena parade theme of "Fun and Games." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lofthouse, a representative of the float designing company, said the 
decoration of the mother raccoon and her two babies with pampas grass, wheat 
stalks and a variety of bark, leaves and petals will challenge the skills of 
Torrance volunteers. But Lofthouse said their experience from previous years 
should aid them in their task.

WOMEN POWER IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice president in 1984, the "women's vote" was 
billed as the sleeping giant that would awaken and save the Democratic Party. 
But the women's vote that year turned out to be a nonhappening. It was a 
different story for state treasurer Ann Richards of Texas this week. "Woman 
power," if you will, is considered a decisive factor in her Democratic 
gubernatorial primary victory -- even after a bruising campaign that could 
serve as the model for how low politics can sink. 
</P>
<P>
While there continues to be difficulty harnessing the women's vote in a 
national U.S. election, gubernatorial campaigns are proving time and again to 
be susceptible to the politics of gender. Specifically, women voters respond 
strongly to issues that cross ideological lines, such as the right to choose 
whether to have a child and personal safety issues like crime. In Texas, 
Richards clearly hopes to capitalize on her advocacy of the right to choose an 
abortion. She now faces a tough fight in the general election against 
millionaire opponent Clayton Williams Jr. But surely he'll gain no points with 
women for a stupid remark -- for which he later apologized -- that compared bad 
weather to rape: "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that raises the question of how will the gender mix play in 
California? Will former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, billed in 
commercials as "tough and caring," be able to hold onto her 2-to-1 poll lead 
with women? Especially when her Democratic primary opponent, Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, has a record on women's issues that is probably more 
conventionally in line than Feinstein's with the thinking of most feminists and 
Democratic Party activists? We wouldn't venture to guess. But the increasing 
opportunities for female and male candidates to face off are certain to make 
for more races where a few more male and female stereotypes can be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there's a broader stereotype -- this one about politicians -- 
that the Texas primary did not shatter. The primary between Richards and Atty. 
Gen. Jim Mattox illustrated, in almost cartoon strokes, that men and women are 
equally capable of stooping to conquer. Mattox started it, insinuating without 
any proof that Richards, a recovering alcoholic, was also once a cocaine 
addict. She shot back by pointing out that Mattox had been indicted on bribery 
charges, without mentioning his acquittal. Then it got even dirtier. As 
California politicians watched the Texas campaign, we can only hope that they 
exorcised whatever mudslinging impulses they may have.

MAN CHARGED WITH FRAUD THAT COST MIGRANTS $4,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside man was charged Wednesday with felony grand theft after he 
allegedly persuaded a small group of migrant workers to turn over nearly $4,000 
to him in exchange for lucrative airline jobs that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Four felony counts were filed against Jesus Garcia Arroya, 37, who authorities 
said convinced a group of migrants they would be hired for well-paying 
maintenance and welding positions at USAir if they paid him in cash for union 
dues and training fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of anything exactly like this," said district attorney's 
spokeswoman Linda Miller, adding that migrants are more typically robbed of 
cash rather than made the victims of con artists. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that, last December and January, Arroya met at least six 
North County migrants through mutual acquaintances, saying he was employed by 
USAir and would receive a bonus for signing up new workers. 
</P>
<P>
Arroya allegedly collected nearly $4,000 in phony union dues and advance 
payments for job training courses. 
</P>
<P>
The purported scheme began unraveling when two of the migrants appeared March 5 
at USAir's offices in San Diego and "stated they were reporting for work," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the migrants showed the airline supervisors what the migrants thought 
were employee cards, but what were actually plastic-covered baggage tags made 
to look like official identification. 
</P>
<P>
USAir officials contacted the district attorney's office, which began an 
investigation that led to Arroya's arrest in Oceanside on Monday. He was taken 
into custody without incident by a district attorney's investigator, and was 
being held Wednesday in County Jail at Vista in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Arroya is presumed to be in this country legally, as are his 
alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Con men think migrants won't come forward to the authorities," she said. "They 
think they can get away with it. It's shameful." 
</P>
<P>
She said the district attorney's office is investigating whether other migrants 
might have been victimized.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE REJECTS DEVELOPER'S PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer failed to win permission Tuesday to build eight new homes on a 
hemmed-in piece of North Torrance property. The proposal would have involved 
tearing down an existing house to make way for a new street. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Council members voted 4-3, with Councilmen Bill Applegate, Tim 
Mock and Dan Walker in the minority, to reject the project proposed by Steven 
Facer of Sequoia Real Estate Funds. 
</P>
<P>
The houses would have been built on irregular-shaped lots carved out of a 
triangular piece of land sandwiched between the Dominguez Channel, just south 
of El Camino College, and the back walls of existing houses on 166th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no public access to the site, Sequoia intended to demolish a 
house on the north side of 166th Street near Falda Avenue to create a new 
street leading into a cul-de-sac on the site. 
</P>
<P>
But residents complained that Sequoia's plan would place a street two feet from 
their back property lines, and in some cases within seven feet of their 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern that the existing sewer system, which has in the 
past backed up into the neighborhood, does not have enough capacity to handle 
eight new homes and that the new streets would not be wide enough for emergency 
access.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to adopt an amendment to the 
General Plan that will permit more commercial than industrial development in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, first proposed in August, will allow commercial development in 
10 areas that were previously slated for industrial or residential uses, 
Planning Director Michael Goodson said. High-density residential development 
will be permitted in four other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the properties are vacant lots located on or near Rosecrans Avenue, 
between Prairie Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard. An environmental impact report 
on the areas was adopted last May.

RED CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demise of the Red Cars back in the early 1960s was the beginning of our 
current transit woes; that was when mass transit began falling on hard times 
and the one-person auto began flooding the streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that we've had to spend millions in taxpayer dollars on 
research that keeps bringing us back to square one -- a light-rail network 
retracing the routes of the old Red Cars. 
</P>
<P>
Because of our failure to act, the inflated cost of the rail system is far more 
now than it was in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's recent action to 
approve a plan to build three new light-rail lines is welcome news, it is 
unfortunate that it has taken bureaucrats this long to act. 
</P>
<P>
Let's bring back the Red Cars. They worked. They got us to where we were going. 
And they were fun.

ARE LATINO PARENTS TO BLAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A child's family is almost always the best clue to how he or she will do in 
school. If mom and dad -- or just one of them -- care enough about what goes on 
in class to get involved with the process -- from helping with homework to PTA 
bake sales -- that student is going to do well. 
</P>
<P>
So Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos isn't completely off base when he 
says part of the blame for the appalling dropout rate among Latino students 
lies with parents who are not as involved with their children's education as 
they should be. But Cavazos is oversimplifying a complex social problem and, 
among all national education leaders, he should know better. 
</P>
<P>
A Mexican American, Cavazos was appointed to the Cabinet by two different 
presidents to give a Latino perspective on education, Topic A to most Latinos. 
As one of the nation's largest and fastest-growing immigrant groups, Latinos 
know upward mobility in this country starts where it did for all the immigrants 
who preceded them: in American schools. 
</P>
<P>
But the world in which Latino children -- in fact, all youngsters -- grow up 
today is far more challenging than what previous generations faced. There is 
less manual labor today, so more schooling is needed just to qualify for the 
most basic jobs. In too many families both parents must work merely to make 
ends meet, leaving less time to help with homework or attend school meetings. 
There are more distractions for modern kids, from relatively benign things like 
radio and TV to real dangers like gangs and drugs. Add the language barrier for 
many Latinos, and you have an inkling of how daunting a task Latino parents 
face just getting their kids through high school, much less college. 
</P>
<P>
Educators argue, with some evidence to back them up, that getting Latino 
parents involved in the schools requires special efforts at outreach -- 
inviting them in Spanish and making them feel welcome at the school. But that 
takes extra time and money when schools are scrambling just to pay for basics 
like textbooks and computers. So Cavazos' challenge is not just prodding 
resistant Latino parents, but reluctant public officials (like his boss, 
President Bush) to ante up more money for innovative efforts that help the 
learning process along. If Cavazos could pull that off, Latino students 
wouldn't be the only ones to benefit.

CONFESSIONS OF YOUTHFUL INDISCRETION ARE HYPOCRITICAL BABBLE. AND LOOK AT 
WHERETHOSE WHO EXPERIMENTED IN THE '60S ARE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley writes the TRB column in the New Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although I have no special desire to be governor of Texas, and would actively 
prefer not to become head of the Office of Thrift Supervision (overseer of the 
savings and loan mess), the traumas of aspirants to these posts in recent days 
compel me to make the following statement. 
</P>
<P>
Like many members of my generation -- Sen. Al Gore and Rep. Newt Gingrich, to 
name but two -- I, too, experimented with marijuana in the distant past. 
</P>
<P>
It was in a party situation during my freshman year in college. Someone handed 
me a marijuana cigarette and I took a puff. Maybe two. I deeply regret this 
youthful indiscretion. 
</P>
<P>
I found the drug had no effect on me whatsoever, and I determined not to 
experiment with illicit substances any further. Instead, I got throwing-up 
drunk in a manner more suited to one with aspirations toward a leadership role 
in this great country of ours. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few days later I experimented with marijuana once again and enjoyed 
it a good deal more. This youthful indiscretion I also deeply regret. 
</P>
<P>
During the next several years, overcome by the spirit of scientific inquiry, I 
experimented with marijuana perhaps 200 or more times. I am not sure of the 
exact number, but I do know that I deeply, deeply regret all of these youthful 
indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
As a law school student in the mid-1970s, I continued to conduct occasional 
experiments with marijuana, heedless of the baleful influence this apparently 
was having on impressionable members of the faculty like Douglas Ginsburg. In 
1987, Ginsburg lost his chance to become a Supreme Court justice after it was 
revealed that he had smoked pot while teaching at that very law school. 
Although my law school experiments were few in number, I deeply regret each one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the string of prominent Americans who have come forward lately to 
confess their dope experiences, I cannot pinpoint with the same remarkable 
clarity the last time I experimented with marijuana. Was it in the "distant" 
past? All I can say for sure is that it was in the past, somewhat distant, that 
it was an indiscretion, somewhat less youthful, and that I deeply regret it. 
</P>
<P>
These days my drug of choice is decaf. I drink it to forget. Knocks me right 
out. But if, perchance, I find myself experimenting with marijuana on some 
future occasion -- which won't happen until the law, or at least the Zeitgeist, 
has changed -- it will be an elderly indiscretion, which I regret. Deeply. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s are said to have been a period of cultural revolution, with marijuana 
playing a big part. Surely, though, the lesson we are learning as more and more 
people come forward with tales of their "experiments" is how little effect it 
all really had on the culture. The fact that nerds like Douglas Ginsburg (or 
the author of this column), goody-goodies like Al Gore and fast operators like 
Newt Gingrich all smoked dope shows both how widespread the phenomenon was and 
how little it mattered. 
</P>
<P>
How little it mattered is a rebuke to marijuana's fans as well as its foes. Pot 
didn't stop Ginsburg from becoming a right-wing legal scholar or Gingrich from 
becoming House Minority Whip. This is hardly what Flower Power was supposed to 
lead to. On the other hand, it didn't leave Timothy Ryan unable to tackle the 
S&amp;L catastrophe. The Great Pot Experiment produced millions of 
conventional, upstanding citizens, plus a few journalists. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears that Ginsburg was a victim of temporary cultural confusion. On 
the marijuana question, out-and-out lying may not be necessary. President Bush 
and Drug Czar William Bennett have said that past pot-smoking should not 
disqualify someone from high office. The revelation simply needs the right 
ingredients: experiment . . . distant past . . . youthful indiscretion . . . 
deep regret. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of course you can't be excused for "experimenting" with marijuana as a college 
kid today. Massachusetts Atty. Gen. James Shannon, age 37, recently made the 
boilerplate confession about past "experimentation," but now favors mandatory 
prison time for even casual users caught twice. He says that his attitude has 
changed. As the Church Lady says on "Saturday Night Live": How convenient. 
</P>
<P>
All these ex-Communist-style confessions-cum-recantations about past drug use 
leave a bad taste in my mouth. What I'm waiting for is some politician to 
announce that he used to indulge in marijuana every now and then, and that -- 
whatever he thinks about more serious drug problems -- he doesn't especially 
regret it. Maybe even that what he really regrets is all the experiments he 
didn't conduct in his youth, perhaps because he was too busy plotting his 
scramble up the Establishment heights. 
</P>
<P>
To have used marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s, when everyone was supposed to 
use marijuana, and to deplore marijuana in the 1980s and 1990s, when everyone 
is supposed to deplore it, is just a bit too unsurprising.

BALTIC TWO TALES OF INDEPENDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
.... BUT GORBACHEV IS DOING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT IF THE NAVAJO NATION UP AND DECLARED ITSELF SEPARATE? THE INDIANS MIGHT 
HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT, BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES COULD OR WOULD 
ALLOW. 
</P>

By GARY HART, Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado was a Democratic candidate for 
President in 1984 and 1988.

Suppose the Navajo Indians pass a resolution declaring their independence from 
the United States. And suppose they send this resolution to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose further that the tribe creates its own militia, declaring it to be the 
Army of the Navajo Nation, and orders it to establish its own border patrol and 
customs service. Then suppose, upon this declaration, several thousand young 
Navajo men desert from U.S. military service. Suppose representatives of the 
new Navajo Nation occupy various offices of departments of the U.S. government. 
Finally, suppose the new nation gains diplomatic recognition from various 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
You are President of the United States. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
Easy, you say. We should simply remind the Indians that the U.S. Constitution 
grants them no right of secession whatsoever, that they have no right to occupy 
government property, and that this is simply unacceptable behavior. In a huff, 
you send a military detachment from a nearby Arizona base to arrest the 
deserters with orders to throw them in the brig, and you instruct the local 
commander to take over the Interior Department buildings claimed by the 
Indians. You issue a statement, in an even greater huff, rejecting the tribal 
chief's offer to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of this silly game, you say. The Navajos are not Lithuanians. It just 
isn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
Well, probably not. But it is close enough to cause thoughtful people to pause 
in what might otherwise be wholehearted support for the embattled, overwhelmed 
Lithuanians. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if a large majority of the Lithuanian people want independence, we 
want them to have it. But, like the Navajos in this hypothetical situation, be 
reminded that the Lithuanians have not had a referendum on this issue. Is 
Mikhail Gorbachev beyond his rights and duties to insist that, at the very 
least, there be a vote on the matter? And what of the rights of the Russian 
people in the Lithuanian Republic? Can soldiers and sailors simply defect when 
their legislature declares its independence? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the issue of precedent. Are you doing your constitutional 
duty as president of the Soviet Union if you permit, without objection, every 
republic in the union to decide arbitrarily and without due process when and 
how it wishes to go its own way? That would simply be an open invitation to 
total chaos. No modern nation does its business that way. And we certainly do 
not accept this policy for ourselves. It is probably uncomfortable for us to 
remember that this was pretty much the identical issue for many 19th-Century 
Southerners and, after brutal bloodshed, they were not given their way. 
</P>
<P>
So, here's to the brave, the courageous Lithuanians. We look forward to 
receiving their ambassador. But, in the meantime, let's give Gorbachev 
reasonable and responsible room to resolve a complicated issue in an orderly 
way.

<TEXT>
<P>
And the government in London sent word to George Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"Of course you can secede from the British Empire. But it must be done in an 
orderly and lawful manner, and we are the ones who make the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Your committees and your Congress count for nothing. They do not speak for 
most of your people, and if they do, then your people are just too emotional. 
There must be a referendum, and we will run it. The Redcoats will take control 
of printing presses, your youth will be pressed into service, and we can 
disband any organization that advocates secession. We will write the text of 
the referendum question. Something like: Are you for Christianity and the 
British Empire? And we will determine who is a permanent resident qualified to 
participate. Redcoats and Hessians obviously qualify. With such help, the 
loyalists probably will get a shade more than one-third of the vote. If so, 
then we will declare the matter closed; let the majority who favor independence 
of the Thirteen Colonies shut up forever. 
</P>
<P>
"But even if you should make the two-thirds mark, that does not mean that 
independence is yours. The matter must then be approved by the Royal Soviet -- 
oops: Council -- in London. Approved by what majority? By whatever it takes to 
block it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are differences between the American Colonies of 1776 and the 
Baltic states of 1990. The Colonies never were independent, not even for 20 
years, and they were not occupied by the British army in the wake of a deal 
with the Ottoman Empire. One-tenth of the American colonists were not 
subsequently deported to Australia. The Baltic nations did suffer a crushing of 
their independence and consider themselves illegally occupied countries. They 
did suffer genocidal deportations, which made room for those Russian colonists 
whose minority vote now is designed to thwart the will of the native majority. 
</P>
<P>
Within the Soviet Disunion, the talk of a genuine federation remains what it 
has been for 70 years: talk. From the time "economic autonomy" officially 
started in January, Moscow has told Estonia that it cannot raise its tobacco 
taxes to pay better salaries to teachers. All local savings accounts have been 
transferred to Moscow, and Estonia's limited leeway in dealing with Finnish 
banks has been further reduced. Under the label of "economic autonomy," 
centralization actually has been reinforced in many essential aspects. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic nations see no reason to be part of a disunion that is akin not to 
the United Europe of the future but to the discredited empires of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev is not looking for a face-saving compromise but for complete 
capitulation of the Baltic nations. Moscow is emotionally attached to the idea 
of empire. The goal of the recent legislation is not to slow down the move 
toward restoring Baltic independence but to block it permanently. Regardless of 
the Baltic wishes and the world opinion, the Soviet military can handle it. 
Whether the Soviet economy can is another matter.

By RICHARD M. NIXON, Former President Richard M. Nixon's comments are excerpted 
from In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal, to be published 
this month by Simon &amp; Schuster. Sunday, in Opinion, he will address the

"Temperance" is defined as drinking in moderation or total abstinence. Many 
would favor expanding the definition to include drug use, with the implication 
that using drugs in moderation is acceptable. Despite the misery and death that 
drugs have brought to our homes, neighborhoods and schools, some still favor 
this permissive approach. They urge the government to go ahead and bomb the 
Colombian drug plantations and clean out the ghetto crack houses, so long as 
the weekend cocaine and marijuana user is left in peace to unwind in whatever 
manner he or she pleases. This approach was proved wrong 20 years ago. It would 
compound the tragedy to let the elite, casual user off the hook again. 
</P>
<P>
America's leadership class will be remembered for the role it played in helping 
lose two wars: the war in Vietnam and, at least so far, the war on drugs. The 
leadership class is made up of highly educated and influential people in the 
arts, the media, the academic community, the government bureaucracies and even 
business. They are characterized by intellectual arrogance, obsession with 
style, fashion and class and a permissive attitude on drugs. In Vietnam, they 
felt more comfortable criticizing the United States for trying to save South 
Vietnam than criticizing the Communists for trying to conquer it. In the drug 
war, they simply went over to the other side. For years, the enemy was them. 
</P>
<P>
Now that polls show a majority of the American people fear drugs more than war, 
poverty, crime or the deteriorating environment, being against drugs is as 
fashionable as being on drugs was two decades ago. Every politician who admits 
taking a puff of dope in the '60s is talking tough on dope in the '80s. But for 
years the elite class accepted and even celebrated "recreational" drug use. 
Some still say that the casual user is not the problem. But when the casual 
user is a powerful movie director, a millionaire rock star or an influential 
columnist, he or she is more dangerous than a hundred Brooklyn dope pushers. 
</P>
<P>
Drug users in the leadership class helped create a climate of social, cultural 
and political acceptance that permitted the drug plague to take root. As it 
began to spread through our colleges and schools, attempts to contain it were 
condemned in leadership circles as paternalistic efforts by the older 
generation to suppress the creative urges of its children. Those who did not 
openly condone drug use coyly looked the other way. 
</P>
<P>
When I rejected the recommendation of a presidential commission that called for 
the decriminalization of marijuana in 1972, one liberal columnist scoffed. 
"There is no real cause for panic about drug abuse and its effect on crime," he 
wrote in the New York Times. "There is no evidence that a crackdown will be the 
answer: quite the opposite." Under the leadership of Dr. Jerome Jaffe, we did 
adopt a tough, coordinated policy, ranging from diplomatic pressure on Turkey 
to stop exporting heroin to establishing the first treatment program for 
inner-city addicts. But even more crackdown in those years might well have 
meant less crack now. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, when most of the prestige media have managed to crowd onto the 
anti-drug bandwagon, they could not help indulging in a revolting orgy of 
nostalgia during the 20th anniversary of Woodstock last year. The smarmy 
retrospectives glossed over the fact that Woodstock's only significant legacy 
was the glorification of dangerous illegal drugs. At least the seven Woodstock 
performers who eventually died from drugs got obituaries in the newspapers. 
Thousands in the audience who also became victims of drug abuse weren't even 
that lucky. 
</P>
<P>
To erase the grim legacy of Woodstock, we need a total war against drugs. Total 
war means war on all fronts against an enemy with many faces. Some, such as the 
South American drug barons, are easy and even appropriate targets. But making 
the drug war largely a foreign-policy issue is a convenient way to blame others 
for our own domestic problems. Some people do not want to admit that the enemy 
is also as near as the face they see in the mirror -- the inner-city or 
suburban father who walks out on younger children who need his influence to 
avoid drugs, the Wall Street broker buying a couple of grams of cocaine in the 
subway station, the columnist smoking marijuana or snorting coke on Saturday 
night and then going to the office Monday and writing that drugs are really 
just a problem for poor blacks. 
</P>
<P>
All are links in a steel chain of greed, poverty, neglect and self-indulgence 
that is being drawn tighter and tighter around our throats. All must be fought 
and stopped before the chain can be broken and our country finally freed of its 
chemical, economic and cultural addiction to illegal drugs. But nothing can be 
accomplished, no anti-drug initiative will be successful, if our society does 
not face the hard fact that any tolerance of any use of any illegal drug is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, calls for legalization of drugs are totally misguided. Police, 
parents and teachers in the inner cities, the soldiers on the front lines in 
the drug war, know that if drugs were legalized, they would be cheaper and 
easier to get. As a result, there would be far more people on drugs. The way to 
win a war is not to give all the ammunition to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The war also cannot be won on the cheap. If Abraham Lincoln had been worried 
about the budget in 1861, George Bush would need a passport to visit Atlanta. 
Instead, Lincoln spent what he needed to win the Civil War and ran up a 
$500-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The war on drugs is our second civil war. If winning it requires a tax 
increase, so be it. In that event, the Bush Administration should seriously 
consider proposing a new tax on cigarettes and alcohol, with the funds 
earmarked for drug interdiction, prosecution, treatment and education. Timid 
advisers who warn the President that the political heat will be too great if he 
proposes such a tax are wrong. The American people expect him to do what is 
necessary to win the war no matter what the cost, so long as his measures are 
bold enough to have a chance to work. The war cannot be won without strong 
leadership from the top. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 58 government agencies share responsibility for fighting drugs. Too 
often they end up spending more time fighting each other for turf than fighting 
the enemy. A drug czar who has little more than the symbolic power of a British 
king will not be able to knock heads together to end the civil war in the 
bureaucracy and make a victory possible in the civil war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A tough policy can also be a compassionate one. When I visited the Daytop 
Village drug rehabilitation center in Swan Lake, N.Y., in 1988, I met scores of 
young people who had fallen into the drug trap. With guidance from Msgr. 
William B. O'Brien and his dedicated colleagues, they were now on the road to 
productive, drug-free lives. Daytop offers 24-hour-a-day supervision, stiff 
punishments for patients who stray, and regular follow-up testing after they go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Because many such programs rely solely on private donations, only a fraction of 
those who need them can get in. No matter what else President Bush does, he 
should make it a national goal to ensure that no one who really wants to beat 
drugs is ever excluded from treatment. Any American who saw the hopeful faces 
of the young people at Daytop Village would gladly open his heart and his 
checkbook if it meant saving even one more child from oblivion.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANS FOR UNDERGROUND MOTEL GARAGE DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for Encino homeowners, a Los Angeles city zoning official has 
ruled that the owner of a Ventura Boulevard motel may not replace a parking lot 
with an underground garage when he rebuilds. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, issued April 6, affirmed the motel owner's announcement at a 
public hearing that he would change his plans because of neighborhood 
opposition and the cost of delays, Associate Zoning Administrator William 
Lillenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
King You Chai of Santa Monica, owner of the deteriorating 28-unit, two-story 
Encino Inn at 17448 Ventura Blvd., plans to tear the building down and replace 
it with a three-story, 60-unit motel. The front of the property is on 
commercially zoned land, Lillenberg said, but the back, which for years has 
included a surface parking lot, is zoned for residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners objected to Chai's plans to replace the surface lot with a 
two-level, underground parking deck, arguing that it would set a precedent in 
the boulevard's residential zones and enable Chai to later enlarge the motel. 
</P>
<P>
Chai could not be reached. According to Lillenberg, the new motel will include 
62 parking spaces -- 22 beneath the building in the commercially zoned area and 
40 above-ground in the area zoned for residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Encino Property Owners Assn., called the 
ruling a victory in her group's continuing battle to curtail development along 
Ventura Boulevard and preserve the quality of life in adjoining neighborhoods.

POLICE SAY STEROID SUPPLY REDUCED SINCE ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: TORRANCE AUTHORITIES CONFIRM FEWER POSSESSION CASES IN THE WAKE OF 
SEIZING 50,000 DOSES OF THE SUBSTANCE USED FOR MUSCLE-BUILDING. 
</P>

<P>
Authorities say they have reduced the supply of steroids in the South Bay since 
the apprehension of a Redondo Beach man who was convicted this week of 
marketing the illegal muscle-building drugs. 
</P>
<P>
John Aldo Disanto, 31, faces up to three years in prison after his guilty plea 
Monday in South Bay Municipal Court to a single count of possession of steroids 
for sale. He will be sentenced June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach police said that when they raided Disanto's apartment overlooking 
King Harbor last September, they found more than 50,000 doses of various 
steroids in pills, syringes and powders. They also reported finding an AK-47 
assault rifle, a shotgun, two pistols and $36,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they took this guy down, the availability of steroids in that area dried 
up considerably," said Joseph Kenney, a special agent with the California 
Department of Justice. Redondo Beach Police Sgt. Mike Minard confirmed that 
there have been fewer steroid possession arrests since Disanto was apprehended 
last year, but were unable to provide exact numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Disanto began last year, when a tipster told police that 
Disanto was selling steroids from his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
When police went to the apartment Sept. 28, they said they saw a box of vials 
in plain view on the floor of Disanto's Buick. Each was marked "Testosterone." 
</P>
<P>
Police returned with a warrant later that day and searched Disanto's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the muscular Disanto, 5-foot-8 and 180 pounds, received and sold 
the drugs through the mail. He was an engineer for a Westlake Village firm. 
</P>
<P>
Disanto initially claimed the drugs were for his personal use, authorities 
said. But if the case had gone to trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank Duarte said 
he was prepared to call Kenney, an authority on steroids, to testify that 
Disanto had far more of the various drugs than he needed for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney said in an interview Wednesday that Disanto had enough steroids to last 
a single user years. Police found 528 10-milliliter bottles of the popular 
steroid testosterone cypionate, for instance, enough to last a single user at 
least 33 years, Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also confiscated substantial quantities of seven other steroids and 
related drugs.

Reporter Gabe Fuentes missed the point of the kickoff of the Southern 
California Gas Co.'s recycling program (March 27). 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is an old issue, already in practice in many places, that is now 
increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the gas company's involvement will encourage even more 
businesses and agencies to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, this project is a double-edged sword. It's environmentally sound. 
And, by contributing the paper income to the Volunteer Center of San Fernando 
Valley, it will indirectly assist hundreds of nonprofit agencies in our 
community. 
</P>
<P>
If any other businesses are interested in beginning a white-paper recycling 
program, but don't know how to begin, my staff could advise.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rogie Vachon always is on the hot seat at the Forum -- a seat in the press 
section on the aisle, where the Kings' general manager is subject to 
up-close-and-personal criticism from fans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But the past week has been a pleasure. The same fans who needled him for 
sending 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls to the 
</P>
<P>
Rangers now are praising him for getting Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato. Just 
shows you what a couple of playoff victories over the defending Stanley Cup 
champions will do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Granato scored the winning goal in overtime Sunday against Calgary, and he and 
Sandstrom produced two-thirds of the Kings' hat-trick hat trick 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, but Vachon prefers to talk about their defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing much tighter on the defensive end," Rogie said. "We've got the 
same goaltenders and the same defensemen, except for the kid (Rob) Blake, that 
we've had most of the season. So what's the difference? The forwards are doing 
their job." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls always was a goal scorer but never a disciplined two-way player. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, on how he felt last year after the Kings fell behind, 3-1, in a 
</P>
<P>
Smythe Division semifinal series before eliminating Edmonton: "I was glad to be 
coming home. We were trying to regroup and take one 
</P>
<P>
step at a time. We had 
</P>
<P>
just lost a tough game (4-3). Of course, this is a little 
</P>
<P>
different situation for Calgary." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vachon, on the Flames: "The pressure is on them. It has been from day one. 
They're expected to win." . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Kings complete the upset, the goaltending of Kelly Hrudey early in Game 
1 should not be forgotten. They could have been blown out but fell behind by 
only two goals before mounting their comeback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli, on the Forum home-ice advantage: "Just listen to our crowds. 
They're sensational." . . . 
</P>
<P>
It has been a particularly embarrassing series for Calgary Coach Terry Crisp, 
who was caught on TV in Game 3 using his necktie as a handkerchief. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik, doesn't think the commotion caused by 
Michael Nunn's split with Ten Goose Boxing will affect the International Boxing 
Federation middleweight champion in his title defense against Starling Saturday 
at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The ring is a safe harbor for a guy who has been fighting since he was 12 or 
13 years old," Sharnik says. . . . 
</P>

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
AFTER SOUR OPENER, METS GET SWEET MUSIC FROM VIOLA, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On opening day, the New York Mets played as if they were the original Mets of 
1962. They couldn't catch, throw or hit the ball and they were trounced by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Met team generally considered the best in the National League showed up for 
the second game Wednesday afternoon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Viola, who said all winter that the Mets did not see the real Frank Viola 
last season, pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings, Gregg Jefferies hit a leadoff 
home run and the Mets beat the Pirates, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, the Cy Young winner when he was 24-7 for Minnesota in 1988, gave up five 
singles, struck out eight and didn't walk a batter. John Franco, a teammate of 
Viola's at St. John's a few years ago, got the last four outs for his first 
save as a Met. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, acquired last August to give the Mets an edge in the pennant drive, was 
beaten in four of his first five starts and the Mets finished six games behind 
the Chicago Cubs in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in New York and always wanted to pitch for the Mets," Viola said. "I 
pretended I was Tug McGraw. I was disappointed that I wasn't at my best last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I was setting up my change with a good fastball, and when I have three 
pitches going I'm tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Viola impressed Barry Lyons, now the Mets' No. 1 catcher. "He was so sharp," 
Lyons said, "that even if the hitters guessed what was coming, they couldn't 
hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Pirate starter John Smiley went into the game with a 7-1 lifetime record 
against the Mets. But after Jefferies opened with a home run, his third off 
Smiley, Keith Miller doubled and scored on Darryl Strawberry's opposite-field 
single to left. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8-3, Atlanta 0-4 -- Other people may worry about it, because 
he'll be 41 next month, but Rick Reuschel was unfazed by his poor spring 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
When it really counted, the big right-hander took charge at Atlanta. He gave up 
just three hits in 5 2/3 innings as the Giants romped in the first game of a 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, rookie Mark Lemke's bases-loaded single in the second 
inning enabled the Braves to jump in front early. 
</P>
<P>
The doubleheader was scheduled because the first two games of the series were 
rained out. Only 11,083 turned up in chilly weather. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel had a 7.07 earned-run average in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an amazing man," Giants' Manager Roger Craig said. "He's never had a good 
spring, but he always has a good opening day." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Houston 0 -- Lou Piniella is enjoying his start as manager of the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Armstrong and Rick Mahler combined on a four-hitter as the Reds completed 
a three-game sweep at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong went six innings, giving up three hits, while Mahler pitched the last 
three for his first save since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Benzinger doubled in the first run in the second inning and Eric Davis hit 
a two-run double in a three-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, St. Louis 4 -- Oil Can Boyd may prove to be quite a bargain at 
$400,000 for the Expos. Boyd, who missed four months last year because of a 
blood clot in his right shoulder, won his NL debut at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who signed as a free agent for well below the average salary in the 
majors, pitched six innings, giving up four hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero hit his first homer for the Cardinals. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS MAY BE IN PAIN, BUT HE STILL PLAYS LIKE A TIGER AGAINST DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a week ago, the Boston Red Sox were concerned about 38-year-old outfielder 
Dwight Evans. He was rushed to Boston for tests to determine the cause of back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pain or no pain, Evans, as he has been for more than 18 seasons, was there when 
the season began. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two victories over the Red Sox's favorite opponent, the Detroit 
Tigers, Evans was three for eight, scoring a run and driving in three. 
</P>
<P>
He was even better in the series finale at Fenway Park Wednesday. Evans hit a 
home run in the fifth inning and singled home the winning run in the 10th to 
give the Red Sox a sweep, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 11th consecutive win for the Red Sox over the Tigers since the 
middle of last June. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Evans' injury was diagnosed as a slipped disk and rest was 
prescribed. Although the symptoms are similar, doctors have ruled out a 
recurrence of the disk injury. However, he missed most of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had very little time to do what I have to do to get ready," Evans said. 
"I'm pulling all the tricks out of my bag." 
</P>
<P>
The three for five made him six for 14 and he has five RBIs. Evans is the only 
major leaguer who has hit at least 20 home runs in each of the last nine 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gamer," said teammate Mike Greenwell, who was four for four. "He gives 
us 100% when he only has 90% to give." 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson has been walking Wade Boggs whenever possible. 
But leading off the 10th, Boggs singled. After a sacrifice, Greenwell was hit 
by a pitch and Ellis Burks popped out. Evans hit a grounder between third 
baseman Tony Phillips and the bag to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 3, Oakland 0 -- While Frank Viola was doing his stuff for the Mets, 
two of the pitchers the Twins received for him enabled the Twins to salvage a 
win in the three games at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie right-hander Kevin Tapani pitched six strong innings and Rick Aguilera, 
the Twins' new, reluctant stopper, pitched the ninth for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hrbek hit a three-run home run off Mike Moore in the first inning for all 
the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Norris, a 35-year-old right-hander returning from a series of drug and 
alcohol problems, pitched two scoreless innings of relief for the A's. It was 
his first major league appearance since Sept. 25, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 2, Baltimore 1 -- The Royals' goal this season is to go into the 
ninth inning with a lead. They figure with Mark Davis heading their bullpen, 
they'll win every time. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, signed to a four-year, $13-million contract as a free agent, pitched a 
perfect ninth at Kansas City to pay his first dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Perry and Kevin Seitzer singled home runs in the fifth inning to beat 
Jeff Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 11, Toronto 5 -- Toronto fans must have known something. They stayed home 
in bunches and about 14,000 of them missed seeing the Rangers build a 10-run 
lead in the first two innings. There were 49,000 at the opener, only 35,031 for 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia homered and drove in five runs to lead the Rangers to an easy 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell hit a grand slam for the Blue Jays in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
New York-Cleveland -- Snow flurries halted play for almost an hour at Cleveland 
in the second inning and finally stopped it completely with the Indians 
leading, 2-1, in the bottom of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The snow wiped out a home run by Cleveland's Cory Snider.

GORDIEN, A FORMER OLYMPIC DISCUS THROWER, DIES AT AGE 67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortune Gordien, a three-time Olympic discus thrower and former world 
record-holder, died Tuesday at Kaiser Hospital in Fontana. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
Gordien, longtime Claremont resident, suffered from a blocked artery in his 
digestive tract. His intestines were removed in January and he was hospitalized 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Gordien held the world record from 1949 to '59 but failed to win an Olympic 
gold medal. He was fourth in 1952 and second in '56. 
</P>
<P>
Gordien also was known a professional escape artist, card manipulator and 
illusionist. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring from competition, Gordien coached track and field at San Marino 
High, San Bernardino Valley College and Mt. San Antonio College. He retired 
from teaching physical education at San Bernardino Valley last year after 
suffering a stroke, Shrum said. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Aileen; twin sons, Mitchell and Marcus; son, Kelly, 
and daughter, Joli. Funeral arrangements are incomplete, Shrum said. ELLIOTT

COMPUTER FILE: HOW TO FIND THE BEST EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-time computer buyers face a daunting task. Valid, unbiased guidance is 
hard to find for a purchase that ranges from expensive to very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The best approach is to divide and conquer. Break the process up into a series 
of smaller decisions and you'll more easily control what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
First, where to buy? If you are a student, faculty or staff member of a college 
or university, you probably can get the best price through the school. But 
selection may be limited, and you may have to wait some time for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
If you work for a large company, chances are that you can buy through the firm, 
either from an employee store or with a referral from the company's purchasing 
department. You'll probably get a better discount than you would walking into a 
store on your own. Again, selection may be limited. 
</P>
<P>
If neither of those options is available, you have your choice of going to a 
computer store, shopping at a discount or warehouse store (selection will be 
very limited and usually aimed at the lowest end of the market) or buying from 
a mail order vendor. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers new to computing who lack the help of an experienced relative or 
friend are better off going to a computer dealer, even if they pay a little 
more. 
</P>
<P>
You shouldn't trust computer advice you get from a discount store employee, and 
you are strictly on your own to set up the computer and install software and 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reputable mail order houses advertising in the computer 
magazines and often the order clerk can give good advice, particularly about 
which pieces of equipment work best together. But if something is wrong with 
the machine when you get it, making an exchange is really inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to choose a dealer is to follow recommendations of others who 
already have purchased. If that's not possible, look for dealers that have been 
in business for five or more years. (You can look up old newspapers on 
microfilm at the library to find which stores were advertising in past years.) 
</P>
<P>
Now that you know where to buy, what should you buy? 
</P>
<P>
You are assured of being firmly in the mainstream of personal computing if you 
buy either an Apple Macintosh or an IBM computer or one of the many machines 
compatible with IBM. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM and Macintosh worlds are separate, however. Neither family of computers 
can run software designed for the other. So buy the one you are most likely to 
use at work or school. 
</P>
<P>
However, either IBM or Macintosh can communicate quite well with larger 
computer systems at the office, if those systems allow outside access by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Macintosh is the easiest computer to use and the easiest to buy because there 
are fewer choices to make. It also tends to be the most expensive, especially 
compared to many of the IBM clones. 
</P>
<P>
The big advantage of the Mac is that its programs use graphic images -- 
pictures of file folders, a page of text, or a program's logo -- to help you 
understand what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
A mouse is used to control a screen pointer and to highlight commands and 
images on the screen. Many tasks are performed simply by pointing at a name or 
image, clicking the mouse button or dragging the image across the screen to 
another location. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, files are erased by dragging their images to a symbolic trash can 
at the bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Macintosh computing tends to be more expensive because Apple has no competitors 
to force its prices down. Also, its graphics need more computing power to run 
satisfactorily and also, you really do need an expensive laser printer to put 
all that fancy typography and imagery properly onto paper. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM world is much more confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Most IBM and compatible computers use programs that are written for the MS-DOS 
operating system. MS-DOS is special software that does the basic housekeeping 
of the computer, allowing its keyboard, disks, screen and memory to all work 
harmoniously. 
</P>
<P>
Most versions of MS-DOS require you to type commands to perform tasks. There 
are no catchy images on the screen for you to drag around as on the Macintosh. 
Thus if you want to get rid of a file, you type the command ERASE followed by 
the directory location and name of the file. It is quite a powerful and 
efficient way to do things, actually, but it is harder to learn. 
</P>
<P>
A more powerful operating system, called OS/2, that has graphic images and lets 
more than one program run at a time, is available. But it requires a fast 
computer with lots of memory, and there is not much software available for that 
system. However, it looms on the horizon and you'll likely find computer 
salesmen urging you to buy the more powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
Before you get talked into buying too far beyond your present needs and 
abilities, remember that anything you buy today will be superseded with faster 
-- and probably cheaper -- models within a year. It has always been that way in 
personal computing and it shows no signs of ending. 
</P>
<P>
Three families of IBM and compatible computers are available, based on the 
microprocessor that serves as the brains of the computer. The least powerful 
have Intel 8088 or 8086 chips and are usually priced around $1,000 to $1,500 
with a hard disk for extended file storage and a monitor. 
</P>
<P>
These are the machines on which Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect became leading 
business software for millions of workers, and they still are just fine for 
basic word processing, basic spreadsheet and small database applications. But 
they are too slow for complex word processing, spreadsheet, database and any 
graphics programs such as desktop publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Next are the 80286-based computers, which are often found in the $1,200 to 
$2,000 range for basic configurations with hard disks and monitors. They have 
enough power to run graphics software and can be expanded to handle OS/2. 
</P>
<P>
They are losing a lot of their luster as bargain-priced performance machines 
these days because for just a few hundred dollars more you can buy the same 
computer equipped with an Intel 386SX chip. The 386SX is a slightly detuned 
version of the popular 80386 chip and if you can get it without much of a 
premium over the 286 chip, it is better to have it. You need to be aware as you 
go shopping that as you go up the performance scale, everything goes up in 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Add a laser printer -- absolutely worth the money -- and even a basic computer 
system comes in at about $3,000 to $3,500 with just a small selection of 
software. If it's Macintosh, figure on $5,000 to $6,000. And if you're a closet 
techie just waiting to break out, you'll be amazed at how quickly you could 
spend $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
MS-DOS users need the least amount of RAM. The basic 640 kilobytes is fine 
until you get into complex graphics or big spreadsheets or programs that work 
with Microsoft Windows. The next jump should be to 2 megabytes. Consider 4 
megabytes the bare minimum for OS/2 and add more if you can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
For Macintosh, I'd recommend 2 megabytes unless you do complex graphics. Then 
it's 4 megabytes for black and white and 8 megabytes for color. 
</P>
<P>
For disk storage, 20 to 30 megabytes is fine if you only use one or two 
programs and don't do graphics. If you intend to collect software, become a 
power user, or get into desktop publishing or other graphics software, you 
can't buy too much disk storage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, should you buy IBM or a compatible machine? There's is no 
technologically "right" answer to that. Design and construction quality of IBM 
and the many name-brand compatibles is high.

BONDS PRICES MOVE OPPOSITE TO OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices rose in response to a temporary drop in oil prices and a rumor 
about trouble at a major bank, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or about $1.88 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which declines when prices rise, fell to 8.57% from 8.59% late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were hurt Tuesday when the sale of $3.5 billion worth of bonds by 
the government's Resolution Funding Corp. did not go as well as expected. But 
prices jumped shortly after the trading day began Wednesday on a rumor that a 
major New York bank was having liquidity problems due to troubled real estate 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
If substantiated, that could spur interest in Treasury bonds as some investors 
seek to move their money into a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, bond prices also received a boost when oil futures prices 
dropped. Lower energy prices can ease inflation, which is one of the prime 
fears of investors in fixed-income securities such as bonds. But oil prices 
later reversed, returning to the level at the start of the day, causing bond 
prices to decline. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.1875% late Tuesday.

<P>
Energy stocks posted broad losses Wednesday while the rest of the stock market 
drifted aimlessly in a quiet session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials slipped 1.35 to 2,729.73, marking the 
sixth consecutive session in which it rose or fell less than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 720 up, 762 down and 497 unchanged. 
</P>

Security Pacific Corp.: The Los Angeles-based banking company said its 
first-quarter profit rose 5% to $188.4 million and would have been higher had 
it not been for a $30-million loss by the bank's Arizona's operations. Results 
for the company, which earned $179.3 million a year earlier, were boosted by 
strong results at its Security Pacific National Bank unit in California and by 
cost controls. Assets totaled $86.5 billion as of March 31, up 6% from a year 
ago.

SOME S.D. EXPORTERS READY TO REAP BENEFITS OF EUROPEAN CHANGES IN '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN

<TEXT>
<P>
As exports go, the 20-foot-high, inflatable red Fiat sent to France last week 
by an El Cajon manufacturer may not appear to be all that substantial a 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
But the balloon, created by Bigger Than Life Inc. for the auto maker's French 
distributor, could be a visible symbol of the opportunities awaiting some San 
Diego County exporters in 1992, when the 12-nation European Community market 
becomes generally more accessible to foreign manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger Than Life, which specializes in promotional inflatables, is one of 
several San Diego exporters that plan to intensify European trade efforts in 
1992 and after. As a manufacturer of nontechnical or unlicensed goods, Bigger 
Than Life officials say, their company in particular stands to benefit from 
pending changes in European Community trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We really would like to move into Europe more heavily," said Peg Trumper, 
Bigger Than Life's international sales supervisor. The European Community's 
changes will allow the 5-year-old company's distributors to more easily ship 
their products to events in various nations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the new European Community rules is the elimination of 
certain physical, technical and fiscal barriers to trade. Stoppages at customs 
posts will be reduced, and uniform customs documentation will be introduced for 
all countries, eliminating the need for scores of different forms. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community will also introduce standardized industrial 
specifications and requirements that will make it much simpler for foreign 
manufacturers to produce, package and market products for all of Europe. The 
new standards, which take effect Jan. 1, 1992, will also eliminate differing 
tariff rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, manufacturers of technical goods, such as medical equipment and 
biotechnology products, will still require export licenses from destination 
countries and so may not necessarily find a smoother path to the European 
market. For that reason, international trade analysts are at odds on just how 
beneficial the new trade rules will be for many of San Diego's high-tech 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Powell, director of the U. S. Commerce Department's San Diego district 
office, said the new rules will have minimal effect on the "several hundred" 
local high-tech companies that are already experienced exporters to Europe, for 
whom the European Community's changes will require only minor marketing 
adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
Of local manufacturers' $2.6 billion in export sales in 1988, the last year for 
which figures are available, about 26% of that was to Europe, Powell said. The 
amount nearly equals the 28% of total export sales destined for customers in 
Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Rim, Pacific Rim, Pacific Rim is all you hear," Powell said. "What 
happened to the European Rim? Just the fact that we do about the same amount of 
business there that we do in the Pacific Rim is a surprise to everybody, 
including the media, because all the hype is on the Pacific Rim." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's San Diego office has been deluged with inquiries from 
businesses about the prospects of selling products in newly democratized 
Eastern European markets, Powell said. But local exporters probably won't make 
much headway into the Eastern bloc until the market infrastructure of 
distributors, dealers and sales representatives is developed, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the European market changes have been beneficial in that they have 
caused many local small businesses to finally focus attention on international 
trade opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem most small business people have is they are simply not aware 
that there is potential outside the United States. That's the problem," Powell 
said, "whether it's EC '92 or Pacific Rim." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Teagarden, a professor of international management at San Diego State 
University, predicted that small businesses will more easily gain access to 
specialized markets in Europe as a result of the upcoming changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer tastes will remain individualistic," Teagarden said. Germans will 
still be Germans, Italians will still be Italians, each with their own likes 
and dislikes, she said. It will not be "a United States of Europe," Teagarden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many small firms now find it difficult to compete in Europe because of the 
costs incurred to build a product to the varying specifications of the 
different countries. Now, there may be up to 12 different requirements on the 
same components for household electrical appliances. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, exporters to the European Community must deal with myriad tariffs 
and 12 currencies. Simply moving goods from country to country "has been a 
major headache" because of bureaucratic obstacles, Teagarden said. The new 
rules promise to do away with all the differences, thereby ensuring one 
standardized marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
However, Teagarden said, U. S. businesses should not expect immediate results. 
"Everyone's looking at it like it's going to happen overnight," she said. "I 
think it will be a slow transition, a very political transition. It will happen 
incrementally." 
</P>
<P>
Some executives said the changes are more a cause for concern than excitement. 
Hal Stitt, vice president of marketing for Wavetek Corp., predicted that a 
smaller number of larger manufacturers will arise to dominate the standardized 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"The American industry is enamored with the thought that a united Europe will 
make it easier to sell," said Stitt, who is also a committee chairman for the 
San Diego chapter of the American Electronics Assn., an industry trade group. 
"American businessmen need to plan to protect their own turf, because it's 
going to come under attack." 
</P>
<P>
Wavetek, a test and measurement equipment manufacturer, has sold its products 
in Europe since the early 1970s. European exports represented about 20% of 
Wavetek's $85.2 million in sales in the fiscal year ended last September. 
</P>
<P>
Of the upcoming changes, Stitt said: "It's kind of like having a bear outside 
your tent. That causes a little excitement more than caution." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Bigger Than Life is concerned, the changes in Europe can only help it 
take advantage of what in 1992 will become the most populous industrialized 
market in the world. The 12 countries that make up the European Community have 
about 320 million consumers -- 30% more than the population of the United 
States -- with a purchasing power of about $4 trillion, according to Commerce 
Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger Than Life's giant inflatables are assembled at its 52,000-square-foot 
manufacturing plant on Fayette Street in El Cajon. The company employs 120 
artists, designers, production and sales employees. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger Than Life projects that its 1990 sales will total $8 million, up from $6 
million in 1989. Exports will account for about 15% of 1990 sales, with nearly 
half those shipments going to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Trumper said increased marketing of the company's colorful inflatables, which 
range from facsimiles of Bugs Bunny to beer bottles, should mean European sales 
will continue to increase. The European Community's changes are an added 
benefit "because we're already there," she said. "We're already ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
Past and present clients have included Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Levi Strauss 
and others in the United States and abroad. But perhaps its best known creation 
was a 55-foot helium-filled replica of Superman made for the Rose Parade that 
broke free of its tethers in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After a 30-minute cruise that included a foray into Lindbergh Field flight 
patterns, the gas-filled caped crusader crashed on Cowles Mountain about 3 
miles west of El Cajon.

Infrasonics: The San Diego-based manufacturer of ventilators for hospital and 
home-care patients reported a third-quarter profit of $82,000 on sales of $2.1 
million, up from a loss of $72,500 on sales of $1.2 million for the same 
quarter the previous year. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, 
Infrasonics' profit stands at $246,900 on revenue of $4.9 million, contrasted 
with a loss of $236,100 on sales of $3.6 million over the same three quarters 
the previous year. President Jim Hitchin said the improved sales are due to the 
federal Food and Drug Administration's recent approval for the company to begin 
selling its high frequency infant respirator, a product that has boosted the 
company's market share.

JACK SMITH: GIVING AID WHEN A BANDIT SAYS: 'I WUZ ROBBED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing recently about famous quotations that were never said, or are 
commonly attributed to the wrong authors, I included a remark the notorious 
bank robber Willie Sutton is said to have made in answer to a reporter's 
question, "Why do you rob banks?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the legend, Sutton answered, "Because that's where the money is." 
</P>
<P>
I commented that "for sheer brevity, clarity and integrity," I had considered 
that among the classics of all time. 
</P>
<P>
First, I was disenchanted by reading in "They Never Said It," by Paul F. Boller 
Jr. and John George, that Sutton never said it. A reporter made it up. 
</P>
<P>
Now I am perturbed by a letter from a man named Jack, whose last name is 
illegible and who gives no address, so I can not give him credit. But he says: 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, Mr. Sutton was asked 'Why do you rob banks?' And he 
replied, 'Because that's where the money is.' I agree with you this is among 
the classics of all time. But not because of its brevity, clarity and 
integrity. It is a classic because, like one of Mr. Boffo's characters, Mr. 
Sutton was unclear on the concept. The reporter was asking Mr. Sutton why he 
robbed, not why he robbed banks instead of other institutions, but Mr. Sutton 
got it wrong." 
</P>
<P>
I have hesitated to comment on this analysis because, not knowing Jack's full 
name, it is like jousting with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
However, other readers might have had that same misapprehension, and I feel 
obliged to clarify the question. 
</P>
<P>
First, we must understand Mr. Sutton (since Jack chooses to give him that 
title). He was a bank robber. He did not mug people in the streets or 
burglarize homes. He robbed banks. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sutton was not a perfect bank robber. He spent 20 years of his life in 
jail. But his style was flamboyant. He wore elaborate disguises and was known 
as "The Actor." He escaped from Sing Sing in 1932 and used a wooden rifle to 
bluff his way out of a Pennsylvania jail in 1947. In 1969, white-haired and 68, 
he was released from Attica Prison. I don't know what happened to him after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
What Jack says is that when the reporter asked Mr. Sutton why he robbed banks, 
he did not mean why did Mr. Sutton rob banks, specifically; but why he robbed 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
And he thinks that Mr. Sutton misinterpreted the question, taking it literally, 
and explained why he robbed banks. 
</P>
<P>
I consider that most improbable. As a reporter myself, I would not have been 
likely to ask a hardened criminal why he was a criminal. The answer to that 
question would be so psychologically complicated that the criminal himself 
could not be expected to know the answer. 
</P>
<P>
No, I think the reporter wanted to know why Mr. Sutton robbed banks, rather 
than little old ladies or liquor stores. And Mr. Sutton told him in an answer 
that was direct, logical, simple, brief and clear. 
</P>
<P>
I am also skeptical of the documentation offered in "They Never Said It" as 
proof that this was not Mr. Sutton's own rejoinder. The book says, "According 
to the infamous bank robber himself, it was a reporter who thought up this 
smart-aleck remark and put it in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
If Mr. Sutton did indeed deny authorship of the remark, he thereupon deprived 
himself of his only claim to enduring fame. It was a remark that might live 
long after his felonies are forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, I do not consider the remark "smart-aleck." It was elegant in its 
simplicity and impregnably honest. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure "They Never Said It' is serving humanity by questioning the 
validity of our most treasured quotes. 
</P>
<P>
They even say it wasn't Gen. John J. Pershing, leader of the American 
Expeditionary Forces in World War I, who said, on his landing in France, 
"Lafayette, we are here!" The author of that splendid phrase, they say, was 
Pershing's chief disbursing officer, Lt. Col. Charles E. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
We might as well say that it wasn't Gen. Douglas MacArthur who said, on his 
departure from the Philippines, "I shall return," but a member of his staff, or 
perhaps only some non-com GI who was making a vow to his Filipina girl friend. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps it was only made up by a reporter, as many great quotes allegedly 
have been.

he is seeking items showing "any threats made or undue influence" on his wife, 
all her personal diaries since 1976 and other writings. Jay Goldberg, one of 
his attorneys, said the documents would "demonstrate without question the 
infirmity of her claim" about threats and influence. Goldberg dismissed her 
plans to call Maples as posturing.

<P>
A GRACEFUL PASSAGE: A PHYSICIAN LEARNS HOW TO LIVE WITH CHRONIC DISABILITY BY 
ARNOLD R. BEISSER M.D. DOUBLEDAY $16.95; 256 PP.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Arnold Beisser's "graceful passage" is from polio, which completely 
paralyzed him at age 25, to a basic faith in human nature that has left him 
jubilant about life. 
</P>
<P>
Beisser, who is kept alive by an iron lung, recalls some of his more 
bewildering and frightening moments: "I did not want to die. Some gross mistake 
must have happened, I thought. I was the doctor, not the patient; I was the 
physically strong one who helped others. Like millions before me, I thought, 'I 
am too young to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
More than the story of life incarcerated in an iron lung, "A Graceful Passage" 
is about a patient who is also a doctor living with grace even at the edge of a 
dark precipice. By helping himself overcome helplessness and fear, Beisser can 
better reach out to those who needed his help. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more and more of them," he writes, "and I will still use my 
creativity if I can, to see what I can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 One of these pages' most piercing moments describes the visit of a friend on a

"Life seems too hard," Beisser confesses. "If it continues this way very much 
longer, I would like to end it all, and I would need help." Beisser explains 
that physicians know from experience the difference between a "good death" and 
a hard one. They see little or no advantage in meaningless suffering, and they 
know how it can reduce the person to a humiliating subhuman level. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends have the knowledge and means to prevent much degradation from 
overtaking them. They are luckier than most people, for they can keep some 
control over their lives." And then he writes: "We must discover ways to place 
the decision back in the hands of the person whose life is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
While Beisser celebrates his right to "live and die as I wish," he adds: "I 
have no desire to end my life except as a way of avoiding useless suffering. So 
as long as there is hope, I would like to stay. I have seen how degrading and 
humiliating senseless health-care intervention can be; I have seen the erosion 
of the spirit that can occur when people become caught up in years of that 
well-intentioned mishap." 
</P>
<P>
This is not an issue between him and God, he stresses, but between him and what 
man has created: a health-care system that essentially can take over people's 
lives. "The greatest gift that could be given to me, or anyone else, would be 
to allow me to live in my own terms." 
</P>
<P>
At 63, Beisser, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and recipient of the 
American Psychiatric Assn.'s Gold Achievement Award, still manages to triumph 
emotionally and spiritually over his long imprisonment in an iron cell. As a 
writer and patient who has struggled with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus for more 
than 30 years, I've learned a lot from Beisser.

It's time to renew our search for Fels-Naphtha soap. Almost four years ago some 
of the major chains still carried it, but it must have disappeared from a lot

asked for it. So if you know where to find it, come clean right away.

The appeal of John Smart of La Jolla, who needed a vibrating (non-beeping) 
wristwatch alarm for deaf people, has not gone unanswered. Skip Edelstein of 
the Foundation for the Junior Blind and Sheilagh Hall of Brawley suggest the 
Silent Page, which is available from the Speech, Hearing and Neurosensory 
Center at Children's Hospital, 8001 Frost St., San Diego, Calif. 92123, or from 
the manufacturer, Quest Electronics, 510 S. Worthington St., Oconomowoc, Wis. 
53066, (414) 567-9157, or Voice-TDD (800) 558-9526. But if Smart is willing to 
settle for an under-the-pillow vibrating alarm, we have two sources: Kathi 
Sharpe-Ross of Sharpe Public Relations &amp; Marketing, 9230 Olympic Blvd., 
202, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212, (213) 274-3587, says they have Shake Awake, 
which vibrates at a pre-selected time and sells for about $25. And Pat Davey of 
Northridge says a similar product, for about the same price, is available from 
Hear You Are Inc., 4 Musconetcong Ave., Stanhope, N.J. 07874, (201) 347-7662.

published by Plexi-Craft, 514 W. 24th St., New York, N.Y. 10011, (212)

LEGAL VIEW: LIVING TRUSTS AND PROBATE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Several years ago I had a will and living trust set up by a Los 
Angeles attorney who has since retired. As I understood it when the estate was 
set up, it would not have to go through probate. I subsequently added a codicil 
changing the trustee from a bank to my granddaughter. In the event of my death, 
does my trustee have to secure the services of an attorney to handle matters, 
or can my trustee just carry on as instructed in my will? Does the will or 
trust have to be filed somewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is difficult to answer your question specifically because all the 
facts needed for a detailed analysis are not in your letter, and you have used 
terms that are not precisely accurate, so I'm not sure what kind of will or 
trust you really have. But let me make a few general observations. 
</P>
<P>
I am assuming your lawyer created a revocable living trust and what is called a 
"pour-over" will, which authorizes the transfer of, or "pours over," any assets 
you neglected to transfer to your trust into your trust upon your death. (This 
is done through probate.) I am also assuming that you "amended" the trust to 
name your granddaughter as the "successor trustee," since ordinarily you are 
the trustee of the living trust during your lifetime (unless you are unable to 
manage your financial affairs). A "codicil" is a legal "term of art" that 
refers to an amendment of your will, not an amendment of a living trust. 
</P>
<P>
But your basic question is: Does your granddaughter have to hire an attorney 
after your death? And in good lawyerly fashion, the answer is "it depends." If 
your estate is very simple, if all your assets have been transferred to the 
trust, and if the trust instructions are relatively straightforward, it may be 
possible for your granddaughter to do it herself, with a little assistance from 
self-help law books. For example, if all your assets are in a brokerage account 
that is held in the name of the trust, she may not need a lawyer to instruct 
the brokerage firm to execute the trust instructions, especially if they are 
simple -- such as transferring all the assets to your daughter. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you have assets spread around in different financial 
institutions, if you perhaps own land in different counties, and if some of 
your assets have not been properly transferred to the trust, your granddaughter 
is in for quite a headache if she tries to go this alone, without a lawyer's 
help. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if all the assets have not been placed in the trust and are not in 
joint tenancy, then those assets will be under the jurisdiction of the probate 
court, and your estate will go through probate. Your granddaughter can even try 
to go through that process without a lawyer's help -- it's gotten simpler in 
the last few years -- but it's still not fun. A good reference book is "How to 
Probate an Estate," by Julia Nissley. 
</P>
<P>
Probate lawyers have to follow a statutory schedule of maximum fees that are 
based on the size of an estate. The fee of a lawyer hired to assist you in 
executing the instructions in a living trust is open to negotiation, although 
some lawyers also base their fees on the size of the estate. 
</P>
<P>

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: CALCULATORS ARE ATTRACTING INTEREST 
</P>

Question: You've written about collecting typewriters. But is there collector 
interest in other pieces of office equipment? -- N.F. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Darryl Rehr of Los Angeles, there is a "subculture of 
office equipment collectors" in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Rehr, 39, a free-lance television news journalist and typewriter collector, 
recently wrote a pamphlet, "A Beginner's Guide to Collectible Calculators," in 
which he describes calculators worth up to $1,000. (He has also written a 
similar pamphlet on typewriters.) 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to disillusion people," he said in a recent telephone 
conversation. "A $1,000 calculator is very, very rare." 
</P>
<P>
In the pamphlet, Rehr writes that "there are no hard-and-fast rules governing 
the collectibility of calculators, but generally speaking, today's collectors 
collect anything that is non-electronic (that is, not driven by electric 
motors)." 
</P>
<P>
To receive the pamphlet, send Rehr $1 and a self-addressed, stamped envelope, 
to 11433 Rochester Ave., 303, Los Angeles, Calif. 90025 . 
</P>
<P>
Rehr also publishes ETCetera, a quarterly newsletter on typewriters and related 
equipment. Annual subscription fee is $15. 
</P>
<P>
Of interest to car collectors will be North Hollywood auto auctioneer Rick 
Cole's sixth annual "gold list" of collector cars. Cole calls his list for 1990 
an index of the top 10 affordable automotive investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Cole's list focuses on autos, currently available for under $25,000, that he 
expects to significantly appreciate in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Cole's current list: Austin-Healy 3000 (1960-67); Jensen Interceptor (1975-76); 
Triumph TR 2-3-4 (1953-67); MGA Roadster (1955-62); BMW 2800CS/3.0 CS Coupe 
(1971-74); Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spyder Veloce (1956-62); Chevrolet Chevelle 
(1966-72); Lotus Elan convertible (1965-68); Oldsmobile Starfire convertible 
(1961-65); and the Edsel convertible (1958-60). 
</P>
<P>
For further information, contact Rick Cole Auctions and Associates, 10701 
Riverside Drive, North Hollywood, Calif. 91602, or call (818) 506-6533.

<P>
An autograph and manuscript auction -- about 500 items valued at more than $1 
million -- is scheduled for May 26 at Superior Galleries, 9478 W. Olympic 
Blvd., Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Items to be auctioned include President Lyndon Johnson's executive order 
establishing the Warren Commission to investigate the Kennedy assassination; 
letters handwritten and signed by baseball pioneer Abner Doubleday; and other 
letters written by historical and literary figures. Also included will be space 
memorabilia, such as astronaut patches and the U.S. flag carried on the 1971 
Apollo 15 moon mission. Items will be priced between $100 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to make people aware that historical documents like these are 
traded like coins and stamps," said Ira Goldberg, a partner in Superior 
Galleries. "No longer are the museums and public and private libraries the only 
repositories of these historical documents."

'Ninja Turtles' Violence: Kids flocking to "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" are 
being exposed to the most violent movie released so far this year, says the 
National Coalition on Television Violence. The organization said that the hit 
film "glorifies violence," and has 194 separate violent acts. A sample of the 
violent acts included a ninja hitting a turtle, a turtle kicking a ninja and a 
ninja hitting a turtle with an ax. GREG BRAXTON

Rooney to Speak: "60 Minutes" commentator Andy Rooney, who was recently 
suspended by CBS for remarks attributed to him about blacks and gays, is the 
scheduled keynote speaker at the Constitutional Rights Foundation annual spring 
dinner May 7 at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is expected to speak on First Amendment issues. The nonprofit 
organization educates youth about the values expressed in the Constitution and 
the Bill of Rights. Rooney recently was suspended for three months, but was off 
the air three weeks after a gay-oriented magazine quoted him as making 
disparaging remarks about homosexuals and blacks. GREG BRAXTON

Critics and audiences weren't wild about "An Innocent Man," starring Tom 
Selleck, but it's doing very well in the rental market. In two weeks it bolted 
up to No. 5 on the Billboard chart. 
</P>
<P>
All those renters who loved Selleck in "Three Men and a Baby" no doubt have 
been instrumental in its rental success. "Dead Poets Society," which debuted 
last week at No. 28, climbed to No. 9 this week on its way to the Top Five. 
Writer-director Wes Craven's "Shocker" (No. 16) is the hottest horror movie in 
the rental market right now. "The Abyss," the big-budget sci-fi thriller, 
entered the rental chart at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
* Director Brian DePalma's Vietnam drama, "Casualties of War," starring Michael 
J.Fox and Sean Penn, is apparently one of those movies that most fans prefer to 
see at home rather than in theaters. It was an instant rental hit -- a lofty 
No. 6 after just two weeks on the chart.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SWEETS EDISON BRINGS HIS SOLID 
REPUTATION TO S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, who opened at Elario's Wednesday night, 
cemented his already formidable reputation during the '40s as a featuring 
soloist with the Count Basie Orchestra. Rooted in the swing of the '30s and 
'40s, Edison's solos made such classic Basie tunes as "Panassie Stomp," "Jive 
at Five," "Shorty George," "Texas Shuffle" and "Moten Swing." 
</P>
<P>
After Basie disbanded his group in 1950, Edison went on to work with most of 
the greats of jazz: Lester Young, Barney Kessel, Lionel Hampton, Ben Webster, 
Johnny Hodges, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Williams, Joe 
Turner, Oscar Peterson. As a studio musician in the '50s, he backed top singers 
including Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
Edison is best known for the sound from which he gets his nickname, an approach 
which stresses subtle phrasings and the tasteful use of silences to enhance the 
power of his lines. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's through Sunday, he will be joined by Sherman Ferguson on drums, 
Marshall Hawkins on bass and Bob Hamilton on piano. 
</P>
<P>
When Anna and Steve Ball were married, he gave her an 1890s-vintage Rinaldi 
violin from Italy for her left hand instead of an engagement ring. That says 
something about the couple's priorities. Soon after, they formed a string 
quartet and named it Rinaldi -- after the violin. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later, the group has evolved an eclectic approach to music that 
blurs the boundaries between jazz, rock and 
</P>
<P>
classical music. Their performances are built around Steve Ball's 
reconstructions of everything from be-bop to the Beatles and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz patron Bob Geib thinks they're jazzy enough to be included in his 
jazz-oriented "Innovations in Modern Music" series at Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach, which opened with Peter Sprague and Steve Kujala on March 31 and closes 
with former John Coltrane bassist Dr. Art Davis on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Rinaldi String Quartet appears this Saturday night, April 14, at 8. Harpist 
Marian Rian Hays, percussionist Richard Steiger and flutist Lori Bell will add 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Balls on violins, the group includes cellist Jennifer Holson and 
violist Karen Elaine. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, all are classically trained, but they all appreciate several 
brands of music. Steve Ball has even played electric violin in rock bands. 
After years of focusing on classical music, the group's true personality began 
to emerge, Anna Ball recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"We did start out with classical and pop, but we realized our audiences liked 
rock and jazz. We started doing in concerts the arrangements we usually just 
played on our own. Peter Gabriel's 'Big Time,' for example." 
</P>
<P>
It takes some getting used to, hearing violins interpret the melody shouted out 
by Gabriel in the original, but Ball's delicate re-working makes you appreciate 
the complexities of rock music like Gabriel's. 
</P>
<P>
Ball discovered that Dizzy Gillespie's "A Night in Tunisia" and the Jefferson 
Airplane's "3/5 of a Mile in Ten Seconds" share chord changes, so he 
superimposed them in an arrangement for the quartet. The result has haunting 
echoes of both bop and Haight Ashbury. 
</P>
<P>
These songs, plus Dave Grusin's "Anasazi," a Beatles medley and David 
LaFlamme's "Don and Dewey," originally recorded by It's a Beautiful Day, will 
all be in the lineup Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the San Diego Jazz Festival and the San Diego Jazz Society are 
vying for shares of the money raised by San Diego's hotel room tax, which last 
year amounted to $5.2 million. The city Commission for Arts and Culture will 
make funding recommendations regarding this year's 84 applicants in May or 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The festival wants $15,000 to produce 10 jazz shows, but its application came 
in after the Jan. 22 deadline, according to a source at the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, late filing eliminates groups from the running, but the festival 
filed an appeal just after the noon deadline March 22. The appeal was 
subsequently denied by the arts commission but the City Council's Public 
Services and Safety Committee has the option of overturning the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz society, which recently closed its three-concert "Salute to the 
Masters" series with a concert by trumpeter Snooky Young with the San Diego 
State University Jazz Ensemble, wants $29,500, up from $12,800 last year. 
(Because of an illness, the festival's application was also late last year, and 
the group received no money). The jazz society proposes to present four "name" 
jazz acts next year, instead of this year's three, expand its free public jazz 
concerts program from three to four dates and add a program of live jazz in 
city libraries.

No Art Conference in Cincinnati: Reacting to a controversy in Cincinnati over 
an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, the College Art Assn. has 
discontinued discussions regarding the possibility of holding the CAA annual 
conference there in 1995. A letter to city leaders from CAA President Ruth 
Weisberg said that the "apparently officially sanctioned censorship" of the 
show and the indictment of Dennis Barrie, director of Cincinnati's Contemporary 
Art Museum, makes the city "an inappropriate milieu" because these actions are 
incompatible with the organization's advocacy of freedom of expression. GREG

Rescheduling Woes: Long Beach Opera's "Pelleas et Melisande," originally 
planned for April 28-May 6, then rescheduled for April, 1991, because baritone 
Kurt Ollmann had a schedule conflict with another opera in Rome, has been hit 
with yet another schedule problem. 
</P>
<P>
Ollmann, who was announced to sing the role of Pelleas, now must cancel because 
the Rome production of "Ariadne" was moved to the same time in 1991. LBO 
general director Michael Milenski unsuccessfully tried to recruit two other 
baritones, including Malcolm Walker, who withdrew after he told Milenski he 
didn't want to do it in English. "It's the most incredible casting problem I've 
ever had," he said. GREG BRAXTON

"Family Feud" Host Arrested: Ray Combs, host of the television game show 
"Family Feud," was arrested in Cincinnati on a trespassing complaint after he 
appeared on stage at the comedy club he co-owns. Combs' arrest was the latest 
legal action in a dispute about ownership and operation of the downtown club he 
and others opened in September. Combs, released later, called the incident "the 
grossest injustice of human rights I have ever seen." GREG BRAXTON

FASHION HISTORY IN 'VAN CLEEF &amp; ARPELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Deco was the last of the great styles in which artists sought to design 
every element of life, from the facade of a building to what a woman would wear 
visiting it. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels set the standards for excellence in 
design and workmanship for Art Deco jewelry. "The Art of Van Cleef &amp; 
Arpels," a small, tastefully mounted exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art through June 17, celebrates the work of the noted French jewelers during 
the palmiest days of the style. The crisply elegant lines of these bracelets, 
brooches, earrings will delight anyone interested in the history of fashion. 
Others will be struck by the way the show summarizes Art Deco design in 
miniature. 
</P>
<P>
The stylized flowers and peacocks on two '20s lapis lazuli vanity cases could 
easily expand into murals for the salon of an ocean liner. If the arches and 
triangles atop the Chrysler Building shrank to thumbnail size, they would 
resemble a small 1925 pin inlaid with precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
The period's taste for Oriental exotica in the decorative arts reflects in a 
"mystery clock" (so-called because the dial seemed to have no connection to the 
movement) of crystal, onyx, agate and diamonds. Modeled after the portico of a 
Japanese temple, it looks like a tiny gong from the lobby of Grauman's Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Exquisite enameled vanity boxes with mosaic scenes in mother of pearl suggest 
miniature Coromandel screens in Deco frames. A delicate platinum and diamond 
bracelet with figures copied from hieroglyphics in colored gems recalls the 
mania for Egyptian motifs triggered by the discovery of Tut's tomb in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
The heyday of the firm's designs ended with the decade. During the '30s, 
sleekly elegant bracelets and pins thickened and spread, like a dancer who 
stops exercising. Delicate Egyptian and chinoiserie ornaments were replaced by 
Boule bracelets and "padlock" watches -- cable-like chains that end in big, 
convex chucks of precious metals and gems. The Jazz Age was coming to a close; 
the lighthearted revels of the flappers drawn by John Held Jr., were giving way 
to the Depression-era adventures of "Little Orphan Annie." 
</P>
<P>
Later pieces lack the self-assured grace of the Deco jewelry: ballerina pins 
from the '40s and '50s, or the "Zip" necklace, based on a diamond-studded gold 
zipper made for the Duchess of Windsor. A maharini's bejeweled gold box with a 
portrait of Empress Eugenie and her ladies-in-waiting represents the flamboyant 
meeting of East and Western kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
The one impressive modern piece is a silver and paste replica of the fantastic 
crown made for the coronation of Empress Farah of Iran in 1967. (The original 
presumably remains in Tehran, where its 36 rubies, 36 emeralds, 105 pearls and 
1,541 diamonds help back the Iranian currency.)

LAWRENCE'S 'BEATIFIC POETS' AT THE ITCHEY FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years ago, Allen Ginsberg took a glib stab at summing up the Beat 
movement he helped breathe life into: "Who were we? A bunch of dopes sitting 
around trying to figure out where we were." 
</P>
<P>
Then why do an evening dedicated to the Beats, as the Mark Taper Forum's 
Sundays at the Itchey Foot is doing right now with a show titled, 
appropriately, "BEATific Poets"? Ginsberg's follow-up remark suggests why: 
"Everyone else was a bunch of dopes, too, but they didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
In Jeremy Lawrence's adaptation of the writings of Ginsberg, Lawrence 
Ferlinghetti, Jack Kerouac, Kenneth Rexroth, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, 
Robert Duncan, Gregory Corso, Philip Whalen and the nearly forgotten John 
Clellon Holmes and Philip Lamantia, artists who thumb their noses at the 
outside world are also painfully aware of their own mishaps. Before he met the 
Beats, Ginsberg was a market researcher. These San Francisco bards might not 
have broken ground on their own. 
</P>
<P>
That's the impression in Lawrence's text, and the picture onstage in Lillian 
Garrett's friendly, almost informal production. The viewer can't help but 
notice how this group portrait contrasts with the studied depictions of lonely, 
self-flagellating literary figures fed to us in school and so common in pop 
culture. But there's another contrast as well. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, especially within the frame of the publicity which attended and 
nearly drowned out the Beats, we view them as entertainingly rebellious, or 
isolate them as embodiments of the Freaky Poet. 
</P>
<P>
Or we institutionalize them: in prison, where Ginsberg almost went for 
committing "obscenity" in his incantatory "Howl," or literary enshrinement, as 
when Ginsberg won the National Book Award. 
</P>
<P>
From its first moments, "BEATific Poets" rejects these strategies. It sets the 
right atmosphere, with a cafe-like ambience, and interested listeners tightly 
packed together at small tables. Then, jazzman Ara Tokatlian (of the group Arco 
Iris) enters blowing a tenor sax fusing Sonny Rollins with Warne Marsh. The 
poets wander up to the stage and start talking. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, of course, has to give his audience some history, but the trick is to 
make the information come out as conversation, since we're at adjacent tables. 
Some past Taper literary cabaret readings have turned into history lessons. 
This time, we're in a jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
The evening is not, though, a succession of cool guys soloing words into the 
air. Relationships form between them. Tony Amendola's Snyder deeply admires 
Rexroth (John Apicella, who also reads/plays Duncan and Whalen) as the mentor, 
with his interests in anarchism, American Indians, Orientalism and 
"poetry-as-music" as the basis of the Beat aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Rexroth howls at Lawrence's Ginsberg to leave his silly corporate job. Ginsberg 
finds Corso's (John Castellanos, who's also Ferlinghetti, Lamantia and Holmes) 
ability to write on any subject profound, but he ambiguously calls Richard 
Holden's Kerouac, who wrote verse as well as novels, "possibly the strangest 
writer in the room." (Holden's smoky aloofness nicely adds to the ambiguity.) 
McClure, played by Jay Louden as an all-American boy who has found freedom, 
wants them all to go off to Mexico and get crazy. 
</P>
<P>
So Lawrence and Garrett allow for the possibility that these were "dopes" 
trying to escape, while giving them a platform. These poets felt the best art 
was felonious by nature, but also that it was only of this moment. Which is why 
Ginsberg says, "You have to attend to what you're saying, because you can't say 
it twice." (Is it also why key Beat influences -- Walt Whitman, Cesar Vallejo, 
Ezra Pound, Henry Miller -- go unmentioned?) 
</P>
<P>
But when Lawrence, who is in the background through most of the performance, 
rips into "Howl" and its angry, corrosive song of lament fills the room, 
"BEATific Poets" extends to at least one writer -- Ginsberg -- the mantle of 
timelessness. The deeply meditative and Jewish quality of what Lawrence turns 
into a song affirms the entire Beat phenomenon. They didn't have to say it 
twice.

'DOWN HOME' A PROMISING SERIES TRYOUT FOR NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the try-out-for-fall season at the networks, and tonight (10:30 on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39) brings the auditioning "Down Home," a promising NBC 
comedy series that finds a New York career woman reuniting with her father and 
brother in the Texas fishing village where she once lived. 
</P>
<P>
After tonight's valuable exposure following the popular "Cheers," "Down Home" 
returns in its regular time slot at 10:30 p.m. Saturday to continue its current 
run of six episodes. 
</P>
<P>
It merits longer life, based on the premiere, a mostly amusing half-hour in 
which a clever script (minus an awful joke about turning a pet singing pig into 
bacon) gives talented Judith Ivey an opportunity play the protagonist Kate to 
the comic hilt. 
</P>
<P>
She's given good support by Eric Alan Kramer as her thudding brother and Dakin 
Matthews as her father, whose failing coastal diner and fishing hangout is 
about to be swallowed by a touristy high-tech real estate development that 
would destroy the character of the town. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out the developer is being represented by Kate's old boyfriend Wade 
(Ray Baker), a former shrimper. Their romantic fires are relit. However, it's 
this relationship -- between the urbane Kate and the relative simpleton Wade -- 
that least works. It's easy to see his attraction to her, but not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, "Down Home" is a welcome addition to NBC. This is one fish that 
swims. HOWARD ROSENBERG

EASTER IN GREECE; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 20 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES, A NATIVE ATHENIAN STILL RECALLS -- AND 
RECREATES -- THE HOLIDAY FEASTS OF IS HOMELAND. 
</P>

The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Easter on the Sunday following the first 
full moon after the vernal equinox -- and always after Passover. Seldom does 
this Easter coincide with the Western Christendom holy day, but this year is an 
exception. On Sunday, Easter will be observed by the entire Christian world. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as the Greek Orthodox church, the Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical 
communion was formed when 15 Christian sects separated from the Roman Catholic 
church before the Reformation. Today 3% of all Christians are Eastern Orthodox, 
according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
</P>
<P>
Easter has been commemorated in Greece with worship and feasting for many 
centuries and has become one of the country's most important holidays. The 
celebration begins with an after-midnight dinner and continues with a 
traditional feast later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of these sumptuous meals remain vivid for native Athenian Cosmos 
Kapantzos, though he has lived in the United States for more than 20 years. He 
and and his wife, Diane, enjoy preparing the traditional feast to share with 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
And while many homes in the Southland may not be equipped to refrigerate and 
roast a whole lamb, a leg or saddle of the meat may be substituted. With the 
exception of kokoretsi, an appetizer prepared from ingredients not easily found 
in Southern California, this Greek menu may be duplicated in a standard kitchen 
with a day or two of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
For Kapantzos, however, the task began weeks ago when he personally selected a 
12- to 15-pound lamb at a small farm in Fontana. The lamb will be butchered 
today, and Kapantzos will pick up the meat and store it in the walk-in 
refrigerator at his Astro Burger restaurant in Hollywood until Easter morning. 
</P>
<P>
On the day before Easter, Kapantzos will stud the lamb from the inside with 
garlic and rub the internal cavity with Cavender's all-purpose Greek seasoning 
-- a blend of salt, black pepper, cornstarch, garlic, monosodium glutamate, 
oregano, beef flavor base, parsley and five other spices. 
</P>
<P>
Next the lamb must be placed on a spit. "This is tricky," Kapantzos said. "The 
cavity is first sewn together and then the carcass is wired to the spit in 
several places to hold it steady during rotisserie cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Once the lamb is firmly attached to the spit, it is studded around the legs 
with more garlic and the whole body is rubbed with the spice mixture, Kapantzos 
explained. The meat is then wrapped and stored in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Kapantzos will also begin preparation of the kokoretsi, an 
appetizer made of lamb organ meats that are spiced and skewered onto another 
spit, then wrapped in the cleaned intestines. He said it takes about half a day 
to prepare this delicacy, which also is seasoned with the Greek spice blend. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the organ meats from the lamb are reserved to prepare mageritsa soup, 
which will be served for an Anastasi (Resurrection) dinner that breaks the 
Lenten fasting. This traditional dish is seasoned with fresh dill and 
avgolemono, an egg-and-lemon sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The actual celebration begins with Resurrection Mass on Easter eve. At 
midnight, one candle, symbolizing the resurrected Christ, is lit by a priest in 
the darkened church. This flame is then passed to light individual candles held 
by each member of the congregation, until the entire church is aglow. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners leave the church and return home, carefully carrying their lighted 
candles. The head of the house enters first and makes a sign of the cross 
overhead on the door's threshold before extinguishing the candle. 
</P>
<P>
Bowls of warm mageritsa soup are served, accompanied by bread and wine. During 
this meal that breaks the Lenten fast, diners tap red-dyed eggs end to end 
while greeting one another with "Christos anesti" ("Christ is risen") and 
"Alithos anesti" ("Indeed He is risen"). 
</P>
<P>
The eggs are hard-cooked before being dyed for use in this traditional game. 
The object is to tap one's egg against everyone else's without breaking it to 
be assured of good luck for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Anastasi dinner family members go to bed for a few hours sleep. 
Kapantzos, however, must be up at 5 a.m. and on his way to the restaurant to 
bring back the lamb and kokoretsi. 
</P>
<P>
About 7:30 a.m. he lights the initial charcoal for cooking the appetizer and 
meat. Coals must be added throughout the rotisserie roasting, which will use 
about 30 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"In Greece the spit often is still turned by hand," Kapantzos said, "with those 
attending the feast each taking a turn." He has lightened this task, however, 
with an electric-powdered rotisserie, modified to hold an additional spit for 
the kokoretsi. 
</P>
<P>
The lamb is cooked by indirect heat. Coals are spread in troughs along each 
side of the grill, and there is a drip pan under the meat. The kokoretsi is 
cooked by direct heat over one of the troughs. 
</P>
<P>
It takes at least four hours to cook the kokoretsi; a little longer for the 
lamb, depending on the heat of the coals. A brush made of fresh herbs -- 
oregano, parsley, dill and mint -- is used to baste both with a mixture of 
lemon juice, oil and Greek spices throughout roasting, whenever either appears 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
Guests arriving during the afternoon nibble on an assortment of appetizers: 
spinach- (spanakopitas) or cheese-filled (tiropitas) filo dough triangles; feta 
and kasseri cheeses; dolmades (stuffed grape leaves); olives; green onions; 
radishes, and bread. Ouzo, an anise-flavored Greek cordial, is sipped by 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
After the kokoretsi is cooked, it's sliced from the spit and served as an 
additional hot appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the lamb is ready for serving. Guests gather around to watch the 
carving and sample the crisp skin before taking some of the moist, 
mild-flavored meat. 
</P>
<P>
To accompany the lamb, there are Oven-Roast Potatoes, Peas With Dill, and a 
creamy sauce ofyogurt, grated cucumber and garlic called tzatsiki. A salad of 
greens, black olives and feta cheese -- sprinkled with olive oil, vinegar and 
oregano -- and Greek bread (plain or sesame) or sourdough round out the buffet. 
Resina, a resin-flavored wine, is the traditional beverage. 
</P>
<P>
Later there are desserts -- Galactoboureko, a custard and filo pastry; 
koulourakia, buttery twist cookies that can be baked at home but are also 
available at Greek markets, and an egg-studded bread called tsoureki. Strong 
Greek coffee is the accompaniment.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: ACCESSORIES ARRIVE IN SPRING HUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrating the spirit of Easter and flaunting the soft pastel palette of 
spring is a wide assortment of accessories to be found on culinary market 
shelves. The rush to prepare the following assemblage started last year and hit 
the shops in time for this season's unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly apropo and welcomed -- with nature and fantasy colliding -- is the 
enchanting Bunny Hollow Collection of playfully conceived teapots, vases, 
baskets, pitchers, cookie jars, serving trays and plates from Fitz and Floyd 
(from $28 apiece). The storybook approach is translated into each cunningly 
wrought ceramic piece. Resonating with whimsy and intricate detailing, a 
basket-weave, pale buff candy box that's embraced by a ruffled baby blue ribbon 
and bow is topped by a storytelling lid, which is designed like a flower patch 
with a bunny boy diving into it. 
</P>
<P>
Another comfortingly familiar item is a cookie jar portrayed by a heavy-set 
female bunny carrying a bunch of spring flowers. She's costumed in a wavy pink 
dress overlaid with a blue and white checked apron that's bordered with lace 
ruffles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Janet Laudeman, showroom manager at the Fitz and Floyd showroom at 
the L.A. Mart, the new pattern has been very appealing this year. "Texture is 
its selling point," she said, "plus the amount of detail and coloring in it. 
Also, everybody is into gardening these days -- people really like the garden 
theme." Particularly amusing she said, is the teapot with the mommy bunny and 
son watering pastel-colored flowers with a green hose; the gush of water serves 
as the the handle of the teapot. 
</P>
<P>
In their quest for the exquisite decorative egg -- a symbol of rebirth during 
Eastertime -- egg collectors will most likely come across the colorful 
characters from Hang 'em High Designs in Tallahassee, Fla. Meet a few of them: 
Trix has an eye-catching fuschia bottom and sunny yellow top. Alexander's 
jagged gray belting complements a strawberry red and pale blue combo. TNT 
explodes with a graduated layering of kelly green, fuschia pink, yellow and 
country blue. Then there's Bebop, bright and bouncy with its collage of purple, 
turquoise, orange ochre and citrus yellow. 
</P>
<P>
They're real goose eggs from South Dakota. And they all come out of their 
designer's nests spotted, streaked, feathered, criss-crossed, whiplashed and/or 
zigzagged through and through with a pleasing sweep of dazzling colors. 
</P>
<P>
Powerfully abstract, the hollowed goose eggs (from $34 to $38) were exclusively 
designed by Michelle McNeil. The young artist, who has long been fascinated by 
the evolution of ancient Chinese characters into their modern forms, has in the 
past been hand-painting the decorative eggs for her own collection as well as 
for gifts for friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
The high price of McNeil's painted goose eggs may very well be justified by 
their originality and quality. They receive extensive processing for permanent 
surface protection and undergo some traveling. Each egg gets its start at 
Beverly's Goose Farm in South Dakota, where it is blown, hollowed and washed 
inside and out. After the holes are patched by a careful process, they're 
shipped to Korea, where they're handpainted, following the artist's designs. 
</P>
<P>
A matching wooden ring stand conveniently supports each egg but if the customer 
requests, Hang 'em High will gladly fit the egg with a delicate eyelet and 
string. According to John Ruben, one of the owners of Hang 'em Designs (which 
also makes carved animal display ornaments), the ornaments are individually 
hand painted -- not just dipped into paint. They're not mass produced, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
For little egg hunters, a wonderful Easter treat could be a bunny cake. Wilton 
Entriprises from Woodridge, Ill. answers this sweet calling by providing a 
MicroBakes Bunny Cake Pan ($4.49). The bunny face contours in the cake are 
easily sculptured with the indentations in the pan. For an Easter dessert, 
Wilton decorators suggest micro-baking a carrot cake in the pan for about 10 
minutes, then icing the cooled cake with a cream cheese frosting. To give the 
bunny a furry look, a sprinkling of coconut does the trick. For eyes, nose, 
mouth and whiskers, use your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Designed for microwave use only, Wilton's MicroBakes pans are all dishwasher 
safe, reusable and guaranteed to provide years of quick baking. For cake 
recipes and decorating ideas send a self-addressed, stamped No. 10 envelope to: 
Fun Desserts with Microbakes, Wilton Enterprises, 2240 West 75th St., 
Woodridge, Ill. 60517. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bunny Hollow Collection is available at Bullock's and Nordstrom's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hang 'em Design Eggs are available at MOCA (Los Angeles), Zero Minus Plus 
(Santa Monica), Mix't (Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
The Wilton MicroBakes Bunny Cake Pan is available at craft, department and 
discount stores nationwide.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: WHEN CALORIES COUNT, MUNCH ON FRESH FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I am trying to watch my calorie and sugar intake, so I regularly 
munch on dried fruits, especially apples and bananas. But a friend has told me 
that they are extremely high in calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DOREEN, Arkadelphia, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DOREEN: Many dried fruits are higher in calories and sugar than fresh 
fruit, so your friend is right. Most fresh fruit is a better choice when 
watching calorie and sugar intake, and they can be a good source of fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I bought a wooden bread box, it had an odor that penetrated 
the bread. I bought some adhesive-backed plastic in a wood-type print and 
completely covered the inside of the box with it. 
</P>
<P>
I can now use the bread box and am not bothered by the pesky odor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS., M., San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I am a busy working mother of two young sons, and dinner was 
getting later and later because the baby wanted to be held and my older son 
wanted my attention. 
</P>
<P>
So, I found a way to spend time with them and prepare dinner too. I get an 
activity -- coloring, cutting or pasting -- for my older son to do at the 
kitchen table, and I put the baby in a front-pack infant carrier. Now I can 
talk with my older son and carry the little one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LINDA, Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This is a foolproof way to mix liquid and powder to ensure there 
will be no lumps when the mixture is used as a thickener. 
</P>
<P>
You will need a clean, empty jar with a tight-fitting lid. Pour the liquid 
(water, milk or bouillon) into the container first then add the flour or 
cornstarch and give it a thorough shaking to mix completely. Use it as a 
thickener in soups, gravies or casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LOIS, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a problem getting candles to fit into the candle holders. 
Please help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANN: Try using the pleated paper cup linings found in a box of chocolate 
candy. They are great for making the bottoms of those candles fit snugly. If 
the candles are too large, shave off some of the excess wax until they fit into 
the holder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Since most of my furniture is wood, I have coasters on each 
table. The coasters always would stick to the bottom of the glass and fall off 
when the glass was raised. 
</P>
<P>
So, I cut some leftover carpet samples into circles to fit the inside of the 
coasters and glued them on. Now they don't stick to the glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GLORIA, South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I accidentally discovered that putting on a rubber glove becomes 
an excellent way to open a difficult jar. It gives me the necessary traction to 
twist off the top. Can't believe I didn't come across this solution sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROSE, Milltown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Recycling has always been a problem around our house because of 
the clutter. We seem to have aluminum cans everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
One day when I was out garage-sale shopping, I ran across a plastic trash can. 
I placed the can outside the garage door where it's become a handy 
mini-recycling center for the household. It's easy, clean and handy to toss in 
the trunk of the car when it's full. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CINDY, Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have more terry-cloth hand towels than I need for guests, so I 
use the extras as napkins for my family. Each member has a different color. 
</P>
<P>
They are a good size, wash easily and save on the paper napkins. 
</P>

BACK TO BASICS: FILLED FILO DOUGH FITS INTO ALMOST ALL MEAL PLANS FOR FANCIFUL 
FEASTS 
</P>

Filo dough triangles, stuffed and then baked until golden brown, are a 
traditional appetizer at many Greek feasts. Those filled with cheese are called 
tiropitas; when a spinach and cheese mixture is used, they are known as 
spanokopeta. 
</P>
<P>
Although filo dough is not difficult to work with, it's important that the 
paper-thin sheets don't dry out or they'll crumble into flakes, becoming 
useless. To prevent this from happening, cover the filo dough completely with 
plastic wrap and a kitchen towel as soon as the dough is removed from the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Mold may appear on filo that is old or has been improperly packaged or stored. 
Don't hesitate to return a just-purchased package of filo if it appears moldy, 
and discard any that has been stored for too long. When well wrapped, the 
sheets should stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If the edges of the filo are slightly dry, revive by spritzing with water from 
a clean spray bottle. Tears in the dough may be patched by moistening a 
separate piece of dough and placing it over the defect. Wrinkles may be patted 
down or smoothed out. 
</P>
<P>
To form the triangles, place one sheet of filo at a time on a clean work 
surface and brush with melted butter (Step 1) or a mixture of melted butter and 
olive oil. Fold the sheet in thirds (Step 2), brushing each surface with 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
Place about one tablespoon of frozen spinach, thawed and well drained, on a 
corner of the strip (Step 3). Sprinkle with feta cheese (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
Fold the corner over the filling, forming a triangle (Step 5). Continue to 
fold, flag fashion, up the strip, retaining the triangle shape. The last fold 
may require trimming or tucking in of any excess dough. 
</P>
<P>
Before placing on a baking sheet, brush each triangle with butter (Step 6). 
Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.

CULINARY SOS: FROM GORKY'S, HERE'S A TERRIFIC HOT BORSCHT SOUP TO WARM THE 
HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Growing up in a terrific Polish family, I have fond memories of my 
Dad's hot borscht soup. Until now, I have searched in vain for a recipe that 
came close to his, but when I tried the concoction at Gorky's Russian Brewery I 
knew I had found my heaven. Please get Gorky's to part with the recipe for 
their potion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PHIL 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PHIL: Chef Michael Friedman of Gorky's gladly provided it. This is a 
heart-warming soup to serve with hunks of crusty pumpernickel or rye bread. And 
keep it in mind for informal, serve-yourself entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
GORKY'S BEET BORSCHT 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds whole beets 
</P>
<P>
14 cups water 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup apple cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
1 can (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth plus 1 tablespoon salt or 4 chicken 
bouillon cubes dissolved with 1 cup hot water 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon black pepper or to taste 
</P>
<P>
2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 large onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cabbage, cored and cut into 2x2-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
1 large Russet potato, peeled and cubed 
</P>
<P>
Cut ends and stems of beets. Boil 20 minutes or until tender-crisp. To peel, 
rub with cloth while still warm and remove skins. Cut into 1/4-inch julienne 
pieces and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Place 14 cups water, vinegar, granulated and brown sugars, tomato paste, 
chicken broth, garlic, salt to taste, pepper and bay leaves in large kettle. 
Bring to boil. Skim off foam. 
</P>
<P>
Add onion. Cook 8 to 10 minutes or until onion is transparent. Add cabbage. 
Cook 15 minutes longer. Add potato and cook another 15 minutes. Add beets, 
bring to boil. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: For thicker borscht, grate instead of julienne 1/2 pound cooked beets. 
Serve with pumpernickel bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: My mother has a great recipe for shrimp rolls but she refuses to part 
with it. Her appetizer is rolled jellyroll style with a cream cheese, shrimp 
and dill filling, then is iced with sour cream. Do you have anything that fits 
that description? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CINDY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CINDY: You can make canape rolls for teas, baby showers or receptions by 
using thin white or wheat bread slices and the fillings listed below. 
</P>
<P>
Flatten bread slices with a rolling pin. Add a desired filling and roll 
jellyroll fashion to form a cylinder. The rolls can be frosted with softened, 
seasoned cream cheese or sour cream, or left plain and tied with ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, your best bet is to prepare Frosted Sandwich Loaf, which when sliced 
reveals multiple fillings. 
</P>
<P>
FROSTED SANDWICH LOAF 
</P>
<P>
1 day-old 12-inch unsliced loaf sandwich bread 
</P>
<P>
Butter or margarine, softened 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp Filling 
</P>
<P>
Dill Filling 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Cream Cheese Frosting 
</P>
<P>
Stuffed olives, pimiento and green pepper strips 
</P>
<P>
Parsley, watercress or crisp lettuce leaves 
</P>
<P>
Remove crusts from bread. Cut loaf lengthwise into 4 slices of equal thickness. 
Keep slices in order. 
</P>
<P>
Place bottom slice on serving platter. Spread with softened butter, then with 
Shrimp Filling. Butter both sides of next slice and press in place over bottom 
slice. Spread with Dill Filling. 
</P>
<P>
Butter both sides of third slice, press in place and spread with Cheese 
Filling. Butter bottom of top slice and press in position. 
</P>
<P>
Spread Cream Cheese Frosting over top and sides of loaf. If desired, decorate 
top of loaf with slices of stuffed olive, strips of pimiento, green pepper and 
other greens. Chill several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Before serving garnish platter with parsley, watercress or crisp lettuce. Cut 
loaf into crosswise slices to serve. Makes 12 to 16 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp Filling 
</P>
<P>
1 (4 1/2-ounce) can shrimp 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
Mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
Drain and chop shrimp, if necessary. Mix with celery and enough mayonnaise to

<P>
2 medium tomatoes

</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or 1 teaspoon dried dill weed

WINE EXHIBIT FUND-RAISER SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Wine Patrons, still $50,000 short of its goal for funding of the 
Hernando Courtright California Wine Exhibit in Los Angeles, announced it will 
kick off a final fund-raising campaign in May, seeking 50 more wineries as 
supporting members. 
</P>
<P>
Raoul Balcaen, president of the Patrons, said the initial funding campaign 
raised $800,000, allowing the exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Science and Industry to open last Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
He said letters will be sent to wineries that have not yet joined the exhibit 
as sponsors, seeking support based on the wineries' case production. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit covers 2,500 square feet of space in a lower level of the museum. 
It is aimed at educating consumers about the wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
Included are computer-based interactive exhibits that look at wine making, 
pairing wine with food, wine aromas, and the various microclimates of the state 
and what makes them unique. 
</P>
<P>
There even is a computer that examines what the body's blood-alcohol level 
would be under various levels of consumption of table wine. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the wine exhibit fund-raising campaign contact: Raoul 
Balcaen, 221 Woodruff Ave., Los Angeles 90024.

THE BUTCHER: CUT-IT-YOURSELF SIRLOIN CAN ADD UP TO LARGE SAVINGS FOR A FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I was shopping at a market in Baton Rouge, La., for meats for cooking 
classes I was teaching in Cajun-Creole country. In the supermarket meat case 
were barbecue steaks ($3.99 per pound), steak for etoufee ($3.89 per pound), 
grillades ($4.19 per pound.), strips of lean beef for stir-fry ($4.49 per 
pound) and lean cubes of beef for kebabs ($3.89 per pound). 
</P>
<P>
Not 10 feet from the section of the meat case containing the above cuts was a 
section of the meat case displaying, among other items, sirloin tip roast -- on 
sale for $1.79 per pound. You had to buy the whole sirloin tip -- each of which 
weighed between 10 pounds and 12 pounds -- but considering all the things that 
you can do with one, the size should not be a deterrent. The sirloin tip is the 
sub-primal cut from which all of the fancy cuts mentioned above are derived. 
</P>
<P>
By doing a little cutting up in the kitchen, you can obtain barbecue steaks for 
$1.79 per pound instead of $3.99 per pound. You can get strips for stir-fry, 
grillades to do with grits, and cuts for kebabs at a fraction of what you would 
pay if the butcher cut them for you. 
</P>
<P>
And even if they aren't on special at $1.79 per pound, whole sirloin tips are 
available at most markets just as they come from the packer, still in its 
plastic vacuum packaging. With a little work, you can stock a freezer with many 
beef meals at a bargain price. (Freezing meat has little effect on its 
quality.) 
</P>
<P>
A sub-primal sirloin tip easily can be divided to meet family needs. The tip 
consists of two main muscles, a small one on top the cap and a large one called 
the ball tip that makes up most of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Start by removing the cap, along with the fat that covers it, from the ball 
tip. This is accomplished more simply by pulling than by any tricky knife work. 
There is a natural seam that separates the two muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Trim the fat away from the cap muscle and slice the cap into thin strips to use 
for stir-fry or stroganoff. 
</P>
<P>
What you do with the remaining ball tip is limited by little but imagination. 
Split it in half, use one half for a roast and cut the other half into steaks 
as thick or as thin as you like. Or slice a thick steak off one side for London 
broil, then divide the rest into roasts, slice it for steaks or cut it into 
cubes for kebabs or fondue.

</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Easter morning breakfast or brunch is not complete without an attractive sweet 
bread to celebrate. These sweet breads are decorative enough to use as 
centerpieces, placed strategically around the table for guests to help 
themselves. Many of them have built-in color, with colored frosting and even 
Easter eggs as adornments. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Small colored candies for decoration 
</P>
<P>
Turn pineapple into wire strainer over bowl. Let drain, reserving syrup. 
Combine water with 1 tablespoon pineapple syrup and sprinkle with yeast. Let 
stand 5 minutes to soften. Add egg, sugar, 4 tablespoons butter, lemon zest, 
cardamom and 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth. Press out as much syrup as 
possible from pineapple, using back of spoon. Measure 1 cup pineapple and add 
to batter. Reserve remaining pineapple for glazing ring. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually blend remaining 1 1/2 cups flour into first mixture, to make 
moderately stiff dough. Cover bowl, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 to 
2 hours. Punch down and divide into 3 portions. Shape each portion into narrow 
strand about 18 to 20 inches long, rolling dough with palms of hands against 
floured board to shape. Cross 3 strands about center of each and braid together 
from each end. Join ends, shaping into ring. Lift onto greased pizza pan or 
baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Brush with remaining tablespoon melted butter. Let rise in warm place until 
doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes, until lightly 
browned. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Mix reserved well-drained pineapple 
with 3/4 cup powdered sugar and spoon over warm braid. Decorate with small 
colored candies, if desired. Makes 1 large ring.

SUCCULENT HAM PERKS UP EASTER DINNER TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Easter is a family time when relatives come together to share the joy of a 
special spring day. It is also the time of year when many cooks spend hours 
laboring in the kitchen over an impressive meal, the nucleus of which is almost 
always a ham. Whether one chooses a fully cooked or a fresh ham, it's sure to 
provide a savory entree for Easter feasting. 
</P>
<P>
How did the traditional Easter ham originate? Years ago, the curing, smoking 
and aging process was necessary for the preservation of meat. Hogs were 
butchered during winter, when hams were cured, then hung in smokehouses to age 
throughout the season. It was believed that the ham had sufficiently aged by 
the arrival of spring (which comfortably coincided with Easter). Thus, ham 
found its way to the dinner table for special Easter celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three glazed, baked hams that will brighten your Easter dinner table. 
Fresh asparagus and hot baked bread are perfect complements. 
</P>
<P>
HONEY-ORANGE GLAZED HAM 
</P>
<P>
1 orange 
</P>
<P>
1 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
1 (8- to 10-pound) fully cooked whole boneless ham 
</P>
<P>
Fresh watercress, optional 
</P>
<P>
Carefully remove zest from orange in long strips and reserve zest. Squeeze 
orange, reserving 2 tablespoons juice. Combine reserved juice, honey, cinnamon 
and cloves in small bowl and mix well. 
</P>
<P>
Place ham on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer into 
thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees 
2 to 2 1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 135 to 140 degrees, basting 
with glaze during last 45 minutes cooking time. Garnish with orange zest and 
watercress. Makes 24 to 30 servings. 
</P>
<P>
APPLE-GLAZED BAKED HAM 
</P>
<P>
1 (5- to 7-pound) shank half smoked ham 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup apple jelly 
</P>
<P>
Place ham, fat side up, on rack in open roasting pan. Insert roast meat 
thermometer in thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Do not add 
water. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees until thermometer registers 130 degrees 
for fully cooked half ham (18 to 24 minutes per pound) or 160 degrees for 
cook-before-eating half ham (22 to 25 minutes per pound). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, melt jelly over low heat. Brush ham with melted jelly during last 20 
minutes baking time. Makes about 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE-CHERRY GLAZED HAM 
</P>
<P>
1 (5- to 7-pound) shank half smoked ham 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup cherry preserves 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon orange juice 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
Place ham, fat side up, on rack in open roasting pan. Insert roast meat 
thermometer in thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Do not add 
water. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees until thermometer registers 130 to 140 
degrees for fully cooked half ham (18 to 24 minutes per pound) or 160 degrees 
for cook-before-eating half ham (22 to 25 minutes per pound). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, melt cherry preserves in small saucepan over medium heat. Strain 
cherries from syrup, reserving syrup. Coarsely chop cherries and combine with 
syrup, orange juice and zest. Brush glaze over ham during last 20 minutes 
baking time. Makes 12 servings.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: RAISING POTASSIUM LEVEL LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick, name two ways to reduce the risk of high blood pressure. We're betting 
you know the answer: Lose weight, if necessary, and cut back on salt. But if we 
asked you to name a third measure, the answer might not come as easily, even 
though it's just as simple: Increase intake of potassium. 
</P>
<P>
This advice comes backed by a special committee of the National Research 
Council, which recommends that adults consume 3,500 milligrams of potassium a 
day. Some groups are already eating that much; others are not. Recent estimates 
show that 15- to 20-year-olds take in 3,400 milligrams daily. Diets of an urban 
white population provided 2,500 milligrams, while studies of black Americans 
have found intakes as low as 1,000 milligrams a day. 
</P>
<P>
Sodium may get more press, but our bodies contain twice as much potassium -- 
just over half-a-pound. Most is found within the cells. Together with sodium, 
it regulates the salt and acid-base balance of the fluid environment of healthy 
cells. The amount outside the cells, though smaller, is equally important, 
contributing to transmission of nerve impulses, control of skeletal muscle 
contractions and maintenance of normal blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary deficiency doesn't usually occur. It can develop when large amounts are 
lost by prolonged vomiting, chronic diarrhea or laxative abuse. Excessive 
losses are also linked to certain diseases and use of some diuretics. Patients 
on such medications often are advised to take them with orange juice or a 
banana, both packed with potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Over several decades, evidence has mounted that eating more such potassium-rich 
fruits and vegetables may benefit not only hypertension patients but the 
population at large. Although not always consistent, some studies indicate that 
low levels of dietary sodium coupled with high intake of potassium may reduce 
blood pressure. And high potassium intake -- meaning at least 3,500 milligrams 
daily -- may by itself protect against death from stroke. In one study, it was 
estimated that an increase of just 400 milligrams a day of potassium, over a 
12-year period, led to a 40% decrease in incidence of stroke-related death. 
</P>
<P>
Why this happens is not yet known. But until research provides the answer, 
we're left with the recommendation to take in 3,500 milligrams a day. The next 
question is, does your diet meet the test? 
</P>
<P>
Bear this in mind: Fruits and vegetables, unless processed with salt, are 
naturally low in sodium, and for this reason are often mentioned as preferred 
potassium sources. Yet most other foods also contain the mineral. A cup of milk 
has 355 milligrams, a slice of whole-wheat bread, 63 milligrams, and an ounce 
of hamburger, 81 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's run through a typical day's menu. Breakfast might include four ounces 
of orange juice (238 milligrams), a cup of oatmeal (146 milligrams), 
three-quarters cup milk (266 milligrams) and coffee (65 milligrams). The total 
is 715 milligrams: 20% of the target. 
</P>
<P>
A bag lunch could be a sandwich made with whole-wheat bread (326 milligrams) 
and two tablespoons of peanut butter (200 milligrams), along with carrot sticks 
(145 milligrams), a glass of milk (355 milligrams) and a fresh pear (260 
milligrams) for dessert. Lunch thus gives you 1,286 milligrams, or 36% more. 
</P>
<P>
A dinner, consisting of four ounces of lean steak (396 milligrams), a large 
baked potato (844 milligrams), a medium stalk of broccoli (293 milligrams), a 
glass of skim milk (355 milligrams) and a cup of pineapple chunks (266 
milligrams) adds 2,154 milligrams, bringing the day's tally to 4,155 
milligrams, even without snacks that might round out this bare-bones menu. 
Clearly, a menu planned with an eye to general principles of good nutrition can 
easily provide 3,500 milligrams of potassium or more. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your meal doesn't include such potassium powerhouses as baked potato, 
there are alternatives. Dried apricots, prunes, cooked kidney beans, celery, 
spinach, avocado and winter squash all provide 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams 
of potassium per half-cup. One rung down are bananas, tomatoes, orange juice, 
cooked lentils, Brussels sprouts and cantaloupe, with 200 milligrams to 275 
milligrams per half-cup. Other fruits and vegetables contain 70 milligrams to 
170 milligrams per half-cup -- and we often eat servings larger than that 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
There's no reason to suggest that taking potassium supplements will ward off 
hypertension. Yet a diet rich in potassium might be of benefit, and this 
possibility provides one more reason to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. 
Such a diet dates back to that of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, who depended 
heavily on potassium-rich roots, fruits, tubers, nuts, grains and seeds for 
calories.

Read Ingredient List on Turkey Products 
</P>
<P>
Question: Is it true that some turkey products have skin ground up in them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some do, and that adds considerably to the fat content of the product. 
One way to tell whether the ground poultry you're buying contains skin as well 
as flesh is by inspecting the ingredients list. If you find the words turkey 
meat or chicken meat, you can assume you're getting the lean part only. If the 
list includes plain terms like turkey or chicken, or even chicken breast, then 
the producer may, within the limits of government regulation, add ground skin 
to the product. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I buy sunflower seeds in bulk, so there is no labeling information. My 
calorie chart says that two ounces of the seeds contain 170 calories. Does that 
mean two ounces including the shell or just the edible seeds? 
</P>
<P>
A: That figure includes the shell. Two ounces of the edible seeds would contain 
about 325 calories. If you don't have ready access to a scale, you may find it 
more useful to think in terms of household measures. A cup of seeds in the 
shell, which yields about one-third cup of edible kernels, provides 255 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
As you may know, sunflower seeds are high in fat -- an attribute useful to 
birds and squirrels trying to survive the winter but not always so desirable 
for humans. Protein and carbohydrate account for a little more than 30% of the 
calories; the rest are from fat. 
</P>
<P>
Sunflower seeds contain some B vitamins and are a good source of iron. They 
also provide a bit of calcium, although in that department they're no 
competitor for milk. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've read that a nursing mother should consume about 500 calories a day more 
than normal during the first six months of her infant's life. What is the basis 
for that statement? 
</P>
<P>
A: On average, milk from well-nourished mothers contains about 70 calories per 
100 milliliters. It's estimated that the conversion of calories consumed (when 
the mother eats) to calories in milk is, on average, about 80% efficient -- 
although this varies widely, ranging from 76% to as high as 94%. Thus, during 
the first six months, a woman typically produces an average of about three cups 
of milk a day. So it takes an average of about 640 calories a day to meet the 
demand of producing milk. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, is the gap between the recommendation and the actual need explained? 
The generally recommended energy allowance of 500 calories assumes that the 
mother has laid down some energy reserves during her pregnancy, anywhere from 
15,400 to 23,000 calories worth. It's expected that these fat stores will 
provide the caloric deficit from 100 to 150 calories a day for the first six 
months. Obviously, women who were underweight during pregnancy or whose weight 
drops too much while they are nursing will need to raise their caloric intake 
to meet the increased demands. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, I purchased three copper pans, all lined with nickel. 
While cleaning up after a recent dinner party, a friend inquired about the 
lining material. When I told her it was nickel, she expressed concern about its 
safety, gently implying that unwittingly I might have been poisoning my guests. 
Are nickel-lined pans harmful in some way? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. While both tin and nickel are used to line copper pans, nickel offers 
two advantages: 1) it is more durable, and will outlast tin; 2) it is more 
heat-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, that means that if an empty tin-lined pan is inadvertently 
left on a heated burner, the lining will be destroyed rather quickly but a 
nickel lining will not be so easily hurt. 
</P>
<P>
From a safety standpoint there really is no difference. There is no evidence 
that either nickel or tin will migrate into the food in harmful amounts. 
Besides, both metals are poorly absorbed and readily excreted.

LATINOS CRITICIZE REMARKS BY CAVAZOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leading Latinos criticized U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos for saying 
Latino parents deserve much of the blame for a high dropout rate among their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Chavira, chief of staff for the San Antonio-based League of United Latin 
American Citizens, which claims to be the largest Latino group in the United 
States, said he was upset by Cavazos' remarks and that scores of educators had 
been calling LULAC to voice their anger. Cavazos, who is Latino, told a San 
Antonio news conference Tuesday that although Latinos have traditionally valued 
education, "somewhere along the line we've lost that. I really believe today 
there is not that emphasis."

The Census Bureau is now uncertain whether 70% of Americans will return their 
census forms as it had hoped, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-five percent is today's figure (for forms returned), and we're still 
hoping people will get them in," said the spokesman. On April 26, the bureau 
will send enumerators to interview members of households from which forms have 
not been received. In some cases, the enumerators will find that homes have 
been torn down or are temporarily vacant. For each percentage point below 70% 
in the response rate, the Census Bureau has estimated to Congress it will have 
to spend $10 million for extra interviewers.

A federal jury has acquitted a senior Cubic Corp. engineer of charges he 
falsified test results on mine detectors to be used by the Army. "It's been a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a huge upheaval in my life," Dennis B. Fink, 41, said after the 
verdict. "It's virtually ruined my career." U.S. Atty. William Braniff said he 
was disappointed, but said the case sent a message that "defense contractors at 
all levels will be fully accountable if found to be involved in contract 
fraud." Fink, engineering project manager for Cubic's $7.3-million mine 
detector program, was charged in the 1988 indictment with participation in a 
massive fraud. Prosecutors alleged inferior workmanship and said that 
manipulation of test results on land-mine detectors was allegedly overlooked in 
order to achieve favorable results. Fink was acquitted on two fraud-related 
counts in August, but the jury deadlocked on 21 other charges. Another Cubic 
employee, William B. Bauder, also was acquitted.

BUSH TELLS FEARS ON BALTIC STATES; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: HE SPURNS PLEA BY ETHNIC AMERICANS TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION. THE 
PRESIDENT INVOKES THE MEMORY OF THE BLOODY SOVIET CRACKDOWN IN HUNGARY IN 1956. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush raised the image of the bloody Soviet crackdown in Hungary three 
decades ago as he told leaders of Baltic-American ethnic groups Wednesday that 
he cannot do more to back independence movements in Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore Bush's fears, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned 
in broadcast remarks Wednesday that secession movements within the Soviet Union 
could lead to "such bloody carnage that we won't be able to crawl out of it." 
</P>
<P>
During a 70-minute meeting with ethnic group leaders, Bush repeatedly cited 
Hungary's 1956 uprising, when the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration 
encouraged a revolt against Soviet domination, only to stand by powerless when 
the Soviet army rolled in and killed thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very, very worried about what happened in Hungary. He remembers it very 
clearly," said Mari-Ann Rikken of the Joint Baltic-American National Committee. 
"He wants to find a way out . . . that will not result in a cataclysm for the 
Soviet Union and that will not result in a blood bath." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a televised question-and-answer session with a congress of young 
Communists, Gorbachev warned that a blood bath is exactly what the independence 
movements in the Baltics could lead to, wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
Given the more than 100 different ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, many of 
them with strong nationalist sentiments, any move to redraw boundaries "would 
pit all peoples and all nations against each other and bring about a situation 
in this society the likes of which has never been witnessed by our country or 
by the world," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of independence for the Baltics argue they are a special case 
because, unlike other parts of the Soviet Union, the three republics were 
independent nations until they were annexed in World War II. But Gorbachev has 
insisted that a move by any one republic to secede could unravel the entire 
Soviet fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"If we begin to divide up, I'll give it to you bluntly. We'll end up in such a 
civil war, in such bloody carnage that we won't be able to crawl out of it," he 
told the young Communist gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has made predictions of disaster before, but the latest remarks were 
among his most pointed on the secession crisis that bedevils the Kremlin 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The forces threatening to pull the Soviet Union apart have seemed to gain 
strength steadily all year. Lithuania declared independence more than a month 
ago, and nationalists in Estonia and Latvia have been pushing to follow suit. 
In addition, Moscow earlier this year had to call in the army to put down 
fighting in the southern republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia. And in recent 
days, officials have confronted nationalist demonstrations in Georgia and a 
strengthened independence movement in the vital western republic of the 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in both Moscow and Washington have been eager to avoid bloodshed in 
Lithuania, fearing that violence there would stop progress across the entire 
spectrum of East-West relations. Already, hard-liners within the Bush 
Administration have been citing Lithuania as an argument against quickly 
reducing U.S. troop strength in Europe or the overall size of the U.S. defense 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The President has taken a characteristically cautious line. And the account of 
his remarks in Wednesday's meeting, confirmed by White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater, provides the best glimpse so far of his reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is under pressure from Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and from 
conservatives at home to take a strong stand in favor of independence for the 
Baltics, which the United States has supported, in theory, since the annexation 
by the Stalin regime in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he told his visitors, Bush fears that strong rhetoric from Washington 
could spur pro-independence forces in the three republics to move too far, too 
fast and bring about what Fitzwater called "a situation that would create the 
use of force." 
</P>
<P>
The result of those conflicting pressures has been a delicate diplomatic dance. 
On the one hand, the Administration has warned the Soviet leadership against 
using force to end the independence movement. On the other, Bush has refused to 
recognize the pro-independence government in Lithuania, and his aides generally 
have refused to comment on specific Soviet moves. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 representatives of Lithuanian-, Latvian- and Estonian-American groups 
asked Bush to take a far higher profile and begin "interim steps" short of 
actual diplomatic recognition that could strengthen the Lithuanian claim to be 
a legitimate government. They left, however, with little to show from their 
session with the President and his top advisers, including Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our present position is the correct one, and the President did 
not indicate that we are willing to change," said Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed with the official policy of the United States," said 
Anthony B. Mazeika, a real estate agent from Mission Viejo, Calif., who serves 
as director of the Baltic American Freedom League. He added that he believes 
that if the United States had made a statement of support for the new 
Lithuanian government after it declared independence, "I think Mr. Gorbachev 
would have been a lot more resilient and supportive of this process." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to refusing any moves toward recognition of the Lithuanian 
government, the Administration also continues to support the idea of referenda 
on secession in each of the three Baltic republics. The Baltic-American groups, 
in a letter presented to Bush, opposed that idea. Pro-independence groups, 
particularly in Latvia and Estonia, fear that large numbers of ethnic Russians 
who have moved to the Baltic lands since the Soviet takeover could vote down 
independence if a referendum were held. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in his remarks, predicted that even the Lithuanians, who 
overwhelmingly supported pro-independence candidates in elections earlier this 
year, would reject secession if it were put to a vote. Once voters realize the 
economic and political problems secession will bring, he said, they would 
realize Lithuania "needs independence, but within the framework" of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Baltic-American groups made no concrete progress, their officials 
said they were pleased that after months of trying, they at least had succeeded 
in holding a meeting with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the ethnic organizations represented in the Oval Office meeting are 
strongly anti-Communist and have had long ties with the Republican Party. "We 
used to wear out the threshold of the previous Administration," said Rikken, 
the spokeswoman of the the Joint Baltic-American National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the meeting now comes at a time when Bush and his aides 
have been toughening their rhetoric on the Baltic situation, warning that 
Soviet actions in Lithuania could put U.S.-Soviet relations "at risk." 
</P>
<P>
But the rhetoric has not, so far, been matched by any specifics. While the 
Administration has warned that "very serious adverse consequences" to 
U.S.-Soviet relations would result from a Soviet crackdown in Lithuania, State 
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler repeated Wednesday that officials have 
never spelled out to the Soviets what those consequences might be. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States to be too specific on the subject would be foolish, 
Tutwiler said, adding: "Let them gamble and see what happens."

AS WOMEN CLIMB POLITICAL LADDER, STEREOTYPES FOLLOW

Ask voters to compare men and women politicians and they probably will reply 
that the women are "harder working," "more caring" and "more ethical." But they 
also probably will say that the men are "tougher" and "emotionally better 
suited" for politics. 
</P>
<P>
Then also ask the voters to describe the differences between former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. The 
responses, as the Los Angeles Times Poll recently found, will be strikingly 
similar -- with stereotypes about women politicians in general spilling over 
into the current battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
All this is more than just an interesting academic exercise as Feinstein 
strives to become California's first woman governor. Women throughout the 
nation in recent years have been climbing higher on the political ladder, some 
into governors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond the issue of who becomes California's next governor, a broader 
question being posed by Feinstein's candidacy -- as well as others this year -- 
is whether the state is entering into what Mervin Field of the California Poll 
has been predicting will be "the decade of women in politics." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a mood out in the culture of wanting to elect a woman," said Margery 
Tabankin, executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Added Kathy Garmezy, the committee's abortion rights director: "There's a 
radarscope thing happening -- (Margaret) Thatcher, (Violeta Barrios de) 
Chamorro, (Corazon) Aquino, (Benazir) Bhutto. . . ." Voters -- especially women 
-- notice these world leaders and realize the United States lags behind other 
nations in electing women to the highest positions of power, she said. "I have 
this desire I've never had before to elect a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's biggest boosters in polls conducted by The Times have been women, 
who are supporting her by 2 to 1 over Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Thomas of Los Angeles, a veteran fund-raiser for women candidates 
and now campaign manager for Kathleen Brown's race for state treasurer, said, 
"I'm not sure women are going to vote in droves for women. Now, for the first 
time, they may have a tendency to do that. But I don't know whether it will 
last. I wouldn't want to bet." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, "There is something that is different out there. People 
(women) come in and want to get involved. They want to give money. Trust me, 
it's like night and day." 
</P>
<P>
One difference, virtually every political activist agrees, is renewed tension 
over abortion rights after last summer's Supreme Court decision that gave 
states broad new power to regulate abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few moments in history when an issue becomes a litmus test," said 
Tabankin, asserting that abortion rights has become an issue upon which many 
women decisively measure politicians. "There's a feeling that 'no man is going 
to tell me how my body should function.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that when Brown campaigns before women's groups she invariably is 
asked to reiterate her support for abortion rights. "It's got nothing to do 
with being treasurer, but they want to know," Thomas said. "It's like, 'OK, now 
we can do business.' " 
</P>
<P>
"If women really are feeling a new surge to go to the polls in 1990, it was 
started by (abortion) choice," she said. "They've been awakened. They're 
personally threatened, no matter which side they are on." 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly," she continued, "women who have been in lower offices are now 
starting to run for very exciting offices. These women are political veterans 
who have learned how to raise money. They have percolated up at the same time 
that there's this awakening." 
</P>
<P>
In Feinstein's case, women voters seem to be supporting her more 
enthusiastically than are women political activists. Many activists, who tend 
to be more liberal than ordinary voters, have reservations about some of 
Feinstein's stands. They accuse her of being a latecomer on women's issues and 
are not satisfied with her positions on the environment and gay rights. Some 
are inclined to agree with the assertion of Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) 
that Van de Kamp "is the best feminist in the race." 
</P>
<P>
There also is private concern among some activists -- mainly those pushing 
other women candidates -- that there could be "too many" women on the November 
ballot. What would be the effect, say, on Kathleen Brown's prospects for 
treasurer if Feinstein were to win the gubernatorial nomination? Just how many 
women will the electorate vote for? A third Democratic woman, March Fong Eu, is 
virtually assured of renomination as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Three Republican women also are seeking nominations -- state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson of Newport Beach for lieutenant governor, Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores for secretary of state and former U.S. Treasurer 
Angela (Bay) Buchanan for treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the fate of Feinstein and other women candidates hinges on 
their ability -- and their opponents' -- to manipulate the old stereotypes, 
altering troublesome perceptions and cashing in on those that offer 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Stereotypes provide the basis for attitudes about a candidate until the voters 
get to know that candidate," observed Times Poll Director I. A. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate or false, the perceptions are political reality. They are shared by 
men and women alike and affect voter attitudes, the Times Poll found. They 
therefore help to shape campaign strategy, especially as it is played out in 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Feinstein personally wrote the words "tough and caring" into her 
first TV ad. It was a strategic move aimed at countering the negative 
perceptions of women as weaker leaders than men and softer on crime, while 
taking advantage of a positive stereotype that they are more compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's supporters insist that the "weaker sex" stereotype especially does 
not fit her. 
</P>
<P>
"She is real tough -- I mean real tough," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), a longtime backer who, nevertheless, has frequently tangled 
with the former mayor. "She doesn't back down. She thinks she knows what she 
knows. She's not pigheaded -- she can be persuaded with logic and merit -- but 
if she thinks she's right, you've got one tiger on your hands." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, a statewide survey of registered voters by the Times Poll in late 
March found that on the general perception of "toughness," Feinstein rated no 
better against Van de Kamp than women politicians collectively did when 
compared to men. And that was pretty low. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, however, Feinstein -- and women in general -- rated high when judged 
on "working hard," "caring" and "ethics." 
</P>
<P>
A big plus for women politicians in this era of political scandal is that they 
are perceived to be more honest than men, although one longtime politico who is 
a woman confided: "Off the record, I don't think we're any more honest than men 
are. We're human beings, and not any more ethical." 
</P>
<P>
But the public perception of women is that they are "ethically clean," noted 
Field of the California Poll. He theorized that in the voters' view "women 
haven't been in politics long enough to be accepting bribes." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the Times Poll asked voters of both parties in February which of the 
three major gubernatorial candidates they thought would "do the best job of 
improving ethics in government," Feinstein was chosen over Van de Kamp by 
nearly 4 to 1 and over Republican Sen. Pete Wilson by 3 to 2. Ironically, it is 
Van de Kamp who has carved out government ethics as a principal issue, deriding 
the state Capitol as a sleazy "swamp" and sponsoring a major ethics initiative 
for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Still, specific stereotypes about women and men can be overcome by individual 
candidates, as both Feinstein and Van de Kamp have shown. 
</P>
<P>
For example, although she is not perceived to be "tougher" generally than Van 
de Kamp, Feinstein has managed to surmount the perceptions of women as weaker 
leaders and softer on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in the Times Poll last month, Feinstein -- in contrast to women 
politicians generally -- rated well both on "leadership" and "law and order." 
Despite Van de Kamp being the state's chief law enforcement officer, Democratic 
voters were not certain which candidate would "do the best job handling the 
death penalty." If anything, they tended to think Feinstein would. 
</P>
<P>
"She's like the cops' pinup lady," quipped Speaker Brown in commenting on 
Feinstein's strong support for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Feinstein's strong advocacy of both the death penalty and abortion 
rights does place her in the mainstream of California voters, Democrats and 
Republicans alike. It is a potent combination of positions "that's tough to 
beat," pollster Lewis noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll found that 43% of Democratic voters both support capital 
punishment and "favor abortion." By contrast, only 14% of the Democrats oppose 
capital punishment and favor abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Just 7% of the Democratic voters share Van de Kamp's personal opposition to 
both capital punishment and abortion. Despite his personal views, the attorney 
general has pledged to carry out the death penalty and is a strong advocate of 
abortion rights. But many voters find this dichotomy of personal beliefs and 
public positions contradictory and confusing, Times surveys have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has been trying to capitalize on her opponent's vulnerability with 
fervent appeals to women voters. She argues that "the best keeper of the faith" 
for abortion rights "is a woman who is personally committed and pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
To women delegates at last weekend's state Democratic convention in Los 
Angeles, she asserted -- in a pointed jab at Van de Kamp -- that "leadership 
comes in different packages" and not necessarily in "an Oxford gray suit." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was cheered when she said, "Today, for the first time, a woman stands 
before you as a candidate for governor. . . . Let's make history." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp later characterized the appeal as blatant sexism. "I don't think 
it's appropriate to campaign before women on the basis of 'Vote for me, I'm a 
woman,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in interviewing voters last month, the Times Poll found that 61% of the 
women who support Feinstein support her "strongly." Among both sexes, 55% of 
Feinstein's backing is "strong," compared to just 43% of Van de Kamp's. 
</P>
<P>
By more than 2 to 1, Democratic voters chose Feinstein as the candidate who 
"would do the best job of handling the abortion issue." Men and women favor 
abortion rights about equally, the survey showed. But women consider the issue 
to be somewhat more important than men do in deciding who to support for 
governor. Additionally, women who favor abortion are more likely than men to 
abandon a candidate who opposes abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp scored points with voters last month by urging the state Department 
of Health Services to allow testing of the French abortion pill RU486, the 
Times survey showed. Democrats favor the pill by 5 to 3. And when they were 
asked whether Van de Kamp's position makes them "more likely" or "less likely" 
to vote for him, his stand resulted in a net 12-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general also has been able to take away from Feinstein one of the 
perceptions about women politicians that generally helps them, that they are 
good at shepherding the taxpayers' money. Van de Kamp has been attacking 
Feinstein for leaving behind a potential $180-million city deficit when she 
departed the mayor's office. In the end, a deficit was avoided when new Mayor 
Art Agnos took drastic fiscal measures. 
</P>
<P>
In the Times poll, women politicians scored significantly better against men 
than Feinstein did against Van de Kamp on the question of who is better at 
handling the taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
It has been risky, however, for Van de Kamp to attack Feinstein. "Nobody likes 
negative campaigning -- least of all men attacking women," pollster Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times survey found evidence of this. Half of those interviewed were asked 
whether they would be "more likely" or "less likely" to vote for a male 
candidate who attacked his female opponent. The other half were asked their 
probable reaction to a woman assailing a man. The result was that among 
Democratic voters, an attacking man stood to lose 15 points more than an 
attacking woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are more chary of attacking a woman than women are," said Barbara Johnson, 
Van de Kamp's campaign chairman. ". . . In running against a woman one has to 
be careful. Care has to be taken to run fair and square. You treat a woman with 
respect. You don't talk disrespectfully. You talk about her record." 
</P>
<P>
This has been precisely Van de Kamp's tack in criticizing Feinstein, Johnson 
insisted. "Women candidates can't have it both ways -- say they're equally 
strong and then cry foul when there's an attack on their record." 
</P>
<P>
And she added that Feinstein "should be careful, too. The advantageous part 
about being a woman (candidate) is that people believe you are caring and 
compassionate. But there's a danger of being seen as strident. That could turn 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler (R-Northridge) agreed. A tenacious politician who 
gave up her House seat to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1986, 
Fiedler said that women candidates must walk a narrow path. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a very fine line between being strong and effective and coming off 
bitchy," she said. "And a woman with a strong personality and presence has to 
be careful of that." 
</P>
<P>
Some people think Feinstein stepped over the line with her second TV commercial 
that seemed to compare Van de Kamp to Richard M. Nixon, subtly equating the 
attorney general's criticisms of her to Nixon's infamous red-baiting of another 
California woman, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in a U.S. Senate campaign 40 years 
ago. Ostensibly the purpose of the ad was to ask Van de Kamp to knock off the 
negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown, one of Feinstein's strongest supporters, said the TV ad was a 
bad idea. He explained: 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that you cannot successfully attack a woman. Women just aren't 
seen as sleaze yet. You can't do it; it doesn't work. And my guess is that if 
the public has that attitude about women, a woman doing it is really revolting 
because there's no credibility to do it. You really can't sling mud unless 
you're a mudder." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, which interviewed 1,667 registered voters by telephone, found 
that more than two-thirds of the electorate -- men and women alike -- think 
"women are discriminated against in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the women, but less than half the men, said that "women 
have too little influence on American life and politics." 
</P>
<P>
But less than half the women, and only a third of the men, said that electing 
more women to high office would "make government better." Three-fourths of both 
men and women predicted that the highest offices will remain mostly in male 
hands for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for the Times Poll, conducted March 23-28, was three 
percentage points in either direction for all the voters and five points for 
just the Democrats or Republicans.

U.S. REJECTS SOVIET PLAN FOR GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, showing increasing confidence that it can prevail 
without having to compromise, Wednesday rejected a Soviet plan that would 
require a reunified Germany to align itself with both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the plan "another formula 
for neutrality." 
</P>
<P>
The compromise was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
in an article published under his name in an independent magazine that focuses 
on international security issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very full and direct policy, which is that a unified Germany should 
be a part of NATO," Fitzwater said. "You can't get any clearer than that." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's policy toward German reunification has been marked by a sometimes 
disorderly retreat since late last summer, when the Cold War barriers between 
West Germany and East Germany began to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Soviets opposed any suggestion of reunification. When that policy 
appeared untenable, they said they could support unification if Germany became 
neutral and was demilitarized. Later, they dropped the insistence on neutrality 
but said Germany must not remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 
16-nation alliance created more than 40 years ago to defend the West against 
aggression from Josef Stalin's Soviet Union and its satellite states. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest variant, Shevardnadze suggested that Germany maintain membership 
in both NATO and the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact until a new security 
organization embracing the United States, Canada and all the countries of 
Europe could be created to replace both alliances. At present, West Germany is 
a member of NATO and East Germany is a member of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our experts . . . believe that the idea of 'dual membership' for 
Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the difficulties emerging now," 
Shevardnadze wrote in his article for the May issue of the magazine "NATO's 
Sixteen Nations." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the twists and turns of policy, however, Moscow has never yielded on 
its rejection of full and unfettered NATO membership for Germany. Shevardnadze 
told reporters in Washington last week that such an outcome would be 
"one-sided." He left little doubt that, regardless of the substantive merits of 
the issue, Moscow could not accept such a humiliating rebuff. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials have said that the Soviets really have no other choice. The 
seven-nation Warsaw Pact has almost disintegrated, with Poland, Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia now governed by non-Communist regimes. And the West German 
government, which is sure to be the dominant force in the reunification 
process, has made clear its preference to remain in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
The details of German reunification are due to be discussed by the foreign 
ministers of the two German states and the four World War II victors -- the 
United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. This meeting, dubbed the 
"two-plus-four" talks, is expected to be held late this month or early May. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that no decision has been 
made on the procedure for resolving conflicts if the six nations do not agree. 
Other officials have said that while every effort will be made to reach 
unanimity, disputes will have to be settled by majority vote. On German 
membership in NATO, these officials expect Moscow to be a minority of one. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a NATO spokesman joined Fitzwater in rejecting the Shevardnadze 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"All Western nations and some of the Eastern Bloc nations have told us that 
they believe a unified Germany should be part of NATO and that it would be a 
stabilizing factor for Germany and the region," Fitzwater said. "Full 
participation of Germany with the alliance is the best guarantee for long-term 
peace and stability in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Fitzwater was saying that a unified Germany, unfettered by 
membership in NATO, could be a danger to its neighbors, just as Germany was in 
1914 and in the 1930s. It has long been acknowledged that NATO serves two 
purposes: It deters the Soviet Union from attacking Western Europe and provides 
a larger international context for the German army.

NATASHA LEARNS TO BE HERSELF;

<P>
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 70 YEARS, SOVIET PRESCHOOLS HAVE PUT STRESS ON 
INDIVIDUALITY INSTEAD OF CONFORMING TO THE GROUP.

<P>
As the old turntable played a pre-revolutionary Russian folk song at Preschool 
No. 804, 5-year-old Natasha was doing something that once would have been 
strictly forbidden in a Soviet classroom. She wasn't dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Because she felt shy, Natasha was allowed to watch quietly as her classmates 
spun and twirled. Just a few years ago, her teacher would have been severely 
rebuked by Soviet school inspectors for allowing a child to sit out a communal 
activity for even a few moments during the average 12 hours per day of 
preschool. 
</P>
<P>
As the first formal contact between the child and the state, the country's 
nursery schools and kindergartens were long viewed as the place where the 
initial lessons of Communist collectivism were to be indelibly imprinted. From 
the shared playpen on, learning to be a member of a homogeneous community was 
the ideal. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time in 70 years here, the accent in preschool is on 
individualism, which can at last be recognized -- even appreciated and 
developed -- thanks to perestroika, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program to 
socially and economically redefine Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
Preschool No. 804 and a second school selected by the Ministry of Education for 
a reporter to visit seem without doubt to be model examples of the new 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
In many kindergartens in the Soviet Union, you can still find row upon row of 
identically drawn pictures of flowers or fruit taped to classroom walls -- the 
first introduction to the philosophy of Socialist Realism in art -- and some 
parents complain their children are permitted to go to the bathroom only with 
the group at scheduled times. 
</P>
<P>
The once-obligatory picture of Soviet founder V. I. Lenin still hangs at 
kindergartener-eye level in many classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the impact of perestroika on preschools is enormous and will have 
a lasting effect on Soviet society, educators here say. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the move toward valuing individuals, our human bouquet will be 
richer, more varied. People will have a chance to reach their full potential, 
and they will be more confident in questioning authority," said Leontiva M. 
Fydorovna, director of a Moscow pedagogical college that educates the preschool 
teachers of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
With the new stress on individuality, she added, "a return to a dictatorship 
like the one that existed under (Josef) Stalin grows far less likely." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet preschools, which are generally combined day care, nursery schools and 
kindergartens, enroll children from the age of 6 months up to 6 years. The 
preschools play such a key role in the Soviet Union's future because they are 
widely attended in this country, where most new mothers return quickly to work. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, for example, about 70% of the city's children attend preschool -- 
about half a million children in 2,760 schools, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the high enrollment is largely financial. Although maternity 
benefits were increased recently to two years with a token payment of 35 rubles 
per month ($56 at the official exchange rate), most families say they still 
cannot afford more than a year of maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
So in their most highly impressionable years, Soviet children are generally a 
captive audience for the lessons the state wants to teach. 
</P>
<P>
In Natasha's music class, those lessons clearly reflect modern times here. 
</P>
<P>
The spirited tune to which the children were learning to bow and dip, for 
instance, would have been forbidden in Soviet classrooms before 1985 because it 
was a Russian song popular among nobility before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, 
music teacher Alla S. Avakovya said. 
</P>
<P>
Another relative innovation: to help the preschoolers settle down, Avakovya put 
a classical record on the phonograph, turned off the lights, flipped on 
blinking colored lights and asked the children to think about nature. 
</P>
<P>
The music, lights and call on imagination represent a giant step forward here, 
Avakovya said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we followed absolutely strict methods," she recalled after the lesson. 
"For instance, the inspector told me once that the children must always be 
seated while singing, never standing. Such a light show would have gotten me 
into big trouble. But now we even get to listen to rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Across town in Preschool No. 1144, 5- and 6-year-olds were enjoying more 
variety in physical education class because of perestroika. Previously, the 
state suggested about 10 different exercises that the children did over and 
over all year, "no matter how bored the children and the teacher got," recalled 
Irina Y. Zvereva, the school's director. 
</P>
<P>
Now the teachers can switch exercises at will -- and even make up their own. On 
this day, the children, dressed in black body suits, were trying with varying 
degrees of success to bend and twist their bodies in time to piano 
accompaniment. They then bounced and tossed plastic balls. 
</P>
<P>
"They can use the balls every day if they want. Before, the state mandated just 
once a week," Zvereva said. 
</P>
<P>
Later the same class was instructed to make clay birds. Most of the birds had 
multicolored feathers and looked much the same. But one, made by 5-year-old 
Kostya, stood out -- it was polka-dotted. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this, children," said the teacher, holding it aloft. "Isn't it lovely 
and original?" 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva said that five years ago, teachers at Preschool No. 1144 treated 
children "just like little soldiers. All together they went to eat, to wash 
their hands, to go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
"The passive children were easily overlooked, all but forgotten. And the 
teachers themselves were afraid to vary even slightly from all the regulations 
we got," she said. "Now we are trying to appreciate each individual." 
</P>
<P>
Other changes: 
</P>
<P>
* Desks no longer have to be lined up neatly in straight rows. Sometimes they 
are arranged in circles or small groups. And some classrooms even have couches 
where children are allowed to lounge during story time. 
</P>
<P>
* There is less emphasis on sitting straight, keeping elbows off tables or 
standing when a teacher enters the room. "We are trying to teach our 
student-teachers the importance of being warm, and we have even introduced the 
concept of children's rights, which was greeted with great surprise," said Nina 
Volkava, a teacher at the pedagogical college for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
* There is even very tentative, discussion of religion, once the big taboo. "We 
can talk about religion as history now, not simply in the context of atheism. 
But about the concept of God, no -- that is still off limits," said Lydia 
Solnishniya, the director of Preschool No. 804. 
</P>
<P>
Fydorovna, director of the pedagogical school, said that now the focus is on 
trying to understand a child's behavior instead of simply molding it. "It's 
harder for the teachers. It was simpler just to give a single command to 
everyone," she noted. "But in the long run, we believe, it makes the children 
calmer, easier to handle." 
</P>
<P>
Not that there are no complaints about the Gorbachev era. The primary one is 
that schools are suffering from the same shortages that have afflicted most of 
the rest of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
At Preschool No. 804, teachers make or collect most of the toys, which are 
primarily brightly colored paper shapes, collages, knitted objects and even 
empty soap boxes and shampoo bottles. At other schools, some parents complain 
that teachers limit the amount of time children can play with toys to cut down 
on the chance of the scarce playthings being lost or broken. 
</P>
<P>
College instructor Volkava said the shortages affect the child from an early 
age. "If you have the feeling that someone can take the only toy you have, then 
you learn to protect yourself, not to share," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another major gripe among educators is that the pay for preschool teachers is 
so low that it fails to attract the best instructors and leads to chronic 
teacher shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Starting salary for a beginning preschool teacher who has graduated from an 
institute is 130 rubles a month ($208). The average Soviet salary is about 250 
rubles a month ($400). 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the teachers seem generally happy, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
"Before perestroika, it was not only the children's creativity that was 
limited. It was also the teachers,' " said preschool director Solnishniya. "The 
work may be harder, but it is also more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The children themselves have a sense that things are different, even if they 
aren't quite sure what. Six-year-old Andrei, a sandy-haired boy playing outside 
Preschool No. 804, had just a hint of uncertainty in his voice as he told a 
visitor what perestroika meant. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to help us turn our bad life into a good one," he said.

CUBAN ARRESTED IN 1976 SLAYING OF CHILE ENVOY

A Cuban exile suspected of being the triggerman in the 1976 Washington car 
bombing that killed former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and an aide was 
arrested early Wednesday by FBI agents in St. Petersburg, Fla., ending a 
12-year manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Dioniso Suarez y Esquivel, 51, described as a member of a New Jersey-based 
anti-Castro group that has long been accused of terrorist activity, had eluded 
arrest since 1978 when he and seven others were charged with first-degree 
murder and conspiracy in the mid-morning explosion that demolished Letelier's 
car as he was driving along Washington's Embassy Row. 
</P>
<P>
A used car salesman at the time, Suarez had come to Washington, helped purchase 
components for the bomb at several local hardware stores and then helped a 
Chilean intelligence agent and another Cuban assemble the bomb in a motel, 
according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The Chilean agent, a U.S. citizen who has since been arrested and served a 
prison sentence in the case, has told investigators he believes that Suarez 
activated the bomb as he trailed Letelier at Sheridan Circle. The other Cuban 
sought in the case, Virgilio Pablo Paz y Romero, remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The blast immediately killed Letelier, who served as the Chilean ambassador in 
Washington from 1970 to 1973 during the Marxist government of Salvador Allende, 
fatally injured Ronni Karpen Moffitt, a Letelier aide, and injured the aide's 
husband, Michael Moffitt, who was sitting in a rear seat. The bombing became a 
divisive wedge in U.S. relations with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose 
government refused to extradite several intelligence officers implicated in the 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials would not say what led them to the St. Petersburg house where 
agents found Suarez, who was known to his neighbors as "Jose Suarez," an 
unemployed painter. Also found at the house were his wife, Elizabeth, and their 
15-month-old son.

BUSH ISSUES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHINESE STUDENTS

President Bush on Wednesday issued the executive order he promised last 
November to protect Chinese students from deportation to their politically 
troubled homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Bush directed the attorney general to defer until Jan. 1, 1994, any deportation 
proceedings against Chinese nationals who were in the United States on or after 
June 5, 1989, and whose visas expire. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese students fear reprisals because they supported the pro-democracy 
movement that was crushed when the government sent in the army against the 
people in Beijing to end the occupation of Tian An Men Square last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of starting deportation proceedings, the government will notify Chinese 
nationals when their visas expire, under the order signed by Bush. The Chinese 
nationals also will have the right to seek jobs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A requirement that Chinese nationals must have valid passports will be waived. 
The government also will furnish documents to "facilitate travel across the 
borders of other nations and re-entry into the United States" for those whose 
passports expired. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had announced that he would protect the Chinese students who feared 
persecution after Beijing's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30, he vetoed legislation designed to extend visa protections to the 
Chinese nationals. But he said then that he would issue an executive order to 
guarantee that no one would be forced to return to China.

BRITAIN SEIZES HUGE GUN BARREL NEAR IRAQI SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
British customs officers said Wednesday that they found a huge gun barrel, 
capable of firing nuclear and chemical shells, waiting to be loaded onto an 
Iraqi-chartered ship. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the gun came two weeks after 40 nuclear trigger devices bound 
for Iraq were seized at London's Heathrow Airport. But a customs spokesman said 
there was no connection between the two investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The gun barrel, reported by Britain's Press Assn. news agency to be 130 feet 
long, was found during a search of a dock in Middlesbrough in northeastern 
England. Arms experts said such a gun could fire shells into the heart of 
Israel or Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency, monitored in London, denied that the seized equipment 
was for military purposes. It quoted a "senior Iraqi source" as saying the 
hardware consisted of steel pipes for a petrochemical project. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is widely thought to be developing nuclear weaponry although it denies it. 
Recently, President Saddam Hussein said Iraq has highly advanced chemical 
weapons, and he threatened to destroy half of Israel if it launched an attack. 
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests in connection with the gun shipment, but officers seized 
documents from two British companies thought to be involved in the gun's 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
The Press Assn. quoted customs officials as saying the gun barrel was in pieces 
packed in eight cases. The cases were reportedly found on the dockside waiting 
to be loaded onto a Bermuda-registered ship on charter to the Iraqi Maritime 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering the possibility that the gun was made to order in Britain 
for the Iraqis," a customs spokesman said. The spokesman refused to identify 
the two firms that were searched in connection with the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Ballistics experts said a gun with a 130-foot-long barrel would be able to fire 
a projectile several hundred miles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is capable of firing a nuclear shell which could easily hit Iran or any 
other Middle East trouble spot from Iraq," the customs spokesman said. "It is 
certainly the biggest gun barrel we have ever uncovered in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, NBC News, citing U.S. intelligence sources, said Iraq has 
developed deadly biological weapons, including those that induce anthrax, 
typhoid and cholera and that it has a germ warfare laboratory south of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC News report also said the Centers for Disease Control, a U.S. agency 
based in Atlanta, unwittingly added to Iraq's stockpile of viruses in 1985 when 
it sent three shipments of West Nile Fever virus to researchers in Iraq.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Satyan Man Rajbhandari, his arm in a sling and the rest of his body badly 
bruised, stood before two senior government ministers and nearly 100 of his 
fellow doctors Tuesday night and described what happened the night that 
democracy came to this remote Himalayan kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
After him came another doctor, and then another. And sitting there listening to 
all this, and to the cries of outrage that the accounts elicited, was King 
Birendra's interior minister, Nain Bahadur Swanr. 
</P>
<P>
It was an extraordinary display in a kingdom that has spent the last 30 years 
under repressive rule. Never had Nepalese confronted their rulers in such a 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's dramatic scene at the Nepal Medical Assn. was a taste of the future 
for this impoverished nation of 18 million as it struggles to join the ranks of 
new democracies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very dicey period," said one diplomat here. "It's precisely this 
mood of the doctors that adds to the uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about a bunch of wild-eyed radicals. These are highly 
educated professionals who were at the forefront of the pro-democracy movement. 
And if the king fails to move fast now with reforms, these people will be back 
in the streets and, the next time, the king may well not survive it." 
</P>
<P>
The doctors told one another Tuesday night of the horrors they had faced on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
It was just one hour after Birendra's historic announcement Sunday night 
declaring an end to the monarchy's monopoly on power, Rajbhandari recounted, 
that he received an emergency call that his brother had been shot. The brother 
had been among the throngs defying a curfew order to celebrate in the streets 
and was cut down by soldiers who had not yet heard of Nepal's new age of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I rushed from the hospital, but when I reached the spot where my brother lay, 
the police pulled me out of the ambulance, forced me to lie face-down on the 
street and then kicked and beat me into unconsciousness," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shame! Shame!" the roomful of doctors shouted angrily in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bharat Pradhan, head of Bir Hospital's emergency room, told how he drove a 
second ambulance to rescue his fallen colleague, only to be turned back by 
soldiers who threatened to kill him if he tried to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Dr. Lok Bikram Thapa, the hospital's chief surgeon, told the huge 
gathering about his telephone call to Swanr, now seated just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"I appealed to the minister to order his police to allow our doctors through, 
but the minister told me: 'You just shut up. You doctors are all troublemakers, 
and if you don't stop your foolishness, I'll send the police to shoot you all 
and burn down your hospital.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Murderer! Murderer!" the doctors screamed at the minister seated before them. 
"Fire the bastard." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Swanr stood up to defend himself, spending 15 minutes pleading for 
forgiveness. But it was clear that the elation of the Nepalese over their 
new-found democracy is not as powerful an emotion as their rage. When the 
minister had left the room, the doctors voted overwhelmingly to reject his 
apology. On Wednesday, they demanded that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the world watched hundreds of thousands of Nepalese dance, 
chant and sing in the streets, the king's four handpicked Cabinet ministers 
have been locked in intensive negotiations with the leaders of the country's 
now-legal political parties. Their goal is to create a tripartite interim 
government that will amend the constitution and schedule national elections. 
</P>
<P>
But infighting has begun among the opposition parties that led the eight-week 
protest movement, a disparate coalition of seven Communist parties and the 
centrist Nepali Congress Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist leaders are demanding that the king dissolve the rubber-stamp 
National Assembly before they will join an interim Cabinet, while some Congress 
Party leaders privately have indicated that they will join without any 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are further hampered by a deep mistrust of the palace among 
political leaders who were jailed for years after Birendra's father outlawed 
party politics in a 1960 palace coup. 
</P>
<P>
There is also sharp disagreement among the three factions about how to punish 
the corrupt and abusive members of the hard-line Cabinet that Birendra fired a 
week ago in a desperate bid to defuse the crisis. Loud chants calling for 
former Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha to be hanged filled Katmandu's 
streets during Monday's massive democracy celebration, indicating the depth of 
sentiment for revenge. He had ordered police to open fire on demonstrators 
during weeks of protest. 
</P>
<P>
But senior government officials and independent analysts say that any extensive 
investigation into public corruption and abuse of power would lead directly to 
the king's palace, which is believed by most Nepalese to have been the real 
power behind the appointed council of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with several senior Nepalese officials, it was clear that the 
palace knows it has moved only halfway toward full democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all aware, including the king himself, that this is going to be a very 
turbulent transition," the newly appointed foreign minister, Pashupati Shamsher 
Rana, said in an interview Tuesday. "We are also aware that we have to 
re-establish a lot of trust, and we have to restore the credibility of the 
crown. But, clearly, the king has taken a very major decision. It is a major 
shift in direction, so there is really no going back on that now." 
</P>
<P>
It is equally clear, though, that the image of the king, a symbol of Nepalese 
nationalism needed to protect the country's sovereignty from Indian influence, 
has suffered badly during the eight weeks of pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
The king, and to a greater extent, his wife, Queen Ratna, have been derided as 
thieves or worse in slogans chanted in the streets. Nepalese from all walks of 
life now believe that the queen and her family secretly have been running the 
country from behind the king's robes for the past two years. Posters throughout 
the city picture the king's mouth closed with a zipper held shut by a small 
queen. 
</P>
<P>
"The people themselves are trying to isolate the blame on the queen, in part 
because everyone knows the monarchy is a necessary foil against interference 
from our big southern neighbor," said a senior government official who asked 
not to be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons to help explain the level of popular outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 90% of the population in Katmandu believes that the queen and her 
family have stolen millions from the country," said a primary school teacher 
who identified himself only as "a true democrat" at Monday's celebration rally. 
"But we also blame the king for creating an entire cult of corruption 
throughout our society." 
</P>
<P>
However, the anger of the doctors, nurses and other medical professionals in 
the capital is rooted in more than palace scandals and rumors of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of removing bullets, stitching up the gashes caused by riot sticks 
and watching patients die as a result of the government's policy since February 
of meeting protest with force, the hospital staffs organized their own 
protests, which many analysts cited as the turning point for the pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Their anger reached fever pitch Friday when police gunned down scores of 
unarmed demonstrators as they began marching toward the palace gates. Several 
government sources said that huge demonstration convinced the king that he was 
politically cornered. 
</P>
<P>
But the bloodshed also convinced the doctors at Bir Hospital that much more is 
needed than the king's brief announcement Sunday legalizing political parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We have only come halfway -- in fact, not even halfway," said a doctor in the 
hospital staff room Tuesday. "Something has begun, and the people are waiting 
to see where it will go, but no one is satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Another doctor added, "The world will forget what has come before here in 
Nepal. It is always that way. But we will not allow the Nepalese to forget." 
</P>

PARATROOPER CHARGED IN MAN'S DEATH IN PANAMA

In a criminal action arising out of the invasion of Panama, a decorated Army 
paratrooper has been charged with murdering an unidentified Panamanian man and 
assaulting three others, military officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
First Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, a 42-year-old career soldier of the 82nd 
Airborne Division, was accused of fatally shooting a prisoner who was captured 
Dec. 23 after a grenade was thrown from a car filled with Panamanians, killing 
one of Bryan's men. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged slaying followed a shoot-out in which several occupants of the car, 
all in civilian clothes, were killed and at least two men were arrested in the 
incident at a checkpoint, according to Army sources. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan, a native of Panama, also is charged with three counts of aggravated 
assault for allegedly hitting two Panamanians with the butt of his M-16 assault 
rifle on Dec. 20 -- the day that U.S. forces swept at dawn into Panama -- and 
whipping a third man with a section of rubber hose Dec. 21, said Army Maj. Joe 
Padilla, a Pentagon spokesman. In the invasion-day incidents, Bryan is charged 
with hitting one man on the head with the M-16 and smashing another man on the 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Bryan stemmed from a probe by the U.S. Army Criminal 
Investigation Command. The Army command reportedly is investigating 20 other 
incidents of serious misconduct during and after the Panama invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials would not comment on the status of those ongoing 
investigations, including one into the possibly accidental shooting of a 
civilian as two U.S. soldiers fled a Panama City brothel without paying. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan has been appointed a military lawyer. He is not being ordered confined at 
Ft. Bragg, N.C., the 82nd Airborne's base, said Maj. Ned Ennis, a spokesman 
there. Ennis added that Bryan has been relieved of duty and is spending time 
"crafting his defense." 
</P>
<P>
The charges are expected to be referred to an investigating officer, who will 
recommend whether the case should be forwarded to Maj. Gen. James H. Johnson 
Jr., commander of the 82nd Airborne, who will decide whether to convene a 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the maximum penalty for 
premeditated murder is death or life imprisonment, dishonorable discharge, 
forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction in rank.

Ann Richards, who won the Democratic nomination in a "mudslide," and Republican 
Clayton W. Williams Jr., still stinging from criticism after a joke about rape, 
promised to stick to issues as they competed in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Clayton Williams and I will work very hard to keep this an ideological 
campaign where we really do focus on the issues, because we do have 
disagreements on the issues," Richards said after defeating state Atty. Gen. 
Jim Mattox in Tuesday's down-and-dirty primary runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who earlier voiced reluctance about running against a woman, said: 
"The rehash of the Democratic campaign is of no interest to me. Read my lips: 
No more mud." 
</P>
<P>
There was little discussion of issues in the runoff, in which Mattox alleged 
Richards, a recovering alcoholic, used illegal drugs, including cocaine, 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters didn't care about that issue as deeply as I do, or as deeply as I 
thought they did," Mattox, who had called the runoff a referendum on the drug 
question, said Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the issue of whether she has used illegal drugs "was put to rest" 
after her overwhelming runoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, 56, now state treasurer, accused Mattox, 46, of profiting from public 
service and challenged him to release his income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Richards handed Mattox his first major political defeat in 18 years, rolling up 
639,126 votes, or 57%, to Mattox's 479,384, or 43%, in unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox said Wednesday that he was defeated because of a growing trend of women 
being elected to higher office regardless of their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Voters' attention was taken off the runoff when Williams, a rancher and oilman 
in Midland, told reporters during his spring cattle roundup that bad weather 
was like rape -- if it's inevitable, "relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 58, who has never run for political office, apologized for the 
comment, but Richards said it illustrated his inexperience in public life. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox and his supporters say they will forget the runoff mudslinging and rally 
behind Richards. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to send a sincere congratulations to Ann Richards," Mattox said. "I 
will be ready to help her up and down the state against the common enemy, and 
the common enemy is Clayton Williams."

The captain and co-pilot of a USAir jetliner that crashed at La Guardia Airport 
last year can fly again if they pass recertification tests, the pilots and the 
Federal Aviation Administration have agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA had revoked the captain's license of Capt. Michael Martin and suspended 
the license of co-pilot Constantine Kleissas, who was at the controls before 
their Boeing 737 slid off a runway Sept. 20, killing two. 
</P>
<P>
Both agreed to drop their appeals of the FAA's action, meaning they can apply 
for recertification sooner than they could have otherwise, an FAA spokeswoman 
said Tuesday.

SUNSHINE FROM CANADA BRIGHTENS LIVES AT DISNEYLAND

About 70 Canadian children smiled impatiently as photographers scrambled to 
take their pictures Wednesday in front of the Disneyland train depot. The 
children, who had just gotten off a 2 1/2-hour flight, were getting antsy as a 
park photographer took one more snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
That final click of the camera was like the starting shot of a race. The kids 
were off, with just six hours to have the time of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
All of the children -- ranging from 8 to 17 -- suffer from severe handicaps or 
life-threatening illnesses. And for most of them, just flying on a plane or 
coming to California was a brand-new experience. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty members of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, along with four 
officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who had traveled to Southern 
California ahead of time, greeted the youngsters as they arrived at John Wayne 
Airport on Wednesday morning. The children, who were scheduled to return to 
Canada that night, were paired with an officer for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old Daniel Allard of Vancouver disembarked and shook hands with 
Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates and an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, but he had only one thing on his mind: getting to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see Space Mountain," he said anxiously. Asked if there was anything 
else he wanted to see, he said again, "I want to see Space Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
The visit was organized by the Sunshine Foundation of Canada, which helps 
severely handicapped and ill children. Ed Czach, an organizer of the visit, 
said he helped form the Canadian chapter after his 15-year-old son died of 
muscular dystrophy in 1985. Since then, the group has visited Walt Disney World 
in Florida several times, but this was the first visit to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the children suffer from cystic fibrosis and spina bifida, diseases 
that have confined them to wheelchairs. Others have life-threatening diseases 
such as cancer and hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Whitman, 15, who is in a wheelchair, said his disability wasn't going to 
stop him from going on Splash Mountain and Space Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, he conceded, was one he never thought he'd be making. "My mom said, 
'You're going to Disneyland,' and I said 'No way.' I really didn't think I'd 
end up making it. My parents kept on saying 'We'll go someday.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Luke Thomas, who is confined to a wheelchair, rattled off a list 
of rides he planned to go on, including Space Mountain and Pirates of the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really exciting," the Vancouver boy said as he snapped pictures with a 
disposable camera. "I'm really happy." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's personnel, ranging from deputies and clerical workers, helped the 
children make their way around the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though cops are kind of cynical, what better thing can you do but give 
them a day at Disneyland?" said Sheriff's Capt. Tim Simon.

COUNCIL TOOK THE PRAGMATIC APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As much as the City Council members wanted Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg to go, 
they had some pragmatic reasons for keeping him around on a lucrative $50,000 
consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said Wednesday that much of the treasurer's office policies, 
procedures and history are carried only in Rittenberg's head and the city needs 
to get it all down on paper before he leaves for good. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only one who knows where the bodies are buried," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee that oversees the 
treasurer's office. "One of his great weaknesses -- and what finally got 
Leonard into trouble -- is that rules were never reduced to writing." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Wednesday to accept a settlement allowing Rittenberg to 
resign rather than to be fired for his role in a scandal involving the mayor 
and a downtown bank. 
</P>
<P>
But even as council members agreed that Rittenberg had to leave after 2 1/2 
years at the helm, some council members said they still respect his talents as 
a prudent investor of a $2-billion portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"As troubled as his office has been, he has an expertise that cannot be 
ignored," said Yaroslavsky. Councilman Richard Alatorre, vice chairman of the 
council's Revenue Committee, added, "He's been there 22 years, he's got 
something to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement approved by the council on Wednesday, Rittenberg will 
retire June 1 and be paid $50,000 as a consultant for the remaining six months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But while Rittenberg was respected as a technician, he was condemned as a poor 
manager who allowed the department to fall into disarray -- particularly during 
the scandal over an investment he made in a bank that had employed the mayor. 
Rittenberg invested $2 million in Far East National Bank in March, 1989, after 
receiving a phone call from Mayor Tom Bradley. Rittenberg has steadfastedly 
denied that the mayor tried to influence him. 
</P>
<P>
"From a pragmatic point of view, we wanted him out as soon as possible," said 
one council member who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He was a negative 
influence" in the department as local and federal investigations demanded more 
and more of his time and the loyalty of his staff was strained. 
</P>
<P>
Firing Rittenberg could have resulted in Civil Service Commission appeals 
lasting up to a year and costing the city many thousands of dollars in legal 
fees, city officials said. During that time, Yaroslavsky said, the city would 
have been required to pay Rittenberg his regular salary of $83,415 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the firing could have resulted in litigation costing the city 
still more, according to council members. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, council members said, settlement guaranteed a swift and 
amicable exit for Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg joined the treasurer's office in 1968 as an accountant and steadily 
rose in the department to become chief deputy in 1981 and then was named acting 
treasurer in 1986 when former Treasurer Robert Odell became ill. Odell died in 
1987 without returning to the job and Rittenberg was appointed treasurer by 
Bradley in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to clean house and restore confidence in that office," said Alatorre. 
"We do know that absenteeism is high and morale is low." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said, "We have an office besieged and beleaguered by scandal and 
preoccupied with defending itself." 
</P>
<P>
Since the scandal first erupted in the weeks before Bradley's close victory for 
a record fifth term as mayor in April, 1989, Rittenberg and his senior deputies 
told conflicting stories about how the $2 million came to be invested in Far 
East National Bank. They openly disagreed on who was responsible for the 
attempted cover-up of the transaction -- including the infamous obliteration of 
a reference "per the mayor" on one document. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the investigations, cash management officer Bill Hoss retired 
without returning to the office, and a senior investment officer, George 
Sehlmeyer, was out on leave for five months, before returning to the office 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the ouster of Rittenberg is only one of many changes 
necessary to restore credibility to the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The office needs more than just a new treasurer, it needs a new attitude, it 
needs a housecleaning," said Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members privately questioned whether the return on the city's 
investments -- which can run into the tens of millions of dollars annually -- 
has suffered during the last year as a result of the tumult in Rittenberg's 
office. Yaroslavsky said he will ask the council on Tuesday to approve a 90-day 
extension of a program in which the chief administrative officer provides daily 
oversight of the treasurer's office to ensure that council-approved policies 
and procedures are followed. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, there was one other overriding factor in the council's decision: 
Most members of the council like Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He is seen by council members and many city bureaucrats as a "nice guy" -- 
serious but approachable, easy to work with and genuine. He is seen as a 
lifetime civil servant who worked hard and got ahead -- only to fall victim to 
circumstance and his own, perhaps momentary, bad judgment.

MAN WHO FOUGHT RAIDER DEAL IS ELECTED IN IRWINDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederick Barbosa, best known as the man who tried to stop Irwindale from 
landing the Los Angeles Raiders, felt vindicated on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thought to be a dark-horse candidate, Barbosa swept into office on a wave of 
public disillusionment over Irwindale's failed bid for the professional 
football team, winning one of three open City Council seats in the tiny San 
Gabriel Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
The barrel-chested engineer's election was a shock to some candidates, the 
mayor, and even Barbosa himself. Barbosa, who sued Irwindale in 1987 and 
effectively held the Raider deal hostage for more than a year, had expected to 
be heckled and harassed by voters while going door-to-door with campaign flyers 
and buttons. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleasantly surprised," a smiling Barbosa said Wednesday after returns 
showed he had captured the second-highest number of votes, outpolling 16-year 
incumbent Joseph Breceda. "When it looked like I was elected, I thought, 'Whoa! 
We're moving in the right direction.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect him to come out like he did," Breceda said. "Maybe he's right, 
about what he's been saying about the Raiders. Maybe I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
To no one's surprise, one of Barbosa's priorities will be to recover the $10 
million in good-faith money that Irwindale surrendered to Raider owner Al 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa also pledged sweeping changes at City Hall, including the removal of 
Raider deal-maker Charles Martin from two of his three posts as city manager, 
city attorney and city clerk -- all of which he has held for 23 years. Martin, 
66, who had indefinitely postponed his retirement three years ago so he could 
work on the Raider deal, said he will reveal his plans next week. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Barbosa was the only Irwindale resident to be named as a 
plaintiff in two lawsuits that sought to dismantle the Raider stadium project 
three years ago. The first, filed by Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi and a group called Irate Irwindale Residents Advocating the 
Environment, resulted in a court injunction barring the city from negotiating 
with the Raiders until it completed an environmental impact report on the 
proposed stadium. The report took more than a year to finish. 
</P>
<P>
The second suit, filed by Barbosa and the same group, is still pending. It 
claims the $10 million was an illegal gift of public money and seeks to 
invalidate the agreement between the Raiders and Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa filed suit at a time when Irwindale residents were still ecstatic about 
the Raiders. Restaurants and businesses sprouted up along Irwindale Avenue, the 
main thoroughfare of the rapidly industrializing city. Black and silver 
T-shirts sporting a homemade "Irwindale Raiders" logo were sold by the dozens. 
And the local watering hole, the Rapscallion Seafood House &amp; Bar, threw a 
party to welcome the team. 
</P>
<P>
Public enthusiasm dwindled when the deal ran into trouble. The city's chief 
negotiator, redevelopment consultant Frederick P. Lyte, was fired in 1988 after 
a falling-out with then-Mayor Patricio Miranda. There were problems with the 
proposed stadium site, a gravel pit west of the 605 Freeway; glitches developed 
in a financing package; and other cities -- Oakland, Sacramento, Los Angeles -- 
waved meatier offers at Davis. Finally, Irwindale was out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Residents weren't angry enough, however, to sweep two other incumbents from 
office. Robert Diaz and Miranda were easily reelected. 
</P>
<P>
But the voice of discontent, the man who would not be silent, became an 
overnight champion for the disenchanted of Irwindale who believe their city was 
snookered. 
</P>
<P>
A descendant of Irwindale's first settlers and the son of Henry Barbosa, a 
former councilman, and Margaret Barbosa, a former city clerk, Barbosa never 
thought he would run for public office. "I didn't want to get involved in 
politics," he said. "But it came to the point where I had to stand up and be 
counted, or shut up. That's why I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa sees his victory as more than just a statement against the Raider deal. 
"I guess people wanted a change," he said.

SINGLETON ARRESTED ON PETTY THEFT CHARGE IN FLORIDA

<P>
Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a 15-year-old California hitchhiker and 
hacking off her forearms, faced a Florida charge Wednesday of trying to steal a 
$10 disposable camera from a drugstore, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, 62, was arrested Sunday in suburban Tampa, but was released with a 
notice to appear in court May 2 on a misdemeanor charge of petty theft, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard at a store in Brandon spotted him taking a $9.98 disposable 
camera, according to a sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton was convicted of raping runaway Mary Vincent, cutting off her 
forearms with an ax, then leaving her for dead in 1978. Singleton was freed in 
1987 after serving eight years and four months of a 14-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He attempted to settle in several California communities after his release, but 
public outrage over his release forced authorities to keep moving him for his 
own protection. He wound up in the Tampa area a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton told deputies he lives at his sister's house in eastern Hillsborough 
County. A woman who answered the telephone there said Singleton stays 
alternately with his sister and his brother, who lives in northwest Tampa. The 
brother refused to comment.

Jim Landis is not an activist by trade. But since December, when his 
18-month-old son nearly drowned in the family's back-yard pool, Landis has 
compiled page upon page of statistics on toddler drownings. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you know that a residential swimming pool is 14 times more likely to cause 
a death than a single automobile?" Landis asked, pulling out pages of 
statistics from his beat-up folder of papers and notes. 
</P>
<P>
He lists more: In 1988, drowning was the leading cause of death for children 
between the ages of 1 and 4, nearly 90% of whom wandered into the pools of a 
family member. For every fatal drowning, there are 10 more children who are 
hospitalized, between 5% and 20% of whom suffer severe brain damage. Boys 
account for 78% of all childhood drowning deaths. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his crusade, Landis has taken it upon himself to educate Orange 
County about the dangers of back-yard pools. He has consulted with experts, 
attended a national conference on childhood injuries and spoken in front of a 
Newport Beach City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"After I recovered emotionally from this whole thing, then I realized how many 
other people there must be in Orange County that are just exactly like me -- 
got a swimming pool, got a child, you're working, you're busy, you turn your 
head for a second, bingo, they're gone," Landis said. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole pitch to the City Council a couple of nights ago was that there are 
things you can do to put up barriers, to help protect the children from falling 
in. It's a preventable accident, that's the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Landis asked the City Council to adopt a swimming pool code 
that would be the most restrictive in California with regard to fencing and 
child-barrier requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Landis' proposal was tabled, but city officials asked him to discuss his 
suggestions with the city building director. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach was the first city he approached with the proposal. Through his 
newly formed organization, the Children's Pool Safety Assn., Landis hopes to 
carry his message throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"To think of those two kids, that blows my mind," he said, after hearing about 
Wednesday's accident in Fullerton, in which the youngsters, ages 3 and 5, 
nearly drowned in a pool. The 5-year-old girl reportedly is suffering from 
brain damage. "I mean, I knew this was going to happen. I've just been in a 
race to get this whole thing together." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent pool accidents, Landis said one of the most effective steps a family 
can take is to erect isolation fencing, which completely surrounds a pool. 
</P>
<P>
All doors from a house or garage to the back yard should be equipped with 
self-closing and self-locking mechanisms, he said. Other preventive measures 
include pool covers that are snapped down and alarms that go off when something 
falls into the pool or when a door has been opened from the house. 
</P>
<P>
Landis also believes that a every pool owner who has children living at home 
should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
The most restrictive legislation approved in the state has been in Contra Costa 
County in Northern California. That ordinance requires isolation fencing on all 
pools except where pool covers, alarms or self-latching, self-closing doors are 
installed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Landis maintains that many pool owners, once informed about the frequency of 
injuries, would install the protective devices recommended by experts. But the 
best way to institutionalize such measures, he said, is through local and state 
lawmakers.

PARTYING ARTISTS PUT ON 'PROBATION' BY LAGUNA FESTIVAL

<P>
On the closing day of the Festival of Arts last summer, artist Jorg Dubin 
flipped on "Jailhouse Rock," lit the charcoal near his booth and held an "Elvis 
Presley Memorial Barbecue." 
</P>
<P>
Dubin had removed most of his artwork from the booth except the centerpiece: an 
Elvis Presley shrine, complete with candles, an offerings plate and a kneeling 
pad. 
</P>
<P>
But the artist's "tongue in cheek" activities that day landed him in trouble 
with the festival's board of directors. In January, Dubin said, the board asked 
him to not participate in this summer's show, saying he broke the rules by 
partying on the grounds and by removing his artworks before the festival 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Then the board rescinded that decision and placed Dubin on probation for three 
years. Five other artists who attended the Elvis party received probation 
periods of one year. 
</P>
<P>
Dubin believes the board's action was intended to discourage displays such as 
the Elvis shrine. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel the festival isn't a place that wants that kind of artwork," Dubin 
said. "They want things that don't create controversy." 
</P>
<P>
So Dubin and the other five artists, who have been dubbed the "Festival Six," 
have hired a lawyer to represent them in further discussions with the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt they had totally overreacted," Dubin said of the board. "Some people 
took (the final day's events) kind of seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The festival board is declining comment on the situation, spokeswoman Sally 
Reeve said. But one board member, who emphasized that he was not speaking for 
the board, said the probation was imposed because of the artists' behavior, not 
the artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make judgments on the art that appears in the festival," board member 
David Young said. "I think they built a molehill into a mountain, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff LeFevre, one of the five artists placed on probation, remains puzzled 
about the entire situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just six out of about 50 to 70 other people" celebrating that day, 
LeFevre said. "My theory was, we were the first six there at the beginning of 
the day. . . . It's really quite a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Eva-Marie Boyd was hired by Dubin, LeFevre and artists Randy Bader, 
Chris Hoy, Scott Moore and David Sabaroff. 
</P>
<P>
Dubin said he will sit out this summer's festival. Boyd said the artists want 
their probation lifted or want a more specific explanation of what it means to 
be on probation. Letters to the artists cited "flagrant violation of ground 
rules" including having alcohol and a radio at the booth as the reason for 
probation, she said, but the conditions of probation were not specified. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hoping for a more egalitarian approach," Boyd said of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that if the artists want to know what probation means, they should 
"go look it up in the dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
"It means they are going to be watched fairly carefully so that it doesn't 
happen again," Young said.

CUSTOMS STRIKES GOLD (AND CASH) SMUGGLED ON JET; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES: AGENTS BOARD 'HIGH-RISK FLIGHT' TO CITE 28 VIETNAMESE-AMERICANS, 
SEVEN FROM ORANGE COUNTY. MORE THAN $225,000 BELIEVED BOUND FOR RELATIVES IN 
VIETNAM IS SEIZED.

<P>
More than two dozen Vietnamese-Americans, including seven from Orange County, 
who allegedly attempted to smuggle more than $250,000 in cash and gold out of 
the United States face stiff fines for violating Customs regulations, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents seized the gold and cash Sunday at Los Angeles International 
Airport as 28 Vietnamese-Americans were about to board a Philippine Airlines 
jet bound for Manila. Investigators believe they were scheduled to take a 
connecting flight to Vietnam, said John Miller, public information officer for 
the Customs Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said the number of seizures of Vietnam-bound gold and cash 
has risen sharply in recent months and that Sunday's operation was part of the 
agency's policy of investigating "high-risk flights" in which large numbers of 
Vietnamese-Americans are booked on flights to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that at least $90 million in cash, gold and property is 
shipped to Vietnam annually -- much of it in violation of strict federal laws 
that severely limit the amount of cash and goods that can be exported to the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, customs officials report, more than $600,000 in cash and gold 
has been seized on the West Coast alone. Much of the money was being shipped by 
refugees to their families in Vietnam, although there is a debate now raging in 
the Orange County Vietnamese community over how beneficial such aid is. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, authorities discovered $220,000 in cash, $3,240 in gold coins and 
$2,280 in gold bars in the suitcases and bags of the 28 people. 
</P>
<P>
Xuan Thi Nguyen, 34, of San Diego, was arrested at the airport and charged with 
making false statements to Customs officers and failure to report exported 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was carrying $52,430 and $1,600 in gold bars, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of how much cash and gold the seven Orange County residents are 
accused of trying to smuggle was not available. 
</P>
<P>
The other 27 suspects, who were not identified, were cited for various 
violations of Customs regulations and released. The seven from Orange County 
were each cited for exceeding the $100-per-family monthly limit Customs 
regulations placed on exporting cash to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
A Customs fines officer will determine what punishment the accused violators 
receive, Miller said. Often, the officer orders that Customs keep the money and 
property seized, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials are continuing to investigate whether the 28 people were 
working as a group and whether any of them is a professional money runner hired 
to make the trip to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Customs operation was one of a growing number of "periodic checks" the 
Customs Service makes on passengers it believes are headed to Vietnam, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Customs Service does investigate high-risk flights," Miller said. 
"Usually, this is for drug money, but we also do it for export control . . . as 
in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Sending money to family member in Vietnam has been a common practice since the 
fall of Saigon in 1975. Last fall, the Customs Service held a town hall meeting 
in Orange County designed to explain Customs laws and regulations to the 
Vietnamese community, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, for reasons Customs officials cannot explain, the number of 
seizures of Vietnam-bound cash has increased over the last four months -- not 
just in Southern California but in San Francisco and San Jose as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone out here is trying to help family that's still over there," said 
Marcus Frank, a Westminster police detective who specializes in Vietnamese 
affairs. "This is a widespread practice." 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese-Americans who cannot make the trip themselves rely on 
professional money runners to get cash and gold to family members, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a growing controversy within the Vietnamese community over 
whether the aid is only serving to prop up the Communist regime in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Frank estimated that the Vietnamese government takes up to a 30% cut in cash 
that enters the country. 
</P>
<P>
Gold is also a popular item for export to Vietnam because it receives a high 
price on the black market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of money (being sent to Vietnam) is way in excess of what a family 
needs to get by," Frank said. "Many people see the money as continuing to 
prolong the Communist government."

FRIENDS SAY VICTIM TRIED TO CHANGE LIFE

<P>
A 21-year-old Santa Ana man, gunned down on a street corner while holding the 
hand of a 4-year-old girl, was described by friends Wednesday as a man trying 
to pull his life together to please his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Julian Gonzalez was walking with the girl and her aunt to a nearby store 
Tuesday evening when the girl's aunt started walking back to the house to get 
money. It was then, police said, that a man jumped out of a passing car, ran up 
to Gonzalez and shot him in the neck and chest as the 4-year-old looked on. 
Investigators say the shooting may be gang-related, but no arrests have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant sped away in a green car believed to be a late 1960s or early 
1970s GM model. Police said they are not sure if the gunman was in the car 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 6:20 p.m. on the southwest corner of Myrtle and 
Baker streets. Gonzalez, who police said was a known gang member, had been 
helping friends paint and move out of their Baker Street house where the 
4-year-old lived. The mother of the girl, Ofelia Hernandez, 26, said she had 
known Gonzalez for two years and recounted how she learned of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept screaming, 'They killed Martin! They killed Martin!' " Hernandez 
quoted her daughter as saying. "I ran to her. Martin was already down. He was 
on his way to the dairy around the corner to buy milk for my little girl and 
sodas for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to get along with everybody in this house. He offered to help us clean 
out our house and paint it because we are moving from here. I wanted to pay 
him, but he would not take the money." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez described Gonzalez as a helpful man who wanted to straighten out his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a job and went out a lot. I asked him to start acting like a 
grown man and stop worrying his mother so much," Hernandez said. "He said that 
he was going to get a job. He was going to try to be a good son for his 
mother." 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Vargas, 33, who was at Hernandez's house when Gonzalez was shot, said 
the gunman "fired three times. It was at close range. All the neighbors came 
out of their houses." LUZ VILLARREAL

MAYOR PLANS TO QUIT, BUY HOME IN IRVINE

<P>
Stanton Mayor Paul G. Verellen has revealed he intends to step down from office 
in June and move to Irvine, where he might run for an elected post. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision to make," Verellen told the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he might remain in Stanton if he does not close a deal on a 
house he is trying to purchase in the Deerfield area of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Verellen, an executive at McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, was appointed to the 
council in May, 1986. He sought reelection the following November, and became 
mayor last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives have changed dramatically," said Verellen, whose family has grown by 
two children during his tenure in Stanton. "We had to look at our own future. 
I'd like to spend some time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
But he did not rule out running again for public office if the house purchase 
closes and the family does indeed move to Irvine. He would not specify whether 
he was eyeing any particular political post or when he might run. 
</P>
<P>
Verellen is expected to be succeeded in Stanton by Mayor Pro Tem David Shawver. 
Council members rotate positions among themselves every year in a largely 
symbolic move, while the day-to-day city business is handled by the city 
manager.CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

CHURCH CAN'T MOVE NEXT TO 'CRASH ZONE'

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing safety as its main concern, the City Council this week turned down a 
request by a local church that it be allowed to move next to a military 
runway's "crash zone". 
</P>
<P>
The 900-member Grace Church wanted to convert two vacant industrial buildings 
into a fellowship hall, sanctuary and Sunday school classrooms on the southern 
tip of Winners Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The property -- owned by Los Caballeros Center, a retail-development company -- 
lies directly outside the Armed Forces Reserve Center crash zone, an area 
extending 1,500 feet on either side of a runway's center line. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not comfortable putting men, women and children in harm's way," 
Councilman Anthony Selvaggi said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue had led to sometimes-bitter confrontations among the council members, 
property owners and church officials. During one such exchange, the owners 
accused the council of "fabricating" the safety issue to gloss over the 
economic impact of allowing a church, instead of a business, to move to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the property owners and church officials were muddying the 
safety issue by bringing up civil rights and religious freedom. The church 
needed the council's approval of a conditional use permit because the property 
is zoned for light industrial use. The city Planning Commission had already 
denied the church's request.KATHIE BOZANICH and JOHN PENNER

CARPET PULLS RUG OUT FROM LIBRARY PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reopening of the Garden Grove Regional Library, closed since December for 
refurbishing, has been delayed once again until early or mid-June because of 
another remodeling snafu. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it's a carpet that doesn't match. 
</P>
<P>
The library was closed Dec. 11 by the county for a periodic face lift and was 
supposed to reopen Feb. 13, said Gary C. Gray, chief of facilities and 
construction for the county's General Services Agency. Other complications 
delayed the reopening until March 26, but when a new carpet arrived in early 
March, portions of it did not match in color. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to be blind to not see it," Gray said.

REPORT ON RAISING ART FUNDS ACCEPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's Cultural Affairs Commission, formed in January to help create a 
cultural game plan for the city, took the first step Wednesday to spotlight 
possible sources of money for an ambitious new art-support program. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member commission agreed to accept a report by Sacramento-based 
consultant Bill Moskin outlining a blend of public and private funding sources, 
and appointed a task force to investigate how to enact the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the commission, Moskin recommended as a first step an increase in 
the city's hotel bed tax. City officials are already discussing an increase of 
1.5% that would raise about $230,000 annually for cultural support and another 
$460,000 for Chamber of Commerce efforts to promote tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the fastest way, and most visible way, to provide support to artists and 
arts organizations," Moskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Irvine would also mandate that 1% to 2% of municipal 
construction costs be used for sculptures and other large-scale art projects in 
public places. Private builders would earn developer credits for using public 
art in their projects or contributing funds to municipal arts facilities or 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A nonprofit support organization to pursue private and corporate funds would 
also be formed under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals were distilled from a number of funding suggestions contained in 
a study done for the city last year. Moskin's report was commissioned to "zero 
in on a couple of ideas that are not only applicable in Irvine, but acceptable 
in Irvine," commission Chairwoman Peggy Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
Mears expects the funding proposals to go before the City Council in July.RICK

WORK ON PIPELINE WILL BEGIN MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work crews will begin installing pipe for the South County Pipeline project at 
Los Alisos Boulevard and Jeronimo Road on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists are advised to take alternative routes to avoid delays while crews 
lay the 2,350-foot length of pipe. Pipeline installation will continue along 
Jeronimo Road until the pipe reaches Olympiad Road in November, project 
officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The work is the second phase of the Mission Viejo portion of the project, 
backed by a consortium of water districts and land developers. Eventually it 
will extend from El Toro to San Clemente, and officials expect to complete the 
pipeline by mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the South County Pipeline will provide the area with a second 
major water pipeline.

<TEXT>
<P>
One of four people hit by a car in a busy intersection died Wednesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Payno Rodriguez, 24, died at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo about 9:40 a.m. from head and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was injured Monday when a driver suspected of being drunk ran a red 
light and hit him and his friends at the corner of 19th Street and Placentia 
Avenue, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Ciriaco Mendoza, had a blood alcohol level of .18, more than twice 
the legal limit of .08, according to Warnack. 
</P>
<P>
Police have requested that charges against Mendoza be upgraded to include 
felony vehicular manslaughter in addition to felony hit and run and driving 
under the influence of alcohol, Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Arrellanos, 35, of Costa Mesa, another injured pedestrian, was listed in 
critical condition Wednesday at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The two other 
people injured, Samuel Chavez Vasquez, 16, and Ramos Sosa Mardocheo, 23, both 
of Costa Mesa, remained in good condition at other hospitals.

AIRLINE TRADE-OFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the late 1970s there was much controversy regarding airline 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the airlines wanted to see the system remain intact, and certainly the 
travel agency industry wanted the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
As an owner of a travel agency, I, along with most of the agents together, 
fought the demise of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
We held that airline service would be reduced, fares would generally increase 
and safety would eventually become a problem because older equipment would 
begin to be used. 
</P>
<P>
We felt that the network that took 40 years to develop would be drastically 
changed. That traffic to and from large cities would increase, intermediate and 
small cities would be forgotten, point-to-point fares would temporarily drop to 
cause fares to be higher to lesser cities. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, the U.S. would wind up with a few major airlines in control of 
destinations and fares. 
</P>
<P>
After about 10 years, what has happened? 
</P>
<P>
There have been over 200 bankruptcies of airlines, many of the old stable 
airlines, like Western, have been swallowed up, we have an inefficient hub 
system, the major airlines number around 10 and now are almost in a position to 
control fares, passengers spend much more time in terminals, baggage is a 
greater problem and most of all small cities are isolated with virtually no 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Is this worth a reduction of fares to and from New York and Los Angeles?

A LANGSTON-WITT GEM DANDY; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: AN UNLIKELY PAIR COMBINES AGAINST MARINERS FOR THE TEAM'S FIRST 
NO-HITTER AT ANAHEIM STADIUM SINCE 1975. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston, the Angels' $16-million man, held Anaheim Stadium enthralled 
Wednesday night with a pitching performance that was priceless -- and hitless. 
</P>
<P>
That he lasted only seven innings against his former Mariner teammates did not 
diminish his feat, for in a wonderful bit of irony, the finishing touches on 
the 1-0 victory that was the eighth no-hitter in the Angels' history were 
provided by Mike Witt, who 5 1/2 years ago pitched the only perfect game in the 
club's history. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, the final one of the 1984 season, Witt blanked the Texas Rangers, 
who were then managed by current Angel Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I knew Witt was the right guy to finish this one," said Rader. 
"He's done it before." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, in his Angel debut, worked with little margin for error against his 
former Seattle teammates. The Angels did not score off Erik Hanson over five 
innings and finally Dante Bichette drew a bases-loaded walk that scored Johnny 
Ray, who had walked to lead off the inning 
</P>
<P>
Langston who spent his first 5 1/2 seasons with the Mariners before being 
traded to Montreal last May, has never pitched a complete-game no-hitter. The 
closest he has come was a one-hitter against Texas on Sept. 24, 1989. He also 
took a no-hitter into the ninth against Toronto last season but lost the game. 
He walked four and struck out three Wednesday, making 98 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't he want to stay in? 
</P>
<P>
"I basically had hit the wall after the seventh," said Langston. "This early in 
the season, I'm lucky to go seven. It's just wild." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 25,632 booed when Witt came out of the bullpen to take over for 
Langston at the start of the eighth inning, but his departure was inevitable, 
given the shortened preparation time he and all pitchers had in the 
lockout-shortened spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said it wasn't how he envisioned his Angel debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, what I pictured wasn't even close," he said. "I was hoping to 
throw five strong innings. I was very fortunate and grateful to be able to go 
seven. The defense was great behind me. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem throwing strikes early on, but I got in a groove from about 
the third inning on. I was throwing strikes and staying ahead of the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Langston may have been nervous in the first inning, and understandably so. But 
his professionalism triumphed, enabling him to grow stronger as the game 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
"The one Mike Witt threw was the most dominating I've ever seen," said Rader. 
"This was the most satisfying because you've got the new kid, Langston, and 
Mike Witt comes in and finishes it." 
</P>
<P>
His first deed as an Angel was hardly auspicious. He walked leadoff batter 
Harold Reynolds on four pitches, but was supported by his defense. The next 
hitter was Griffey, but left fielder Bichette helped turn Griffey's sinking 
liner into a double play when he ran in to catch the ball, saw that Reynolds 
was most of the way to second and made a fine throw to first to double Griffey 
off first. 
</P>
<P>
That proved important when Langston walked Alvin Davis, his former roommate. 
However, Langston got out of the inning when Jeffrey Leonard hit a grounder to 
short that forced Davis at second. 
</P>
<P>
Langston issued another walk to Brian Giles in the third inning, but the 
defense again stepped in and turned an inning-ending double play on a grounder 
hit by Reynolds to second. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels weren't faring much better against Hanson, who stands an imposing 
6-6 but seemed short after the sight of 6-10 Randy Johnson Tuesday. The did get 
to Hanson for two hits in the second, when Lance Parrish singled with two out 
and Jack Howell doubled, moving Parris to third, but Mark McLemore ended the 
threat with a fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
Devon white and Wally Joyner sandwiched singles around Ray's fly ball to left 
in the third, but Chili Davis bounced into a double play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels put runners on base in the fourth inning, but again failed to score. 
Bichette led off with a single to left and advance to second when Claudell 
Washington walked. Parrish then hit a grounder that hopped under the glove of 
third baseman Edgar Martinez, but shortstop Giles recovered the ball in time to 
tag Bichette out at third. Reynolds, the second baseman, bobbled Howell's 
grounder, but managed to get Parrish at second. With Washington on third and 
Howell on first, McLemore struck out swinging. 
</P>
<P>
Langston came close to giving up his first hit in the fifth. Pete O'Brien led 
off with a grounder that Joyner played deep on the dirt behind first. Langston 
raced to cover the bag, but Joyner's throw was high over his head. Parrish 
retrieved it, and had the presence of mind to get O'Brien involved in a 
rundown, which ended with O'Brien being tagged by Joyner at first. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez walked, but Langston got Henry Cotto to fly to left and David Valle to 
look at a third strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels again had runners on base in the fifth but failed to score. White 
swung at a bad pitch on what should have been strike three, but the ball eluded 
Valle and White reached first. Ray sacrificed him to second, but he remained 
there. Joyner was walked intentionally and Hanson got out of trouble by 
striking out Davis and getting Bichette to fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Howell stroked a one-hop double off the wall in center with two 
out, but he was stranded there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield may remain on the disabled list beyond the minimum 
15-day period because he experienced increased discomfort in his right 
hamstring Tuesday after taking ground balls and moving laterally on the field. 
Trainer Ned Bergert said the muscle discomfort meant Schofield had "regressed a 
little bit." Bergert added, "He's eligible (to come off the disabled list) on 
the 16th and I don't think at this time it's likely he'll come off on the 
16th." . . . Reliever Bob McClure, whose sore left elbow showed no improvement 
following a cortisone injection Monday, will undergo a Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging test today at Centinela Hospital. The test, in which a radio frequency 
pulse causes electrical elements of injured tissue to react and appear on a 
computer display, is being done "for peace of mind, to make sure nothing is 
being missed," Bergert said. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bill Schroeder, who is on the disabled list because of soreness in his 
surgically repaired right elbow, will see Dr. Paul Jacobs, who performed the 
arthroscopic procedure, next week in Milwaukee. . . . Jack Howell rejoined the 
healthy Wednesday, exactly a week after he sprained his left ankle while diving 
for first base in an exhibition game. "I'm OK, as far as practice situations, 
ground balls hit pretty much right at you, batting practice, and running pretty 
much straight ahead," said Howell, who blooped a double that landed just inside 
the right-field foul line in his first at-bat Wednesday. "That's not to say I 
expect game situations to be all that different. The only way to tell is trying 
to turn on a good fastball, beating out a grounder or fielding a hard shot hit 
to your left when you've got to make a quick turn. Til those things happen, I 
don't know how it feels." He feels fortunate to be back so quickly. "Looking 
back, it could have been a lot worse," he said. "I could have totally ripped my 
ankle and not been able to come back until June. I'm fortunate it happened 
early in the season, when I was going through spring training-type drills. It's 
not like it was in the middle of a pennant race, where if you miss games it's 
hard to get back in."

SPRING SIGNING SEASON FINDS TOP BASKETBALL PLAYERS LOCKED UP LONG AGO 
</P>

<P>
Scott McCorkle spent Wednesday at the beach. Bill Martineau played some pickup 
basketball. Robert Conlisk hung out by the pool at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all of Orange County's top high school boys' basketball players who 
are seniors relaxed Wednesday, the first day of spring signing period. Once one 
of the busiest times of the year for high school basketball players, the first 
day of signing in the spring has become less significant since the early 
signing period was established in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The trend in recent years has been for players to sign earlier and avoid the 
recruiting crush. 
</P>
<P>
"Was today the first day of signings? I didn't even know," said Conlisk, a 
6-foot-11 center from Los Alamitos High School. "I'm glad I got it over with 
early, otherwise the last few weeks would have been really difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The top four Orange County seniors signed letters of intent in November, 
including McCorkle (Capistrano Valley), Martineau (Edison), Conlisk (Los 
Alamitos) and Keith Walker (Brea-Olinda). Martineau signed with UC Santa 
Barbara, McCorkle with Syracuse, Walker with California and Conlisk with 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to take it easy during my senior year," Martineau said. "I didn't 
want to have to deal with recruiters during the season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Conslisk: "When I was a junior, they were always coming to my games. I 
didn't even have to see them in the stands, I knew they were there. It was 
really a pressure situation." 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk said he was able to enjoy his senior season and be more productive. He 
averaged 17.9 points a game and led the Griffins to the Empire League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a 6-5 guard, led Orange County in scoring, averaging 32.6 points. 
McCorkle, a 6-5 forward, led the Cougars to the Southern Section 5-A title as a 
junior and averaged 24.4 points last season. Martineau, a 6-10 center, averaged 
14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Other top players who signed during the early signing period Nov. 8-15 were El 
Toro's Greg Everett (Creighton), Ocean View's Greg Evans (Loyola Marymount) and 
Mater Dei's Andy Karich (Santa Clara). 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk said he received phone calls from several schools before the early 
signing period. 
</P>
<P>
"Some would even call at 11 p.m., some would call at 7:30 a.m.," Conlisk said. 
"It got very hectic. Sometimes they would come to school, then call my house 
and say, 'I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by.' I couldn't 
imagine going through that and try to play basketball this year." 
</P>
<P>
The early signing period has changed the approach to recruiting basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches used to get a lot more time off in the summer," UC Irvine Coach Bill 
Mulligan said. "Now you have to go out and hustle kids like crazy. If you get a 
kid in November, then it's fine. If you don't, you have to go back and hustle 
more kids. My feeling is, if we get a good player early, then it's a damn good 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries also were a consideration for some of the players who signed early. 
Martineau was coming off a back injury and said he was worried that another 
injury would hurt his chances for a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"There were already some schools that lost interest after I hurt my back during 
the summer," said Martineau, who had strained muscles during a summer league 
game. "I didn't want to take the chance of not having anything for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 players on The Times' All-Orange County team, eight were seniors. 
Five of the eight -- Conlisk, Karich, Martineau, McCorkle and Walker -- 
received scholarships to NCAA Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining first-team players, two will play at community colleges next 
season. Sam Sabbara, a 6-1 point-guard from Western, said he will play at 
Cypress College and Agustin Heredia, a 5-10 guard from Estancia, said he will 
play a community college, but has not decided which one. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Andres, a 6-7 forward from Mater Dei, said he will not play basketball 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
Others who still being recruited include Beau Hossler and Randy Kriech, both of 
Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Hossler, a 6-2 guard, will visit to Boise State and Montana. Kriech, a 6-1 
guard, has offers from Southern California College, Ft. Lewis College in 
Colorado and Humbolt State. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top girls' players also committed early, including Amy Jalewalia of 
La Quinta, Aimee McDaniel of Brea-Olinda and Tammy Blackburn of Brea-Olinda. 
Jalewalia, a 6-1 forward, signed with UCLA; McDaniel, a 5-6 guard, signed with 
Pepperdine; Blackburn, a 5-8 guard, signed with San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough going through the whole recruiting process," said Jalewalia, who 
led the county in scoring. "It's better to get it out of the way and relax." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 seniors on The Times' girls' all-county team, four signed early. 
Besides Jalewalia, McDaniel and Blackburn, Melisa Sortino of Marina signed with 
the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Bone of El Toro committed to Dartmouth in November. Jennifer Rohrig of 
Mission Viejo signed to play volleyball at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
The other four players are undecided. Debbie Fischer, a 5-6 guard from Edison, 
is being recruited by Loyola Marymount. Jennifer Sullivan, a 6-3 center from 
Ocean View, is being recruited by Louisville, Kansas and Loyola. Karie 
Yoshioka, a 5-4 guard from El Toro, is being recruited by UC Irvine and UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Jensen, a 5-11 forward from Katella, committed to University of Redlands.

WESTERN DIGITAL, IBM WILL SHARE TECHNOLOGIES

Western Digital said Wednesday that it has signed a cross-license patent 
agreement with International Business Machines Corp. that will give the Irvine 
computer products company access to a broad range of IBM technology. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Western Digital will pay undisclosed royalties to IBM for 
the right to use IBM technology for five years in products such as computer 
chips, disk and video controllers and computer circuit boards. Western Digital 
will be licensing its technology to IBM as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with IBM because it further 
strengthens our relationship with this important industry leader," said Roger 
W. Johnson, chairman, president and chief executive of Western Digital. "The 
agreement gives us access to IBM's extensive patent portfolio and includes 
patents covering leading process and product technologies in the semiconductor 
and computer industries." 
</P>
<P>
Financial terms for the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital stock closed Wednesday at $12.375 a share, up 37.5 cents, in 
American Stock Exchange trading, continuing the stock's recent bull run on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, which is based in White Plains, N.Y., has a reputation for tough 
enforcement of its patent rights, but it has been aggressively pursuing 
licensing agreements with suppliers since the summer of 1987. Robert Blair, a 
Western Digital spokesman, said the agreement was not reached under threat of 
litigation. He added that payments to IBM will not have a material impact on 
his company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts welcomed the agreement, saying that a cooperative 
relationship between IBM and Western Digital bodes well for both companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of agreement is becoming typical in the industry," said analyst 
Steve Ossad with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, "and it's consistent 
with an improved business relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Raj Rajaratnam, analyst with Needham &amp; Co. in New York, said that the 
agreement signals a close working relationship between IBM and Western Digital 
that could enhance Western Digital's prowess in the technology marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the license agreement reinforces the rumor circulating on Wall 
Street that IBM has granted Western Digital a major contract to supply parts 
for a notebook-size laptop computer that IBM is expected to announce that it 
will make. Both Western Digital and IBM have declined to comment on the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mark Matheson, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport Beach, 
cautioned that the license agreement by itself is not an indication that 
Western Digital has won the contract to supply parts for the IBM laptop or that 
that contract would be lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
Rajaratnam said Western Digital's strategy for becoming a broad supplier of 
parts and systems for personal-computer makers is coming together. He said the 
company has strong product lines in its "intelligent" disk drives, storage 
controllers and communications offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital will report its earnings for the third quarter on April 20, 
Blair said. contracts

KNOTT'S HOPES BOOMERANG RIDE GETS PEOPLE TO GO THERE -- AND COME BACK

This is Knott's Berry Farm's big week. The long-awaited new roller coaster, 
Boomerang, opened last Saturday for thrill seekers who like zooming around a 
torturous, pretzel-like track. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's officials are hoping that the ride -- the first major new attraction at 
the park since the Bigfoot Rapids flume ride made its debut two years ago -- 
will increase attendance during the crucial spring break period this week. So 
far, though, its effect on attendance is hard to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
The ride "just opened over the weekend, so it is a little too early to tell," 
says Stuart Zanville, a Knott's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance was higher Sunday than it was on the same day last year, he says, 
but Saturday was bedeviled by this year's recurring problem -- the weather. 
</P>
<P>
There has been "more rain on Saturdays than any year we can remember," Zanville 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's is also promoting the golden anniversary of its Ghost Town, the 
attraction that started it all in Buena Park 50 years ago. Knott's founder 
Walter Knott began putting in original Ghost Town buildings -- some of which 
are authentic relics from the Old West -- in 1940 as a way to keeping the 
hordes occupied as they waited for seats in wife Cordelia Knott's chicken 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's is confident enough of drawing tourists this year to have increased 
children's admission prices by

KEATING SAYS REGULATORS CUT LINCOLN'S VALUE TO SEIZE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To justify seizing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., regulators arbitrarily 
wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed 
the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's 
former owner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Without any analysis, they took the entire loan portfolio and said it was 
non-performing," Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr. testified in his 
fifth day on the witness stand in his suit seeking to recover the Irvine-based 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board analysis of Lincoln's loan and 
equity portfolios prepared a week after the government imposed a 
conservatorship April 14, 1989, Keating called the numbers "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The analysis, in the form of an April 21, 1989, memo from regulators in charge 
of the Lincoln case to bank board officials in Washington, is the first 
government document specifying regulators' estimate that alleged losses of 
federally insured deposits by the thrift could cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The document estimated that the thrift's assets were worth only $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion, or $1.85 billion to $2.2 billion less than what they were listed 
on Lincoln's books at the time. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Keating has asserted that he ran Lincoln soundly, and that 
regulators could show the thrift was insolvent only by placing a lower value on 
its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those provided by 
American Continental's chief financial officer, he testified Wednesday that 
only 3% of Lincoln's $1.4-billion mortage-loan portfolio was more than 60 days 
in default. 
</P>
<P>
All of the loans, Keating testified, were fully secured, with the borrowers 
putting up an average 20% down payment on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators, however, listed the value of those loans at only $703 million, 
accounting for a third of the losses they claim that Lincoln suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law who headed Lincoln's real estate 
investments, likened the analysis to a family buying a $100,000 home with a 
$20,000 down payment and an $80,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Then a regulator comes in and says the value of the home and the loan on it is 
worth only $40,000, even though the monthly payments are still being made, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James Murphy, an attorney representing the Treasury Department's Office of 
Thrift Supervision, repeatedly objected to Keating comparing the numbers from 
the regulators' April 21 analysis and Keating's own figures on the status of 
Lincoln's loans and equity holdings as of Dec. 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on the 
implementation of the receivership" four months later, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision succeeded the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as 
the industry's chief regulator under the $50-billion savings and loan bailout 
passed last year by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The government seized control of Lincoln in April last year under the 
conservatorship, claiming that it was being grossly mismanaged but making no 
assertion at the time that it was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until August that the regulators asserted that Lincoln's alleged 
losses actually exceeded the value of its assets and imposed a receivership 
that took ownership of the thrift from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin overruled Murphy's objections, but said he 
wanted testimony from Keating's chief financial officer in addition to hearing 
from regulators on their justifications for the writedowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't write down 50% on a mortgage portfolio," said Sporkin, who is a 
former accountant and was at one time the chief enforcement officer for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's attorneys also introduced documents showing that regulators were 
unhappy with the performance of the consultant they hired at an annual salary 
of $300,000 to run Lincoln after seizing control from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 19, 1989, memo to the bank board's top officials in Washington, Mark 
Randall, the government official in charge of managing the conservatorship, 
said the consultant, Roger Clark, failed to address Lincoln's major problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger Clark's inaction, questionable judgment and lack of participation 
establish his inability to function as a CEO (chief executive officer) of 
Lincoln," Randall's memo read. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said that Clark still holds titles as both the CEO and chief financial 
officer of Lincoln under a contract that requires the government to pay him a 
$100,000 termination fee, but that other officials are actually running the 
thrift under the receivership.

O.C. POP BEAT: BONHAM IS A PALE REFLECTION OF LED ZEPPELIN'S LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
THE LATEST REINCARNATION OF THE LEGENDARY, HEAVY-METAL BAND GIVES IT A TRY, BUT 
THE BLUESY, HARD-HITTING MAGIC IS UNMISTAKABLY ABSENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The best that can be said for Bonham is that it is probably more entitled to 
rip off Led Zeppelin than the rest of the recent-vintage metal kids who are 
ripping off Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Bonham, who anchors the band, has done an assiduous job of preserving the 
heavy, yet dynamic drumming style handed down by his father, John Bonham, whose 
death in 1980 spelled the end of Led Zeppelin's 12-year run. Keeping alive a 
family instrumental style is not an unworthy aim. But using it in an 
all-corners rehash of the ancestral past -- as Bonham did Tuesday night at the 
Coach House -- is at best unimaginative, and at worst a roadblock to ever 
finding a musical identity of one's own. 
</P>
<P>
The young Bonham, in his early 20s, has surrounded himself with a band that 
might better be dubbed Led Zeppelin Too. Guitarist Ian Hatton did a yeomanly, 
if nondescript, turn in the Jimmy Page role. Ditto for fellow Englishman John 
Smithson doing the John Paul Jones bass-and-keyboards routine. But, yowl as he 
might in blatant imitation, Canadian singer Daniel MacMaster was no Robert 
Plant. 
</P>
<P>
In his Led Zeppelin days, Plant occasionally mustered some authentic blues 
passion, distorted and distended as Led Zep's heavy blues might have been. 
MacMaster's white-bread delivery left it open to question whether his blues 
roots go back beyond 1968. Then again, laden with material as bland and cliched 
as Bonham's, even a singer who hums "Dust My Broom" every night before bed 
would be sorely challenged to achieve much emotional impact. 
</P>
<P>
Of the band's originals, only the encore, "Wait for You," sustained much 
melodic interest. For the most part, Bonham's melodies would ramble formlessly 
until hitting a hook refrain designed to be repeated endlessly. To fill out the 
1 1/2-hour set, the band augmented songs from its debut album, "The Disregard 
of Timekeeping," with several Zep and non-Zep oldies. Little Richard's "Ready 
Teddy" lumbered when it needed to jump. The Beatles' "Come Together" was heavy 
but serviceable. A mid-set version of Zep's "Rock 'n' Roll" was perfunctory, 
and a concluding "Black Dog," which Bonham dedicated to his father, re-created 
the Led Zeppelin hit in a way that would have done any bar band proud. 
</P>
<P>
For someone attempting a Zep redux, MacMaster was a surprisingly unimposing 
presence, and his voice was seldom up to the high-screech task. Instead of 
throwing off any of Plant's sexual shamanism, the boyish-looking singer came 
off like a wet-behind-the-ears teen-age rocker trying to overcome his shyness 
and impress the girls. There's nothing wrong with being a wet-behind-the-ears 
rocker -- but only if you're trying to sing your own story and find your own 
musical path. Devoting yourself to weak-tea imitations of Robert Plant is no 
way to tell any kind of story, except perhaps the one about how to succeed in 
the rock business without really trying. 
</P>
<P>
Bonham himself has potential. The stocky drummer has mastered his father's 
method of laying down a slow, teeth-shuddering beat, but interspersing it with 
fills and dramatic flourishes that lend a sense of surprise and acceleration. 
In most of the songs, there were moments -- usually during instrumental 
passages -- when that massive beat helped the band scale a peak of intensity. 
But Bonham would serve his legacy far better by trying to extend it in new 
directions. He doesn't have to re-create his father's band to be his father's 
son.

Johnny Crash, a new band from Los Angeles, opened with a limited but spirited 
set of garage-metal that borrowed from the likes of AC/DC and the Faces. 
British front man Vicki James Wright (yes, despite the first name, that's front 
man) howled like Rod Stewart might if he stepped on a rusty nail -- in a 
Rod-like voice, only more frayed and less firm. Lead guitarist August Worchell 
was no virtuoso, but no guitarist can truly go wrong if he follows the 
when-in-doubt-crank-out-Chuck-Berry-licks approach that Worchell favored. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the show, Wright abandoned the cramped stage, where Johnny Crash 
was hemmed in by Bonham's mass of amps, drums, and a dozen extra speakers 
trucked in to augment the Coach House's perfectly capacious sound system. The 
blond, moon-faced singer spent most of the 40-minute set walking tables and 
running through the audience in an athletic, but ultimately repetitious 
display. Johnny Crash's songs quickly became repetitious, as well, with number 
after rough-hewn number offering the same good-natured but utterly 
unimaginative bad-boy- rocker swagger. 
</P>
<P>
Far from packing a hint of a threat, Wright was all too eager to flatter a 
receptive, but hardly boisterous audience with perky, profane patter about what 
a good time he was having and what an exceptionally rockin' bunch they were. So 
that's what bad-boy-L.A.-rock has come to in 1990: You want to be popular, 
right? So be sure and make nice. 
</P>

NIPPER, MEET VINNIE: Originally signed to the independent Cypress label, Orange 
County folk-rocker Vinnie James has stepped up to one of the majors, RCA 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
According to his manager, Mike Jacobs, major-label interest in James prompted a 
delay in the release of his debut album, "All-American Boy," which he recorded 
late last year. Cypress is now in on the deal as the production company that 
funded the recording, Jacobs said, but it will be released and promoted by RCA. 
The album is due out in late September. 
</P>
<P>
James said he was impressed by RCA's recent success in breaking alternative 
acts such as Cowboy Junkies and Peter Murphy. He plans to pave the way for the 
album's release with some solo acoustic touring.

JOHN MURRELL'S PLAY 'WAITING FOR THE PARADE' TAKES A ROUTE THROUGH PRETTY 
RECOGNIZABLE TERRITORY, BUT THE MESSAGE IS STILL WORTH THE TRIP.

<P>
Like many dramas about "life during wartime," John Murrell's "Waiting for the 
Parade" centers on women, how they cope with their men away and the new demands 
of a changing society. 
</P>
<P>
This is pretty recognizable territory, often plumbed and often sentimentalized. 
To be sure, Murrell's play -- offered by Cal State Fullerton's just formed 
Contemporary Repertory Theatre Company at the Gem Theatre in repertory with two 
one-acts also focusing on women (see related review) -- is sentimental, but not 
too much so. We can watch the five women it spotlights without feeling a wave 
of cloying insistence. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Murrell is a Canadian playwright, and "Waiting" is set in his homeland. 
He gives us a perspective on World War II from a different land. All the 
unabashed patriotism, fervid anti-German feelings and painful honor and regret 
are there, just like it was in America, but from a Canadian orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Director Gretchen Kanne opens the production with a stylized scene of Janet 
(Arlyn McDonald) at center stage, moving hesitantly to a period song. One by 
one she seeks out the other characters, all women, and gets them to dance. She 
can't really connect, though, as the steps are awkward and short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Janet never does connect. As the leader of the local volunteer effort in a 
Canadian town, her job is getting the most out of Catherine (Karlie Cook), Eve 
(Renee Simoneau) and Margret (Gwenda Deacon) as they try to make life more 
bearable for the men going overseas and the families staying behind. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the little care packages she puts together, Janet keeps a wary eye on 
Marta (Kathleen Dunn), who's been ostracized for her German heritage and has a 
father imprisoned as a Nazi sympathizer. A somewhat hardened case, Janet 
receives respect but never admiration. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of mostly minor-key episodes, comfortably organized by Kanne, 
we find out about all of them. Spunky Catherine's husband is missing in action 
and she turns to an affair for solace. Sensitive Eve sees sad poetry in the war 
and, perhaps to ease her unhappiness, makes fun of her husband, a man too old 
to enlist or be drafted. Solid, matronly Margret frets over her sons, the ones 
fighting in Europe and the one in jail at home. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Marta, the perennial outsider, who endures abuse, both from her 
neighbors and the bureaucracy that keeps her father imprisoned. Murrell's point 
is obvious -- wartime brings out the best and the worst in people, and a trace 
of Nazi immorality can be found just about anywhere -- but it's one that can 
stand being repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble acting is better than in the two one-acts, although there is a 
tendency to get us involved through the large gesture. McDonald and Deacon give 
the most accessible performances, but Dunn's accent and attitude seem forced. 
</P>

'HIGHER SOURCE' LOSES ITS POWERS HALFWAY

<P>
"A Higher Source," a new play at the Way-Off Broadway Playhouse, plays like a 
sitcom awkwardly married to a soap opera. Orange County playwright Allison 
Gappa is more successful in the sitcom vein, and her premise has amusing 
possibilities, but one act of it would have been plenty. 
</P>
<P>
The heroine, Barry (Michelle Fashian), is to be married within the hour to a 
lifelong friend, Collin (played with boyish charm by Robert Embree), with whom, 
alas, she is not in love. In the ladies' lounge of a posh Vermont inn, Barry, 
in her bridal undies, is stalling. 
</P>
<P>
Enter a Latina wearing a long, curly, red wig. This is Moralis, an overzealous 
junior Cupid who has misused her supernatural powers to incite love, or at 
least lust, between Barry and a lying, two-timing boozer named Blake (played by 
Jim Bogner as a humorless lout with one expression). In order to save her 
assignment, Moralis must stop the wedding of Barry and Collin and reform Blake. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, time freezes, and a pair of higher-up Cupids are with us, ordering a 
flashback of the whole Barry/Blake/Collin mix-up. Then come the soap-opera 
scenes, like rocks in a very fragile souffle. 
</P>
<P>
Fashian's comic sense, displayed in the opening, is completely suffocated by 
the joylessness of these "passionate" interludes. 
</P>
<P>
The one brightly unifying element is Moralis, played by Dani Ballew in the 
style of a young Lucille Ball doing a Desi Arnaz accent. Ballew isn't Latin, 
she doesn't even look Latin, but she has a wonderfully mobile face and an 
endearing fearlessness in her pursuit of a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The stylistic schizophrenia of "A Higher Source" is managed valiantly by this 
fledgling company, headed by director Tony Reverditto. But Moralis' 
malapropisms and lusty wriggling are not enough to sustain two hours, although 
Tisza Posner, as Barry's little sister, pitches in with her dryly humorous 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The Way-Off Broadway Playhouse and Acting Studio is a phenomenon in itself. 
Twelve actors and an audience of 49 are squeezed into a small, low-ceilinged 
room with inconveniently placed supporting columns. You have to walk through 
the box office-cum-booth to get to your seat. Local artists' paintings are on 
display in the labyrinthine lobby and $1 of every ticket goes to charity. 
Periodically, a train rumbles by. 
</P>
<P>
These people are determined to make a theater, no matter what. They deserve 
credit for the sheer audacity of their endeavor. 
</P>
<P>

Hamilton, Jim Bogner, Maureen Sullivan. Runs through April 29 at Way-Off

IN 'PATIO' AND 'GRACELAND' AT THE GEM THEATRE, PLAYWRIGHTS ELLEN BYRON AND JACK 
HEIFNER HAVE CREATED CHARACTERS TOO HEAVY WITH QUIRKS.

<P>
There's something about Southern women that makes playwrights go goofy. It's as 
if a spell -- a cloud of unreason -- settles over them as they create 
characters so heavy with quirks they can seem more cartoon than human. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Hansen, with her eccentric nervous Nellie having hissy fits all through 
her works, has to be the prototype, but she's not nearly the only one. Take 
Ellen Byron and Jack Heifner, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
In the one-acts presented by Cal State Fullerton's new Contemporary Repertory 
Theatre Company at the Gem Theatre (in repertory with John Murrell's 
full-length "Waiting for the Parade"; see related review), we find three ladies 
and a girl, all afflicted by Southern peculiarity. 
</P>
<P>
The more amusing, probably because the topic is so bizarrely familiar, is 
Byron's "Graceland." By the title, you can guess that Elvis is the centerpiece 
as Bev (Arlyn McDonald) and Rootie (Renee Simoneau) fight over who's going to 
be the first to set foot in the everlasting one's mansion when it is initially 
opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Bev arrives first, pitching a pup tent by the famous music staff gate and 
placing a comforting assortment of Elvis junk nearby. She's a middle-aged type, 
a little soft in the middle and prone to wearing bad wigs. Bev's got a tart 
mouth, but she's all mush inside. 
</P>
<P>
Rootie comes a little later, plopping down on a pillow and eating hard-boiled 
eggs from a paper bag. While Bev is obsessed with Elvis as the usual 
love/fame/sex object, Rootie sees him as something more. 
</P>
<P>
In a satiric but muddled metaphor for the transcendence of stardom and 
idolatry, Byron has Rootie envision Elvis as a spiritual conduit to her brother 
Beau, who died in Vietnam. She needs to get in the mansion first so she can 
commune with Elvis and ask him to contact Beau. 
</P>
<P>
Bev and Rootie fight, but eventually become pals. Rootie doesn't need a friend, 
though; she needs a therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Byron is making a point -- about the danger of replacing real feelings for real 
things with real feelings for unreal symbols -- but it's a pretty tired idea. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters in Heifner's "Patio" are both idiosyncratic, especially the 
talkative, high-strung Pearl (Karlie Cook). She worries about lots of stuff, in 
particular how her going-away party, done in a Snoopy motif, for her sister 
Jewel (Kathleen Dunn) will turn out. 
</P>
<P>
Jewel is leaving town to become something better. She's slightly more sensible 
than Pearl, with a real career as a hairstylist. (Why is it that these Southern 
women are always beauty-shop types? Why not a Southern meter maid, or a 
Southern hot-dog vendor?) 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, they squabble about who Pearl's husband loved more, Pearl or Jewel, but 
end up showing how much they care for each other in a creamy denouement. 
</P>
<P>
Both playlets are directed by Cherie Brown in a comic, eager style that 
escalates the nuttiness of the characters. The acting is also too hyperactive 
for its own good.

ANN CONWAY: BECKMAN ENTERS THE 90S WITH A SMILE 
</P>

<P>
Arnold Beckman celebrated his Big Nine-O with 1,000 of his faithful employees 
at the Disneyland Hotel on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
And what did he do? Partied with the stamina of a 30-year-old, shaking hands 
here, flashing smiles there, dipping into filet mignon and birthday cake with 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
How did the founder and chairman-emeritus of Beckman Instruments, Inc. feel? 
</P>
<P>
"Great! Like I did at 89!" said the nonagenarian with a laugh, striding into a 
special champagne reception for employees who were celebrating their 10th, 
15th, 20th and 25th anniversaries with his company. "Really. I am so grateful 
to be 90 and in good health." 
</P>
<P>
The annual splash may be Orange County's oldest gala. The event marked the 55th 
year that Beckman Instruments of Fullerton honored its true-blues with a 
recognition dinner. 
</P>
<P>
In the hotel's South Lounge, employees tipped bubbly and talked about their 
boss as they awaited his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the finest man I've ever known," said Allan Chisholm, a Beckman employee 
for 25 years. "I wish him another 20 years! He is the kind of man who, if he 
doesn't know your name the first time around, he'll know it the second." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Vice wished there were more people in the world like Beckman, an 
inventor inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame two years ago. "Very 
few people leave a mark. And Beckman has already left several." Among them: the 
pH meter, a device that measures acidity and alkalinity; the spectrophotometer, 
which measures light; and the helipot, used during World War II for radar 
control. "I mean," Vice added, "100 years from now, who's going to remember 
Charlie Vice? Probably nobody!" 
</P>
<P>
Party hats and streamers covered the tables. And so did programs listing each 
long-term employee's name. "Isn't this great?" said Molly Moodyman, another 
25-year employee. "I love to work at Beckman because it's so pleasant. The 
people are so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
And you can make good money at Beckman, Moodyman said. "If you stick it out, 
you can get what you want." 
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks, Beckman, dapper in a dark blue suit and burgundy tie, 
told the crowd: "I hope to be back at the end of the decade and see how well 
you have carried out your obligations." 
</P>
<P>
Beckman will be honored at another bash later this month when Gavin and Ninetta 
Herbert stage a luncheon for 200 guests at their Casa Pacifica manse, once 
Richard M. Nixon's Western White House. 
</P>
<P>
Hi ho silver!: The cubed lamb with ginger and garlic delighted guests at Sunday 
night's "International Dinner," staged by the Protocol Foundation of Orange 
County. So did the cubed chicken whipped up with tomatoes and spices. And the 
tandoori bread. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Royal Khyber's "Gulab Jaman" dessert that got guests gabbing. 
The deep-fried milk ball floating in sugar syrup was frosted with sterling 
silver paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmmmm, good for your health," said the Hon. S. K. Lambah, consul general for 
India, dipping into the shiny concoction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an aphrodisiac," whispered restaurant owner Arun Puri, wearing an elegant 
black achkan, the stand-up collar jacket popularized by Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 guests came (at an ultra-reasonable $35 each) to dabble in Indian 
food, raise money for the Protocol Foundation and listen to Lambah talk about 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an ancient country," he said, standing between flags of India and the 
United States. "But we have had a functioning democracy for 40 years. (George 
Bernard) Shaw said the United States and Britain were two countries separated 
by the same language. In a light vein, I would say the United States and India 
are two countries separated by the same political system." 
</P>
<P>
Additional points made by Lambah: 
</P>
<P>
* The United States is India's largest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
* India was the 10th country in the world to become industrialized. 
</P>
<P>
* After the United States and the Soviet Union, India is the world's largest 
resource for technological manpower. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, India has the Taj Mahal. During dinner, Lambah was asked what he 
thought of Donald Trump's new gambling casino by the same name. Lambah smiled. 
"There is hardly a comparison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real Taj Mahal was built to symbolize a man's enduring love for his wife," 
said Lambah's guest, Devender Singh of the India Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Also among guests: Fred and Eva Schneider, vice president of the foundation; 
Wes and Mary Jones, the foundation's executive director; and board members Anne 
Badham with husband Bob; Annemarie Ballin with husband, Dolf; Bernice and 
Willard Hird; Pat and Carl Neisser; John and Kitty Rau and Elaine and Bill 
Redfield.

"Look at all those people!" 
</P>
<P>
Tenise Harris peeked from the South Lounge in the Disneyland Hotel and got a 
bad case of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so nervous I can't breathe," said Harris, a Chino High School junior and 
one of 13 debutantes presented in the hotel's Grand Ballroom on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The party, attended by 565 guests from Orange and Los Angeles counties, was 
sponsored by the Orange County chapter of Links Inc., a national community 
service organization involved in educational, cultural and philanthropic 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
For Harris and her deb buddies, the night was the culmination of six months of 
preparation -- including hours of volunteer work, etiquette training and career 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to take an old tradition and modernize it," said Laura Rycraw, 
event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition prevailed at the fund-raiser, where career and civic concerns were 
briefly displaced by pressing matters of makeup, hair, curtsy and waltz. 
</P>
<P>
While the black-tie crowd sipped cocktails outside the ballroom, the 
white-gowned girls, their families and escorts posed for formal portraits 
behind the South Lounge's closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at my beautiful baby!" cooed Earlene Owens as she combed Kamela Bell's 
hair. Bell, a junior at Cerritos High School, is Owens' godchild. 
</P>
<P>
Debutante Robynne Royster, a junior at the Los Angeles High School of the Arts, 
said she'd wanted to be a debutante since she was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was a debutante," said Royster, an aspiring actress who kept a cool 
head while those around her tensed. "Starting when I was about 3, I used to 
dress up and play around in her gown." 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the girls -- which included the requisite curtsies, 
bouquets and tours of the ballroom dance floor -- began at 7 p.m., after brief 
speeches by Rycraw, Links Inc. chapter President Iva Green and Jennie Spencer 
Green, who presented scholarship awards. 
</P>
<P>
Emcee Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor of student affairs at UC Irvine, 
described the accomplishments of the "13 young, gifted and talented 
African-American women . . . (whose) beauty (is) sweeter than the sound of a 
musical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
Also making a formal debut were Shelbi Titus, a junior at Cerritos High School; 
Sharmarra Turner, a senior at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles; Gwendolyn 
Williams, a senior at Saddleback High School in Santa Ana; Joi Williams, a 
junior at Gahr High School in Cerritos; Sabrina Barry, a junior at San Pedro 
High School; Russetta Bourda, a junior at St. Anthony High School in Long 
Beach; Yolaunda Collier, a junior at University High School in Irvine; Heather 
Davis, a junior at Whitney High School in Cerritos; Denise Johnson, a junior at 
Corona High School; and Kristie Moore, a senior at Cerritos High School.

TROUBLED THRIFTS STILL PAY TOP SAVINGS DEPOSIT RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the nation's most troubled thrifts -- including some already under 
regulatory control -- continue to pay among the highest rates for savings 
deposits, despite government efforts to curb the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts contend that the higher rates often translate into higher 
costs for troubled thrifts, which could increase the tab for the 
taxpayer-financed federal bailout of the industry. In effect, taxpayers are 
subsidizing high rates to depositors at these ailing thrifts, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But regulators say there is little else that sick thrifts can do. 
</P>
<P>
"The institutions need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity and the 
negative publicity that surrounds a takeover requires (that) they pay a little 
higher premium for deposits than their competitors," said Dan Page, a spokesman 
for the Office of Thrift Supervision in San Francisco. "It is not the most 
desirable thing, but it is necessary under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the differences are sometimes staggering. An informal survey of 10 
California thrifts -- including five that meet capital requirements versus five 
that don't -- revealed that sick thrifts paid between 0.10 and 1 percentage 
point more than healthy institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The highest rate payer locally is Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, which is 
under tight operating restrictions because of its deteriorating financial 
health. It pays an annualized rate of 8.6% on both six-month and one-year jumbo 
certificates of deposit (those generally with balances of $100,000 or more), 
and will pay up to 8.71% if the depositor is over the age of 55. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Great Western Bank, a Beverly Hills-based thrift that currently 
meets all regulatory requirements, pays only 7.72% for a six-month jumbo CD and 
only 7.95% for a one-year jumbo CD. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a saver with a $100,000 deposit would earn roughly $650 more 
each year by depositing the money in Valley Federal versus Great Western. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar Savings, which is insolvent and currently under regulatory control, 
pays 8.59% for six-month jumbo CDs, while the other three troubled institutions 
surveyed -- Columbia Savings, Mercury Savings and Imperial Savings -- paid 
between 8.35% and 8.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The healthy institutions surveyed -- California Federal, Glendale Federal, Home 
Savings and World Savings -- paid a maximum of 8.22% for six-month jumbo CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, federal regulators maintain they have made progress in reducing 
the premiums sick thrifts pay for deposits. Two years ago, sick thrifts were 
paying between 0.25 and 0.35 percentage points more for deposits than average 
rates nationwide, said Eric Hirschhorn, director of industry analysis at the 
Office of Thrift Supervision in Washington. However, by the end of last year, 
that premium dropped to under 0.1 percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period of time, the government has closed, sold or placed 
hundreds of sick thrifts under regulatory control. That cut the percentage of 
sick thrifts operating independently from 20% of the industry to less than 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Although many insolvent thrifts under government control still pay higher 
rates, Hirschhorn notes that the government can ensure that those rates are not 
totally out of line. For example, the government can provide money to a 
troubled thrift, thereby reducing the institution's need to pay high rates to 
attract deposits. 
</P>
<P>
That's helped both solvent and insolvent thrifts, he said. The interest that 
savings institutions pay on deposits is generally one of their biggest 
operating expenses, so any reduction in these rates often filters down to 
higher bottom-line profits. And because savings deposits of $100,000 and less 
are federally insured, competition forces healthy thrifts to keep their rates 
competitive with their weaker brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many healthy thrifts are dissatisfied with the fact that sick 
institutions are still allowed to pay these high rates.

GROUP HINTS IT MAY LAUNCH PROXY FIGHT FOR PIC 'N' SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investment group including a former T. Boone Pickens Jr. associate and an 
experienced Southern California retailing executive said Wednesday that it 
expects to launch a takeover effort for the Pic 'N' Save close-out retail 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
The investment group, known as Girard Partners, disclosed in a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission that it has acquired 6.6% of the 
Dominguez-based chain's stock for $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Girard Partners is led by David H. Batchelder, who founded a La Jolla 
investment firm in 1988 after serving for 10 years as the chief deal maker for 
Pickens, the Texas corporate raider. Another key member of the group is Robert 
J. McNulty, president and chief executive of the HQ Office Supplies Warehouse 
retail chain and a founder of the Home Club chain. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's disclosure follows a 24% climb in the price of Pic 'N' Save's stock 
last week on rumors of a possible takeover bid. In over-the-counter trading 
Wednesday, the stock was up 50 cents to close at $13.50 before Girard Partners 
revealed its plans to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had been puzzled about why a takeover artist would want Pic 'N' Save. 
The company, analysts said, faces tough competition from other discounters, has 
little real estate and owns few, if any, other valuable assets. 
</P>
<P>
But the revelation that McNulty is part of the group pursuing Pic 'N' Save 
appears to signal that the investors have an overhaul in mind for the chain, 
said Sarah Stack, an analyst with the investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles. She called McNulty an innovative businessman who has 
pioneered new warehouse retailing concepts. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be some changes made if these people are successful," Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
Stack said Girard Partners is more likely to pursue Pic 'N' Save with a proxy 
fight rather than with an outright bid for the company. She noted that the 
investors indicated that they still are trying to line up financing for an 
acquisition and that they did not disclose what price they would pay for Pic 
'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
In the SEC filing, Girard Partners said it is seeking consent from Pic 'N' 
Save's management to reorganize the board so that it will be dominated by the 
investment group. Girard proposed a five-member board, consisting of 
Batchelder, McNulty and supply-side economist and consultant Arthur B. Laffer, 
along with Pic 'N' Save President Lewis B. Merrifield III and the company's 
former chairman, Arthur Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC document said that, if installed, the new board members would seek to 
sell most or all of Pic 'N' Save to Girard Partners or another bidder. Girard 
Partners said it has invested in Pic 'N' Save because it believes that the 
current price of its shares "does not adequately reflect the value of the 
underlying businesses and assets of the company or the price that could be 
obtained" if it were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Girard Partners could not be reached for comment. William M. 
Jacobs Jr., Pic 'N' Save's senior vice president and chief financial officer, 
said his company would have no comment until it studied the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save, a chain of 189 stores, has doubled in size during the past four 
years. Its earnings have declined, however, because of stepped-up competition 
and the cost of its expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, profit fell 34% to $30.9 million on sales of $475.2 million. The 
stores sell a wide variety of discontinued and surplus products.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FILES SUIT AGAINST NORTHROP OVER ALLEGED INFLATED COSTS ON 
JET; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE COMPANY FAILED TO DISCLOSE COST-SAVING 
TECHNOLOGY ON THE F/A-18. DAMAGES ARE AT LEAST $25 MILLION, SAYS A LAWYER 
FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Justice Department sued Northrop Corp. for millions of dollars in damages 
and penalties Wednesday, alleging that the Los Angeles aerospace firm 
fraudulently inflated bills it submitted to the Navy for work on the F/A-18 
fighter-bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Although government officials said they had not determined the precise amount 
of damages, a private lawyer familiar with the case said they were at least $25 
million and that the recovery could be three times that amount because the suit 
was filed under the federal False Claims Act, which allows treble damages. 
</P>
<P>
The suit marks the fourth time in the last two years that the government has 
sued a Northrop operation for fraud or has joined in suits that were filed 
against the company by whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
The company, whose headquarters are in Century City, also faces at least three 
federal criminal investigations around the country and several other civil 
suits by former employees. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit filed in U.S. District Court here Wednesday alleges that the 
company failed to disclose savings it had achieved from a new manufacturing 
process that enabled it to produce parts for the F/A-18 at considerably less 
cost than it had in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said the company had no comment to make since 
it had not yet been served with the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The action was originally filed in 1987 by Eldon L. Janssen of Agoura Hills, a 
former Northrop employee. Under the False Claims Act, a private party can sue 
-- on behalf of the government -- companies and individuals who have defrauded 
the government. The government then has the right to intervene in the case and 
assume control of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The statute provides that all such suits filed by private individuals are 
placed under seal and the government is given at least 60 days to investigate 
the case and determine if it wants to intervene. Frequently, the government is 
given lengthy extensions for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In this instance, at least part of the delay in unsealing the case was the fact 
that the Justice Department had also been exploring the possibility of criminal 
charges in the case, according to William R. Ramsey of Encino, Janssen's 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey said, however, that the Justice Department had decided against filing 
criminal charges in the case. He also said that this was one of numerous 
criminal investigations that the government had agreed to drop in February when 
Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud counts and paid a $17-million fine 
in connection with tests on a stabilization device for a Marine jet fighter and 
on guidance equipment for a nuclear-armed cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials declined to comment on any prior criminal 
investigation. However, the agency issued a formal statement announcing the 
unsealing of the civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's assumption of this suit signals its continued determination 
to assure that all federal contractors are honest in their dealings with the 
government," said Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general in charge of the 
civil division. 
</P>
<P>
If the government wins such a suit, the individual who brings the fraud to the 
government's attention can collect 15% to 25% of any award that is recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Janssen was manager of major equipment procurement for Northrop's aircraft 
division from June, 1983, to July, 1985. He then served as manager of contracts 
and pricing in Northrop's Ventura division from July, 1985, to August, 1986, a 
period in which he learned about the wrongful conduct alleged in the suit, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Janssen was dismissed by Northrop in May, 1987, according to the suit, and is 
working as a defense industry consultant, according to Ramsey. The lawyer said 
the damages sought in the suit were at least $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stems from work Northrop did as the primary subcontractor for 
McDonnell Douglas Corp. on the F/A-18. The Navy has purchased hundreds of these 
aircraft from McDonnell Douglas since it went into full production in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Both McDonnell Douglas' contract and Northrop's subcontract are what is known 
as sole source, fixed-price agreements. This means that only one contractor is 
deemed qualified to perform the work, and there is no competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's primary responsibility on the plane is the building of the center 
and aft sections of the fuselage. As part of this work, Northrop manufactures 
each year a number of identical sets of itemized parts for the aircraft, 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these parts are made of so-called composite materials that must be 
shaped and refined under high pressure and heat, using a vacuum process.

BROADCASTING: THE PROBLEMS IN ATTRACTING SUBSCRIBERS HAVE LED TIME WARNER AND

The talks between Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc. regarding a merger of their 
new cable television comedy networks appear to be on once again, but officials 
close to the negotiations said there are still several obstacles to an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Both Viacom and Time Warner are being forced back to the bargaining table 
because their respective comedy channels have had a difficult time attracting 
subscribers to the fledgling program services. Cable operators generally agree 
that there is a market for an all-comedy cable channel, just as there are 
all-sports and all-news channels, although second channels offering a similar 
format behind an already established channel have mostly failed. 
</P>
<P>
So far, neither Viacom's Ha! nor its direct competitor, the Comedy Channel, 
have emerged a leader, and analysts see a long, resource-draining fight between 
the two channels as they try to establish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom launched Ha! on April 1 with only 4 million subscribers, although the 
company says it expects to add another 1 million subscribers by next month and 
have 6 million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner, through its HBO subsidiary, launched the Comedy Channel in 
November with a larger base of 4.2 million subscribers, although it has not 
grown appreciably beyond the 6 million subscribers it had at the end of 1989. 
HBO, however, says it has "commitments" from cable operators that would 
increase the Comedy Channel's subscriber base to 15 million over the next 
couple of years, depending on how fast cable systems are able to increase 
channel capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no delusions about the reality of the marketplace," said Ha! president 
Ed Bennett. "But we are fully prepared to stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett says room for new cable channels will open as cable systems increase 
their channel capacity to 54 channels over the next five years and systems 
begin dropping "imported" distant signals because of copyright problems and 
ailing home-shopping channels. 
</P>
<P>
The battle between the two services has turned nasty. Personal insults have 
been exchanged on top of litigation. Viacom last year filed a $2.5-billion 
antitrust suit against HBO, charging it with monopolizing the cable television 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Time Warner threatened to sue a group of cable system operators who 
were in discussions about making an equity investment in Ha! in exchange for 
adding the program service to their systems. Time Warner lawyers contended that 
those equity deals would have shut out the Comedy Channel on systems totaling 
between 18 million to 20 million subscribers, even though the pact did not call 
for exclusive carriage of Ha! The cable operators were sufficiently scared that 
the equity discussions have now collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say talks between Viacom and Time Warner over merging their comedy 
cable networks have been stymied on several important matters, including who 
would manage the combined company, what their respective interests would be and 
whether to allow cable operators to invest in the company. Cable operators, 
which provide the pipeline into the viewer's home, typically invest in the 
programming services they carry. 
</P>
<P>
The limited number of channels available on cable systems around the country is 
a major reason that Viacom and Time Warner are finding it difficult to launch a 
new cable network. 
</P>
<P>
Cable systems on average carry 35 channels, but there are 104 different cable 
networks competing for those limited openings. In addition, most cable 
franchise agreements call for the cable system to set aside about one-third of 
those channels for local broadcast stations, further reducing the available 
slots for new cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly cable operators have limited shelf space," said Richard J. MacDonald, 
a partner in the New York media investment firm of MacDonald Grippo Reilly Inc. 
"The best thing for them would be to combine their efforts." 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Channel and Ha! are taking a different approach to programming their 
respective channels, although both feature stand-up comics. The Comedy Channel 
is relying heavily on the use of short comedy features, or "clips," similar in 
format to music videos. Ha! is scheduling more traditional programming, such as 
old reruns of "The Lucy Show" and "Saturday Night Live." The costs are steep: 
HBO will spend about $40 million during its first year -- some believe the cost 
will actually balloon to more than $50 million -- and Viacom officials have 
said Ha! will spend between $85 million to $125 million over the next four 
years.

Bond Reports Massive Loss: Alan Bond's beleaguered flagship, Bond Corp. 
Holdings, announced the third-biggest loss in Australian corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported a loss of $580 million ($758.15 million Australian) for 
the second half of 1989. The loss was surpassed only by Bond Corp's own 
full-year loss of $623 million (A$814.1 million) to June 30, 1989, and a 
six-month loss of $660 million (A$862.5 million) by its 58%-owned subsidiary, 
Bell Resources, reported in March. But Bond Corp. Director Peter Lucas said the 
company was confident it could not only survive but rebuild.

Southland Corp.'s Profit Outlook Shaky: The parent company of the 7-Eleven 
chain said it does not expect to become profitable until 1993, even if it 
successfully exchanges $1.8 billion in publicly traded debt for new debt. In a 
preliminary prospectus for its debt-exchange offer, Dallas-based Southland 
Corp. projected a $156-million loss in 1990. The firm also said it expects to 
save $1.6 billion in cash interest payments between now and Dec. 31, 1997, if 
the bond swap goes through.

Capital spending, after adjustment for inflation, is expected to rise by 7.6% 
in 1990, a sharp increase from the 4.9% rise estimated three months ago, the 
Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the projected increase for this year would still be down from the 8.6% 
gain in spending by businesses on plant and equipment in 1989, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The January-March survey of spending plans by businesses was another sign that 
economic activity would continue its growth but at a slow pace after more than 
eight years of economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Companies plan to increase capital spending after adjusting for inflation to 
$503.4 billion in 1990, a 7.6% gain over last year.

A CHANGE OF SCENERY FOR WESTERN COSTUME; 
</P>
<P>
RELOCATING: ENTIRE STOCK OF ABOUT 3 1/2 MILLION COSTUMES AND PROPS IS BEING 
MOVED TO NEW NORTH HOLLYWOOD LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Abramowitz admits he hasn't slept much lately. 
</P>
<P>
As president of Western Costume Co., he's supervising the move of its entire 
stock of costumes and props -- about 3 1/2 million of them -- from Hollywood to 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The move, expected to take 28 days, started last week. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you move all of this and still do business at the same time?" 
Abramowitz asked recently as he walked through the 65-year-old structure on 
Melrose Avenue that Western is vacating so Paramount Studios, which owns the 
site, can put up an office building. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the largest collection of vintage clothing in the world, and it 
has to be preserved," he said. "Most of the clothes are genuines." 
</P>
<P>
That morning, he had spotted, among the packed boxes of more than 3,000 swords, 
two authentic European weapons imported by Western in the 1920s for the Eric 
von Stroheim classic, "The Wedding March." They were pulled from the regular 
collection and placed for packing with the special items. 
</P>
<P>
"We find those kinds of items all the time," said Abramowitz, explaining that 
no piece-by-piece inventory has ever been done of Western's apparel and props. 
"And it never will be. It would be a monumental task and too costly." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates the company has at least 2 1/2 million costumes, prompting his 
stepson Adam, 11, to ask: "Do you know you have two costumes for everybody in 
the state of Maine?" 
</P>
<P>
Chief costumer Bob Pecina, who has worked at Western on and off since 1945, 
observed: "We've started an inventory many times but never finished. But this 
place was always No. 1. All the biggest designers were here, Walter Plunkett, 
Edith Head, Adele Palmer, Irene Sharaff, Renie, Yvonne Woods, Eddie Stevens. 
And all the stars. My favorite was Barbara Stanwyck. She was such a lovely 
person. And Errol Flynn and Gilbert Roland. Gilbert is still a friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
As for props, probably a million have been acquired by Western since it was 
founded by Indian post trader L.L. Burns circa 1912, when cowboy star William 
S. Hart, complaining about the accuracy of the garb he had been given, hired 
him to be official supplier of Indian clothing for his pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Burns' company originally was housed in downtown Los Angeles at 7th and 
Figueroa streets in a tiny building. Western moved several times before taking 
up residence in 1932 on Melrose Avenue in a former furniture warehouse. Burns 
lost control of Western during the Depression; the company went through several 
owners until Abramowitz, author Sidney Sheldon and agent Bill Haber bought the 
collection last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Five and half miles of racks of costumes, two more miles of boxes of props," 
Abramowitz commented, showing a shining rack of space suits, copies of the 
Mercury astronaut suits used in "The Right Stuff." To allow Western's costumers 
to authenticate the suits, the Smithsonian, where the originals are stored, 
loaned the company Scott Carpenter's suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have anxiety about all of this every night," Abramowitz said. "But it's 
exciting because we're going to have the flexibility to operate properly. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
When the first shipment of costumes arrived at the North Hollywood site, there 
weren't enough lights to see to unload the dresses; Abramowitz climbed a large 
ladder and changed the florescent fixtures attached to the 24- foot ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is like three airplane hangars," he said of Western's new building. 
"But when it's finished, it will be a lot better for our business to have 
everything on one floor, instead of crawling around six floors trying to find 
something. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hired to transport what Abramowitz calls "the lifeblood of Hollywood" were John 
Marshall Movers of Van Nuys. The cost? "Well into six figures," Abramowitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said: "We've done jobs this huge, but never this type. Nobody's ever 
done this." He explained that most of the moving would be done at night because 
Western will be open during the move, adding, "Traffic wise, it will be better, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Although it's only a 20-minute drive from Hollywood to Western's new 
headquarters in the 125,000-square-foot former printing plant on Vanowen 
Street, Abramowitz said he regrets having to move from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had tried to find a nearby Hollywood building: "We held out hope to 
the last second that we could remain here. We looked at more than 30 buildings. 
But there are very few buildings in Hollywood that could house us." The new 
site is nine acres and cost $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing is, we're leaving Hollywood," said George Santander, the 
women's clothing department director and a Western employee for 25 years. "It 
will probably be good for business, but I still hate to go. I don't think about 
it much right now. I've got too many problems carrying on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's an order," he continued, picking up a form from his worn wooden desk. 
"I'm supposed to ship stuff to a guy at the end of April. But I don't know 
where we'll be then." 
</P>
<P>
Western isn't leaving Hollywood completely. It plans to open retail outlets to 
rent and sell "conventional Halloween-type costumes" throughout Los Angeles; it 
hopes to have a Hollywood site for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Besides clothing and props, all of Western's other facilities will move too, 
including its library -- a rare collection of 10,000 books and periodicals 
dealing with costumes -- shoe, dye, millinery, tailor, paint and leather shops, 
and laundry and dry cleaning facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The clothing is being packed in garment boxes and loaded on sealed trucks, 
which will be opened at the new site by Western employees. 
</P>
<P>
Why the emphasis on security? Because, Abramowitz explained, so much of the 
clothing worn by Hollywood's famous has simply "walked out the door." An entire 
rack of Marilyn Monroe's original movie clothing, for example, disappeared 
years ago. Remaining is a blouse she wore in "The Misfits" and a backup copy of 
a dress fashioned for her for "The Seven Year Itch" in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The Monroe blouse is part of Western's Star Collection, apparel worn by famous 
movie stars. Abramowitz plans to build a public museum at Western's new home 
for the collection, which is unavailable for rent and includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Rudolph Valentino's gold-filled suit of lights worn in "Blood and Sand" and 
his robe from "The Sheik." 
</P>
<P>
* Charlie Chaplin's uniform from "The Great Dictator" and his clown suit from 
"Limelight." 
</P>
<P>
* Charleton Heston's robe from "Moses." 
</P>
<P>
* Dresses from the "Sound of Music"; items from "Gone With the Wind," including 
five original bonnets; an Elvis Presley jacket, and outfits worn by John Wayne, 
Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Natalie Wood and Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Western began producing from original molds -- made by its boot and 
shoemakers -- replicas of Garland's ruby slippers from "The Wizard of Oz." So 
far, it has sold 10 pairs at $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Western owns thousands of pairs of other shoes, all of which will be moved. 
"Just look at these shoes," said Richard Eastman, a stockroom employee who was 
packing the items. "You think Imelda Marcos has shoes? Not like this." 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, one set of tracks Western hopes to leave behind: those of 
the company ghost, who, employees say, has been heard, off and on, for years 
stomping around the second floor at night. "I've heard him," Abramowitz 
admitted. "I don't know who he is, but I've heard him. Maybe he's a satisfied 
customer who never wanted to leave. But I'm hoping he won't move with us."

A RENAISSANCE IN THE NEW VENICE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: AWARD-WINNING TRIO OF STEVEN EHRLICH STRUCTURES ENLIVENS THE 
AREA, RECALLING ABBOT KINNEY'S VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-five years ago, silver-prowed gondolas, piloted by gondoliers imported 
from Venice, Italy, were docked in the Main Lagoon and Grand Canal of "Venice 
in America," a fantasia carved from the tide flats of Ocean Park by developer 
Abbot Kinney. 
</P>
<P>
Colonnades mimicking the Doge's Palace lined the waterways in Kinney's Venetian 
fantasy, a kind of proto-Disneyland conjured on the coast of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
It was, as one contemporary wrote, "a magical transformation of the once-dreary 
expanse" where "surrounded by hot sands, salt water and Kansas farmers, the 
Divine Sarah (Bernhardt) did her stuff in 'Camille' and other masterpieces." 
</P>
<P>
But Kinney's dream failed. The Main Lagoon and Grand Canal were filled in. The 
once-popular Race Through the Clouds roller coaster was dismantled. Venice 
became a slum that in the 1950s and '60s sheltered a community of beatniks and 
hippies and artists enjoying cheap housing with an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the New Venice of the Yuppies, the Main Lagoon, transformed into a 
traffic roundabout named Windward Circle in 1929, has been spruced up by a trio 
of intriguing Post-Modern buildings by architect Steven Ehrlich that evoke the 
history of Kinney's lost vision. 
</P>
<P>
The Ehrlich designs -- named Race Through the Clouds, Windward Circle Arts 
Building and Ace Market Place -- collectively won a 1990 design award from the 
California Council of the American Institute of Architects as "an outstanding 
example of design excellence and innovation." 
</P>
<P>
The trio, which anchors corners of Windward Circle, the pivot of contemporary 
Venice, sets the tone for a second generation of local commercial street 
architecture. That tone is more urbane and sophisticated than the trashy strip 
buildings that have long occupied the gaps between the relics of Kinney's 
Venetian colonnades. 
</P>
<P>
Described by their designer as "an animated container" for Windward Circle, 
each of the three buildings is distinct in appearance. Yet they share a common 
vernacular that Ehrlich says "aims to capture the energy of the past without 
regurgitating history." 
</P>
<P>
Race Through the Clouds features a sinuous, galvanized steel-and-neon stair 
that recalls the roller coaster that once occupied the circle's southern 
corner. With shops below and offices above -- including Ehrlich's own studio -- 
Race Through the Clouds skillfully exploits the simple geometries of a square 
and a circle to evoke a feeling for the site's history. 
</P>
<P>
Across the way, the Ace Market Place, a three-story retail center, enlivens its 
basic building form with the Constructivist jeu d'esprit of projecting metal 
arms topped by wheels threaded with cables. 
</P>
<P>
This playful feature, which derives its inspiration from steam-driven dredger 
shovels that excavated Kinney's original canals, "acts as an identifying 
marquee for the market and expresses a metaphor of old Venice," Ehrlich 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
The Windward Circle Arts Building, on the site of the old Antler Hotel, is the 
most sober design of the Windward Circle trio. 
</P>
<P>
Above the sidewalk shops are two floors of studios intended for resident 
artists. To express this semi-domestic character, the building's front facade 
is capped with miniature peaked roofs above an asymmetrical collage of square 
windows and glazed terraces. The Venetian motif that Kinney introduced in his 
original colonnades is mimicked here in the spiral, metal-faced pillars exposed 
on the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
In his imagination, Ehrlich sees his buildings reflected in the memory of the 
Main Lagoon. For Ehrlich, the ghostly gondoliers that Kinney imported still 
ride at anchor, calling to passers-by that, in the words of the old sign, 
"Everybody in Venice rides in a gondola. Why don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Much as the water mirrored the old buildings and doubled their size by 
reflection, the metaphoric mirroring of the new architecture in its history 
deepens the feeling of presence and meaning," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich, 44, formerly of New Jersey, acquired his poetic dimension during a 
spell in the Peace Corps in the late 1960s. It took him to Morocco, and, later, 
on his own initiative, to Nigeria. There, Ehrlich designed a theater and 
workshop for Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria built of mud, thatch, bamboo and 
concrete. The building fused indigenous architectural forms with modern 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Africa gave Ehrlich a profound respect for architectural simplicity; he later 
expressed that in a series of striking Los Angeles home designs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1981 Kalfus Studio in the Hollywood Hills, his first locally built 
project, the manipulation of natural light through subtly shaped glass walls 
seems to be the main architectural element. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, Ehrlich's design for the nearby Miller-Nazarey house uses 
sliding Japanese shoji screens to filter the hot, white Los Angeles light. That 
creates a feeling of deep domestic refuge within the all-white interior. 
</P>
<P>
While a desire for serenity governs the mood of Ehrlich's houses, his 
non-residential architecture seeks to express a more energetic mode. 
</P>
<P>
The Shatto Recreation Center west of downtown, now under construction, is a 
muscular building marked by a single dramatic curved roof made of galvanized 
metal. The textured concrete block exterior walls have an integral 
rough-grooved pattern designed by artist Ed Moses. The patterning is intended 
to discourage graffiti yet to accept the inevitable without seeming defaced. 
</P>
<P>
In the Windward Circle buildings, Ehrlich is concerned to express "the urban 
edge, where the city meets the sea." He feels, as do many architects, that 
seaside metropolitan regions, such as Venice, act as transitional zones between 
the mysteries of nature and the contrivance of the city; thus, they should echo 
both realities. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice trio also represents a transitional style for Ehrlich between the 
severely orthodox late-Modernism of his houses and a new Post-Modernism 
enlivened by playful historic references. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ehrlich's professional colleagues comment that this very Venetian 
injection of playfulness may be just what he needs to lift his already 
considerable reputation a notch. The sense of fun that characterizes the work 
of Frank Gehry and Morphosis, without compromising its seriousness, could 
leaven Ehrlich's all-too-scrupulous style, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich answers such comments with a statement about his belief in the 
inevitability he seeks in each of his design solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Architecture is all about the discovery of the inevitable," he says. "There 
might be many different ways to do a building, but only one is the truest of 
them all. There's no mistaking that one true solution once you find it."

ANIMAL RESEARCHERS, INDUSTRIES GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST INCREASINGLY 
MILITANT ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT and DAVID TREADWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three decades ago, when the animal rights movement was just reaching into 
public consciousness, its adherents airlifted wild burros marked for death from 
the Grand Canyon, stopped the clubbing of baby seals and took to the high seas 
to fend off whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Now they do that and much more, from staging anti-fur parades to operating a 
frog dissection hot line to burglarizing laboratories and torching a 
multimillion-dollar research facility. They have sent furriers into economic 
shock, forced the withdrawal of untold thousands of dollars from federally 
funded animal experiments and compelled a growing number of companies to stop 
using animals to test for the safety of cosmetics and household products. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, animal rights advocates have become the fastest-growing 
movement in the nation, at least by some counts. Up to 10 million people belong 
to groups ranging from the Humane Society of the United States, which stresses 
animal protection, to such lesser-known entities as Rat Allies and Feminists 
for Animal Rights. 
</P>
<P>
But as animal advocates seek to turn what is still largely a protest movement 
into a long-term popular cause, they face a new and potentially devastating 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The animal-using industries and professions that have borne the brunt of their 
attacks so far have launched a massive, multimillion-dollar counteroffensive. 
The vitriol that is now building on both sides raises two questions: Have 
animal rights activists gone too far? And how far will their opponents go to 
stop them? 
</P>
<P>
The Fur Information Council of America, for example, has spent more than $2 
million so far in a campaign that features, among other things, full-page 
newspaper advertisements that portray animal rightists as violence-prone 
radicals with a bizarre agenda for change. 
</P>
<P>
"Today fur. Tomorrow leather. Then wool. Then meat. . . . After that, medical 
research. Even circuses and zoos," read the ads, which were created by the 
public relations firm of Burson-Marsteller. 
</P>
<P>
The council also tracks activities of animal rights groups. Photographs taken 
by fur retailers at demonstrations have been turned over to the U.S. Department 
of Justice, the council acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Assn. has amassed a war chest of almost $1 
million for targeting legislators, news media and public-opinion makers in 
about 10 states where bills are being considered which would ban the use of 
animal testing for the safety of cosmetics and household products. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in an escalating fight across the country," E. Edward Kavanaugh, CTFA's 
president, told members in announcing the plan. "We are not dealing with 
rational opponents. We are dealing with zealots who cannot comprehend that a 
child's life is more important than a dog's. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn., a longtime foe of anti-vivisectionists, has adopted 
an "action plan" with a price tag of between $15 million and $35 million that 
is designed to "isolate the hard-core activists from the general public" by 
exploiting the differences within the movement over goals and tactics -- 
particularly over the use of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Among other efforts, the plan calls for challenging the tax-exempt status of 
certain nonprofit animal rights groups, forming a special investigative unit 
within the federal government to investigate animal rights activities and 
creating a so-called Foundation for Animal Health to draw funds away from 
animal rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The AMA's crusade got a big image boost when Health and Human Services 
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, former dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine in 
Atlanta, recently vowed to lead the fight against "animal rights terrorists who 
have impeded life-enhancing research." 
</P>
<P>
The biomedical research field in particular has been galvanized. A group of 
beneficiaries of research on animals -- Incurably Ill for Animal Research 
(IFAR) -- have dedicated themselves to battling anti-vivisectionists by 
publicizing their own medical histories. 
</P>
<P>
In response to what he terms "the constant barrage of lies about research 
programs," Charles Nicoll, a Berkeley physiologist in endocrinology, two years 
ago formed the Coalition for Animals and Animal Research. The group, which 
organizes demonstrations and lectures backing animal-based research, has 20 
affiliates on university campuses across the country and, says Nicoll, has 
received 300 requests for information on forming similar pro-research 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the backlash was building, some of the more militant members in the 
animal rights movement had suffered setbacks: 
</P>
<P>
* A federal grand jury in Sacramento is investigating the Animal Liberation 
Front (ALF), a militant underground organization, in connection with break-ins 
throughout the University of California system and other Western research 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
* Later this year, Fran Trutt, a highly publicized animal rights activist, will 
stand trial on charges of attempted murder. She was arrested in November, 1988, 
with a pipe bomb outside the Connecticut offices of the United States Surgical 
Corp., which uses dogs to test surgical staples. Trutt and animal rights 
sympathizers maintain she was set up by agents of the surgical supply company. 
</P>
<P>
* In November, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill to make breaking into 
research facilities a federal crime. Two similar bills are pending in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
* In February, after protracted campaigning, voters defeated an initiative to 
ban the sale of furs in the trendy ski resort of Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the controversy, American public opinion appears divided. A May, 1989, 
Louis Harris poll found more than 57% of respondents thought animal rights 
activists did more good than harm, versus 36% who thought the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallup Poll, conducted for the AMA a year ago, showed 36% of those questioned 
strongly supported the use of animals in biomedical research and 23% strongly 
opposed it. However, 77% thought the use of animals in medical research was 
necessary for progress in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in a March, 1989, ABC News poll, 35% of the people said they wouldn't 
like to own a fur coat because animals were killed, while 23% said the purchase 
price was prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Such numbers dictate a clear strategy for the coalition of industry and 
professional groups that has begun to attack the animal rights cause: 
Concentrate on the issue of vandalism at biomedical research labs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the Animal Liberation Front, which has been tagged as a 
terrorist group by the FBI and California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, has 
claimed more than 100 raids against U.S. research laboratories, resulting in 
"liberated animals" plus $10 million in damages in destroyed equipment. In 
California, the state's Biomedical Assn. estimates damages at $5.6 million, 
$4.5 million caused by the 1987 burning of an unfinished veterinary medicine 
building at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1985 attack on the University of Arizona medical center where 
volunteers were testing a drug to help victims of multiple sclerosis, one MS 
patient founded the Incurably Ill for Animal Research, now a national 
association with 2,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be alive today if it were not for animals in medical research," 
says Cyndi Jelkmann, president of IFAR's Los Angeles chapter. A heart 
transplant patient, Jelkmann has benefited from transplantation techniques 
developed on dogs and sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of statistics for us," says IFAR national director Steve 
Caroll. "It's a matter of life and death." Burned over half of his body in an 
airplane crash, Caroll was saved through a skin graft technique first perfected 
on pigs. 
</P>
<P>
Animal rights groups claim most of the experiments are repetitive, wasteful and 
unnecessary. Cheryl McAuliffe, state director of the Georgia Fund for Animals, 
said "about 90% of biomedical research has nothing to do with saving human or 
animal life." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the hard-line ideology of the most militant advocates that captures 
more of the attention: "A life is a life," declares Chris DeRose, head of the 
Los Angeles-based activist group, Last Chance for Animals. "If the death of one 
rat cured all diseases it wouldn't make any difference to me. In the scheme of 
life we're equal." 
</P>
<P>
It is this kind of ideology that is provoking an equally hard-line reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Orem, a sleep researcher whose Texas Tech lab was raided by ALF last 
summer, says he has been "hardened to the animal rights movement. I had 
sympathy for their welfare concerns, but now I am against their concerns in all 
their forms. That is the danger of a backlash because you always risk 
overreacting." 
</P>
<P>
The February murder of Dr. Hyram Kitchen, dean of the University of Tennessee 
College of Veterinary Medicine, who was gunned down at his Knoxville home, has 
elicited extreme opinions among both animal rights activists and the biomedical 
research community. Although no evidence has been found and most observers 
believe none exists, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating 
a possible link between the death and animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
Said Franklin Loew, dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts 
University, referring to the Kitchen affair, "There are some people in the 
medical research community who in a bizarre and perverse way almost hope there 
is an animal rights link so that any critics of medical research, whether 
moderate or extreme, might be discredited." 
</P>
<P>
Both activists and pro-researchers allow that image is important in choosing 
which experiments to target. Loew points out, "There has not been a highly 
publicized break-in on cancer, heart disease, AIDS or Alzheimer's research, 
four diseases most people would rank at the top of the health hit parade." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the University of California system has been a major 
national target, even though DeRose says that other research institutions 
conduct less humane experiments on animals. But, he says, "UCLA is looked up to 
like a temple. Once it's brought to its knees all the other universities will 
start to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Undeniably, activists have proved better able to grab newspaper column inches 
and media sound bites than their adversaries. As Loew points out, "It's hard to 
make a researcher who discovers a new enzyme as sexy as accusing a guy from a 
blue-chip university of being a torturer." 
</P>
<P>
In describing their plight, advocates for the biomedical research camp also run 
the risk of hyperbole. A March Washington Times editorial stated that 
"scientists are dropping out of medical research like sparrows in a blizzard," 
and quoted Richard Van Sluyters, a visual neuroscientist at Berkeley, as 
reporting "that 30% to 40% of undergraduates quit research careers out of 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sluyters confirms that about 30% of the half-dozen to dozen students who 
approached him last year about entering biomedical research studies were 
frightened away -- or a maximum of four people. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks come as no surprise to animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
"Every social cause, no matter how justified, gets an angry backlash," said Dr. 
Neal Barnard, chairman of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a 
Washington-based anti-vivisectionist organization that has been in the 
forefront of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Many animal advocates, in fact, see the counter assault as the surest sign that 
their crusade is succeeding in its efforts to move into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"I look on their attack as an advantage," said Regina Gavin, New York director 
of the Williamsport, Pa.-based Trans-Species Unlimited, which is a particular 
nemesis of the fur industry. "What it does is open up the public dialogue and 
bring out the issue even more than we could ever do ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Although Trans-species encourages confrontational tactics as part of its 
anti-fur campaign, Gavin said that the group does not condone violence or civil 
disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Carol L. Burnett, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA), a media contact for ALF, said that the counteroffensive was unlikely to 
bring about any changes in the strategies of her organization, which claims a 
membership of 280,000 people nationwide and boasts of being the biggest, most 
broadly active and among the most radical of the new-breed animal advocacy 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
PETA officials point to a major upcoming vegetarian campaign, flagged by the ad 
slogan, "Meat Kills." As forerunners at this latest barricade, activists 
spray-painted two McDonald's outlets in suburban Washington in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The extremist image of some animal advocates already is causing more moderate 
groups allied with the cause to disassociate themselves publicly from the more 
radical elements. 
</P>
<P>
John Hoyt, president of the Washington-based Humane Society of the United 
States, for example, in a speech last month to animal agriculturists at a 
regional seminar in Maryland, took great pains to distinguish between groups 
like his that more correctly should be called "animal welfarist" or "animal 
protectionist" and those groups like PETA that are strict "animal rightists." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike animal rightists, who generally maintain that all animal exploitation is 
immoral and should be abolished, animal protectionists hold that some uses of 
animals for human needs are acceptable as long as the conditions under which 
the animals live and die are as free of unnecessary pain and suffering as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society's Hoyt said that he has been moved in recent months to point 
out such distinctions because he believes that the extremist image of animal 
advocates is making it increasingly difficult to find common ground with 
sympathetic members of the animal farming community and the biomedical research 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt said, for example, that the "small farmer isn't at all happy with 
agribusiness" and might be amenable to joining animal welfarists in encouraging 
more humane livestock and poultry production practices. Similarly, he added, 
there are members of the biomedical research Establishment who would be 
receptive to an alliance to achieve "reasonable reforms in using animals for 
testing and research procedures." 
</P>
<P>
But if they think of all animal advocates as coming from the same extremist 
mold, he said, they are going to be discouraged from entering any such unions 
simply as a matter of economic self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
A similar viewpoint is held by New Yorker Henry Spira, a 62-year-old former 
seaman, union activist and high school teacher who has been involved in the 
animal rights cause for the past 15 years and is one of the leading moderate 
figures in the national movement. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest campaign, which is aimed at factory farming and uses East Coast 
poultry king Frank Perdue as a target, Spira promotes systems that will improve 
the quality of life for both animals and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Spira has followed a similar strategy with great success in his previous 
campaigns, including his classic crusade against the cosmetic industry's 
practice of testing new products in the eyes of rabbits. It opened publicly 
with a full-page advertisement in the New York Times that asked: "How Many 
Rabbits Does Revlon Blind for Beauty's Sake?" 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, his campaign against Perdue was launched last fall with an ad 
challenging Perdue's claim that his animals live a pampered life in a kind of 
"chicken heaven." "Frank, Are You Telling the Truth about Your Chickens?" asks 
the ad, which features a drawing of Perdue with a Pinnochio-like nose at the 
end of which are perched two baby chicks. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they may not publicly disagree with Spira's methods of 
operation, many radical animal rightists do not feel that the gradualist route 
is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals insist that the confrontational approach is necessary to keep the 
issue alive in the public mind. Otherwise, they argue, it runs the risk of 
being submerged by any of a number of other national issues. 
</P>
<P>
Animal-using industries and professions generally are in no mood to temporize. 
They feel that they underestimated the movement when it started gathering 
momentum in the early 1980s and that it has already gained too much ground. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Malbin, a spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Assn., 
contends that the bills pending in 10 states to ban animal testing for safety 
of consumer and household products spell trouble for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Animal testing for product safety must remain as a scientific option," she 
said. "It must not be legislated out of existence. If you didn't have animal 
testing, you wouldn't have products like sun screen, which reduces your chance 
of skin cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the assertions of animal rights activists, she maintained, there are no 
alternatives to provide the kind of data necessary to substantiate the safety 
of many new products or new combinations of old products. 
</P>
<P>
She says that if individual cosmetic companies desire to go to alternative 
methods of testing, that is their right. But, she added, the standpoint of the 
industry as a whole is that it must maintain the option of being able to use 
animals for testing -- an option that should not be excluded by any kind of 
legislation.

PETA SUES WRITER OF MAGAZINE STORY IT CALLS 'FALSE . . . MALICIOUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID TREADWELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals contend the biomedical community 
has hit below the belt in a recent article in Washingtonian magazine about PETA 
founder Alex Pacheco, whose 1981 expose of conditions at a Silver Spring, Md., 
research lab led to the facility's losing its federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
A story in the February issue alleges, among other things, that Pacheco staged 
photographs used as evidence in the Silver Spring lab case, and that PETA has 
used funds for purposes that violate the organization's status as a nonprofit, 
tax-exempt charitable group. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-page article, titled "Beyond Cruelty," was written by free-lancer Katie 
McCabe, a former English teacher who -- the magazine made a point of noting in 
a biographical box -- has made 18 speeches to scientific groups on the subject 
of animal rights for which she has received a total of $6,000 in honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
The article created a considerable stir on Capitol Hill and is being used by 
animal rights opponents across the country -- particularly those in the medical 
community -- to help make their case against the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect backlash, but I didn't expect it to be (so) dirty. I didn't expect 
outright lies," said Ingrid Newkirk, a former chief of animal disease control 
for the District of Columbia who co-founded PETA with Pacheco and serves as its 
national director. 
</P>
<P>
PETA has filed a $3-million lawsuit against McCabe in District of Columbia 
Superior Court, charging the writer with writing "false, defamatory and 
malicious statements" and with "malicious intent" to damage PETA's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the photographs in question is of a macaque monkey named Domitian, who 
is shown hanging from clamps with his head pulled back and arms and legs 
outstretched in a lab restraining chair. The picture has been used in posters 
and other publicity material widely distributed by PETA and has become 
something of a movement icon of animal suffering at the hands of scientific 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco, who gained admittance to the lab by taking a job there as an assistant 
and going in alone at night to document the abuse of the monkeys used in a 
study of spinal-cord injuries, contends the photograph of Domitian was taken 
during a routine experiment. 
</P>
<P>
He also maintains that the allegations of financial misconduct in the article 
relied on two anonymous sources, both of whom are disgruntled former PETA 
employees who were "fired for cause." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe time will show that Ms. McCabe's article was part of an attempt by 
those under siege for wrongdoing and heinous cruelties . . . to distract the 
public and the Congress from the pursuit of overdue reforms by trading in lies 
and distortions," Pacheco said in testimony before the House Subcommittee on 
Health and the Environment, which had the article included in its hearing 
record on a bill to stiffen penalties for lab break-ins and the like authored 
by the committee chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) DAVID TREADWELL

MARINERS LEARN LESSON THE HARD WAY; 
</P>
<P>
NO-HITTER: THEY SAW LANGSTON PITCH BEFORE, BUT NEVER FROM THIS ANGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Harold Reynolds was the first Seattle Mariner to bat against Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
On May 21, he stood behind Langston at second base in a game against New York, 
a teammate in Langston's final game as a Mariner. 
</P>
<P>
He was no teammate Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw that first pitch, it was probably the hardest ball I've ever seen in 
my life from a left-hander," Reynolds said. "The next one was even harder. You 
don't see that when you're playing behind a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Langston began his career as an Angel by throwing four consecutive balls to 
Reynolds, sending him to first. It did not seem a debut to merit $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then he didn't allow a hit over seven innings, combining with Mike Witt on a 
no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw the ball good, good stuff, that was evident," Reynolds said. "It felt 
like once they started giving him the high strike he was hard to hit. He 
pitched a great game. I knew once he settled down he'd be all right." 
</P>
<P>
It was different from playing behind Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"You play behind a guy, you don't face him," Reynolds said. "The only advantage 
I felt I had was on the bases. I knew his moves. He was on. He pitched a great 
game. He's one of the best. He's the best left-hander I've ever faced." 
</P>
<P>
They were friends and teammates, but there was no joy in the Mariner clubhouse 
after the 1-0 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible, Reynolds was asked, to be happy for Langston? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "He pitched a great game. That's good for him. I wish we'd worn 
him out, actually . . . I don't think he's worried about how we feel about it. 
We'll get him again." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre was wearing a stern face. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark threw good," he said. "He had a good hard slider. . . . When he needed to 
get the out, he got it. . . . On the whole, the only thing I feel upset about, 
not upset, disappointed, is we had great pitching ourselves. Good pitching on 
both sides. Unfortunately, it would have taken a no-hitter to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Only the Angels had one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on," Reynolds said. "What can I say? We knew he would be." 
</P>
<P>
They knew he would be on, but that didn't make it easier. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw a no-hitter, man," Lefebvre said. "I don't give a . . . if he's 
throwing power or not. Even a no-hitter isn't hard to swallow. Losing 1-0 is 
hard to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing they could do.

NCAA SUMMARY EXPLAINS FIRING; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: EARNEST RIGGINS WAS FIRED AS SAN DIEGO STATE COACH LAST MAY 
BECAUSE HE REPRESENTED AN EX-PLAYER IN DEALINGS WITH AN AGENT.

Earnest Riggins was fired last May after six seasons as the San Diego State 
women's basketball coach because he violated NCAA rules by representing a 
former athlete in dealings with a player agent, the university said in a 
document released this week. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was contained in a summary of a report the university submitted 
to the NCAA, detailing last spring's school investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said the player was Chana Perry, an All-American center for San Diego 
State who completed her eligibility with the 1988-89 season. Perry is playing 
for a professional team in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The university released the 2 1/2-page summary this week after a request for 
the report by The Times under the California Public Records Act. The university 
has thus far declined to release the complete report on the advice of its 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The summary said the university declined to renew Riggins' contract because he 
violated an NCAA rule prohibiting university personnel from marketing 
student-athletes to professional teams and organizations or receiving direct or 
indirect compensation for such services. It does not say that Riggins gained 
any benefits from the dealings described. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins has denied violating NCAA rules and said the university has 
misinterpreted his actions. He said his termination was improper and is 
contesting it through the California State University system's grievance 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, 52, also contends he was a victim of sex and race discrimination by 
the university because he is a black male who was coaching a women's team, and 
he filed a separate grievance on these charges. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said both grievances have been denied at two levels within the 
university system. He said a hearing on the improper termination grievance has 
been scheduled for May 11, before an arbitrator from the American Arbitration 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The university said in the summary that the investigation conducted by the 
athletic department began in April of 1989 and concluded that Riggins helped 
fill out an agreement that served as a basis for a contract the player 
(identified by Riggins as Perry) signed with an agent a week later. It also 
said that Riggins led "the discussion" in at least one meeting with the agent 
and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said he did fill in portions of the agreement but only on the 
instructions of Perry, to be used as a guide for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said that after the 1988-89 season he introduced Perry to the agent, 
whom he identified as Joe Betancourt of Crystal City, Tex. But, he said, he was 
never attempting to arrange a contract for Perry and denied leading the talks.

BY DESIGN, IT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR NICKLAUS

When Jack Nicklaus won his first tournament on the PGA Senior Tour two weeks 
ago, it was on a course he designed. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus didn't design the PGA National Golf Club where the PGA Seniors' 
Championships starts today, but he knows his way around since he lives 10 
minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
The Seniors' championship has been played on PGA National since 1982, but the 
veterans will see a different course since dramatic alterations have been made 
in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes were made by, you guessed it, Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no home-course advantage," Nicklaus insisted Wednesday. "I had to play 
a couple of practice rounds here this week just to see what I've done. It's 
coming along nicely, even though it's young and immature in some places. The 
greens have a nice pace to them and were much smoother (Wednesday) than 
(Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
The competition for Nicklaus includes former champions Gary Player (1986), 
Arnold Palmer (1984) and Larry Mowry (1989), not to mention another senior tour 
rookie, Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus' competitors aren't concerned that he knows the layout so well. In 
fact, they're glad he made the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big improvement," Player said. "There is a much better design to the 
greens and bunkers." 
</P>
<P>
Added Palmer: "It's better than it was. The grass is smoother, more consistent. 
I don't think you can say it's easier or harder than it was before. It depends 
on the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Sarazen, who won the tournament in 1954, was honored Tuesday night at the 
past champions dinner. He has been a member of the PGA of America since March 
15, 1921, longer than any man alive. The PGA was organized in January, 1916.

Clipper guard Jay Edwards, on the suspended list since March 3 after failing an 
NBA-administered drug test, will undergo surgery Friday to repair the patellar 
tendon in his left knee, the team announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards missed most of training camp and then spent 43 games of the regular 
season on the injured list because of an ongoing problem with tendinitis in the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, to be performed in Santa Monica by team physician Dr. Tony Daly, 
is expected to keep the former Big Ten player of the year off the basketball 
court for approximately 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, one of three rookies in the league to receive a season-long suspension 
after testing positive for an undisclosed drug, is also continuing treatment at 
the ASAP substance-abuse center in Van Nuys. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

HOUSEBUSTER DUSTS OFF WEAK COMPETITION; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: HE GETS SIXTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY AGAINST ONLY TWO OTHER HORSES 
IN A NON-BETTING RACE AT KEENELAND.

Housebuster chased away all but two opponents in the $76,200 Lafayette Stakes 
at Keeneland Wednesday, and those two horses also had little business leaving 
their barns. 
</P>
<P>
In a glorified workout, Housebuster won his sixth consecutive race, beating 
Sacra Hoxen by 11 lengths, with Critical Choice, who was beaten by 38 lengths, 
reaching the finish line several seconds later. Irish Spell, also entered in 
the seven-furlong race, was scratched and will continue to run against maidens 
in a start here today. 
</P>
<P>
There's always an eerie feeling to races at Keeneland, the only track in the 
country that doesn't use an announcer, and the running of the Lafayette was 
even stranger, because there was no betting on the race. Keeneland made the 
stake a betless exhibition and received permission from the state to add a 10th 
race to the program, giving its fans nine betting races as usual. There hadn't 
been a non-betting race here since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Had there been betting, so much money would have been bet on Housebuster to win 
that Keeneland would have had to use some of its own funds for the payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster, ridden by Craig Perret, broke on top as usual and ran the first 
six furlongs in 1:08 4/5, just two-fifths of a second slower than the Keeneland 
record. The 3-year-old colt's final time on a drying-out, fast track was 1:22 
4/5, which missed the Keeneland record by 1 3/5 seconds. Perret went to his 
whip only once, hitting Housebuster on the left flank in midstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster's trainer, Jimmy Croll, and his owner, Bob Levy, have been adamant 
about not running the horse in the Kentucky Derby on May 5, and Wednesday's 
cakewalk didn't change their feelings. The next race for the Mt. Livermore-Big 
Dreams colt is scheduled to be the one-mile Derby Trial at Churchill Downs two 
weeks from Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The major goal for Housebuster is the six-furlong Breeders' Cup Sprint at 
Belmont Park in the fall, which his interests hope will lead to an Eclipse 
Award as the year's best sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said Wednesday that the Preakness, the second race in the Triple Crown 
series, is a possibility for Housebuster, whose only loss came the first time 
he ran -- a third-place finish at the Meadowlands last October. The Preakness, 
which at 1 3/16 miles is a quarter-mile shorter than the Derby, is scheduled 
for May 19 at Pimlico, a track that can favor speed horses. 
</P>
<P>
"We could run in the Preakness," Levy said. "But I'd say that the odds are 
about 25-1 that we'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
Croll doesn't even like the sound of the Preakness. "They (the owners) are 
thinking about it," the trainer said. "But I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
The $250,000 Blue Grass Stakes still looks as if it will have a seven-horse 
field at Keeneland Saturday, but the identities of two of the entries have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, who had a slow workout the other day, came up with a reason: He 
has been coughing, and trainer Chris Speckert said he will miss the race. 
Pleasant Tap could still run in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland April 24. 
</P>
<P>
A new contender for the Blue Grass is Iskandar Elakbar, who has made only three 
starts. Owned by Steve Stavro, who won the Blue Grass in 1988 with Granacus, 
Iskandar Elakbar won a maiden race at Gulfstream Park last month, but the 
Canadian-bred was beaten by more than 30 lengths in his other two starts. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who will be favored in the Blue Grass, worked a half-mile on a 
muddy track Wednesday morning in :48 4/5. The other Blue Grass starters will be 
Unbridled, Shot Gun Scott, Land Rush, Top Snob and Slew of Angels.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE LAST SIGN-OFF TO THE MANY VOICES OF RAY GOULDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were probably one o'clock classes in astronomy, Greek history or physical 
geography that, if I had taken them, would have changed my life. But, when I 
went back to college after a khaki interruption, you didn't take one o'clock 
classes if you could humanly avoid them, because that was when you listened to 
"Matinee With Bob and Ray" on WHDH in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Ray was Ray Goulding, who died the other day after a long battle with 
kidney disease. In 1946, he was a newscaster at the station and Bob Elliott was 
a disc jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Their show's theme was a peppy tune called "Collegiate," more recognizable for 
its melody than its title. What followed had the same appeal to inquiring 
minds, I suppose, as Mad magazine, the National Lampoon, Pogo, Stan Freberg and 
Li'l Abner. It saw the world and its ways as fit material for silliness, the 
nonsense that lurks just half a step beyond solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
One of their creations was a cooking hostess named Mary McGoon, and few will 
now remember that she was based on the pioneer radio kitchen person Mary 
Margaret McBride. Their Mary ran for President ("Racing With McGoon"), trading 
on the popularity of her Half-Baked Indian Pudding and her quince and kumquat 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
They once did a small-businessman's seminar ("I'm Waldo Sturdley and I'm three 
inches tall; please pass the grape drink"), filling a whole table with their 
apparently endless supply of voices. 
</P>
<P>
Ray was Steve Bosco, their sportscaster who signed off with "This is Steve 
Bosco, rounding third and being thrown out at home") and whose frequent message 
to headquarters was "Everything's gonna be all right, send more loot," a catch 
phrase that had a special appeal to dollar-short scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Bob was Wally Ballou, their adenoidal on-the-spot reporter who got everything 
crisply and authoritatively wrong, as, most famously, when he described a brick 
wall because he inadvertently faced the wrong way at a parade. 
</P>
<P>
It was radio poking fun at radio. And, as always with radio, what Bob and Ray 
did invited the imagination to see those small tycoons passing the grape drink 
and never getting around to discussing much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
Their continuing feature was "Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife" ("the story of a 
young girl from a deserted mining town out West who becomes the wife of 
handsome Larry Backstayge, the idol of a million other women"). It was a parody 
of a successful soap opera, "Mary Noble, Backstage Wife," whose own premise was 
not greatly different. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in late April, 1954, television began live coverage of what has gone into 
history as the Army-McCarthy hearings, the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy's 
investigation of Communists and Communist influence in the government and in 
the Army. It was reality television at its most watchable, and millions of us 
set everyday chores aside to follow the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In what I think was their finest hour, Bob and Ray mirrored the hearings in a 
long sequence on "Mary Backstayge," in which Larry tries to get zoning 
permission to build a 12-story summer skyscraper home on his Long Island 
estate. This brought him dead against Zoning Commissioner Carstairs, whose low, 
mocking and insinuating voice (Goulding's) was extraordinarily like McCarthy's. 
The other principals in the hearings found their counterparts in the zoning 
case. One of the defense attorneys became "our beloved dogcatcher, Roy 
Perkins." 
</P>
<P>
Television had already taken a whack at Sen. McCarthy, in the form of Edward R. 
Murrow's courageous "See It Now" program a few weeks before the hearings began, 
so the Bob and Ray effort was not unprecedented. Two generations later, it is 
also probably impossible to convey the apparent power and the real fear (not of 
disclosure but of malign destruction) that the senator represented, and the 
courage it took to challenge him, not least as farce on a heavily sponsored 
morning radio program. 
</P>
<P>
But the reduction to absurdity by Bob and Ray of the acrid infighting of the 
hearings was indeed its own brave and lethal whack at McCarthy. The combination 
of fact and foolishness and the daily revelations by television of the senator 
in action proved a kind of one-two-three punch. The Senate shortly thereafter 
voted 67-22 to condemn its colleague from Wisconsin for his irresponsible 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the hearings, Bob and Ray had left Boston and were doing the 
morning show on a New York station. They were also en route to becoming a 
national treasure, through their commercials and later on NBC's "Monitor" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
They tried television early, but it was not their medium, any more than it had 
been Fred Allen's. You couldn't make visible what the mind's eye saw as you 
listened to their vast and varied company of voices. (I do remember Ray as Mary 
McGoon in an apron giving a recipe at a serving window between kitchen and 
dining room, the arrangement tactfully serving to conceal his round and jovial, 
distinctly masculine face.) 
</P>
<P>
A Broadway show in more recent years worked better -- mostly, I suspect, 
because a couple of generations (at least) of Bob and Ray fans wanted at long 
last to see what their heroes really looked like. 
</P>
<P>
They had a fine run, Bob and Ray, more than 40 years of inventive, clever and 
gentle humor. (Their send-up of the hearings was probably the more telling 
because it was so deceptively gentle.) I hope that their kind of unabrasive, 
uncaustic comedy is not lost to us, although we've lost one of its masters.

PHILHARMONIC SUSPENDS BASSIST LIEBERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Philharmonic bassist Barry Lieberman was suspended for six months 
without pay Tuesday night for allegedly assaulting a fellow bass player at a 
children's concert at the Wiltern Theatre two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was the latest in a series of difficulties between Lieberman and 
others in the Philharmonic organization, including claims made at a news 
conference two months ago of harassment by a substitute violinist. 
</P>
<P>
Philharmonic personnel manager Irving Bush declined to discuss the specifics of 
the Lieberman matter but did confirm that the bassist had been suspended for 
"assaulting one of the other bass players in the orchestra with his bass" and 
uttering obscenities while children were present. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman -- who says Bush's violinist daughter Nicole has harassed him and his 
wife ever since they were married three years ago -- acknowledged in an 
interview Wednesday that he "blew up" and cursed at stand partner Jack Cousin 
at the children's concert but denied that he attacked him. Lieberman said he 
has not decided whether to contest the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman says he accidentally bumped Cousin with his instrument as they were 
leaving the stage after the concert. Lieberman then claims that Cousin made an 
insulting remark to his wife, fellow orchestra member Maria Larionoff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I blew up," Lieberman said. "I started yelling and screaming, 
"I've had enough of this . . . I can't stand it any more." 
</P>
<P>
Cousin did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
An orchestra official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "Lieberman . . 
. shoved his bass into the back of his stand partner's legs when they were 
leaving the stage and uttered all sorts of profanities. He said, 'Move, you 
so-and-so and get that so-and-so bass out of my way,' and then he shoved his 
bass into his legs." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman and Larionoff claimed at their February news conference that Nicole 
Bush made thousands of crank phone calls to their house and threw rocks and 
eggs at the home of Larionoff's mother. At that time, they filed a lawsuit 
against the Musicians Union, which had censured them for making accusations 
against Bush to orchestra officials. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Bush has denied the couple's claims.

EXXON MUST RESTORE SHORES, LUJAN DECLARES 
</P>

Exxon Corp. must restore the soiled Alaska environment after it finishes 
cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill, Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan 
Jr. said Wednesday after he spent two days touring areas affected by the Exxon 
Valdez spill. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calling on Exxon to restore the grease-coated shores to 
pre-spill conditions, Lujan said the time has come to resume offshore drilling, 
which was suspended after the tanker struck a reef and lost 11 million gallons 
of oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said that the freeze on drilling off California, Florida and Alaska 
should be ended. He also predicted approval of controversial drilling plans for 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska and a federal auction 
of tracts there in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan reiterated the need for further environmental efforts by Exxon, but his 
overall message was that the Bush Administration wanted to get back into the 
federal oil tract leasing business. 
</P>
<P>
Federal offshore oil and gas leasing was put on hold in various places, and 
Congress even placed a moratorium on drilling in Alaska's Bristol Bay, a rich 
fishing ground where leases had been sold before the Exxon Valdez spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for all kinds of ways to open it up," Lujan said of the offshore 
areas picked for drilling. "We're very dedicated to move ahead with it again in 
an environmentally sensitive manner." 
</P>
<P>
Money might turn the heads of drilling opponents in coastal states, Lujan said. 
"One of the things we're looking at is to share oil revenues with the local 
communities, so the local community doesn't just have the impact and no money 
to take care of it. So that might reduce some of the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said he had neither the authority nor the desire to cancel the Bristol 
Bay lease sale -- which three Alaska governors tried unsuccessfully to stop 
before the Exxon spill. He said: "If I do it for Alaska, then Florida will be

1,500 PRINTS IN ART FRAUD PROBE CALLED AUTHENTIC; 
</P>
<P>
APPRAISAL: HOWEVER, SOURCES SAY THE NUMBERS, SUPPLIED BY THE BEVERLY HILLS 
GALLERY, MAY BE MISLEADING. THE POLICE INQUIRY IS CONTINUING.

More than 1,500 of the expensive prints that art-forgery investigators seized 
in a raid of an Upstairs Gallery store in Beverly Hills have been deemed 
authentic by experts hired by the art chain, an attorney for the gallery said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles police and district attorney's officials said their 
investigation into possible criminal art fraud by the gallery continues. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we have a criminal investigation and that there have been 
numerous forgeries found" among the prints seized by federal and local 
authorities in a raid of the Rodeo Drive gallery last September, Police 
Detective William Martin said. "Nobody has been charged, but it is still under 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Police and district attorney's officials declined to comment on the gallery's 
figures, which show that 1,506 of the 1,648 confiscated works were judged to be 
authentic by nationally renowned art experts Howard Russeck, Martin Gordon and 
Bernard Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the probe warned that the gallery's numbers could be 
misleading, because the 1,506 works that the gallery said were authentic 
actually are copies of a handful of prints. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining 142 artworks, the sources said, may be forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
"If one were holding 1,500 images, 1,400 of which were the same image, by the 
same artist and found to be legitimate," said one source, who asked not to be 
identified, "that -- contrasted with an additional 100 prints of different 
images, by different artists and a high percentage of which were fake -- would 
mean (the gallery's figures) were misleading. The gallery should give a 
breakdown by artist. That would be more accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs Gallery lawyer E. Timothy Applegate declined to say which of the 
confiscated prints -- which investigators charged had been falsely credited to 
the late Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall and Joan Miro -- were judged to be fakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigators gave the raw figures. So did we," Applegate said. "I think 
that releasing the breakdown (by artists) would be misleading." 
</P>
<P>
Applegate said he expects the authentic works to be returned to the Upstairs 
Gallery soon. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery hired Russeck, Ewell and Gordon to examine the prints shortly after 
the raid, Applegate said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hired them at considerable cost to us," the attorney said. "We selected 
them not only for their stature but for their acceptability to the 
authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Applegate said Gordon and Ewell are frequent witnesses in federal cases 
involving the authenticity of Dali and Chagall works. Russeck is regarded as a 
leading appraiser of Miro. None of the art appraisers returned telephone calls 
from The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business and our reputation suffered" after the raid, Applegate said. "It 
is our hope that (the results of the examination) further improve our 
reputation. I think in the long run, this may be positive. There was a problem; 
we were not aware of it. We did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery has been beset by other problems in the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
In October, prosecutors leveled a five-count grand theft charge against Lee 
Sonnier, the former manager of the gallery, accusing him of failing to deliver 
four pieces of art sold for about $872,000. Court documents allege that Sonnier 
and Manhattan Beach art broker Frank de Marigny, who was arrested in September, 
"conspired to sell and distribute fraudulent artworks."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES FILED IN DEATH OF MADD DIRECTOR'S 
SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors filed charges of murder, vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving 
Wednesday against a San Jose-area man who police said was drunk when his 
Cadillac smashed head-on into a pickup, killing the son of the Los Angeles 
director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
Darshan Grewal, a 42-year-old lab technician who has two previous drunk driving 
convictions, was charged with causing the high-speed collision last Saturday on 
California 18 in the Antelope Valley just west of the San Bernardino County 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The crash killed Adam R. DeJesus, 19, of Canoga Park, whose mother is Marcy 
DeJesus, head of the Los Angeles chapter of the nationwide organization. 
</P>
<P>
Grewal remained in fair condition at San Bernardino County Hospital in San 
Bernardino, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was to be transferred today to that 
county's jail ward, said Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz. 
</P>
<P>
Shanya Roberson, 19, a passenger in DeJesus' truck, was in fair condition at 
Palmdale Hospital Medical Center.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL PUT IN 'LOCK DOWN' FOR 2ND TIME IN 3 
WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles was "locked down" Wednesday 
afternoon for the second time in three weeks as sheriff's deputies once again 
searched the nation's largest jail for a gun that they believed had been 
smuggled in. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was found during the lock down, which began at noon and ended at 3:30 
p.m. The move came after bailiffs found bullets in a bag containing the 
belongings of an inmate who had been transported from the jail to Los Angeles 
Superior Court in Torrance, said Asst. Sheriff Richard Foreman, who oversees 
county jails. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman said deputies became suspicious because the inmate, who was not 
identified, is housed in the same area where deputies found marijuana, money 
and a handmade knife -- but no gun -- during a search three weeks ago. As it 
turned out, the bullets were never inside the jail. Foreman said they were 
confiscated when the inmate was arrested and had been placed in the property 
bag.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 5, CRITICAL AFTER SWIMMING POOL 
ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 5-year-old girl was in critical condition Wednesday after she and her 
3-year-old sister almost drowned while playing in their grandparents' swimming 
pool in Fullerton, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Randi Newkirk of Walnut was breathing with the help of a ventilator Wednesday 
evening at Children's Hospital of Orange County. Dr. Ralph Rucker, director of 
pulmonary services at the hospital, said she was in "bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
Her younger sister, Robyn, was in fair condition at St. Jude Hospital in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' grandmother spotted Robyn floating face down in the pool about 1 
p.m., authorities said. She pulled her from the pool, but could not find Randi 
and went to call rescuers. Within minutes, a Fullerton Fire Department engineer 
found the girl at the bottom of the pool. When he pulled her out she was not 
breathing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn was revived by paramedics.

BLIND WOMAN'S LAWSUIT AGAINST RTD TOSSED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit brought by a blind woman who said she was knocked down and trampled 
by passengers during an incident aboard an RTD bus has been dismissed, 
attorneys said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Millicent Collinsworth sought unspecified damages in her suit charging that the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District was negligent in operating an 
overcrowded bus and not providing a safe place for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Robert W. Zakon ruled Monday in a 
pretrial hearing that the suit contained "no tryable issues of fact" -- a 
decision that led to its dismissal, said RTD attorney Jerry Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner ruled that the bus company didn't have a duty to protect 
(Collinsworth)," said Janet Gullixson, the blind woman's attorney. Gullixson 
said she will appeal the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The suit grew out of a 1987 incident that later became the basis for a 
television movie. Collinsworth, accompanied by her guide dog, was returning to 
her Hollywood home on a bus she had boarded in Westwood. Investigators said a 
passenger wearing a backpack and standing on the crowded bus "went berserk" and 
began flailing his arms and demanding to be let off. 
</P>
<P>
In the commotion, the man's backpack apparently struck Collinsworth in the 
face, cutting her lip. Gullixson said the disturbed passenger also stepped on 
Collinsworth's dog, a Labrador retriever, and knocked the woman to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Collinsworth said she pushed her way off the bus with her guide dog and walked 
more than 15 blocks to her home without anyone offering to help her. 
</P>
<P>
She said that, at first, she did not know her lip had been cut in the scuffle. 
She said she mistook the blood from her nose and mouth for tears, and realized 
she was hurt only when she arrived home and reached for her keys and discovered 
her hands were sticky with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey said Collinsworth reported no injuries to the bus driver. "If we had 
been told that there was a passenger hurt, we could have stopped," he said. 
"What can we do to help her if we had no knowledge that she was hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
Gullixson countered that the RTD "has rules that blind people should sit behind 
the bus driver -- obviously so the drivers can watch them."

FAA RULE THREATENS SAFETY ABOVE LAX, PILOTS' GROUP CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The busy airspace over seven U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International 
Airport, has been declared "critically deficient" in safety by an airline 
pilots' group because of an FAA rule that gives air traffic controllers more 
latitude in determining how far apart to keep planes. 
</P>
<P>
The seven locations -- areas of rigidly controlled airspace called Terminal 
Control Areas -- were placed on a "Black Star' list by the 70-member 
International Federation of Air Lines Pilots Assns., meeting this week in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The change was instituted at the seven locations in 1988 as part of a two-year 
test program. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous FAA rules, planes were required to be at least three miles 
apart. Under the change, which the pilots' group says was quietly instituted by 
the FAA, the controller "can now let aircraft get as close as he wants, as long 
as in his judgment they will not collide," according to Capt. Henry Duffy, 
president of the U.S. Air Line Pilots Assn., which is associated with the 
international group. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles spokesman for the federal agency Wednesday defended the FAA's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a compromise of air safety," FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said. 
"This was done with full cognizance of the airlines in 1988. It's a test 
program. The objective is to reduce the near-midair-collisions possibility, 
increase service to the pilots and to handle more air traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said in a prepared statement that the newly adopted Black Star 
designations were aimed at the controlled airspace at the seven locations -- 
not the airports beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Black Star rating does not mean that these Terminal Control Areas are 
'unsafe,' " he said. "It simply means that they now have a safety deficiency 
that warrants notification of airline pilots worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Though the FAA instituted the change two years ago, the pilots' association did 
not discover the "positive separation" rule change at LAX and the six other 
sites until late last year, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Los Angeles, the Terminal Control Areas added to the "Black Star" list 
include Charlotte, N.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, 
Philadelphia and Phoenix..

GIANT-KILLER MONTCLAIR PREP SLAYS AGOURA FOR TITLE, 6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Steele's fears that his top-ranked Montclair Prep team would be short on 
pitching and emotion were erased Wednesday by one swing from Keyaan Cook and a 
strong pitching performance from Scott Saklad. 
</P>
<P>
Cook hit a grand slam and Saklad allowed only four hits as the Mounties 
defeated Agoura, 6-1, in the championship game of the Thousand Oaks tournament. 
Montclair Prep (15-2), the No. 1-ranked team in the Southern Section 1-A 
Division but the smallest school in the tournament, was coming off a 7-6 upset 
of previously unbeaten El Camino Real on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about an emotional letdown," said Steele, Montclair Prep's coach. 
"It was a big win, but we wanted to keep a consistent tempo." 
</P>
<P>
That was cured when Cook, a 5-foot-10, 215-pound senior shortstop, gave the 
Mounties a 4-0 lead when he sent a fastball from Bob Kazmirski (2-4) over the 
left-field fence with two out in the third inning. Cook hit a three-run home 
run against El Camino Real and was five for 12 with eight runs batted in during 
the four-game tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Keyaan has been struggling lately, but really started to get his rhythm 
going," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
Saklad, making only his second appearance in three weeks, also was in tune. A 
short reliever who had thrown only 6 1/3 innings all season, Saklad (1-0) 
retired 10 batters in a row at one point. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just hoping for four innings from him, but after five innings he had 
only thrown 62 pitches so we stuck with him," Steele said. "He really picked us 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Saklad lost the shutout in the sixth when Josh Smaler, an all-tournament 
selection, hit a two-out solo home run. Saklad walked two in the seventh and 
was relieved by freshman Chris Ferebee, who struck out the two batters he 
faced.

"I wasn't nervous because I hadn't thrown in a while and not much was expected 
from me," Saklad said. "I just wanted to keep the ball down and throw 
groundballs." 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep, which failed to advance past the first day of the tournament 
the previous two years, extended its lead to 5-0 in the fourth. Russell Ortiz 
-- an all-tournament selection -- reached on an error, went to second on a 
fielder's choice, and scored on Shad Knighton's two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties added a run in the fifth when Cook singled, moved to second on a 
ground out, and scored on a hit-and-run single from Brent Polacheck. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (7-8), winner of five consecutive games, had runners in scoring position 
three times but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
"We just weren't aggressive at the plate and it hurt us," Agoura Coach Gary 
Gray said. "(Saklad) wasn't overpowering, but he was around the plate and kept 
us off balance."

ST. BERNARD FINDS ACE ST. ANTHONY HURLER NO PUZZLE IN 10-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
St. Bernard High School's Sean Dunbar has already figured out what most Camino 
Real League baseball players still want to know: the secret to hitting St. 
Anthony ace Eric Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney, a 6-foot-3 left-handed power pitcher, has baffled most of the league's 
teams this season, including El Segundo, the top-ranked team in the Division 
2-A. 
</P>
<P>
But so far he hasn't fooled Dunbar, who hit a pair of home runs off Mooney in 
St. Bernard's 10-2 victory Wednesday over host St. Anthony at Guesno Field in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The key: "You've got to jump on the first one you see," said Dunbar, St. 
Bernard's junior second baseman. "Otherwise, he'll make you hit his pitch." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning Wednesday, Mooney left a fastball up over the plate and 
Dunbar stroked it the opposite way over the 286-foot marker on the right-field 
fence for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Leading off the second, Dunbar drilled Mooney's first pitch of the inning -- 
another fastball -- over the 312-foot sign in right for a solo shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I like that alley," Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the second time Mooney has been hit hard by St. Bernard this 
season. He struck out 13 but gave up nine hits and four walks. Mooney (4-4) was 
also hurt by five St. Anthony errors, four of which came in St. Bernard's 
five-run first. 
</P>
<P>
The high-kicking left-hander was also victimized by stolen bases. St. Bernard 
pulled off seven thefts on the afternoon, including two steals of home -- one 
by Jeff Richardson in the first inning and another by John Coleman, the South 
Bay's leading base-stealer, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Mooney wasn't holding runners on base too well," St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall 
said. "That's the first time we've ever stolen home twice in one game. It was 
kind of shady over there by third base, and Mooney didn't have a good view of 
the runner." 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard first baseman Phil Ruhl added a homer and a double for two RBIs. 
Right-hander Andy Diver (6-1) allowed only one run -- a homer by Mooney -- en 
route to the victory. St. Anthony got its second run on a homer by Sylvester 
Harris off reliever Grant Hohman. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves St. Bernard (11-2 overall, 7-1 in league) into a first-place 
tie with El Segundo. St. Anthony (7-8, 6-2) drops to third. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo was a 13-4 winner over St. Bernard last Friday. The next match-up 
between the league-leading teams won't come until May 11, the last day of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids were on a mission today," Yarnall said. "We felt some of our momentum 
was taken away in the El Segundo game by the umpires. So we were out to prove 
that we're a good baseball team." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 3, St. Ignatius of San Francisco 0 -- Lopsided victories have become 
almost routine for El Segundo, a team averaging 13 runs a game. Occasionally, 
though, the Eagles have had to rely on their fine pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case Wednesday, as senior right-hander Rob Croxall pitched a 
six-hit shutout in the first round of the San Luis Obispo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (15-2) will meet either Hueneme of Oxnard or San Luis Obispo in the 
second round of the eighth-team tournament at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Croxall (5-1), who entered Wednesday's game with a team-leading 1.29 ERA, 
struck out six and walked three. The Eagles supported him with one run in the 
first inning and two in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lewis tripled in the first and scored on Garret Quaintance's double. With 
two outs in the fifth, Jason Wayt with another single, and quaintance scored on 
a throwing error.

<P>
Mike Rooney relieved struggling starter Tim Wimbish in the second inning and 
allowed three runs over the next 5 2/3 innings as Cal Lutheran rallied to 
defeat Pepperdine, 11-8, in a nonconference game in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second time in as many seasons that Cal Lutheran (19-10) had 
defeated Pepperdine (26-15). Rooney (3-3) allowed two hits, walked three and 
struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran scored four times in the third to take a 5-4 lead, added two in 
the sixth and four in the seventh. Chris Matkin relieved Rooney with one on and 
one out in the eighth. Pepperdine cut the lead to 11-8 in the inning, but 
Matkin pitched a scoreless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Washington was two for three with a home run and three runs batted in for 
Cal Lutheran. Manny Alvarez and Leonard Matsumoto each added three hits. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
The Master's 8, Westmont 7 -- The Mustangs scored three runs in the sixth 
inning and two in the seventh to win the NAIA District 3 game at Reese Field. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-6, after 6 1/2 innings, Master's (19-15, 9-7 in District 3) scored 
in the seventh on consecutive singles by Sheldon Sparks, Russ Henzie, Craig 
Johnson and Andy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, who was three for five, extended his hitting streak to a school-record 
19 games by singling in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Simpson (3-5), who relieved John March, gave up a two-run home run to the 
first batter he faced in the fifth inning, Jeff Kliewer. But he settled down 
after that to pick up the win. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson gave up six hits and two earned runs in five innings, while striking 
out three and walking no one. 
</P>
<P>
He retired the last nine batters he faced after giving up a leadoff single in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Master's narrowed a 7-3 deficit to one run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Martin slugged a one-out solo home run to start the rally and Jeff Preston was 
hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacArthur doubled Preston to third, and Jeff Cole doubled in MacArthur and 
Preston. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who was three for four with a home run (his fourth) and two doubles, 
drove in four runs and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Ebarb (2-2) took the loss for Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
Valley 9, East L.A. 8 -- Valley's Mark Cavarretta went from goat to hero in a 
nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Cavarretta had a two-run throwing error in the fourth as East 
L.A. built a 7-3 lead at Valley, but his two-out single in the ninth scored the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Carroll (3-2) pitched two innings of scoreless relief to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cavarretta had a double and two singles, and third baseman John Stephens had a 
triple and two singles to lead Valley (13-17-2). East L.A. is 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
Valley catcher Ed Aguilar tied the game at 8-8 with a two-run double in the 
eighth.

NORTHRIDGE CLINCHES VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge men's team clinched its first Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. playoff berth with a 15-10, 15-4, 15-12 win over Brigham Young 
on Wednesday night in Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The win ended a frustrating period for the Matadors, who had needed to win just 
one of their final six WIVA matches to secure the berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge dropped four consecutive matches, including a straight-game loss 
to UC Santa Barbara a week ago, entering two season-ending matches against BYU. 
The Matadors conclude their regular season Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Rafael Tulino's 17 kills and Mark Root's 16, the Matadors accomplished 
the mission. Coley Kyman also had 12 kills for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The win boosted Northridge to 12-10 overall, 7-8 in conference play, and 
clinched second place in the WIVA. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors with will meet the third-place team from the Harry Wilson Division 
in first-round playoff action April 25 at Northridge.

AFTER A 21-YEAR BREAK, SWEETWATER WINS TITLE

<P>
Memories of the 1969 Sweetwater baseball team are growing more faint. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 21 years since a high school baseball team from National City had 
won a tournament championship, the Lions unlimited title. But Sweetwater blew 
the dust from the archives Wednesday with a 7-5, come-from-behind victory over 
Granite Hills in the AAA division final of the Lions tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"People think of Sweetwater as being so good in football and basketball, but no 
one ever thinks we do anything in baseball," Sweetwater Coach Gene Alim said. 
"And if they do, they always remember the 1969 team. We talked about that this 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
The pep talk endured through the day. Sweetwater had a tough morning semifinal 
against Orange Glen but escaped with a 6-4 victory. Granite Hills advanced by 
beating San Diego, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they reached the final, both teams had well-used pitching staffs, 
and each needed four more pitchers before the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to the survival of the fittest," Granite Hills Coach Gordie 
Thompson said. "Both clubs had gotten 100% out of their kids by the time we got 
to this game." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the sixth rolled around, Sweetwater trailed, 5-3, and was scraping 
to survive. Averaging 10 hits a game, the Red Devils had just five after five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Back-to-back singles by Mike Romero and Frank Castro were the start of a 
three-run, five-hit sixth for Sweetwater. The singles and two passed balls put 
runners on second and third with one out, and Juan Lopez lined one to center to 
score Romero and move Castro to third. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills' Shane Spencer had thrown seven innings in the morning but told 
Thompson he felt good and wanted to pitch. With runners on first and third, 
Spencer replaced Jason Gandy, who had given up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Spencer balked in Castro for the tying run, and the winning run came off a 
single to center field by Fernando Rodriguez, which scored Lopez from third to 
make it 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills (12-5-1) threatened in the sixth, but third baseman Raul Sanchez, 
made a diving catch to end the inning, stranding a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (14-4) also scored in the seventh on Sanchez's RBI double to left 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted this tournament," said Sanchez, who is batting .558. "This 
was important to us. We've had a couple of losses and we had something to prove 
to the rest of the county."

All it took was a pep talk by Paul Mossuto. 
</P>
<P>
And when he followed it with a triple, St. Augustine's baseball players knew 
they had better oblige their teammate and start hitting the way they can. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine (10-6) rallied from a three-run deficit, their biggest of the 
season, with five runs in the top of the fourth inning en route to a 7-3 
victory over Clairemont (10-8) in the A Division championship game of the Lions 
tournament at Hickman Field. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul was yelling and hitting everyone, trying to pep everyone up," said first 
baseman Bryan Cantwell. "Then when he went out and hit that triple, we knew we 
had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mossuto's one-out triple was followed by a run-scoring single by Jason Alcoser. 
Alcoser stole second and then scored on Cantwell's two-out double. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Klem singled, and David Salonius relieved Danny Langford (3-3) for 
Clairemont. Aaron Goncalves singled to score Cantwell, and Klem followed him 
home on a throwing error. Goncalves, who reached third on the error, then 
scored on a single by Justin Williams to make it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a slow start, then really came on," St. Augustine Coach Mike Stephenson 
said. "We just had more pitching than they did. I'm very pleased with how we 
played in the tournament. We pitched well and hit extremely well for five 
games. And we've played exceptional defense." 
</P>
<P>
In the title game, Roger Alvarez (3-2) threw a six-hitter with no walks and 
three strikeouts. Mike Bryant threw a three-hitter in St. Augustine's 7-2 
semifinal victory over Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Jauregui hit a two-run single in the first to give Clairemont a 2-0 lead. 
In the second, Danny Langford scored from first on an error to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont Coach Rob Dreher said the fourth-inning problems were typical of 
this season. "When we lose, we lose in one big inning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Clairemont's 3-2 semifinal victory over La Jolla in eight innings 
Wednesday morning, Dreher said he expected some problems in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an exciting game this morning and some of the excitement carried over, 
but we just couldn't sustain it," he said.

ALL THE SCORING IN TIEBREAKER AS SANTANA DEFEATS MADISON

The way Shelly Hawkins of Santana and Jenifer Booker of Madison were pitching 
in the Tough Time Division final of the Orange Glen Easter Tournament 
Wednesday, the offenses would have had a tough time scoring before Easter had 
there not been a tiebreaker after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Santana won, 2-1, in nine innings at Kit Carson Park, scoring the runs on a 
groundout and a bunt after starting the inning with a runner on second in the 
tiebreaker system used in high school softball. Madison scored its run in the 
ninth on two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad we couldn't have won it earlier," said Rebecca Aase, Santana 
third baseman. "But it comes down to who can execute at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
With Hawkins (8-0) and Booker (9-2) on their games -- Hawkins allowed just two 
hits and struck out 10 and Booker gave up six hits and struck out nine -- 
neither team was able to score through eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Madison runner Michele Sergott was placed on second to begin the ninth, 
advanced to third and scored on the wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the ninth, Santana placed catcher Christy Stippey on second, 
and Hawkins walked. Cheryl Castelo bunted them to second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Murphy then grounded to short. Madison shortstop Beania Galletta fielded 
it cleanly and fired home, but Stippey managed to kick the ball out of the mitt 
of catcher Chrystal Friesen. Murphy took second, setting up a second-and-third 
situation with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped senior right fielder Tami Schaeffer, with two fingers on her right 
hand taped because of an early-season injury. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer slapped a perfect bunt between Booker and Madison first baseman Toi 
Poole to drive in Hawkins and give Santana (17-1) the tournament championship 
and its second victory over Madison (15-3) in three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer said the injury bothered her a little but that she knew she could get 
down the bunt. "I wanted to prove to coach I could do it," she said.

The Lions Tournament is not supposed to be like this. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament that forces the finalists to play five games in five days is 
supposed to be a nightmare for pitchers and a free-for-all for batters. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrey Pines' 4-0 victory over University of San Diego High in the AA final 
at Hilltop High was actually played as if everyone had had three days of rest. 
The game lasted only 90 minutes and included no errors. 
</P>
<P>
USDHS Coach Dick Serrano couldn't figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been a hitting game this late in the tournament," said Serrano, 
whose team fell to 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
But Serrano's team simply ran into a pitcher and team with something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (9-8) began the tournament with a 0-3 record in the Palomar 
League. But after losing their first game to Escondido, the Falcons won four in 
a row, and their pitching staff allowed just one run in their last 23 innings. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous two starts, Torrey Pines pitcher Antony Napoli had allowed 
seven runs in a third of an inning against Rancho Buena Vista and four runs in 
four innings in the tournament loss to Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to pitch as well as everybody else did," said Napoli, who raised his 
record to 2-4 with a two-hitter. "I didn't want to disappoint anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Napoli attributed Saturday's loss against Escondido to a non-existent 
curveball. And Wednesday, the pitch deserted him again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just throwing high fastballs," Napoli said. "They were just hitting it 
right at us." 
</P>
<P>
And when they weren't, Torrey Pines center fielder Preston Byrnes was running 
them down. Byrnes made six putouts, two spectacular ones. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of USDHS's outs came on fly balls to the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get the key hit, and they made some nice plays," Serrano said. "We 
were swinging underneath the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless until the fourth, when Mark Swain's double, Britton 
Scheibe's bunt single, Napoli's RBI single and Mike Staffieri's fly ball gave 
Torrey Pines a 2-0 lead. Three singles, a Nate Uter ground ball and a Scheibe 
fly made it 4-0 in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed we can play with (league leader Mt. Carmel)," Byrnes said. "It feels 
like we're finally coming together."

Few look forward to April 15, but Joyce Rebhun's clients dread it. 
</P>
<P>
Rebhun, who calls herself a tax therapist, is a Westside tax attorney, CPA and 
historian of taxation whose specialty is nonfilers. With extensions or without, 
the majority of us manage to get our tax returns in, even if it means racing to 
the post office as midnight approaches. But the tormented, tax-wise, who seek 
out Rebhun have let the deadline pass once, twice, even 20 or 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the more than 7,000 clients Rebhun has counseled in four years of tax 
therapy are all but phobic about the IRS, she says. And the longer they wait to 
straighten out their tax problem, the more fearful they become. 
</P>
<P>
"They miss one year for a legitimate reason, say, they have a divorce, and 
they're afraid they're going to jail," she says. Some, including a stockbroker 
she worked with, compound the problem by refusing to open any mail they receive 
from the IRS. A few hard cases go underground to avoid discovery by the IRS, 
giving up a permanent address to move in with friends or family, quitting 
employers who report their earnings to the IRS to take jobs that pay them under 
the table in cash, living little better than fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
"They are lost causes," she says, "unless someone brings them back." 
</P>
<P>
Rebhun, 46, won't accept clients she suspects of trying to defraud the IRS. "No 
one comes here who is a tax evader or a cheat," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her clients, who owe an average of $100,000 to the federal government, are 
typically people with personal problems that have left them too paralyzed or 
preoccupied to deal with their tax obligation. According to Rebhun, more than 
10% have been referred by a psychiatrist or other therapist. On a bad week, 
half a dozen clients tell her that they want to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Their tax mess is often the least of their problems. "Often we don't realize 
the terrific crosses people are living under," Rebhun observes. Her files, 
which include client's sworn statements to the IRS explaining why they didn't 
file in a timely fashion, are filled with anguish as well as tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers come to her Ladera Heights office every week from a gay man who stopped 
filing returns after he discovered he was HIV-positive and was dumped by his 
lover. Rebhun says she was so moved she now volunteers her services to AIDS 
patients, many of whom can't get medical benefits until they straighten out 
their tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of her clients are recovering from alcohol or drug abuse. They 
often send Rebhun the pins they receive in Alcoholics Anonymous and other 
recovery programs to mark 90 days of sobriety. Other clients let tax deadlines 
slip by while suffering from depression, cancer or some other serious illness, 
the delayed impact of child abuse, the aftermath of a divorce or a bankruptcy, 
the death of a child. 
</P>
<P>
Like other tax experts, Rebhun advises her clients on tax law and leads them 
through the maze of IRS paper work. But unlike most other tax preparers, she 
also offers them emotional support. Rebhun says that it wasn't until she 
developed and overcame her own drinking problem that she realized the fragility 
-- and heroism -- of people dealing with addiction and other personal crises. 
</P>
<P>
"The normal CPA, the normal attorney will not nurture you," she says. "Often 
people in trouble need to be nurtured, at least to get the process started." 
She is constantly reminding her clients "they don't have to be paranoid. There 
is hope." 
</P>
<P>
At times, she says, she thinks of herself, not as a tax therapist, but as a tax 
minister. "It's almost become a mission," she says of her practice. "It's 
Lourdes West. You're here for a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
The miracle is often worked in mundane ways. Her clients' lives may be in 
disarray, but they typically have kept the documentation they need to file 
complete returns for past years. As she reminds, these are people who, whatever 
their problems, want to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
Rebhun often sits down with the client over a cup of coffee as the client 
details the reasons for not filing. She doesn't probe, but she helps them word 
their explanatory affidavits as persuasively as possible, trying to read them 
over from an IRS point of view and recommending changes. She makes sure that 
death certificates and other documents that support a client's often woeful 
account are attached. 
</P>
<P>
Rebhun charges $400 for an initial consultation, which is often enough to solve 
the client's problem, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly an attorney with the IRS in her native Pittsburgh, Pa., Rebhun does 
not believe the IRS is a huge, uncaring monolith. "I realize their kindness, 
their compassion," she says. Rebhun claims that 90% of her clients are relieved 
of the penalty part of their tax bill, which can amount to 40% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those whose lives are tranquil, the tax process is complicated, the 
tax therapist acknowledges. Rebhun has personally heard the interior siren that 
whispers "Why bother?" at tax time. 
</P>
<P>
Resist it, she advises. 
</P>
<P>
"We think if we hide in the closet, it will go away," she says. "It doesn't. In 
the words of my mother, 'The jails aren't big enough for people who don't pay 
their taxes.' You just have to file."

5 FACE POSSIBLE COURT-MARTIAL IN DRUG INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: AN INVESTIGATION RESULTS IN CHARGES OF NARCOTICS USE AND URINALYSIS 
TEST TAMPERING AGAINST FOUR SAILORS AND A NAVAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Four sailors and the chief law enforcement officer from a Long Beach-based 
guided missile frigate face possible court-martial on drug charges and alleged 
tampering with urinalysis tests, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The five were charged this week after a seven-month investigation that yielded 
32 drug-related counts, many of them dealing with the use and distribution of 
marijuana and a crystal form of methamphetamine, said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser 
of the Long Beach Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged crimes took place on and off the John A. Moore, which has escorted 
oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and is used now as a naval reserve training 
ship with a crew of 160. 
</P>
<P>
"It is consistent with our zero-tolerance policy regarding drug abuse," Chesser 
said. "We became aware of the problem and we took appropriate action, and now 
the judicial process will go forth." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was started by the ship's commanding officer, Chesser said. 
All five men remain restricted to barracks at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Radioman Chief David Riley, the ship's "head policeman," was charged with using 
methamphetamines and compromising urinalysis tests by swapping samples and 
warning sailors when random tests were scheduled, Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley faces an Article 32 hearing, the military's equivalent of a criminal 
preliminary hearing to determine if there are sufficient charges for a general 
court-martial. Also scheduled for such a hearing are Engineman 1st Class Alden 
Hendrickson, charged with three counts of distributing methamphetamines and one 
court of using the drug, and Operations Specialist 2nd Class Kevin McPike, 
charged with nine counts of distributing methamphetamines, six counts of using 
them and one count of using marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Two other sailors are scheduled to be tried at a special court-martial, a less 
severe proceeding. They are Electrician's Mates 3rd Class Thomas Hawley and 
Lonnie Fessler, each charged with one count of distributing methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
Navy investigators interviewed at least 18 of the ship's crew members over the 
past three weeks. Four other sailors suspected of related but less serious 
crimes will be dealt with in an administrative hearing conducted by the ship's 
command, Chesser said. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy randomly tests sailors about three times a year for six drugs, with at 
least one witness present to ensure the integrity of the sample, Chesser said. 
The charges allege that some samples believed to show traces of drugs were 
swapped for clean ones.

MANY INCUMBENTS HAVE A DEFEATING DAY; 
</P>
<P>
24 NEWCOMERS GAIN OFFICE IN 16 CITIES, AS 10 REELECTION BIDS FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters changed the makeup of city councils throughout Southeast Los Angeles 
County, ousting 10 incumbents and selecting 24 newcomers Tuesday in 16 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Political representation for Latinos, slow growth and campaign spending were 
some of the issues that contributed to the defeat of the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate will have three new members on its five-person council. The only 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artesia 
</P>
<P>
Veteran incumbent Jim Van Horn was returned to office while Mary Alyce Soares, 
a savings and loan official who was born in Artesia, was elected for the first 
time to the five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell 
</P>
<P>
Voters sent City Hall mixed messages by reelecting two incumbents who say they 
have run the city well, and electing the candidate who criticized the slow pace 
of redevelopment, an outdated sewer system and the city's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
George Bass, 59, a retired fire chief who has criticized Bell leaders for 
failing to revitalize the downtown, defeated Allen Caddy for one of the three 
spots on the City Council. Caddy was running on the same slate as incumbent 
Rolf Janssen, 34, who will begin his second term, and Jay Price, 75, who will 
begin his ninth consecutive term in office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Ronald Bird and federal employee Douglas O'Leary won an election in 
which one of the key issues was whether the all-Anglo City Council had been 
representing the Latino population, which has mushroomed the past few years and 
now makes up 75% of Bell Gardens' population. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, 46, who was elected to his second term, and O'Leary, who will begin his 
first, successfully fended off a challenge from Latino candidates Josefina 
Macias and Rosa Hernandez, who were attempting to become the first Latinos to 
sit on the council. O'Leary took the seat of Mayor Roger McComas, who retired 
after 22 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said the results show that a council member does not necessarily have 
to be Latino to represent Latinos. Both he and Bird said they represent the 
entire community. 
</P>
<P>
Macias and Hernandez said Latinos are making their presence felt now and that 
this election helped them realize their potential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bellflower 
</P>
<P>
The calm, quiet campaign belied a close race with a nail-biting vote count that 
at one point had all six candidates virtually even. In the end, the three open 
City Council seats were won by incumbent John Ansdell, who will be serving his 
third term; incumbent Bill Pendleton, elected to his second term, and newcomer 
Bob Stone, 43, an insurance salesman. Stone unseated Ken Cleveland, who has 
served on the council twice. 
</P>
<P>
Stone attributed his victory in part to the strong support of the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has been trying to 
unionize some Bellflower employees for the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cerritos 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Charles J. Kim's high-spending campaign turned the election for three 
City Council seats into a late-night cliffhanger. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who raised $104,000 for his campaign, more than triple what any other 
candidate has raised in a Cerritos election, narrowly missed winning one of the 
seats in an election that featured a significant increase in absentee 
balloting. Kim received more votes in absentee balloting (1,135) than in the 
polling booth (802). A total of 2,260 absentee ballots were cast, three times 
the number in the 1988 council election, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilwoman Ann Joynt, a former teacher, received the most votes in 
the 13-way race. Her political ally, Planning Commissioner Sherman Kappe, came 
in second. Third place went to John Crawley, president of the Optimist Club and 
a senior financial analyst for the Atlantic Richfield Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's campaign left a bitter taste in the mouths of some locals, who had been 
highly critical of his spending and called him a carpetbagger because he moved 
to town only last year. His elaborate campaign, which featured a computerized 
voter registration and absentee ballot drive, cost about $54 for every vote 
that he received. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cudahy 
</P>
<P>
The accusations and finger-pointing in this election continued even after the 
results were announced. Incumbent Joseph Graffio, and candidates Alex Rodriguez 
and Jack Cluck handily won the three seats on the five-member Cudahy City 
Council, but most of the other candidates said they are planning to challenge 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the filthiest race I've ever seen," said incumbent Bill Colon, who 
was unseated after four years on the council. "There is something wrong 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Colon said some residents were intimidated by the winning candidates' 
campaigning illegally at one of the city's polling places. Candidate Valerie 
Hansen said the race had been "stolen." Graffio, Cluck and Rodriguez denied the 
charges, saying they had run a clean races. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 63, a retired refrigeration engineer, and Cluck, 70, president of a 
local senior citizens organization, were elected to their first terms. One of 
the three council seats on the ballot was vacated earlier this year when Tom 
Thurman resigned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kathleen Navejas was reelected by a solid margin, but incumbent 
Donald Schultze was defeated in the races for two City Council seats in 
Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
However, just one vote separated two candidates vying for Schultze's seat, with 
about 20 questionable ballots yet to be counted. Former Councilman Richard 
Vineyard, who lost his seat two years ago by three votes, held the one-vote 
lead over Domenic Ruggeri, a Navejas ally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park 
</P>
<P>
Latino candidates won City Council seats for the first time in this city of 
59,000, which is 90% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Perez, who had run unsuccessfully five times before, was the top 
vote-getter, followed by incumbent William P. Cunningham and upstart candidate 
Luis Hernandez. Councilman Jim Roberts, who had served on the council since 
1970, lost his seat after finishing 20 votes behind Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and Hernandez used nearly opposite campaign strategies to win office. 
Perez billed himself as a cooperative team player, while Hernandez, always the 
firebrand, lashed out at the incumbents during a candidates forum and with 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
Political representation for Latinos was the key theme of Perez's campaign. The 
47-year-old loan officer called for more neighborhood meetings and overall 
community involvement to deal with the city's crime problem, including gang 
crime. He stressed his longtime involvement in civic groups and his dedication 
to the city -- demonstrated by his 12-year quest for a council seat. He 
refrained from strongly criticizing the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial consultant, downplayed the issue of Latino 
representation throughout the race. He attacked the incumbents for the city's 
financial problems, which forced the layoffs of 25 municipal employees last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham and Roberts attacked Hernandez. Some of the 14 mailers they put out 
accused Hernandez of lying about his background and alleged that he did not 
live in the city. Hernandez, who was living in nearby Walnut Park, said he now 
lives with his sister in 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
But they spared Perez. "(Perez) had the Hispanic vote and the Anglo vote," said 
Cunningham, 50, who ran a joint campaign with Roberts. "If a white person asked 
me who to vote for the third seat, I told them vote for Perez." 
</P>
<P>
A Latino candidate was virtually assured of winning at least one seat when 
longtime Councilman Herbert A. Hennes decided to retire for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lakewood 
</P>
<P>
Voters gave Larry Van Nostran a fifth term on the City Council and elected 
Joseph Esquival to replace Councilwoman Jacqueline Rynerson, whose retirement 
next week will make the council an all-male body for the first time in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Esquival, 57, is a quality control engineer for American National Can Co. in 
Carson. He has been a city parks and recreation commissioner for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
La Habra Heights 
</P>
<P>
Voters soundly defeated a proposal to increase annual fire fees from $200 to 
$500 per parcel, which would have provided money for around-the-clock paramedic 
service. They also elected two new City Council candidates who had been 
endorsed by the city's retiring mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The winners are Richard Newbre, 55, a real estate lawyer, and Diane Kane, 42, 
an environmental planner for the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Norwalk 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk Parks and Recreation Commission member Robert J. Arthur, 41, upset 
two-term Councilman Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez in a relatively quiet campaign. 
Mayor Grace F. Napolitano received the most votes, followed by Arthur and 
Councilman Luigi A. Vernola. 
</P>
<P>
The four major candidates ran courteous campaigns, focusing on their 
accomplishments and avoiding criticism of their opponents. But Rodriguez had 
been criticized by the weekly News Tribune for, among other things, using an 
off-duty sheriff's car to carry him to and from Norwalk Dodger Day last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paramount 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Henry Harkema, 78, lost his bid for reelection to the five-member 
Paramount City Council. Voters returned Councilman Manuel E. Guillen to office 
and selected two newcomers, Elvira (Vera) Amaro and Allen (Joe) Parker. 
Harkema, Guillen and Parker were endorsed by Councilman Charles R. Weldon, who 
decided not to run for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
Amaro, a teaching assistant for the Paramount Unified School District, has 
served on the city Water Commission, an appointed position, for the past six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 51, was also making his first try for an elected office. He was 
appointed to the Planning Commission more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera 
</P>
<P>
City Councilmen John G. Chavez and Albert Natividad won reelection in Pico 
Rivera, while challenger Richard L. Mercado Sr., 55, a city building inspector, 
overtook incumbent Gilbert De La Rosa, an eight-year City Council veteran. The 
victory was Mercado's first in five efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilwoman Sara Dodds Hanlon lost her seat to Carol A. Churchill, 
chairwoman of the Planning Commission. Signal Hill voters reelected Mayor 
Gerard Goedhart for the second open council seat. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill, a lawyer, credited her victory to her "strong position" against a 
large development proposed for the city's hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Gate 
</P>
<P>
Voters elected three new City Council members, signaling a change in the 
balance of power on the five-member South Gate council. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Herbert W. Cranton, 66, the only incumbent seeking reelection, was 
defeated. The three victorious newcomers -- Mary Ann Buckles, 50; Larry R. 
Leonard, 47, and Johnny Ramirez, 35 -- were endorsed by Councilmen Robert A. 
Philipp and Gregory Slaughter, who frequently found themselves on the losing 
side of key votes by the five-member council. Philipp and Slaughter were not up 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whittier 
</P>
<P>
Two City Council candidates who campaigned for slow growth were elected in one 
of the most spirited campaigns in decades. An incumbent who had defended 
Whittier's recent development policies was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"(The vote) is a mandate against the policies of the old-boy network that has 
run this town," said Helen McKenna Rahder, a teacher and local activist who led 
the field of 10 candidates in the hotly contested race. "It means that the 
preservationists, the slow-growthers and the younger environmentally aware vote 
has come through. This is a statement for quality of life and quality 
development standards." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Henderson, an insurance broker and former councilman, won the second 
council seat.

Only Commerce voters returned all incumbents to office in a contested race. 
Elections were previously canceled in La Mirada, Maywood and Santa Fe Springs 
after no candidates emerged to challenge incumbents for council and other

VOTERS GIVE A SPLIT DECISION ON DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: STRICT HEIGHT-LIMIT INITIATIVE IS PASSED, BUT THE CANDIDATE WHO 
SUPPORTED IT IS DEFEATED IN FAVOR OF TWO PRO-DEVELOPMENT CONTENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a curious ending to a curious campaign, voters in Culver City elected two 
pro-development candidates to the City Council on Tuesday, but approved a 
stringent height-limit initiative that the winners had opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 56-foot height limit contained in the residents' initiative known 
as Measure I beat a more lenient competing proposal backed by development 
interests, the council candidate who backed Measure I, Tom Hammons, lost to 
incumbent Jozelle Smith and Mike Balkman, who supported the milder controls 
outlined in Measure II. Both measures received a majority of "yes" votes, but 
Measure I is the only one adopted because it received more "yes" votes. 
</P>
<P>
The split decision has the town abuzz with Monday-morning quarterbacking. It 
startled almost everyone, particularly the candidates. It also clouded the fate 
of the controversial $159-million Marina Place regional shopping mall planned 
for Culver City's western tip. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Oscars, why supposedly are the best director and the best movie always 
the same?" Smith said. "In this case, they weren't." Remarked Hammons: "I'm 
very puzzled." 
</P>
<P>
Hammons, a district manager for Thrifty Drug Stores, had billed himself as a 
slow-growth and grass-roots candidate. He heartily endorsed Measure I, calling 
it "the people's choice." The initiative qualified for the ballot after 3,600 
residents signed petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Measure I imposes a cap of 56 feet, or about four stories, on buildings in the 
city's busiest commercial zones. Criticizing that as inflexible, the City 
Council majority of Smith, Richard Alexander and Paul Jacobs placed the rival 
measure to the ballot. Without specifying a height limit, Measure II called for 
lot-coverage limits on most commercial buildings in the city and prohibited 
them from blocking views, disrupting air flow or causing "significant 
detriment" by their shade, shadow or glare. 
</P>
<P>
There was one other key difference between them. Whereas Measure I 
theoretically applies to any project not yet under construction, Measure II 
would have exempted any project that had received city approval, regardless of 
whether construction had started -- and would therefore exempt Marina Place.

The 1-million-square-foot Marina Place project approved by the City Council 
last month would place Nordstrom and Bullock's stores, 150 smaller shops and a 
six-screen movie theater at Culver City's western edge, on a site nearly 
surrounded by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As approved by the council, the mall contains several elements that will have 
to be scaled back if the terms of Measure I are applied. The theater complex is 
envisioned as being 74 feet high, and there are two proposed 84-foot decorative 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Eleanor Egan said in an interview, however, that she believes Marina 
Place will be able to get in under the wire. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive agreement between the city and the developers approved by the 
council last month is scheduled to be signed April 25, at the end of a required 
30-day period to allow the filing of any referendum petitions seeking to 
contest the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council has the option of amending the development agreement, 
according to Egan, the election of Balkman and Smith makes that unlikely. With 
Councilman Paul Jacobs, they make up a council majority in favor of the project 
as now proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't change (the development agreement)," Balkman said, adding that he 
thought the project had "gone through enough." 
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is signed on schedule, Egan said, it will shield Marina Place 
from Measure I, which is not scheduled to take effect until April 27, 10 days 
after next Tuesday's City Council meeting in which the new council is expected 
to certify the election results. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Lowenthal, general manager for Marina Place developer Prudential 
Property Co., said she believed the development agreement "would stand up as it 
is" despite the adoption of Measure I. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Pachtman, a former mayor and a sponsor of Measure I, said it is not 
that simple. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem to me," he said, "that any councilman that would act in such a 
way in the face of a measure adopted by the people would face a recall." 
</P>
<P>
Pachtman and another sponsor of the initiative, Robin Turner, said Wednesday 
that they were considering several challenges to Marina Place, including 
collecting signatures to force a referendum on the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
They also questioned the legality of the council's rush to approve the 
development agreement before the election. "It was a deliberate attempt to 
subvert the will of the people," Pachtman contended. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the mall encounters no additional obstacles in Culver City, its future 
is by no means assured. The city of Los Angeles, the Venice Town Council and 
the California Coastal Commission all are threatening legal challenges, based 
on the traffic congestion and pollution the mall is expected to generate. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a vocal opponent of Marina Place, 
called on the new Culver City council to "reconsider its precipitous action on 
Marina Place." 
</P>
<P>
The election parties Tuesday night reflected the candidates' characters and 
philosophies. Hammons and Measure I advocates converged at the home of 
initiative sponsor Turner. Smith returned to Veterans Auditorium, the site of 
her 1986 election celebration. Balkman, the president of an electrical 
contracting company and the Culver City Lions Club, partied in a ballroom at 
the Ramada Hotel in Fox Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they had campaigned against it, Balkman and Smith said that they 
would not tamper with Measure I. Balkman predicted that the height limit would 
be a "definite obstacle" to developers, but said, "If that's what the voters 
want, that's what we do. . . . Rules are rules, laws are laws." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Measure I's label of " 'people's initiative' appealed to a lot 
of people who didn't take the time to read it thoroughly (and) were not that 
aware of the differences between the two (measures)." 
</P>
<P>
"But . . . we can live with that," she said. "I don't think the height limit 
will be a shock to any developers," she said, considering the development 
restrictions that exist in many other area communities. 
</P>
<P>
There was some last-minute hassle Election Day, as voters were given flyers 
from the city clerk's office instructing them to ignore their sample ballots 
and go strictly by the ballots in the voting machines. Over the weekend it was 
discovered that the sample ballots were printed incorrectly, with wrong numbers 
assigned to the measures, City Clerk Pauline Dolce said. The error meant that 
voters intending to vote yes on either ballot measure would in fact be voting 
the opposite of what they intended if they followed the sample ballot. But 
Dolce said there was "no way" the ballots for the 51 machines could have been 
reprinted in time for the election. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot mistake was just one of a series of surprises before the election. 
Two weeks before the voting complaints arose of outside influence in the 
council race, when a carpenters union local based in Los Angeles mailed a 
letter endorsing Smith and Balkman because of their support for Marina Place. 
Both candidates decried the letter as unwanted interference in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Measure II advocates used names from the Measure I petitions 
to target a campaign mailer. The petitions were unlawfully released by City 
Clerk Dolce. The Measure II campaigners also failed to report they had 
contributions and spending of more than $1,000, in apparent violation of state 
campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
Measure I sponsor Pachtman has filed a complaint with the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission and has asked the district attorney's office to 
investigate.

INCUMBENTS TAKE BEATING AT THE POLLS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: VOTERS MAKE CLEAN SWEEPS IN THREE CITIES. ASSEMBLYMEN FRANK HILL AND 
CHARLES CALDERON ARE WINNERS IN RACE FOR SENATE SEATS.

San Gabriel Valley voters ousted 18 incumbent council members, including all 
those running in La Puente, Monterey Park and Temple City, and rejected two tax 
measures Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In La Puente, where no incumbent has been defeated since 1968, voters made up 
for lost time. For the first time in city history, three veteran councilmen 
were swept from office in a dramatic upset fueled by the highest voter turnout 
in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
In Temple City, three candidates who said it was time for new ideas and 
leadership swept three incumbents aside. 
</P>
<P>
And in Monterey Park, newcomers scored decisive victories over two council 
incumbents, including Barry L. Hatch, the outspoken former mayor who alienated 
some residents with his complaints about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents also were turned out of office in Arcadia, Azusa, Covina, El Monte, 
Glendora, Irwindale, San Gabriel, South El Monte and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the city votes, special elections were held Tuesday to fill two 
vacant state Senate seats. Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) won a runoff to 
succeed William Campbell of Hacienda Heights, who resigned to become president 
of the California Manufacturers Assn., in the 31st Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) was an easy winner in the 26th 
District, which was represented by Whittier Democrat Joseph B. Montoya until he 
resigned in February after being convicted of political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in La Puente elected Manuel J. Garcia, 52, chairman of the city's 
Planning Commission, Edward L. Chavez, 26, a substitute teacher and school 
board member, and Louis R. Perez, 52, a sales engineer for a diesel company. 
</P>
<P>
They ousted incumbents Francis M. Palacio, 62, and Max E. Ragland, 70 -- both 
of whom were vying for their seventh four-year terms on the council -- and 
Louis F. Guzman, 70, a council member since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the changing of the guard," said Garcia, who led the field of 
eight candidates with 632 votes. "I think the people sensed that." 
</P>
<P>
Palacio, who served 24 years on the council, said he was pleased that the three 
victors were all Latino. "I helped pave the road for these people," he said, 
noting that few Latinos held municipal office in Los Angeles County two decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
No one characterized the spirit of the election better than Chavez, who was 
only 2 years old when Palacio was first elected to the council. Chavez, who has 
a political science degree from UCLA, said he even has photos of himself as an 
infant posing with the councilmen he helped defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of hard to run against them, you know, just out of respect," said 
Chavez, who still lives at home with his parents. "But obviously I think the 
community wanted to move forward. I'll never say I was better than these 
councilmen, though. I'll never gloat." 
</P>
<P>
In a hotly contested race in Monterey Park, incumbents Pat Reichenberger and 
Hatch lost to challengers Sam Kiang, an attorney and engineer; Marie T. Purvis, 
a businesswoman, and Fred Balderrama, automotive shop owner. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said he had no regrets. "I did it my way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Temple City, Mary Lou Swain, running for her third term, and Ken Gillanders 
and Tom Atkins, both running for their fourth terms, were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Bobbie McGowan was the top vote-getter with 1,764 votes, followed by 
Cathe Wilson and Mary Louise Manning. "I'm absolutely elated," said McGowan, 
who said she ran because she felt the council was not listening to residents. 
Voters "have spoken again," she said. "but this time at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
In Azusa, council members Bruce Latta and Jennie Avila took unexpected tumbles, 
losing to John Dangleis and Stephen Alexander. Councilman Tony Naranjo, who had 
aligned himself with Latta and Avila in a bid to oust Mayor Eugene Moses, saw 
his hopes for higher office dashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were taking this city in a direction they wanted," Naranjo said. 
"It's really puzzling to figure out this community, I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
In South El Monte, Raul Pardo, 30, a newcomer to the city's politics, outdrew 
three other candidates in six of seven precincts. He and incumbent Jim Kelly, 
who tied Pardo in his home district, won the two seats, beating incumbent 
Ignacio (Slim) Gracia. 
</P>
<P>
"The community overwhelmingly spoke," said Pardo, celebrating with exuberant 
campaign volunteers in a storefront after the results were in. "The voters said 
it was time for a change, and they wanted somebody to bring a new vision." 
</P>
<P>
Gracia, 71, who trailed the field, said that Pardo had "played to my age." But 
he acknowledged that he had done little campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a funny city," said Vice Mayor Stan Quintana, who made an appearance 
at City Hall early in the evening. "People like to see you. Gracia didn't get 
out and walk." 
</P>
<P>
In Irwindale, where disillusionment after a failed multimillion-dollar Raiders 
bid still looms over the tiny city, voters replaced longtime incumbent Joseph 
Breceda with Frederick Barbosa, the man most known for trying to stop the 
football stadium project. Two other incumbents, Robert Diaz and Patricio 
Miranda, were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa, 41, joined other residents and Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi in suing the city in 1987 to force it to prepare an environmental 
impact report on the proposed stadium's impact. A Superior Court judge ordered 
Irwindale to conduct such a study, and barred Irwindale from negotiating with 
the Raiders until it was completed more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia Councilman Roger Chandler lost his bid for relection, finishing fourth 
among six candidates. The winners were incumbent Robert Harbicht, George W. 
Fasching, a businessman who owns a travel agency and car wash, and Joseph 
Ciraulo, owner of a medical transcription service. 
</P>
<P>
In El Monte, Mayor Don McMillen, a fixture on the council for 10 years, edged 
challenger Art Platten for reelection, with Maurice Lopez a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
In the council election, El Monte, whose population is about 75% Latino, lost 
its only Latino councilman when incumbent Ernest Gutierrez was edged out by 
Patricia Wallach and Jack Thurston in a six-candidate field. The two winners 
waged aggressive campaigns, attacking the current council for allowing what 
they described as runaway development. 
</P>
<P>
In San Gabriel, newcomer Dominic S. Polimeni outpolled both incumbents in a 
three-way race for two seats. Polimeni, 49, has been a member of the Parks and 
Recreation Commission for seven years. He is the administrator of the Alhambra 
Municipal Court. Veteran Councilman Sabino Cici won a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
In Covina, Chris Richardson, who has been city clerk for 27 years, was elected 
to replace Mayor Bob Low, who had served for 12 years. Low finished last in the 
three-candidate race, trailing winners Richardson and incumbent Henry Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina voters ousted Councilman Richard Lewis and swept in challengers 
Richard Jennings and Steve Herfert. Jennings attributed his victory to voter 
discontent with the city Redevelopment Agency's arrangements with developers. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendora, Councilwoman Lois Shade was at a loss to explain why she failed in 
her bid for a third term. She gained 2,874 votes but trailed Marshall Mouw, a 
47-year-old letter carrier, by 169 votes, in a comparatively large vote 
turnout. Shade said a tax measure to buy hillside property, which was 
resoundingly defeated, helped draw voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Also elected in Glendora were incumbent Bob Kuhn, a 46-year-old insurance 
agent, who gained a second term, and Molly MacLeod, 38, an attorney and city 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont voters reelected Mayor Nicholas L. Presecan and Diann Ring to their 
second four-year terms, but also elected a critic of city policies, Algird G. 
Leiga, 56, a business executive. Leiga said his election reflected not only 
hard work by an army of volunteer supporters but also voter desire for stronger 
controls over city spending. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead City Councilmen Gary Taylor and Dennis McDonald won easily against 
challenger Frank Villar, each earning more than a 2-to-1 margin of votes over 
Villar despite the newcomer's intense campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Only one newcomer was chosen among seven candidates to fill three City Council 
seats in Sierra Madre. MaryAnn MacGillivray, marketing vice president of a 
health products company and the only woman candidate, will join incumbent Clem 
Bartolai and former councilman Gary Adams on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Voters supported an advisory measure limiting the terms of council office, but 
rejected overwhelmingly a measure that would have increased property taxes 8 
1/2 cents per every $100 of assessed value to raise money for paramedic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas Mayor Terry L. Dipple won reelection without opposition and 
Councilman Sandy McHenry was reelected. John Ebiner, a hospital computer 
analyst, finished ahead of five other candidates to win the second council 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
In Baldwin Park, Mayor Pro Tem Bette Lowes was easily elected from a field of 
three candidates to her first full term as mayor. No provision has yet been 
made for filling the remaining two years of her council term. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent council members Julia McNeill and Bobbie Izell were also reelected 
from a field of six candidates. Two ballot measures that would have changed the 
mayor's position from a two-year elected term to a rotating seat among council 
members were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, where six candidates were vying for three seats, incumbents 
James Hodge Jr. and James Woollacott Jr. were returned to the council. Harry A. 
Knapp also was elected. Former Councilman Robert Wagner finished fifth in the 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
In Diamond Bar, which had to hold its second election only a year after 
incorporation because of a technicality in state law, both incumbents running 
for reelection, John Forbing and Gary Werner, won four-year terms. Jay Kim, 
owner of a Diamond Bar-based engineering firm who outspent all eight of his 
opponents, won the third seat and captured the highest number of votes. 
</P>
<P>
In La Verne, Mayor Jon Blickenstaff scored a decisive victory despite an 
aggressive campaign by challenger David L. Sardeson, who criticized the city's 
approval of a 12-screen movie theater with 2,950 seats. Incumbent Councilmen 
Patrick J. Gatti and Robert Rodriguez also won new terms. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia voters reelected Lara Blakely and John Nobrega to the council and gave 
Mayor Bob Bartlett another term. 
</P>
<P>
In Alhambra, voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition A, which repealed a 1982 
ordinance prohibiting the sale of Alhambra Community Hospital without approval 
from two thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The financially troubled hospital had fallen behind in rent payments to the 
city, forcing the city to tighten its belt by slashing the municipal budget 
twice last year.

GLENDALE MAY GET RAIL SYSTEM IN 10 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTE: COUNCIL MEMBERS AGREE THAT RAILROAD TRACKS ALONG SAN FERNANDO ROAD 
WOULD BE THE BEST ROUTE FOR A REGIONAL SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
Glendale is climbing on the region's light-rail priority list, Los Angeles 
County transportation officials told the Glendale City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After a late start, Glendale was excluded from the first group of light-rail 
lines planned, but now is considered likely to get a system in about 10 years, 
said Susan I. Rosales, manager of rail planning for the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale has made it perfectly clear to us that they want a commuter rail 
system," Rosales said after a transportation study session with the council 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city purchased the old Southern Pacific rail depot in December in hopes of 
turning it into a light-rail station and transportation center. Officials are 
seeking more than $8 million in state or regional funds for the project. 
</P>
<P>
In the study session Tuesday, council members agreed that the railroad tracks 
along San Fernando Road would serve as the best route for a regional rail 
system through Glendale, including both commuter rail and light-rail service. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter rail is defined as a train, such as Amtrak, which is designed to serve 
riders traveling up to 50 or 60 miles. Stations are spaced every six miles or 
so. A light-rail system uses cars that are self-powered, such as by 
electricity, and that are designed for trips of 20 miles or less. Stations 
usually are a mile apart. 
</P>
<P>
The existing tracks could be used for commuter train service between Los 
Angeles and the Santa Clarita and Simi valleys, with stops in Glendale, Burbank 
and other communities, Richard Stanger, commission director of rail 
development, said in an interview Wednesday. He said the commuter service is 
planned to start in less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
"A resident of Glendale could hop on a train and be at Union Station downtown 
in five or 10 minutes, then transfer to Metro Rail to ride to work," Stanger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad right of way could also be used to bring a light-rail system to 
Glendale from Los Angeles, possibly connecting to a local transit system, such 
as trolleys, into downtown Glendale. A trolley system would operate like buses, 
stopping every block or two. 
</P>
<P>
The city had initially studied about a dozen different routes for a regional 
rail system, but decided Tuesday that the railroad right of way would be the 
least disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are still considering three routes from the train station into 
the downtown area for the possible trolley system. 
</P>
<P>
The local routes include one along Brand Boulevard looping along Broadway and 
Colorado Street east toward Pasadena. Two others could run along either Brand 
or Central Avenue, jogging over toward Orange Street, which might be turned 
into a transit mall through the downtown redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are considering continuing the transit system north to Glenoaks 
Boulevard, where it would turn west back to the railroad tracks at San Fernando 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
City consultants are expected to provide further details on the alternative 
routes within three to four months. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that if Glendale keeps working aggressively, it may 
be able to develop a transit system sooner than other cities that ranked the 
highest for light-rail service but still have years to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Stanger said Wednesday that the commission is nearing completion of 
negotiations for a light-rail right of way from Union Station through the 
Taylor train yard alongside the Los Angeles River and just south of Glendale's 
border. That would bring light rail two-thirds of the way from Los Angeles to 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely taking steps toward getting the line out to Glendale," 
Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale had a late start in lobbying for its share of the 1980 Proposition A 
transit tax funds to build commuter light rails, city officials admit. The city 
was rated among the lowest priorities when the commission ranked the needs for 
transit systems in 1983. Glendale was told then that it would have to wait at 
least 20 to 30 years for a rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is one of three destinations targeted for initial construction of a 
proposed 150-mile rail system in the Los Angeles Basin. Early priority was also 
given to proposed routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the new Century 
Freeway to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last two years, Glendale has worked feverishly to change its status. 
Even though it was excluded from the first group of light-rail lines planned, 
the city agreed in 1988 to split with the county commission the $200,000 cost 
of a study on potential light-rail routes and a commuter line to Los Angeles.

PARKING SIGNS MAY BE USED TO DRIVE OUT CAR-DWELLERS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: AN OVERNIGHT PARKING BAN MAY BE ENFORCED ALONG RIVERSIDE DRIVE IN LOS 
FELIZ, A POPULAR SPOT FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS. 
</P>

<P>
Steve (Max) O'Neill usually walks to his job as a part-time custodian at Camp 
Hollywoodland, a city-run girls' camp in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
For O'Neill, it's about a three-mile jaunt from Riverside Drive in Los Feliz, 
where, just down from the Mulholland Fountain, he and about a dozen others live 
in their cars, vans and motor homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so bad -- I'm actually very comfortable," O'Neill said Monday evening 
as he sat in the front seat of the car in which he lives and looked out at the 
surrounding park. "Who knows? I could stay here forever." 
</P>
<P>
Not according to city officials. The city of Los Angeles soon may enforce 
parking regulations to oust those who live in their vehicles along Riverside 
Drive near Los Feliz Boulevard. A request by Griffith Park rangers, supported 
by the Los Feliz Improvement Assn., for signs prohibiting overnight parking 
along the three-block strip was being considered late Wednesday. If granted -- 
which officials consider likely -- the signs will be posted within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the request is denied, pressure on the car-dwellers is likely to 
increase, city officials indicated. Since Los Feliz homeowners and officials 
discussed the problem recently at a meeting about traffic problems, parking 
enforcement officers twice have patrolled the strip and put warning cards on 
vehicle windshields, said Roger Gornick, a parking enforcement supervisor for 
the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"These are homeless people who have no place and no money, but they've just got 
to find another place to park their vehicles," Gornick said. "It becomes a 
problem when you have more and more people there because then it becomes 
uncontrollable." 
</P>
<P>
The request to prohibit parking from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. was made after rangers, 
parking officials and Los Feliz homeowners complained that the Riverside strip 
was becoming a camp for homeless living out of their vehicles. The number of 
people living along the street has grown, they said -- and so has the amount of 
graffiti, vandalism and destruction of parkland and facilities that line the 
strip on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The strip, surrounded by trees, tennis courts and the Griffith Park Cultural 
Arts Center, for years has been a popular parking spot for the homeless and 
people with large campers or trucks, said Tom LaBonge, a field deputy for Los 
Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers and homeowners said they are uncertain whether the car-dwellers -- the 
number of whom on a given night ranges from six to 30, Gornick and others said 
-- are responsible for the area's recent rash of problems. But, they said, 
restricting overnight parking at least may curb illegal fires, the smell of 
urine along Riverside Drive's sidewalks and complaints by park patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The car-dwellers "are creating an atmosphere that's really not conducive to the 
patrons in our parks," said Lucia Ruta, chief park ranger for the Los Angeles 
Recreation and Parks Department. "We're really sensitive to the homeless 
situation. But when the complaints start coming in and there's a lot of 
vandalism, we've got no choice." 
</P>
<P>
But others, including Los Angeles Police Department officers who patrol the 
area, said they had little indication that the car-dwellers are the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
"All areas of the park have been victims of vandalism, but it's not these 
homeless people who are committing the vandalism," said Paul Afdahl, senior 
police patrol officer for Los Feliz and Griffith Park. "They're most often the 
victims. I've had two incidents where people who have parked there for the 
night have woken up and found their motor homes covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot see, in my personal view, going out there and putting a lot of 
pressure on these people because that's only going to compound the problem" of 
homelessness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Afdahl said he talks with the vehicle residents, most of whom are men, at least 
once every two weeks. He said he advises them about city shelters, warns them 
about their safety and urges them to find another place to live. But most 
cannot afford housing and consider Griffith Park safer than most shelters and 
other parts of the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parking regulations restrict people from leaving their cars in one spot for 
more than 72 hours and from abandoning their cars. And the parks department 
enforces a trespassing ordinance, which prohibits people from entering the park 
between 10:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. But there is no law against sleeping or living in 
a vehicle on a public street, Afdahl and other police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who said he has lived along the street for about a year, said he and 
others leave periodically and return, or move from one side of the street to 
the other to meet the 72-hour rule. And they generally are asleep by the time 
the park closes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the street is a popular place from which to car-pool, and a large 
apartment complex supplies some cars by the curbs -- making it difficult to 
tell which cars are serving as homes and which are there temporarily, parking 
supervisor Gornick said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "no overnight parking" signs would be the first restriction aimed 
at people living in vehicles along Riverside Drive. Jurisdiction would not 
change: Park rangers, who work for the city's parks department, still would 
enforce just the trespassing law. But they would report car-dwellers to the Los 
Angeles Police Department and parking enforcement officials, and violators 
would receive a $28 citation, plus other penalties if additional laws were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
Park rangers called the plight of the homeless unfortunate and said that if the 
signs are posted, they will inform the car-dwellers of city shelters, social 
services and other options for two weeks before enforcing the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully a warning would do it," Ruta said. "We're in the business of 
communicating with people and asking them not to stay there all night. I don't 
have a problem with someone sleeping in their car. My problem starts when they 
get out of their car, come into the park and start bothering patrons." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, 32, who on Monday relaxed on a sleeping bag in the front seat of his 
1971 Plymouth Duster, said he and other car-dwellers don't bother park visitors 
or vandalize the property because they consider the area their home. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are parked here and live here, but they have jobs, like me. It 
ain't like there's madness going on down here," he said, shrugging when told 
about the proposed prohibition on overnight parking. 
</P>
<P>
"Those late hours are the hours when nothing happens and people just want to 
sleep," O'Neill said. "But if they said we couldn't park here, I'd just have to 
find somewhere else, I guess."

GOING BATTY FROM THE NOISE OF SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE OWNER OF A 25-YEAR-OLD BATTING CENTER, CHARGED WITH VIOLATION OF 
THE CITY'S NOISE LIMITS, FACES TRIAL NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The crack of bat against ball may be music to the ears of baseball fans. But 
the sound is triggering cries of "foul" from Glendale city officials and 
neighbors of the Glendale Batting Cage, who complain that batters practicing 
for America's traditional pastime are driving them batty. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sleep and you can't relax," said Robert P. Paone, a salesman who 
lives in an East Elk Avenue apartment behind the batting center. "You get four 
or five batters out there, and you've got a headache." 
</P>
<P>
Paone and other residents have waged a two-year campaign to persuade David R. 
Johnson, operator of the baseball business, to curtail hours, install 
sound-muffling material and take other noise-reduction measures. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is scheduled to stand trial in Glendale Municipal Court on May 16 on 
two misdemeanor counts of violating the city's noise limits, plus misdemeanor 
charges that he has an illegal advertising sign and that his now-closed snack 
bar is an illegal building. The maximum penalty for each violation is a $500 
fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's attorney, Robert A. DePiano, complained that his client "is being 
characterized as a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson has already taken steps to reduce noise, shutting down the two 
rear batting cages closest to the neighbors, covering exposed metal parts and 
encouraging patrons to use quieter foam-filled bats. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the other violations, DePiano said Johnson has applied for the 
required sign permit and has asked city officials what would be an acceptable 
use for his former snack bar. In both cases, he said, the city has failed to 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to make changes if they'd work with us," the attorney said. "The 
Batting Cage has no interest in being a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Braden said taking Johnson to court was a last resort 
after city officials made repeated efforts to persuade him to correct code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy of the city of Glendale is to try to get compliance and not go 
through the criminal process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braden said Johnson "would say he would comply -- and he didn't" 
</P>
<P>
A conviction and the threat of jail would force Johnson to correct the problems 
at his business, Braden believes. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Batting Cage has been operating at 620 E. Colorado St. for 25 
years, becoming something of a local institution, DePiano said. Little League 
players and older athletes hone their hitting skills in the five baseball and 
two softball cages. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-unit apartment building where Paone lives was built about four years ago 
almost directly behind the batting center. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained about the noise generated by the hitting, the 
machinery and by some of the youthful batters. They say the center's 
hard-rubber balls create a particularly annoying sound when they bounce off the 
metal bats that have become increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have also collected stray balls that have slipped through holes in 
the surrounding safety net, sometimes damaging vehicles or utility connections 
on the building. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Cameron, manager of the building, said the noise makes it difficult for 
him to attract and retain tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But Albert W. Sanderson, who owns the land on which the batting center 
operates, wrote in a 1988 letter to Cameron, "I think the main problem is that 
the fellow who built your apartment house did not consider the noise or any 
other nuisance inherent in the batting cage." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "At this stage of the game, I can only recommend that when a person 
wants to rent one of these apartments, he should be informed that there might 
be some noise from the batting cage at certain times." 
</P>
<P>
Four sound experts have been enlisted to find out whether the batting cage 
noise exceeds the city's noise control rules. 
</P>
<P>
One hired by Johnson said the batting center did not violate the noise law. 
Another hired by the residents showed that the cages significantly exceeded the 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale city officials had to throw out two of their noise tests because the 
measuring devices were improperly adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, city officials were finally satisfied that they had conducted a 
valid test, showing the batting center exceeded the 65-decibel noise limit in 
commercial zones. As a backup, the city hired an independent expert in October, 
who also detected violations. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were filed Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Chris De Santis, who owns a retail complex just west of the Glendale Batting 
Cage, said neighbors are losing patience. 
</P>
<P>
"The netting is so old and deteriorated that balls are somehow getting 
through," he said. "They're all over the roof of our shopping center. They've 
broken some glass in the skylight windows, and they've hit cars in the parking 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
De Santis said Johnson has not responded to his letters requesting compensation 
and repair of the netting. 
</P>
<P>
Like some of the other neighbors, he feels a twinge of guilt for picking on a 
piece of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids need a place to bat," De Santis said. "I wouldn't like to see him out 
of business. But I'd like to see him fix his place up and comply with the law."

VALLEY BLVD. PLAN APPROVED

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved a development plan for Valley Boulevard, 
culminating a 14-month effort to establish guidelines that will control the 
types of new buildings permitted along the commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Alhambra Business and Residents Assn. complained that the plan 
would not help improve Valley Boulevard and said residents and business owners 
had not been given enough notice of the changes. But council members said the 
public had plenty of notice through newsletters, flyers and community meetings.

PLAN TO EASE BILLBOARD RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has instructed the Planning Commission to consider an 
ordinance that would expand the areas where billboards are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Billboards now are authorized only in manufacturing zones, but a number of 
billboards are located outside the zones. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would allow billboard companies to retain their existing 
signs or relocate them in commercial and manufacturing zones. In addition, new 
signs would be permitted along freeways in manufacturing and 
administrative-professional zones. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith has sharply attacked the proposed ordinance submitted by 
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, because it was largely written by a billboard 
company, the Patrick Media Group. 
</P>
<P>
She said the city should not allow an industry to write its own regulations. In 
addition, she said, the ordinance would increase the number of billboards, 
contrary to the wishes of residents who persuaded the council to enact tough 
billboard restrictions in 1964 and successfully maintained those restrictions 
through a referendum eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
After action by the Planning Commission, the ordinance will be considered again 
by the council.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
EX-APARTMENT OWNER FINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former owner of a Hollywood apartment house has been ordered to pay $35,286 
in fines, penalties and restitution after pleading no contest to violations of 
fire, health and building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
Charles A. Folcke, 45, entered his plea to 18 violations March 27, as the 
second day of his trial was about to get under way in Municipal Court, 
according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Folcke also was placed on two years' probation, the office said. 
</P>
<P>
Folcke's company, Hollywood Terrace Investments, acquired the 52-unit apartment 
complex at 1921 N. Highland Ave. in May, 1982, and sold it last December 
without first repairing items cited in the violations, said Deputy City Atty. 
Michael R. Wilkinson, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
The current owner has not repaired the building, which remains under 
investigation by the city's Housing Enforcement Task Force, according to a 
statement by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
When criminal charges were filed July 6, the building was cited for fire code 
violations, such as defective and missing fire doors, missing and broken smoke 
detectors and defective fire houses, said City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"These types (of violations) . . . are always of particular concern because of 
the threat they pose to the safety of tenants in the event of a fire," Hahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems included blocked drains and cockroach infestation, Wilkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Folcke, of Irvine, said he relinquished operation of the building to partners 
long ago and was not aware of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no inkling until it was way too late that there was any problem," Folcke 
said. "Once I was made aware of the conditions, I was appalled and took action 
immediately. I thought the building was in the hands of capable people when it 
was not."

2 BUILDING PROJECTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed four-story office building at 725 S. Arroyo Parkway and a 
three-story hotel at 2850 E. Colorado Blvd. were approved Tuesday by the Board 
of Directors under the 1990 Growth Management Initiative limits. The two 
projects total 47,229 square feet, leaving 193,052 square feet remaining for 
allocation out of the yearly limit of 250,000 square feet for commercial 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Two more commercial projects, totaling 112,698 square feet, have also been 
submitted, along with 24 housing projects whose total units exceed by 39 the 
yearly 250 unit limit. These projects will be evaluated later this year by the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
In other growth management matters, the board rejected proposed sales price 
limits that would have provided exemptions from the initiative for new 
moderate-income housing. Those limits were tentatively set at $73,765 for a 
one-bedroom unit to $119,515 for a four-bedroom unit. However, the board asked 
the Planning Department to come up with possible price limits based on local 
real estate prices, not on state income guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, approved by the voters last year, sets construction limits in 
Pasadena for the next 10 years.

electricity a month would pay $35.42, a $1.96 increase from the current $33.46 
charge. A commercial customer using 2,000 kilowatt hours per month and now 
paying $173.90 would pay $187.15. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, which takes effect Friday, will enable the city-run electric 
utility to partially fund a two-year, $39.8-million capital improvement 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who objected called the rate hikes unfair, saying oil prices have 
been declining and electric rates should decline correspondingly.

PETE ELLIS GRANTED FUNDS FOR NEW CAR DEALERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, has entered into an 
agreement with automobile dealer Pete Ellis to develop an auto sales dealership 
in South Gate that officials said could produce more than $1 million in sales 
taxes in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have agreed to help Ellis develop property at 5910 Firestone Blvd., 
which is the site of a former dealership. 
</P>
<P>
The site has been vacant since South Gate Hyundai moved in December. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Ellis will be given a $350,000 grant and a $250,000 loan 
to improve the 2.7-acre property. Ellis will repay the loan at 12% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis will purchase an automobile dealership in another city and relocate it at 
the Firestone Boulevard site. As part of the agreement, the name of the 
dealership could not be revealed until escrow closes in about 45 days, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the agreement by a 5-0 vote. Last month, Ellis pulled out 
of a project to develop an auto sales lot next to a 20-acre mobile home park. 
Residents of the park and their supporters conducted a successful petition 
drive to place the issue on the ballot in June. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked whether they approve developing the property for any type 
of auto sales. The referendum is only an advisory measure. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis owns the Pete Ellis Dodge and Jeep/Eagle dealerships in South Gate.

$40,000 TO EDUCATION FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Max Salter said his appeal for supporters to contribute to the Beverly 
Hills Education Fund instead of his reelection campaign has raised more than 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing is that a lot of of them were people I don't even know," 
said Salter, who pledged to match the donations with at least $50,000 of his 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the contributors were unknown to him, most of the money came 
in after he made a series of telephone calls, Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
Salter and fellow City Council incumbent Robert K. Tanenbaum were re-elected in 
the April 3 election.

VOLUNTEER TUTORS SOUGHT

The Bureau of Jewish Education is looking for volunteers to help tutor the 
children of newly arrived Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Since their parents cannot speak English, these children desperately need 
tutors to help them with their schoolwork, both English and Hebrew," said 
Miriam Goldman, a spokeswoman for the Bureau, which is the educational arm of 
the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With 1,700 Soviets arriving in Los Angeles and another 3,000 expected in 1990, 
the demand is increasing, she said.

Connie Victoria is always hearing about her clothes. She's used to it, as you 
have to be if you don't wear anything less than 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what people think," she says. "I wear what I like." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a decidedly offbeat ensemble -- a long denim skirt paired with a 
lacy T-shirt and denim fringes -- Victoria shows off her vintage clothing store 
in Ventura, Street Scene Classics. 
</P>
<P>
A sleeveless black chiffon number with wine-colored lace and matching costume 
jewelry from the 1930s is displayed outside the door. A 1940s wedding dress and 
a white veil hang on the wall. A silk afternoon dress from the 1920s hangs in 
one corner. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing comes in lace, brocade and velvet, and with gloves, hats, shoes and 
costume jewelry, dating from the 1920s to the present. Both sexes are 
represented. None of it is in any sort of order. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria haunts estate sales, swap meets and garage sales. Treasures usually 
get a cleaning, but only one-fourth need repair, she said. "They're made so 
well," she said. "Everything is lined." 
</P>
<P>
Ballroom dancing allows her to show off her wardrobe, Victoria said, but most 
customers don't generally wait for a costume ball or Halloween to dress up. 
They tend to be "weird people, just like me, who want to have fun." PEGGY Y.

SLOWDOWN IN OFFICE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westside office market, usually one of the strongest in Southern 
California, lost more tenants than it gained during the first quarter of the 
year, signaling a dramatic slowdown, according to a report released this week 
by a national real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the Grubb &amp; Ellis Research Service Group of West 
Los Angeles, said that a surge of new office space entering the market, 
combined with an unusual jump in the amount of space being vacated by tenants, 
left the area with a decline -- about 30,000 square feet -- in the amount of 
office space occupied. 
</P>
<P>
While the decline was small, it is significant because the area had been 
absorbing an average of 300,000 to 500,000 square feet of new space per quarter 
over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate for the Westside rose from 13.5% to 15.6% at the end of the 
first quarter, as about 1 million square feet of new office space entered the 
market. The slowdown is likely to continue, the Grubb &amp; Ellis report said, 
because an additional 1.4 million square feet of new space is expected to be 
completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The firm surveyed 296 existing buildings and 18 projects under construction for 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills may be hit especially hard by tenant departures. American Medical 
International has given up 30,000 square feet of space as it begins moving its 
national headquarters from Beverly Hills to Dallas. AMI may vacate another 
50,000 square feet in the next several months, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and other financial firms, as a 
result of the collapse of the junk bond market, may vacate as much as 200,000 
square feet of space in Beverly Hills by the end of the year, according to 
brokers.

STREETS BARRICADED IN 2 LOCATIONS IN ATTEMPT TO CUT FLOW OF DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police street barricades, successful in stemming the flow of drugs through some 
neighborhoods near downtown Los Angeles, are getting a tryout in two Westside 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials, with some fanfare, announced Wednesday that they 
have barricaded one of two entrances to the Mar Vista Gardens housing project, 
a 600-plus apartment complex notorious for violence spawned by area drug sales 
and gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the site, police said they have closed off Marionwood 
Drive, the major thoroughfare through the project, at Braddock Drive, creating 
a cul-de-sac. Motorists will be able to enter the massive complex only from 
Inglewood Boulevard, said Capt. Patrick Froehle, commanding officer of the 
Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, barricades were set up in the Wilshire District to restrict 
access to a neighborhood just off Hauser Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the barricades, set up to restrict access to Hauser from Adams 
Boulevard south to Jefferson Boulevard, appear to have cut rampant drive-by 
drug sales that have plagued the area for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been fighting the problem for more than two years and it hasn't 
helped," LAPD Sgt. Tom Johnson said. "The barricades seem to be slowing the 
dope dealers somewhat, because the buyers are afraid of entering the area. They 
read the signs and say, 'We've got to get out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police say they began using the barricades last October, in the Pico-Union area 
near downtown Los Angeles. In recent months, they have expanded the program to 
include an area in the Newton Division in South-Central Los Angeles, and in the 
police department's Van Nuys and Devonshire divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they have had some unexpected, but welcome, results. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody was surprised that drive-by shootings and narcotics 
trafficking went down significantly," LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wonderful surprise was that 150 to 200 more kids attended school at one 
place, Jefferson High School, immediately after the barricades went up. We feel 
it was that feeling of safeness the kids had, that they could walk the streets 
without being accosted," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista Gardens has been the site of several gang-related slayings recently, 
including one last month, and authorities are worried that gang activity is off 
to a record-breaking start this year. Several gangs are headquartered inside 
the projects, just west of the San Diego Freeway and north of the Marina 
Freeway, and rival gangs are nearby, police say. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had an increase of crime in the area and there is a substantial 
narcotics and gang problem, and this is an effort on the part of police and the 
community to combat those two problems," Froehle said. He said police spent the 
last month garnering the support of local Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, city 
housing officials and neighbors before approving use of the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the barricades will separate the (drug) buyers from the sellers," 
Froehle said, "and also reduce the amount of gang violence by deterring 
individuals from entering the areas when they realize they'll have to make a 
U-turn and drive back out the way they came." 
</P>
<P>
At the open entrance to Mar Vista Gardens, advisories will be posted warning 
that it is the only way in and out of the complex, that only residents and 
their guests will be allowed in, and that there will be an increased police 
presence at the entrance and throughout the complex at any given time, Froehle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore Grammatico, president of the Del Rey Homeowners and Neighbors Assn., 
said he supports the idea but thinks it will have little impact on the seven 
gangs he says operate and sell drugs out of Mar Vista Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like a Band-Aid approach to the whole problem," Grammatico said 
Wednesday. "How effective could something like that be when you have such a 
longstanding feud between major gangs?" 
</P>
<P>
Froehle and other police officials said they have no immediate plans to set up 
barricades in other Westside high-crime areas. "But it's a possibility," 
Froehle said. "Obviously, if a program is successful, it will be repeated in 
other locations."

STREET CLOSED AFTER 5 DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Exasperated residents of San Luis Street, scene of five drive-by shootings 
since September, have persuaded city officials to temporarily erect barricades 
at one end of the street. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time Pomona has closed a street to stop drive-by 
shootings, a tactic that is being used in Los Angeles to deal with drugs and 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there have been no injuries in the drive-by shootings on the 
street. But resident Linda Bustos told City Council on Monday that bullets have 
come close to hitting her 15-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very scared," she said. "My neighbors are upset. We're tired of it, and 
we want something done." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to instruct the Public Works Department to erect 
barriers on San Luis Street at Orange Grove Avenue. The barriers will keep 
traffic from entering or leaving San Luis at Orange Grove, but traffic will 
still be able to enter and leave at Cadillac Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Chuck Heilman said the neighborhood, between Orange Grove and Garey 
avenues, south of La Verne Avenue, is not known for gang activity, and the 
shootings could be motivated by a personal dispute rather than gang rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman said neighbors have given police a number of tips in the case, but 
authorities have not identified any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Maridel Davis, who has lived on San Luis Avenue since 1952, told the council it 
has always been a good, quiet neighborhood. "I've lived here a long time," she 
said. "I've never been frightened until the last few months." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said parents along the street say their children are not involved in 
gangs. "These aren't kids out getting into trouble," she said, "but they're 
getting shot at." 
</P>
<P>
Bustos said residents have tried to get license numbers and descriptions of 
cars, but the shootings occur at night and the lighting in the neighborhood is 
too dim. 
</P>
<P>
The council instructed city staff members to look into upgrading the lighting 
and taking other steps to make the street safer. 
</P>
<P>
Robert De Loach, public works director, said the city will erect temporary 
barriers immediately, but the council would have to conduct hearings to make 
closure of the street permanent. He said it would cost $15,000 to convert San 
Luis into a permanent cul-de-sac.

Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said 15 drive-by shootings in three 
months prompted his department to temporarily close two streets in 
South-Central Los Angeles to through traffic in February. Booth said the 
closures, along with increased police patrols, have reduced crime. The streets 
remain blocked off, and there have been no drive-by shootings reported since 
then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the tactic also has been used successfully in other parts of Los 
Angeles to discourage drug trafficking and gang activities, including drive-by 
shootings.

WHERE WILL CHILDREN PLAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have noticed in my area a great number of apartment buildings under 
construction. It is obvious that the city is facing an overpopulation problem. 
</P>
<P>
But, as I look at these huge apartment buildings, I ask myself a question. Are 
children going to live here? If so, where are they going to play? What kind of 
an environment will these apartments have to offer growing children? 
</P>
<P>
I think the building regulators are missing a very important factor in the 
building of so many apartments. As it is mandatory to have adequate parking 
spaces for each apartment, it should be mandatory that each building have an 
adequate playground according to its size or occupancy limit. 
</P>
<P>
My concern is that the future leaders of our country will not have the 
appropriate facilities to develop their motor skills. Consequently, this could 
raise a series of problems related to lack of space in which to move around, 
not enough exercise and lack of social contact. 
</P>
<P>
I definitely wouldn't like my grandchildren to grow up under these conditions.

HOW CORN MUFFINS CRUMBLE AT MA MATTIE'S SOUTHERN COOKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Oxnard, "The Stroll" is not a dance from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
It's a portion of the Ormond Beach neighborhood that at one time had a rep as 
being a home for strolling ladies of the night and certain related activities. 
</P>
<P>
But walk down The Stroll these days, and you'll instantly know that things have 
changed. I, for one, safely ventured there in search of Ma Mattie's Southern 
Cookin'. 
</P>
<P>
When the corn muffin didn't crumble in my hand before I could get it to my 
mouth, I figured that the trip had already been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
After looking at the menu, and even before the muffin, I walked outside to take 
a close look at the restaurant's sign. This was no barbecue joint -- although 
ribs are on the menu. And it wasn't Cajun -- even though the gumbo was as good 
as any I've had in a while. It was exactly what the sign said: "Southern Home 
Cooked Food." 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note on the wall, from an obviously satisfied customer, read: 
"I'm from Texas, and your cooking sure reminds me of Dallas and Lake Charles, 
La. . . ." That's what I might have said after a meal or two at Ma's, and I'm 
not from Texas. But in Lake Charles, Harold and Mattie Lockett's grandkids 
might not be running all over the place. You can tell they're the grandchildren 
because they're not eating. Any other kids in the place, it seems to me, would 
be eating. 
</P>
<P>
Before you order, this "down home" menu needs some study. There's a meat loaf, 
covered with brown onion gravy. Or fried chicken crisp enough to make you think 
you're at a Pioneer Chicken store, but without a lot of the grease. 
</P>
<P>
Ma's collard greens, and red beans, among several of the traditional side 
dishes, are Southern-good. Biscuits are soft and heavy, made on the premises. 
With the gravy they're probably as good as you'll find on this edge of the 
Mason-Dixon Line. I've got to admit that I've never been in an adventurous 
enough mood to try the pigs' feet. Next time, maybe. Nor have I sampled Ma's 
Sunday special, the chitterlings. 
</P>
<P>
And with some of that spicy food, like the chicken and sausage jambalaya, I 
wish they served beer. 
</P>
<P>
Ma's desserts, however, are as good as they look. (Your eyes are drawn to them 
as soon as you walk in.) "We make 'em here," says Lulu, Ma's daughter. I can 
never pass up a chance to try a chocolate cake -- any chocolate cake. This is a 
good, heavy German one. And there's sweet potato pie of course. But those are 
small potatoes compared to the peach cobbler and the bread pudding. I carried a 
three-day supply of each of these out the door with me in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
These are desserts, Lulu says, which were popular at old-time Baptist Church 
Sunday dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Ma Mattie's may not be the place for a barbecue purist, or a Cajun aficionado, 
but for a lover of pure, traditional Southern cooking, it's worth a drive to 
"The Stroll." 
</P>
<P>
MA MATTIE'S 
</P>
<P>
Ma Mattie's Southern Cookin', 601 W. Hueneme Road, Oxnard. (805) 986-3827. Open 
Tuesday through Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Friday and Saturday until 9 p.m.). 
No alcohol. Reservations not necessary. No credit cards. Dinner for two, food 
only, $16-$20.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ZONING REDUCTIONS TO BLOCK APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council last week unanimously approved zoning reductions 
to prevent apartment construction on portions of nine blocks in Atwater 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
In a single ordinance adopted Friday, the council changed the designation of 
the nine areas from medium to low-medium density. 
</P>
<P>
The new zone allows for the construction of single-family homes and duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
The areas include portions of the five blocks northwest of Fletcher Drive 
between Larga and Casitas avenues, the block southwest of Atwater Avenue 
between Silver Lake Boulevard and Garcia Street, and the four blocks northwest 
of Los Feliz Boulevard between Glenfeliz Boulevard and Boyce Avenue. Other 
portions in those blocks retain their present zoning for either commercial or 
single-family home construction. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Weitzer, planning deputy for Councilman John Ferraro, said the downzoning 
was initiated by residents to eliminate the possibility of apartment houses 
being built in the area.

A COACH LETS GO; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER A WEEK ON HIS NEW JOB IN COLORADO, JOE HARRINGTON RETURNS TO LONG BEACH 
FOR BELONGINGS AND SOME GOODBYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near the top of the world because of his new job as basketball coach at the 
University of Colorado, Joe Harrington made a nostalgic descent this week back 
to Cal State Long Beach and realized how hard it can be to let go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad coming back. I really liked Long Beach and the people here," 
Harrington said Tuesday morning as he gathered his belongings in his former 
office. "I enjoyed my three years here more than at any place I've coached." 
</P>
<P>
He said that last week, while on his new job, "I got on the phone with a 
recruit and said, 'This is Joe Harrington from Long Beach State.' " 
</P>
<P>
Behind his old desk, Harrington found a clock, still in its box, that was his 
award for being a head coach in this year's National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if Seth is going to let me keep it," he wondered, referring to his 
successor and former top assistant, Seth Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a five-year contract worth more than $1 million, why did Harrington 
leave after three years and a 53-36 record with the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is that (Colorado) is the state university," he said, "which 
means football and basketball coaches are highly visible in the state. It's 
amazing how recognizable they make you. In a week and a half I've been on TV 
more times than in all my other jobs combined. They know you are the UC coach." 
</P>
<P>
Already he has done his first Joe Harrington Show for a Denver TV station. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington felt he might have coached his last game for Cal State Long Beach 
right after the 49ers lost to Hawaii last month in the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the bar of a Honolulu hotel later that night, Harrington, who had also been 
sought by the University of Miami (Fla.), talked of the importance of financial 
security. "I'm not going to be coaching forever," he had said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, there were other considerations that swayed the 44-year-old 
Harrington as much as money, things he will now have that he did not have at 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorado has an on-campus facility and a student population of 25,000, who 
either live on campus or in the town (Boulder)," said Harrington, who is 
leaving a university that has only a 2,000-seat gym and a small percentage of 
its more than 30,000 students living on campus. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 Tuesday morning, Martha Fronke, the 49ers basketball secretary, arrived 
for work and greeted Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
He hugged her, then said, "The hardest thing about leaving is the players and 
the people you work with. I'm so proud of what's transpired here. I wouldn't be 
at Colorado if it weren't for guys like Morlon Wiley, John Hatten and Tyrone 
Mitchell. Those guys busted their butts for me. I've grown to appreciate and 
love what players do for coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington has found at Colorado a situation similar to the one he encountered 
upon arriving at Long Beach: a nucleus of promising players but a tradition of 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
"(Colorado) hasn't won an away game in the conference in 52 games, and they've 
been in the cellar five straight years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Colorado, which had a 12-18 record last season, plays in the 
Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
An average crowd of only 3,700 watched the Buffaloes in their 11,000-seat arena 
last season. But, unlike at Long Beach, there are a lot of seats to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one limitation at Long Beach State, and that's (the lack of) a 
(campus) arena," said Harrington, who hated the sight of the 49ers' gym. 
"That's the one thing I won't miss about Long Beach, all those lines on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
It does appear, Harrington allowed, that he is on top of the world. "But in 
reality, I think I'm going to have to work harder than I have at any place I've 
been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's tentative schedule for next season includes games at North Carolina, 
Wake Forest, Wyoming and the Connecticut tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's besides playing Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri twice," he said. "You 
think that's not a step up? 
</P>
<P>
"And there's a whole lot more pressure. It's a big, big difference. The 
pressure here was self-induced. There wasn't pressure from the fans and alumni 
here like there will be there." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Cal State Long Beach program should prosper under Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for Seth," Harrington said. "I can't think of many young coaches who 
inherited a team like the one he will have. That's a darned good basketball 
team coming back here. We've turned it around here. We've got ourselves in 
position to keep winning here." 
</P>
<P>
He had said "we" when he meant "they." But that habit will be hard to break for 
a while. 
</P>
<P>
As Harrington walked across the campus to a snack bar for coffee, people called 
out farewells. His eyes glinted in the morning sun. He could have been 
wondering how far golf balls travel in that Rocky Mountain air, and thinking of 
a way to turn some heads in the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have silver home uniforms," Harrington said. "We had California 
gold here, we'll have Colorado silver there." 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to the basketball building, he shook hands with Greenberg, who 
said Harrington could keep the NIT clock. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg was hard at work, so Harrington looked for a place to make some 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"You can use my old office," Greenberg said. They both laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't life great," Harrington said, able to let go after all.

NOGALES HIGH TRIPLE JUMPER IS ALL BUSINESS, AIMS FOR RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: BILLY IVEY MISSED THE CIF MASTER'S MEET BY A QUARTER OF AN INCH LAST 
SEASON. THE SETBACK HAS MADE HIM WORK HARDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Ivey still vividly remembers the low point in an otherwise brilliant high 
school track career. 
</P>
<P>
It came last year, when the Nogales High triple jumper realized that he had 
failed to qualify in his specialty by a mere quarter of an inch at the CIF 
Southern Section Master's Meet. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Ivey said it was like a nightmare that he simply wanted to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 19-year-old senior has taken steps to turn his disappointment 
into a positive experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed making the Master's by one-quarter of an inch but I think that was 
the best thing that could have happened to me," Ivey said. "It made me work 
harder. Now when I go out at practice and meets, it's always at 110%." 
</P>
<P>
It's an all-business approach that Ivey said didn't exist in the past. It has 
helped him produce marks of 49-0 1/4 in the triple jump -- fourth best in the 
nation among prep athletes this year -- and 24-0 in the long jump. He has also 
run the 100-meter dash in a swift 10.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey gives much of the credit for his improvement to his coach from outside 
school, Charles Yendork, who started working with him in January. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons for my success this season is I know that I have to be 
serious about this and I think the biggest thing that has changed is Mr. 
Yendork being my coach," Ivey said. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork, whose daughter Julianna is at Walnut High and is the top girls high 
school long and triple jumper in the nation, said Ivey improved quickly after 
he started working with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He started with me after Christmas and since then he has progressed from 
(about) 45 feet then to over 49 feet now," Yendork said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey said the coach helped instill a hard-work approach to practicing and 
competing and improved his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the little things that he worked on that made a big difference," Ivey 
said. "He's helped me build my confidence back up. I'm back at the level where 
I should be. It's not that I'm cocky. I just know what I'm supposed to be 
doing. When I go to a track meet now, all I try to do is execute like I do in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like you can accomplish anything if you work at it and Mr. Yendork has 
me believing in myself." 
</P>
<P>
Besides instilling a better attitude and improved confidence in his 
performance, Ivey said the coach has also worked on the technical aspects of 
jumping. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a world-class jumper," Ivey said. "He was in the 1976 Summer Olympics, so 
he knows the triple jump. He can break it down for you in steps. He's a 
technician. He works with you on the little things that other people don't know 
as much about, like how to plant your feet and how not to break your speed when 
you're jumping. Those are things that keep you from going from 49 to 52 feet." 
</P>
<P>
While Yendork is pleased with Ivey's progress, he says there is still a lot of 
potential for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can be jumping 51 or 52 feet," he said. "Right now he should be 
jumping two more feet and I think in the next couple of meets he should be 
jumping over 50 feet. We know he's in that range so I won't be surprised if he 
gets there in the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where he is right now. It's just a matter of time. I think before he 
graduates he's capable of jumping in the 54-foot range." 
</P>
<P>
When Yendork first started speaking to Ivey about his potential, Ivey said he 
had difficulty believing the coach. That is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach always tells me, 'Billy, at any time you can go 52 or 53 feet (in the 
triple jump).' Before I just said, 'Really?' But now I truly believe him. I've 
almost gone that far in my scratch jumps." 
</P>
<P>
Ivey said he is just beginning to scratch the surface of the potential that he 
has as a track performer. 
</P>
<P>
It is potential that Ivey first displayed as a freshman at the since-closed 
Edgewood High in West Covina, when he produced a top mark of 47-3 1/2 in the 
triple jump -- the best leap in the nation for a freshman at the time. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore at Edgewood, he improved to 49-1 in the triple jump and 23-5 1/4 
in the long jump in winning both events in the Southern Section 2-A Division 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
But Ivey's career took one giant leap backward in his junior year. Ivey started 
the year at West Covina, which had merged with Edgewood, before transferring to 
Nogales after football season. 
</P>
<P>
He said his problems started after he sprained his ankle in a football game 
against Glendora. He said he never fully recovered, mentally or physically, 
from the injury the rest of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost broke my ankle in football and I wasn't as focused on track as I was 
in the two years before that," Ivey said. "The first two years I always thought 
I knew what I wanted. I wanted to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
While it was the ankle that might have affected his performance at first, Ivey 
said it was his attitude that cost him the most last season in track. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to the point where I would think, 'Hey, I'm Billy Ivey,' and all I had 
to do was show up," he remembers. "I thought it would be easy and I found out 
the hard way. You have to work at it and you always have to try your hardest. 
The gods have blessed me with pretty good speed and jumping ability and I 
wasn't using it. It was a nightmare. Guys I was beating by five feet before (in 
the triple jump) were beating me." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Ivey, his senior year has been considerably more memorable so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
It started with football season, when he starred as a tailback and defensive 
back for Nogales. He rushed for 1,006 yards and eight touchdowns and 
intercepted five passes to lead the Nobles to the Division IV semifinals -- the 
best finish in school history. 
</P>
<P>
He was also named to The Times All-San Gabriel Valley team and made the 
All-Sierra League squad on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year starter at three different schools -- Edgewood, West Covina and 
Nogales -- says he was recruited by numerous NCAA Division I football programs. 
He also has the speed, with a best of 4.36 seconds in the 40-yard dash, and the 
moves to excel at the major-college level. 
</P>
<P>
Only for Ivey, there is no question about which sport he will pursue in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"Track is my first love," he says. "I just like to play football to give track 
a rest and not get burned out. I could go out for both (football and track) in 
college but I prefer track." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to track, there is also no question about which event he enjoys 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my body's build is perfect for triple jumping," he said. "It's not too 
small but not too big. I have to be explosive every time I jump. If I had a 
chance to start (my career) over again I'd still pick the triple jump. It's the 
most graceful of any event in track." 
</P>
<P>
Yendork also thinks Ivey has outstanding ability in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got 25-foot potential in the long jump," Yendork says. "It's just a 
matter of timing and doing it in the meets." 
</P>
<P>
Ivey says there is no limit to his potential in the jumping events. But for the 
moment, he said he has two other goals in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"So far in track, I've gotten all of the awards but two," he said. "I don't 
have a state championship or a league championship. But this year I think I 
have a chance to get both." 
</P>
<P>
With the Southern Section and state championships coming up in May and June, 
Ivey said he feels primed for peak performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like no one is going to be able to come in and jump leisurely and beat 
me," Ivey said. "I'm going to pose a challenge. I'm going for the gold and 
setting records. I want to be No. 1, not just in California. I want to be the 
best jumper in the nation before the year ends and if I work at it I feel I can 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound a little too ambitious. But with his new-found approach to 
track, Ivey is not about to dismiss the possibility.

SEARCH FOR FOSTER HOMES STILL DIFFICULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An increasing number of single people, seniors and dual-career couples are 
opening their homes to the hundreds of abused or neglected Ventura County 
children who are removed from their homes each year. But social workers say the 
shortage of available foster care is still far from over. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in bad shape," said Diana Caskey, who works with the Department of 
Children's Services as Ventura County's foster home recruiter. "Each time a 
child comes to us, finding a foster home is a little like hunt and peck." 
</P>
<P>
Each month, between 40 and 60 children require some kind of foster care, Caskey 
said. But only 55 licensed homes in the county have available beds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even then, that statistic is deceiving," Caskey added. "It's rare to get a 
foster parent who says, 'I'll take any age, any sex, any behavior problem.' 
There usually are some restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, I had a 7-year-old boy, and there was no place to put him," she 
said. "I finally had to call a woman who had requested only girls." 
</P>
<P>
No statistics are available that compare the reasons for foster care placement 
over the years. Between 1987 and 1988, however, the last year for which data is 
available, Caskey said the majority of emergency foster care placements were 
because of parental neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Young children have been found alone in homes where the power and water have 
been turned off, and where there has been no food for days, she said. Social 
workers have also removed children who have refused to go to school and have 
been left home alone for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be amazed how many parents have no idea how to set any limits," Caskey 
said. "They want to be their children's buddies or something, and then when the 
child gets older and he wants to do whatever he wants, the parent has no 
control. There's usually a lot of dysfunction in these families." 
</P>
<P>
Next are cases of physical abuse, sexual abuse, child abandonment and 
drug-addicted infants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of cocaine and heroin babies, and those have definitely 
increased," Caskey said. "Even though we don't keep figures on how it compares 
to five years ago, I personally think drugs and alcohol play a big role in 
foster care. They can be involved in every category." 
</P>
<P>
Before a drug-addicted child is removed from its home, the mother is first 
given the opportunity to enter a drug rehabilitation program, Caskey said. In 
many cases, she said, the mother is unwilling to comply. AURORA MACKEY

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's and women's track teams will play host to the University of 
Houston men and women on Saturday at Drake Stadium. Field events will begin at 
11:30 a.m. for the women and at 1:15 p.m. for the men. The first women's race 
is at 1:30 p.m. and the first men's run at 2. The hammer throw will be at 10 
a.m. at West Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin men, 3-0 in dual meets this season, have a 44-0-1 dual record in 
Coach Bob Larsen"s sixth season. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's Texas Relays, several UCLA men excelled. Senior Victor Santa 
Maria was second in the invitational 5,000 meters in 14:26.27, senior Derek 
Knight won his 110 hurdle heat in a season-best 14.02 but pulled out of the 
final with a slight groin muscle strain, junior Jay Borick went a personal-best 
17-5 in the pole vault, senior Brian Blutreich was third at 185-1 and senior 
Pete Thompston fourth at 179-1 in the discus and sophomore Sven Haug was fourth 
in the invitational 1,500 in a season-best 3:53.39. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA junior shot-putter Tracie Millett was named the Pacific 10 Conference 
woman athlete of the week after she set a career-best mark of 51-9 3/4 at the 
Texas Relays. 
</P>
<P>
At last weekend's San Diego crew races, the UCLA women's varsity and junior 
varsity boats won their races, the Bruin men's varsity finished second to 
Harvard in the Copley Cup race and the UCLA freshman men took a first. 
</P>
<P>
In the Copley Cup competition Harvard won in 6:11.31 and UCLA was second in 
6:15.45. The final was a re-row after the first race, won by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA men will play host to California at 11 a.m. Saturday at the UCLA 
boathouse in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team, 20-3 after last week's loss to No. 2 
USC in the finals of the Diet Pepsi/UCLA tournament, will play at No. 3 Hawaii 
tonight and Friday night. The first match counts as a Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. contest, and the second does not. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans beat the Bruins in four games at last week's tournament. UCLA was 
led by junior Carl Henkel, who had 24 kills and nine digs. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's softball team (38-5 and 7-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference) will 
entertain No. 8 California in a double-header at 1 p.m. Friday at the Sunset 
Canyon diamond on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Last week UCLA's Lisa Longaker (13-0) pitched the second perfect game of her 
career in the nightcap as the Bruins swept a double-header from Arizona State. 
UCLA also won a double-header from No. 11 San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 UCLA women's tennis team (18-4, 4-3 in the Pac-10) will play host to 
No. 4 USC (17-4, 5-2) at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on 
campus.

Last week the Bruins lost 5-4 to top-ranked Stanford and No. 5 California. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 4 Pepperdine men's tennis team (22-3) will be idle because of final 
examinations until the West Coast Conference championships on April 20-22 in 
San Diego. Last week the Waves defeated No. 14 UC Irvine, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 8 UCLA men's tennis team (19-3 overall, 4-1 in the Pac-10) will play 
host to No. 11 USC (17-6, 4-2) at 1:30 p.m. Friday at the Los Angeles Tennis 
Center on campus. When the teams met in March the Bruins won, 5-4, as UCLA's 
Jason Netter upset Byron Black at No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins lost at No. 1 Stanford, 5-1. UCLA's only winner was

fourth at the nationals behind Utah, Alabama and Georgia, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Last week senior Jill Andrews won the all-around title at the regional with a 
career-high score of 39.225, helping the Bruins score a season-high 192.05. 
Andrews won the vault at 9.9 and the beam with a score of 9.8, a record for the

ROCK CLIMBING;

<P>
TRAINING BEGINS WITH GLUING STONES TO ROAD WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE KEENEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura might seem like an unlikely place for a climbing cult to flourish. 
Local hills are sandstone and the rock is insufficient for lead climbing. It's 
a long way to Joshua Tree. 
</P>
<P>
But Black Diamond, a well-known Ventura manufacturer of climbing equipment, and 
the Ventura River Wall, a 250-foot traversing wall beneath the freeway, have 
put Ventura on the climbing map. 
</P>
<P>
Black Diamond employs many climbers. To some of them, Painted Cave, Gibraltar 
Rock, Sespe Gorge and other county climbs are out of reach at the end of a 
workday. Two years ago, some climbers got a wild idea and started gluing rocks 
on a wall in the Ventura riverbed under the Ventura Freeway. That was the 
beginning of the River Wall. It's the closest thing to real climbing near home 
and is perfect for training during the week. 
</P>
<P>
The River Wall is not the only freeway wall being used by rock climbers. For 
years now, rock-climbing enthusiasts have been gluing rocks to acres of 
vertical Caltrans concrete to make artificial climbs. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation recently came across some rocks glued to 
a freeway supporting wall at Flint Canyon Wash near Pasadena. Now that they 
know what people are doing there, Caltrans will be removing the rocks, said 
Selma Gleason, spokeswoman of Caltrans District 7 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But to destroy all climbing walls, Caltrans will have to find them, and that 
could take a while. Walls are carefully guarded secrets, passed by word of 
mouth in a very small circle. 
</P>
<P>
According to members of that circle, as many as 30 other walls may exist in Los 
Angeles County, with dozens more in Orange and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The River Wall is no longer a secret since it has been written about in 
Climbing magazine and is one of three Caltrans walls mentioned in Craig Fry's 
"Bouldering Guide to Southern California" (Chockstone Press, Boulder, Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
The wall is easy to miss, almost invisible. When the late afternoon sunlight 
slants in under the bridge, the wall could almost be mistaken for quirky 
conceptual art -- until climbers get on it, moving in a crisscross pattern from 
rock to rock. 
</P>
<P>
The glued-on rocks, collected from climbing areas around the world -- such as 
the Shawangunks in New York state, El Trono Blanco in Baja California and the 
Blue Mountains in Australia -- are interspersed with manufactured holds. Six 
U.S. companies now design and manufacture the artificial holds. 
</P>
<P>
According to Reese Martin, an environmental engineer and a climber, the 
creators of the River Wall chose not to bolt anything into the concrete 
surface. Instead, to preserve the wall's structural integrity, they used glue. 
Reflectorized road marker adhesive is the epoxy of choice, but it's expensive. 
Bondo body-work filler is cheaper but more brittle. 
</P>
<P>
"Two kinds of wall-climbing are possible," Martin said. "Some climbs are 
designed to go up, such as the 65-foot vertical pillar ascent under the 210 
Freeway, a climb which requires bolts and equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The River Wall, however, was designed for horizontal traversing, or 
"bouldering" -- climbing close to the ground for fun and training. 
</P>
<P>
For added enjoyment, or perhaps to make up for the missing thrill that height 
provides, horizontal climbers play games to help develop their form -- hands 
must be kept below shoulders, and no touching the same rock twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Good for the tendons and hands," Martin said, climbing onto the wall. He moved 
quickly and smoothly from north to south about two or three feet off the 
ground, making it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
"No need to go higher," he said. "It's just practice." 
</P>
<P>
The highest holds on the River Wall are less than 10 feet off the ground. And 
yet, far above the highest holds can be seen ghostly, chalky palm prints. 
</P>
<P>
"Made by a hot dog," said Fred Clark, a manager at General Electric and a wall 
regular with a disdain for vertical climbing. Clark recently introduced his 
12-year-old son, E. J., to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't good at anything," Clark said. "But when he took climbing classes 
and found out how good he was, he gained self-confidence and improved 
enormously at school. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a damn spider up there," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Clune is a world-class climber. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit in which the River Wall was built was to have a place where we can 
get a good 'pump,' " said Clune, a sales representative for Black Diamond. 
"It's a fun social event, and it's not dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Robinson, an orthopedic surgeon and an avid climber, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think there'd be spectacular trauma with such an apparently dangerous 
sport," Robinson said. "But in fact you almost never get significant injuries. 
Anything more than a bruise or sprained ankle is unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and his wife, Susan, an internist, have climbed in France and 
frequently climb at sites outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
"After I started climbing the River Wall, I got tons better as a climber," said 
Susan Robinson, who once broke her wrist climbing. "Climbing the wall's good 
for two things: grip strength and moving sidewards -- which gives you more 
options when climbing on real rock." 
</P>
<P>
"The wall's an organic thing," Martin said. "Someone adds a hold here, or 
steals a hold, or a hold breaks off, it changes." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, so many holds have been added that the wall's not as 
difficult as it used to be. But it's not a wall anyone can just get on and 
climb either. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't catch the bug on that wall," Martin said. "It's not for beginners. 
But you can get a good workout on it." 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura River Wall was one of the first," Craig Shaw said. "It put a seed 
in people's minds. In fact, some climbers had been trying to design wall 
routes, but when they came to Ventura and saw the River Wall, they realized 
that just placing the rocks aimlessly was better." 
</P>
<P>
Cam Donnahoo learned to climb on Gainsborough Road in Thousand Oaks. He and his 
wife both work out on the wall; one climbs while the other holds their 
10-month-old son, Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
Like many local climbers, Donnahoo is afraid that the wall's existence is 
jeopardized by Caltrans' recent discovery at Flint Canyon Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to keep the wall," Donnahoo said, bouncing the baby. "It's the only 
local place with easy access." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climbers' Glue Is a Sticky Issue 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans workers had known for some time that something unusual was going on at 
Flint Canyon Wash near Pasadena. The rocks glued to a wall of the freeway 
bridge there gave them a clue. But it wasn't until last month that they found 
out those rocks had been put there by rock climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans decided the rocks had to be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at our bridges, our freeways, our abutments every day, and it's 
possible workers are finding the rocks," said Selma Gleason, a Caltrans 
spokeswoman in Los Angeles. "But we don't have people out specifically looking 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
The primary cause for concern is the safety of both climber and motorist, and 
the liability of the state should either get injured in a wall-climbing 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Climbers have been slapping rocks onto the walls without getting permits from 
Caltrans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to fill out an application first," Gleason said. "There is 
information they need to answer like, 'What do you want to do? How often? Do 
you have insurance?' " 
</P>
<P>
An application for gluing rocks to a wall? Does such a permit really exist? 
Well, not exactly. But Caltrans wants certain basic questions answered. Then, 
they say, they will review each situation individually. 
</P>
<P>
So there is a chance that someone could get a rock-gluing and climbing permit? 
</P>
<P>
"We can't answer hypothetical questions," Gleason said, "but all applications 
are entitled to consideration."

READING: OXNARD MAN SEES COURSE LEADING TO A HAPPIER LIFE AND A DRIVER'S 
LICENSE, SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO ON DATES ON A BUS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alan McElhiney wants the three Rs in his life. That's reading, 'riting and 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 41, the Oxnard man can't read or write beyond the second-grade 
level. He thinks that if he can pick up some basic skills, he can find love and 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
He says that is his main motivation for spending two hours a week at the Oxnard 
Adult School. He is in the Ventura County Library's reading program for adults, 
an adult literacy tutoring program. The free lessons are supported by a 
consortium of county libraries, adult-education schools and literacy programs. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, McElhiney knew the alphabet, period. A couple of weeks ago, 
he scored 95 on a test, and last week, he was working with his volunteer tutor, 
Pat Soyster, on punctuation and capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"You punctuate when you talk," Soyster told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he replied. "I always punctuate when I talk." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean you've got it in your head," Soyster said. "But not when you read it." 
</P>
<P>
What he has in his head, too, is love. When Pat asked him about his love life, 
he laughed shyly and answered, "What love life?" 
</P>
<P>
"Getting another girl is what I want," he said. "But I have to pass my driver's 
test. I met a girl on a train from Seattle. We were getting along pretty good. 
We spoke on the phone. Then she wrote me a 'Dear John' letter. I felt if I had 
been able to drive, I could have taken her out instead of going on dates on a 
bus." 
</P>
<P>
McElhiney needs to read to pass the driver's test. He also needs to read to 
become a writer or a bus driver, two of his other pursuits. He works in the 
shipping and receiving department for Goodwill Industries of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Boston but never went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County has an estimated 82,000 adults who are unable to read above the 
fifth-grade level, the state says. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, there were never more than 10 students enrolled in the 
literacy program at a time. Now it has 55 students in its eight locations and a 
waiting list of 30, and there is a shortage of tutors. 
</P>
<P>
The reading program operates at eight locations throughout the county, and a 
ninth center will be added around June. Last week, the Moorpark City Council 
appropriated $8,000 to start a program. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of high school graduates who are reading at a second- or 
third-grade level," site supervisor Jeannie England said. "A lot of the 
students have learning disabilities. Some are dyslexic. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have some Spanish-speaking students who as children moved every six 
months to Mexico and to the States and to Mexico and to the States and were 
never in school long enough." 
</P>
<P>
England says the majority of the students come with one of two goals: better 
jobs and staying ahead of their school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has both. She is 31 years old with a 7-year-old girl and a factory job. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about learning to read and write all the time," she said. "But now 
my daughter is moving into a higher grade, and I didn't want her to fall back. 
I wanted to help her. I was just being lazy, and I was embarrassed to admit I 
have a learning problem. . . . It's not really a problem. Just hearing the word 
illiterate all the time starts getting to me." 
</P>
<P>
Rose managed to get through high school without reading and writing and takes 
most of the responsibility for that. "I'm the only one in my family who doesn't 
read and write," she said. "My parents say I just didn't want to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
It's a different story for Arnulfo Hernandez. The 32-year-old native of Mexico 
City has spent most of his life working in the fields and never before had a 
need to learn English. Now, working for the Burpee Seed Co. in Santa Paula, he 
needs it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in high school, I learned some, but since I only spoke with Mexican 
guys, I forgot a lot that I knew," he said. "When I worked in the fields, 
everybody spoke Spanish, so it was not necessary to speak English." 
</P>
<P>
When the program started in 1984, it was financed by a five-year state grant 
that was designed to diminish each year. As the state funds decreased, Ventura 
County had to make up the difference. When state funding ended completely in 
July, 1989, the county Board of Supervisors approved funding of $85,800 a year 
to maintain the program. 
</P>
<P>
While the cost of running such a program is high, officials say the cost of not 
running it is higher. The less educated the potential work force, the worse it 
is for the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Director/Choreographer Susan Marshall, for whom the Susan Marshall Dance 
Company is appropriately named, left the palm trees in New York. Can you 
believe it? She actually left the palm trees in New York. 
</P>
<P>
So when she brings her company to UC Santa Barbara next week she will have to 
improvise a little. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three works the group will be performing, "Articles of Faith," 
debuted at the World Financial Center in New York a while back, where the 
setting is a little different from the one at UCSB's Campbell Hall. 
</P>

"The stage had 40-foot palm trees coming out of the floor," said Marshall. "So 
the work has gone through some changes as we've been on the road without the 
palm trees. This is almost like a premiere." 
</P>
<P>
Even without the trees, "Articles of Faith," like all of Marshall's work, is 
like a novel told through dance. 
</P>
<P>
"It tells of a community of people, a group that keeps returning to where they 
used to be, and there's something evil there," she said. "But there are no 
specific characters, not even a plot like in my other works. It's much more 
episodic." 
</P>
<P>
The other two works the eight-person company will perform go back to Marshall's 
usual format. "Arms" is a duet performed by a man and a woman who move only 
their upper bodies and their arms. And an excerpt from "Interior with Seven 
Figures" revolves around a mother, a father and two sons and focuses on the 
family as a whole, said Marshall. "Our older works have been quite humorous and 
light, but this is quite a serious type of program," she said. "It's hard to 
find something naturally humorous in dance without forcing it. It has to be 
funny without being cartoony or campy." 
</P>
<P>
It's Marshall's way of telling a story that has earned her acclaim over the 
past five years. In 1985, the company's first year on tour, the 30-year-old 
Marshall was awarded the New York Dance and Performance Award for Outstanding 
Choreographic Achievement, and in 1987 she received the American Choreographer 
Award. Last year she won the Brandeis University Creative Arts Citation in 
Dance. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways the recognition makes it easier to work," she said. "It's a 
safety net. People will put up with you longer, even if you're not doing 
something they like. You're not going to lose all your funding and bookings in 
one year. Although we don't live in luxury by any means, we are getting 
funding." 
</P>
<P>
While Marshall and Company is more used to performing at international 
festivals, the visit to UCSB is just one stop in what Marshall says is the 
group's longest campus tour to date. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she said, audience reaction has been great. Maybe that's because her 
work can be enjoyed by the dance aficionado and novice alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We use a lot of gestures, everyday movement with dramatic qualities," she 
said. "Some of the audience who understand our work most simply and directly 
are elementary school students. Hopefully there's a level of our work that's 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall and Company will perform April 17 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15, $13 and 
$11 (general admission) and $13, $11, $9 (students). Marshall will be on campus 
a day earlier to give a free public lecture-demonstration at 4 p.m. in Campbell 
Hall.

The city of Santa Barbara will be 208 years old April 21, and residents are 
marking the occasion in a really big way beginning April 18: 
</P>
<P>
* For starters, the third annual Presidio Days will kick off with arts and 
crafts demonstrations -- from candle-making to leather tanning to wool dyeing 
to metalworking -- from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 18, continuing through April 
22. There will also be multicultural dance and music performances throughout 
the five-day celebration. 
</P>

* A concert by Bo Diddley on April 19 will highlight the second annual Santa 
Barbara Fair and Expo sponsored by the 19th District Agricultural Assn. It will 
run April 18 to 22. Diddley may know how to play guitar, but he's leaving the 
drums to the Trinidad Calypso Steel Drum Band, one of the musical acts that 
will perform at the fair. For added entertainment, Butler Amusements will again 
provide a carnival midway.

</P>
<P>
Oh, and keep an eye out for those swift swine, Hedrick's Racing Pigs from 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"The pigs are dressed in different-colored satins and they race down a track," 
said fair publicist Linda Mears. "They race for Fig Newtons, and people stand 
around and cheer. They're billed as the fastest pigs in North America." 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 adults, $2 seniors citizens, $1 children 6 to 12). Children 5 
and younger are admitted free. For information, call 687-0766.

Crime Statistics -- An article on Wednesday erroneously said FBI statistics 
show Thousand Oaks to be the safest U.S. city of 100,000 or more people, as 
measured by the number of reported crimes in relation to the population in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the article were for the total number of crimes, not the rate 
per 100,000 as the story stated. Thousand Oaks, with a population of 107,000, 
had the fewest reported crimes among the cities. That does not necessarily mean 
that it had the lowest rate. The figure reported for Los Angeles was greatly 
exaggerated. The actual number of crimes per 100,000 population in 1988, the 
latest for which data is available, was 6,861.

<TEXT>
<P>
After four decades of denying a dark past, East Germany today apologized to 
Israel and all Jews for the Nazi Holocaust and accepted joint responsibility 
for the slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"East Germany's first freely elected Parliament admits joint responsibility on 
behalf of the people for the humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, 
men and children," said a statement read by Speaker Sabine Bergmann Pohl to a 
televised session of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the 400 deputies backed the statement, which also covered 
relations with Moscow and postwar borders, in a vote. Then all stood in silence 
out of respect for those who died at the hand of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel sad and ashamed," the statement said. "We ask the Jews of the world to 
forgive us. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask the people of Israel to forgive us for hypocrisy and hostility of 
official East German policies toward Israel and for the persecution and 
degradation of Jewish citizens also after 1945 in our country." 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited development came as East Germany's new Parliament named Lothar 
de Maiziere as prime minister and backed a plan for swift unification with West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's first freely elected government also said a unified Germany should 
at least temporarily be a part of the NATO alliance, a key issue when the 
superpowers begin unification talks in the coming weeks. And it endorsed a 
merger of the two German currencies by July 1, a demand of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement among East Germany's major political parties on the speed of 
reunification, a united Germany's military alignment and a timetable for a 
currency union was a huge leap forward to creating a single Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping moves will be followed by unification talks with West Germany and 
the four World War II allies that divided the countries: the Soviet Union, 
United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable string of conciliatory gestures, Parliament recognized the 
legitimacy of Poland's postwar borders and apologized for East Germany's role 
in the Soviet-led invasion that crushed reforms in Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It also said East Germany is prepared to make reparations to Nazi victims and 
urged establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line Communist government that was toppled in October had never 
formally apologized for the Holocaust. West Germany has apologized for Nazi 
atrocities and has paid reparations to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament approved a declaration saying: "Jews in all the world and the people 
of Israel are asked to forgive us for the wrongs they experienced. Persecuted 
Jews should be granted asylum in the future in East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Michael Shilo, said the declaration 
appeared to meet Israel's two conditions for establishing ties -- East 
Germany's acceptance of moral responsibility for the Holocaust and its 
willingness to negotiate reparations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very positive text. It may be overdue, but it is nonetheless welcome," 
Shilo said.

Two people suspected of robbing a Yorba Linda bowling alley early this morning 
surrendered to police after a brief chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Grant Gulickson said two robbers armed with air pistols used a 
crowbar to pry open the back door of Village Bowl in the 18000 block of 
Imperial Highway at 3:15 a.m. They tied up a janitor and fled with with a 
pillowcase stuffed with an undisclosed amount of coins, Gulickson said. 
</P>
<P>
But the janitor freed himself and called police. An officer who responded to 
the scene saw the robbers' car leaving the bowling alley's parking lot. After a 
short chase, the officer found the car abandoned in the area of Oriente Drive 
and Lakeview Avenue in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Gulickson said the robbers ran to a friend's house and telephoned their 
parents, who advised them to surrender to police. They were later taken into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Michael Burton, 18, of Anaheim and a 17-year-old Brea youth. 
Burton is held on $10,000 bail while the juvenile, whose name is being withheld 
because of his age, was released to his parents after being booked on suspicion 
of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Gulickson said officers recovered the pillow case of coins and two air pistols.

SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICIAL SHOT IN FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERY BID

A Los Angeles school district official was shot and slightly wounded during an 
apparent follow-home robbery attempt in the underground garage of his Tarzana 
condominium, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel M. Isaacs, 50, assistant superintendent in charge of high schools in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, was treated for a shoulder wound and 
released from Tarzana Medical Center after the shooting about 10:15 p.m. 
Wednesday, Detective Robert Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs and his wife, Sandy, had just driven into the garage at their 
condominium in 18700 block of Hatteras Street when a gunman slipped through the 
open garage door, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"She saw the man with a gun and screamed, and her husband turned and confronted 
the suspect," Johansen said. "There was a verbal exchange and the suspect fired 
twice." 
</P>
<P>
One bullet struck Daniel Isaacs in the left shoulder, and the gunman ran from 
the garage without taking anything from the victims, police said. No arrests 
were made. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this was a robbery attempt," Lt. William Gaida said. "It has 
all appearances of a follow-home robbery."

Richard Dortch, Jim Bakker's right-hand man at the PTL Ministry, sobbed for 
mercy today before a federal judge who said he probably would reduce Dortch's 
eight-year prison sentence for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"For almost five years, I had been in a prison of my own, a prison I built for 
myself," Dortch, 58, told U.S. District Judge Robert Potter between bouts of 
weeping. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to see that prison is more than a physical place. I believe I've 
learned my lesson well." 
</P>
<P>
Potter said he needs time to consider the request for reducing the sentence for 
Dortch, who reported in February to a country club federal prison in Florida 
where prisoners live in unlocked dormitories and are free to play golf or 
tennis if they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch, whose testimony was crucial in convicting Bakker, pleaded guilty in 
August to four of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. Potter said he could not 
forget the fraud that Dortch, Bakker and others at PTL perpetrated against the 
television ministry's loyal followers.

President and Mrs. Bush paid $101,382 in 1989 federal income taxes on a gross 
income of $456,780, the White House disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who released copies of the tax 
returns to reporters, said that of the income Bush received $189,167 was his 
presidential salary. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is $6,229 he received as salary while serving as vice president 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes also reported $208,274 in income from other sources as well as $804 
in interest income and $16,238 in income from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
A long-term capital gain from his blind trust of $36,068 also was disclosed.

<P>
Fitzwater declined to explain why control of the blind trust was shifted from 
Bush's wealthy longtime friend, William Farish, to Bessemer Trust Co. of New

U.S. officials put a popular entertainment and disco district in Seoul off 
limits to American personnel today in an attempt to stem anti-American violence 
and protect U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.S. 8th Army for the 43,000 U.S. troops, thousands 
of civilian employees and their dependents in South Korea said the Itaewon 
entertainment district would be off limits indefinitely from midnight until 5 
a.m., effective Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many American families live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in recent years that U.S. military officials have placed 
an entire South Korean district off limits to American soldiers and civilians. 
Officials said it was being done to protect "the health and welfare" of U.S. 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"When lives are at stake, no measure is too extreme," said an unidentified 
official quoted in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks long near 8th 
Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and U.S. military personnel shop 
there by day, and at night its neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of young 
Koreans as well. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was an apparent move to avoid clashes between South Korean 
civilians and American soldiers who frequent late-night bars and entertainment 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a crowd of Koreans chased two U.S. military policeman and threw 
bottles, bricks and sticks. Two vehicles, including a U.S. military patrol car, 
were demolished, the windows of a police station were shattered and at least 
half a dozen people were injured.

Exiled former King Michael abandoned plans to return to his native Romania 
today after the Bucharest government, warning of possible violence, revoked his 
entry visa. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be in my country for Easter," the former monarch told a news 
conference in Zurich, from where he was to have flown to Bucharest for his 
first visit in 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching his passport in his hands and flanked by his wife, the former Queen 
Anne, Michael said it is a "very sad day when a country no longer accepts its 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
He said his planned trip to Romania after four decades in exile was "entirely 
motivated by personal and spiritual reasons connected with my wish to spend 
Easter in my country." He said he still hopes to return to Romania as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, who abdicated in 1947 after the Communist takeover, has mainly worked 
as a private businessman in Geneva. Now semi-retired, he says he does not seek 
to regain the throne but will do all he can to help his country, suffering 
political and ethnic instability since the execution of dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Michael flew from Geneva to Zurich on the first leg of his journey before 
aborting the effort. Earlier, the air carrier Swiss Air warned it would not 
allow Michael to fly to Romania without a visa. 
</P>
<P>
Romania canceled entry visas for Michael, 68, and his family only hours before 
they were scheduled to depart for Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
The move came a day after the government formally asked him to postpone his 
trip until after May 20 elections. The government warned of possible violence 
during the turbulent period leading up to the country's first democratic vote 
after more than 40 years of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, about 100 pro-monarchy demonstrators staged a rally in the 
capital to demand the return of the former king. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Dobre, 23, a student who was among the demonstrators, said restoring the 
monarchy might help solve Romania's myriad problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although few Romanians support the idea of restoring the monarchy, many 
expressed an interest in at least seeing what the former king looks like. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the former monarch's second-oldest daughter, Helen, who arrived in 
Bucharest Tuesday with a convoy of relief aid, said her father is not seeking 
his old throne but sees himself as a unifying and stabilizing figure.

Eli Lilly &amp; Co. has discontinued manufacturing 60 products and versions of 
products, according to a notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies said that the 
products involved were either old or slow-selling and that the loss of the 
items will have little or no financial impact on them. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't cause any problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a routine 
maintenance" of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for Bergen Brunswig 
Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly said it knows of no other manufacturers for 10 of the discontinued 
products, including two package sizes of 32 mg. Darvon capsules. However, other 
dosage sizes of Darvon are available. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer drug, and of 
Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly continues to manufacture 
those products in other formats. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection report on Lilly's 
manufacturing practices issued last year.

RETAILERS PUT BLAME FOR MEDIOCRE MARCH SALES ON LATE EASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the nation's big retailers today reported mediocre March sales due in 
part to this year's later Easter. 
</P>
<P>
The largest chain store reporting was discounter K mart Corp., which blamed the 
calendar shift for a so-so performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales were strong in the first two weeks of March but, because of the later 
date for Easter in 1990 than in 1989, sales weakened in line with expectations 
in the latter part of the month," said Joseph E. Antonini, K mart chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The retailers' results were compared with March, 1989, when stores drew 
customers because of holiday promotions to push everything from spring clothing 
to candy. Easter fell on March 26 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several major mass merchandisers, such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., posted their March sales a week ago as did a few department store 
groups. Overall, those results were sluggish. The exceptions were the perennial 
star performer Wal-Mart and stores concentrating on apparel.

STARKIST ADOPTS 'DOLPHIN-SAFE' POLICY ON TUNA 
</P>

StarKist Seafood Co., the world's largest tuna canner, said today that it will 
not purchase any tuna captured in nets along with dolphins nor will it buy any 
fish caught with gill or drift nets. 
</P>
<P>
StarKist, owned by H. J. Heinz Co., will become the first major tuna company to 
sell only "dolphin-safe" tuna for human and cat consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz Chairman Anthony J. F. O'Reilly said the decision will cost consumers "a 
couple of cents" extra on each can of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, a coastal zone from Chile to 
Southern California, customarily swim above schools of yellowfin tuna for 
reasons biologists cannot fully explain. When nets are spread out to catch 
tuna, dolphin are often caught as well, killing or maiming them. 
</P>
<P>
StarKist said it will buy only tuna that has been certified as dolphin-safe by 
an observer on a tuna boat. Currently, there are observers on every tuna boat 
in the U.S. fleet and on 30% of the foreign fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Also, StarKist will continue its practice of refusing to buy any fish caught 
with gill or drift nets, known to be dangerous to marine life. They are 
sometimes 40 miles in length. However, it will buy fish caught with purse-seine 
netting. 
</P>
<P>
Within three months cans of StarKist tuna sold in the United States will carry 
labels with the message, "No harm to dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists applauded the decision, with Greenpeace saying StarKist's 
leadership can help the rest of the tuna industry end its role in marine mammal 
killings.

JAPAN MONEY POLICY SHIFT MAY SLOW GROWTH IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: WEAK YEN, SHAKY TOKYO STOCK MARKET THREATEN CASH POOL THAT HAS 
BANKROLLED U.S. BORROWING.

<P>
The wellspring of Japanese cash that has bankrolled the U.S. government's 
borrowing spree may be drying up, threatening to increase interest rates and 
pare economic growth in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say the weak yen and shaky Tokyo stock market are ushering in a 
shift in Japanese money policy that could squeeze funds and ultimately boost 
the costs of borrowing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's days as the world's banker are over," said Kenneth Courtis, economist 
at Deutsche Bank Group in Tokyo. "Japan will not be the lender of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75% of Japan's net capital outflow between 1987 and 1989 went to the 
United States, constituting more than half of U.S. borrowing from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors have bought about one-third of U.S. Treasury bonds auctioned 
in recent years, providing a source of cash for the massive U.S. budget deficit 
and $3-trillion public debt. 
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese pare their investments by half, as some economists believe may 
happen, U.S. interest rates could climb three-quarters of a percentage point 
from their current level of 8.59% on the 30-year Treasury bond. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have been there to ensure that U.S. debt can be sold at a 
reasonable price," Courtis said. 
</P>
<P>
But that may now be changing. "We're taking a second look at U.S. bonds as they 
have lost some of their attractiveness," said a manager at one of the Japanese 
life insurance firms, which have become major overseas investors. 
</P>
<P>
Even a slight rise in interest rates for U.S. government bonds could lift 
borrowing costs throughout the economy, dampening already weak U.S. growth. 
</P>
<P>
Japan earned a reputation as the world's banker after the 1985 Plaza Accord, 
which sent the yen soaring and the dollar crashing lower as major 
industrialized nations tried to boost U.S. exports and pare the huge Japanese 
trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
An ample and growing supply of money in Japan combined with low interest rates 
provided an almost unlimited pool of cheap funds for investment. 
</P>
<P>
The combination sent Tokyo Stock Exchange share prices soaring, giving Japanese 
companies an easy way to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
But with interest rates now creeping higher throughout Europe, especially in 
West Germany, Japan has been forced to raise interest rates as well in a bid to 
prevent the yen from falling and triggering an inflationary spiral.

<P>
Reports of the death of Garry Shandling's character on the final "It's Garry 
Shandling's Show" are premature. 
</P>
<P>
The last show's theme is death -- Shandling's, specifically. 
</P>
<P>
And though the lead character is killed off, in the tradition of television 
series endings, there is a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In its inevitable style, "It's Garry Shandling's Show" ends with Shandling 
talking right to viewers at home. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say, 'Is it your show or is it your life?' " Shandling says to 
the camera. "This is just a show." 
</P>
<P>
The final episode of the show, which made its debut four years ago on the 
Showtime cable network, is slated for telecast on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We both made this decision a long time ago," co-creator and producer Alan 
Zweibel said during a taping of the final show earlier this week. "It's time to 
try something else."

'I LOVE LUCY' PILOT TO SEE LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS has announced that a previously unseen, 40-year-old, 34-minute pilot for 
the "I Love Lucy" series will air Monday, April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour special, hosted by Lucie Arnaz, daughter of the late comedian and 
her late husband, Desi Arnaz, will also include interviews and clips from some 
of the most popular shows in the all-time favorite series. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the pilot was recently discovered under the bed of Joanne Perez, 
where it had been stored for the past 39 years -- a forgotten gift from Lucy 
and Desi to Perez's husband, the famous vaudeville performer Pepito the Spanish 
Clown. Pepito, who was a guest star in the pilot, helped Lucy with her cello 
act and her "seal" act in vaudeville days. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, written by "I Love Lucy" creators Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh 
Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., includes a small portion of the Lucy-Desi nightclub 
act, which the special producers, Grant-Tribune Productions, call "an unusual 
blend of situation comedy and classic vaudeville." 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Carroll will both appear on the special.

AD AGENCY SUES LOWE, ALLEGING FAILURE TO WARN OF SEX SCANDAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An ad agency that hired actor Rob Lowe to promote a new car in Japan sued Lowe 
on Wednesday for allegedly failing to warn the firm about the scandal brewing 
over his appearance with a teen-ager in a sexually explicit videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo Inc., a large Tokyo advertising firm, said it lost $1.6 million after 
a videotape depicting Lowe having sex with a teen-age girl became public last 
year, the suit filed in U.S. District Court said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe was chosen to appear in commercials for Cultus, a car Suzuki Motors Co. 
marketed in Japan, "because of his positive and wholesome public image." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe was paid a total of $450,000 for the use of his "image" in the ad 
campaign, which began in August, 1988, and later was extended through May, 
1989, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract, Lowe promised that he would not "undertake any action 
that would . . . damage the business or reputation" of Hakuhodo or the car, 
including committing "a felony or crime of moral turpitude," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo claims that Lowe knew when he renewed the contract in March, 1989, 
that the videotape made during the period in which he attended the Democratic 
National Convention in Atlanta, Ga., had fallen out of his hands and "the 
possibility existed of its later distribution."

SINGER JAMES BROWN BEGINS WORK-RELEASE PROGRAM

Grammy-winning soul singer James Brown was freed from prison today after 16 
months so that he can begin a work-release program. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 56, who was serving concurrent six-year terms for leading police on a 
wild, border-crossing chase in 1988, will enter a work-release program Monday, 
acting as a sort of counselor with the Aiken and Barnwell Counties Community 
Action Commission. He will be in the office during the day and will return on 
nights and weekends to the Lower Savannah Work Center in Aiken. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be in a working capacity. It's not as severe as jail but it's not as 
free as the entertainment world," said Sue Jones, a Community Action Commission 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Although his exact duties in his work-release job have not been determined, 
officials said Brown likely will be required to talk with children and adults 
in the largely rural area and work to increase public awareness of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Brown included failure to stop for police officers in South 
Carolina and Georgia. Authorities said Brown tried to run down officers with 
his pickup truck during a wild car chase along the border between the two 
states in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who won't be eligible for parole until March, 1991, had a series of 
run-ins with his wife and police officers in Georgia and South Carolina in the 
months before the incident that landed him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Sept. 24, 1988, fracas began when Brown burst into a Savannah, 
Ga., office building he owned and began waving a shotgun at people attending an 
insurance seminar. Authorities said Brown apparently was angry that someone had 
used his private bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, known for such hits as "Please, Please, Please," "It's a Man's World," 
"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and his 1987 Grammy winner "Living in America," 
has denied having a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
However, Brown tested positive for the drug PCP after his September 1988 arrest 
and pleaded no contest to possession of the same substance following an earlier 
incident in Aiken County.

"BLOOM WHERE you're planted!" This is the motto of actress Elaine Stritch, who 
is in Los Angeles getting ready to make the two-hour pilot for the TV version 
of "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to enjoy myself no matter what I am doing or where I am 
acting," says Elaine, who is most enthusiastic about this project. As you know, 
the movie version of the off-Broadway play won fans worldwide and earned much 
acclaim for playwright Robert Harling, director Herb Ross and producer Ray 
Stark. Now Stark and Columbia are gearing up to do the TV version for CBS. The 
cast goes to New Orleans next week to work on location and pick up their 
Southern accents. 
</P>
<P>
Stritch is cast in what is now referred to as "the Shirley Mac-Laine role" of 
Ouiser. Polly Bergen is portraying the mayor's widow, Clairee, or "the Olympia 
Dukakis role." Sally Kirkland will essay the beauty shop owner, Truvy, "the 
Dolly Parton role." Sheila McCarthy is cast as the "born-again" beauty 
operator, Annelle, "the Daryl Hannah role." "Laverne and Shirley's" Cindy 
Williams is to portray the mother, M'Lynn, "the Sally Field role." The pilot 
will move right on from after the death of the beloved young Shelby, who was 
played on screen by Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
MONEY TALKS! At 20th Century Fox, they are said to be waxing nostalgic -- and 
pessimistic -- over reports that the new Bruce Willis movie "Die Hard 2" is $20 
million over budget, bringing the current total to $60 million -- and it's not 
finished yet. It reminds some people of the good old, bad old days of 
"Cleopatra," which cost $40 million of those famous 1962 dollars and nearly 
destroyed the studio. 
</P>
<P>
AT PARAMOUNT, they are nervously observing the soaring costs of the Tom Cruise 
movie "Days of Thunder." This racing car epic has also reached the $60-million 
mark. Its freewheeling producers, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, have a 
certain total autonomy that makes the bookkeepers nervous. 
</P>
<P>
The facts are that since Cruise lost the Oscar he was expected to win for "Born 
on the 4th of July," and since the Oliver Stone movie wasn't quite the usual 
Cruise smasheroo, "Days of Thunder" rolling on and on does make some people 
edgy. 
</P>
<P>
SIDNEY ZION, one of New York's last authentic "characters," has turned in a new 
surprising piece of work to publisher Donald I. Fine, and we'll see his novel 
"Markers!" at the end of May. The fiction is being touted as this year's 
"Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Presumed Innocent" -- a tall order indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Zion was a criminal lawyer and federal prosecutor before he went into the 
newspaper business, and I'd hazard a guess that he knows as much about the real 
gritty world as did Roy Cohn, whose semi-autobiography Zion helped write a 
couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Markers!" has a list of tributes from the likes of Frank Sinatra, Erica Jong, 
Nick Pileggi, Victor Navasky and Jeffrey Hart. Publishers Weekly gave it a rave 
and Penthouse excerpts two chapters in its May issue. 
</P>
<P>
THE REWORKED "Annie 2," set to begin rehearsals at the Norma Terris Theater in 
Chester, Conn., on April 23, will NOT have Dorothy Loudon playing the evil Miss 
Hannigan. After "Annie 2" closed down in Washington some months ago, Loudon 
says she was never "invited" to go to Chester. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if Helen Gallagher, a Broadway belter and favorite from the "Pal 
Joey" and "Hazel Flagg" days of big musicals, will play the part of the mean 
orphanage overseer.

Singer Frank Stallone says he considers himself a keeper of a the big beat 
flame in an era of overproduced technopop. 
</P>
<P>
If not performed "the music will die, it's real important to keep it alive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone, brother of actor Sylvester Stallone, said he is drawing from the 
classic works of Count Basie, Tommy Dorsey, Bobby Darren and Frank Sinatra 
during his current engagement at Trump Castle Casino Resort. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided four years ago to move away from rock 'n' roll and B-grade 
movies toward the big band sound and better film roles. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone just landed a part in "Hudson Hawk," starring Bruce Willis and 
Isabella Rosellini. 
</P>
<P>
"After all the hoopla from "Stayin' Alive' everything went sour," Stallone 
said, referring to the "Saturday Night Fever" sequel that inspired little 
fever.

OAKLAND'S MIKE NORRIS GETS AN 'A' FROM FANS FOR COMEBACK EFFORT 
</P>

<P>
Mike Norris was never speechless before, and seven years later he had plenty to 
say about his return to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't say enough about the fans and that ovation," said Norris, who was 
granted a thunderous ovation by the Oakland Coliseum fans Wednesday when he 
pitched two scoreless innings in the Athletics' 3-0 loss to the Minnesota 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, recovering from arm injuries and cocaine addiction that forced him out 
of baseball for three years, made his first major league appearance since Aug. 
6, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The most incredible thing I've ever experienced," Norris said of the welcome. 
"Better than the 22 games, the first year in the majors . . . better than all 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Norris, 35, says his battle against drugs is over and professes to be a devout 
Christian. Now he's fighting emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm battling right now is just an immense amount of adrenalin," he said. 
"I'm just pumped up tremendously. I had to go into the bathroom after the first 
inning and just thank the Lord for giving me this chance." 
</P>
<P>
Norris was 22-9 with a 2.53 ERA for Oakland in 1980 and 12-9 in the 
strike-shortened 1981 season, but went 11-16 over the next two seasons, slowed 
by an assortment of injuries and addictions. He spent the 1984 season disabled, 
tried brief minor-league comebacks in '85 and '86, then left baseball seemingly 
for good until deciding on one more comeback try last season. 
</P>
<P>
Norris was 6-6 with a 3.18 ERA for the A's AAA Tacoma farm in 1989, good enough 
numbers to put him on the A's 40-man roster for 1990. And even though the A's 
must trim the rosters soon, Manager Tony La Russa says Norris will have every 
opportunity to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for pitching is so important, so Norris will be here," La Russa said. 
"He has a lot of composure, plus a lot of different pitches. He'll help us. He 
won't be affected by numbers as long as he plays." 
</P>
<P>
Norris, whose last relief stint was in 1979, says he'll accept a relief role 
with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to be one of the 24 or 25 guys on the best ballclub in baseball means a 
lot to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most teams have only a handful of veterans who remember Norris' style of 
pitching. The Twins were the last major league team Norris faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Gary Gaetti going around the bench and telling guys about my screwball," 
Norris said. "But I still feel like I can get them out, even if they know it's 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hrbek, the other Twin who previously faced Norris, said he didn't remember 
much about him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a guy who believes in second chances like that," Hrbek said, "but it's 
nice to see guys who can come back." 
</P>
<P>
Norris knows that his new opportunity may come under scrutiny, but he's on a 
staff that may be the best in baseball for reviving once-forgotten pitchers. 
The A's signed Dave Stewart and Dennis Eckersley after each was given an 
outright release by his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's forgotten me here," Norris said. "Why keep hurting a guy for what he 
did five, six years ago? The Lord forgives us, so why can't people?"

Mechanical failures and quagmired roads forced seven drivers, including 
front-runner Markku Alen of Finland, out of the Safari Rally today. 
</P>
<P>
Alen led most of the way in his Subaru Legacy until the car's engine blew up 
halfway through the 712-mile first leg. 
</P>
<P>
Three other drivers were time barred, one retired and a third withdrew just 
before the start, leaving 52 cars in the race. Officials gave no reasons for 
the withdrawal or retirement, but said those time barred were hampered by bad 
roads after torrential rains. 
</P>
<P>
Alen's withdrawal put Bjorn Waldegaard of Sweden in the lead in a Toyota Celica 
GT4. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's Massimo Biasion, world and Safari Rally champion driving a Lancia, fell 
from second place to sixth with 51 minutes and 17 seconds in penalty points. 
</P>
<P>
The rally is divided into six sectors and the sectors in turn split into 83 
sections. Drivers are required to cover each section in predetermined time. 
Penalty points are awarded for every minute a driver arrives late. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half the starters are expected to finish the 2,480-mile race through 
plains, mountains and bush country. 
</P>
<P>
The cars leave Nairobi on Friday morning on the second sector north around 
Mount Kenya, the continent's second highest mountain.

DOUBLE TRIPLE IS NOT A SAFE BET BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO PLAY THE ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated bettors at Pimlico in Maryland don't need to be reminded how 
difficult the double triple is. Nobody has hit the wager for 20 racing days, 
and the losers' money has swelled the jackpot carry-over to $628,417. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone trying to pick, for example, the one-two-three finishers in today's 
third and fifth races might consider one pertinent fact. With 12 horses in each 
race, there are 1,742,400 possible outcomes to the double triple. Even if a 
bold syndicate were prepared to invest $50,000, it would be able to cover only 
1% of the combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Given these probabilities, is there any rational way to approach the double 
triple? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
But while most people think of double-triple strategy in terms of formulating 
their wagers, the most important part of this bet is deciding whether to play 
at all. It's like a poker game; sometimes the best decision a player can make 
is to fold his cards immediately, instead of getting into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If a 12-horse field is evenly matched, with no standout and with few horses who 
are obvious throw-outs, playing the double triple becomes unfeasible. (Using 
all the combinations of just six horses in each race costs $43,200. Seven 
horses, $132,300.) 
</P>
<P>
In any form of gambling, chasing money that already has been lost is a 
dangerous practice. Regardless of his previous investments, a handicapper 
should scrutinize each double triple and judge whether it appears to be 
playable. These are the things that can make it playable. 
</P>
<P>
* A key horse. Betting the double triple is most manageable when there is one 
solid horse in one of the races. If a handicapper thinks No. 2 is a standout 
and that Nos. 6, 8 and 9 are the contenders, he can "key" his top choice and 
cover the race with only six combinations (2-6-8, 2-6-9, 2-8-6, 2-8-9, 2-9-6, 
2-9-8). He then can afford to use more combinations in the other part of the 
double triple. Without a key horse, everything gets too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
* A race that can be narrowed to a small number of contenders. Sometimes 
rock-bottom maiden races contain many animals that are so bad that they 
couldn't even get lucky and sneak in to finish third. By the process of 
elimination, only a few horses can be considered contenders -- making the race 
playable even if there is no standout. 
</P>
<P>
* A smaller-than-usual field. The best chance of narrowing a race to a few 
contenders comes in a small field. The size of the double-triple fields is 
sometimes reduced by late scratches, and when that happens, odds governing the 
wager are changed dramatically. Reduce each field from 12 to 11 horses and the 
number of possible winning combinations drops from 1.74 million to 980,000. The 
double triple becomes half as difficult to win. 
</P>
<P>
When a handicapper determines that the double triple is playable, he should 
carefully plot the number of combinations he wants to use in each race. The 
most common strategies are to key one horse over several others, or to box 
several horses (i.e., take all possible combinations involving those horses). 
These are the number of combinations involved in some typical plays: 
</P>
<P>
Key 1 horse over three others: 6 
</P>
<P>
Key 1 horse over four others: 12 
</P>
<P>
Key 1 horse over five others: 20 
</P>
<P>
Key 1 horse over six others: 30 
</P>
<P>
Box 3 horses: 6 
</P>
<P>
Box 4 horses: 24 
</P>
<P>
Box 5 horses: 60 
</P>
<P>
Box 6 horses: 120 
</P>
<P>
To calculate the size of the investment, multiply the number of combinations 
needed in each race, and then multiply by $3, the size of the double-triple 
wager. To key one horse over three others in one race and to box four horses in 
the other races costs $432 (6 x 24 x $3). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the variations on betting configurations are endless. A bettor might 
play marginal contenders to finish third only. He might play combinations using 
his key horse to finish second with all the other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
But the secret of the double triple is to wait for the track to offer a worthy 
opportunity, rather than to pursue a big jackpot just because it's there. When 
the right situation does arise, the prudent player will have his bankroll 
intact and will be ready to bet aggressively. And if some more intrepid gambler 
hits the double triple while he is waiting, the prudent player won't fret. 
There always will be other big jackpots, and it takes only one to change a 
gambler's life.

TYSON'S EX-MANAGER SCORES KNOCKOUT, OF HIMSELF, WITH LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In boxing, some guys just don't know when to quit. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, however, we're not talking about a fighter. This one who refuses 
to hang 'em up is a manager, and a well-heeled one at that. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bill Cayton sent a letter to his wayward heavyweight, Mike Tyson. It 
was not a love letter. As has been well-documented, Cayton and Tyson have been 
estranged for most of the past two years, for various reasons, if you believe 
Tyson. Or, if you believe Cayton, for one reason -- Don King. 
</P>
<P>
Cayton, seeing an opening to perhaps move back into an active role in Tyson's 
career now that he has lost his title to Buster Douglas, fired off the letter, 
dated April 4, 1990, and had copies of it sent "everywhere Mike Tyson could 
possibly be." 
</P>
<P>
Including King's office? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I did not send it to Don King's office," Cayton said. 
</P>
<P>
Before we get into the specifics of the letter, a copy of which was obtained by 
Newsday, it bears repeating that as a manager, Cayton has yet to be proven 
guilty of anything except exceptional -- some would say excessive -- 
competence. When Tyson-King sued Cayton last year to break the managerial 
contract alleging thievery, Cayton produced documents accounting for every 
penny taken in and paid out in every one of Tyson's bouts up to the Spinks 
bout. Tyson and King said, don't let that fool you, we have proof that Cayton 
is a thief. They have yet to produce one scrap of it. 
</P>
<P>
But as a human being, Tyson has said Cayton is lacking something. He is not a 
warm fellow, despite his somewhat awkward attempts to be one. When Tyson was 
beset with personal problems, Bill Cayton was not the man the then-21-year-old 
felt he could turn to for emotional support. King, of course, was only too 
willing to provide same, even if his sincerity was no more genuine than 
Cayton's. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to The Letter. It was intended to patch things up. But it is, 
perhaps, one of the finest examples ever written of "How to Further Alienate 
Someone Who Already Thinks You're a Jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the opening line: "Dear Mike: What does it take to wake you up?" 
</P>
<P>
It is tough to imagine Mike Tyson getting past that. He probably tore the paper 
into confetti at that point and sprinkled it around the room, or the car, or 
the nightclub, or wherever he happened to be. Nothing like being called a 
nitwit right off the bat. 
</P>
<P>
If, somehow, Tyson delved any further into this correspondence, he would have 
read the following: 
</P>
<P>
* That he was back-stabbed by King, who has cost Tyson more than $50 million 
between the loss of the title and subsequent endorsements and TV commercials; 
</P>
<P>
* That King is trying to rush him back into the ring without the proper medical 
examinations, and that his only interest in a Douglas-Tyson rematch is to 
cement a relationship with Douglas; 
</P>
<P>
* That Cayton would prefer Tyson to fight Alex Stewart in June, Renaldo Snipes 
in September and "a particularly appropriate opponent" in November or December, 
before meeting the winner of the proposed September Douglas-Evander Holyfield 
fight in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
All well and good, sound business advice from a consummate businessman. But 
then, in the final two paragraphs, Cayton the cold fish, the snobbish autocrat, 
rears his head again. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as you and I are concerned, I want you to know that I do not want nor 
expect any apology," Cayton writes. "Remember through all your comments about 
me, I never said one bad word about you. I am your manager. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Cayton goes on to say that a reconciliation "would mean that you would have 
Kevin (Rooney), Steve (Lott) and Matt Baransky working with you. The team that 
brought you from your amateur days. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A call was put in to the Catskill, N.Y., house that Tyson grew up in, and to 
which he has returned since the Douglas loss. Remember that Tyson has not 
spoken to Newsday, or any other paper -- with one glaring exception -- on a 
regular basis since King took over. This time was no exception. Tyson's friend 
and corner man, Jay Bright, relayed some quotes he said Tyson had dictated to 
him over a car phone. 
</P>
<P>
The full text of Tyson's reply, according to Bright: "The letter speaks for 
itself. The content and intent is degrading and insulting, as if I would run 
back, tail between legs, because of what happened. Bill has neither the mind 
nor the imagination to deceive me into that slave-master mentality. He's 
pompously dangling what he perceives as bait. Let him direct that pimping 
mentality somewhere else, to someone more gullible who finds it a little less 
offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Cayton, awaiting a personal reply from Tyson, reacted with shock when told of 
Tyson's response to the letter. "Can you believe that?" he said. "This guy has 
been so poisoned by Don King that he reacts that way to a letter in which I was 
very positive? I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
When it was pointed out to Cayton that perhaps the greeting was a tad strong, 
and perhaps he should not have adopted a dictatorial style in his close, Cayton 
seemed surprised. "Do you think it was strong? It might have been, I guess. But 
I can't get to him except by using strong language. I thought I needed a strong 
opening to get his attention. 
</P>
<P>
"There would never have been a Mike Tyson if not for Jim Jacobs and Bill 
Cayton. . . . He would never have been anything without me. We took him out of 
a prison. . . . He has said some terrible things about me, and I have never 
responded. . . . I treated him better than any fighter in the history of 
boxing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What does it take to reach him?" 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Bill, you will never know.

<P>
LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE: THE VOTE IS AN APPARENT MANDATE FOR THE CITY TO PROCEED 
WITH CONTROVERSIAL SPORT CHALET PROJECT.

<P>
La Canada Flintridge voters have elected three City Council candidates who 
supported the proposed Sport Chalet shopping center, giving an apparent mandate 
for the city to go ahead with the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
In a field of seven candidates, former Councilman Jack Hastings led the pack in 
Tuesday's election with 3,728 votes. Closely following him was Public Safety 
Commissioner Jim Edwards with 3,666 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilwoman Joan Feehan was reelected with 3,543 votes. This will be 
her second four-year term on the City Council, where she served as mayor in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilman O. Warren Hillgren and Mayor Edmund Krause did not run. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,712 ballots were cast, representing 49.9% of the city's registered 
voters. The new council members will be sworn in April 17 for four-year terms 
on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of yesterday's election is a sign that we shall all move together 
for consensus in the community," said Feehan. "Let us all put the election 
behind us and work together to ensure we remain the fine city that we are." 
</P>
<P>
The three victors in the election had been labeled pro-growth candidates due to 
their strong support of a proposed Sport Chalet shopping center development. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings was appointed to the council and served as mayor pro tem in 1985. He 
was defeated in his 1988 reelection bid. Edwards has an extensive record of 
community involvement, including 16 years as a volunteer member of the Montrose 
Search and Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
They and Feehan were endorsed by a local Republican group in a tabloid mailer 
written and funded by representatives of the Sport Chalet store. 
</P>
<P>
The Sport Chalet also paid for several last-minute campaign flyers that 
attacked three other candidates, Trails Council President Liz Blackwelder, 
Planning Commissioner Judy Breitman and architect Peter Kudrave, claiming that 
they opposed the shopping center. Breitman, Kudrave and Blackwelder emerged in 
the campaign as a slate of candidates publicly opposed to the size of the 
proposed Sport Chalet retail complex. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in the other faction, Feehan, Edwards and Hastings, went on record 
supporting the plans for the shopping center in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates included Melvin Ricks, who ran his campaign on a promise of 
streamlining city government and improving communication among municipal 
departments, and Barbara Parady. Although she dropped out of the race early in 
the campaign, her name appeared on the ballot, and she received 223 votes. One 
flyer bearing a return address of the Sport Chalet accused Blackwelder and her 
real estate firm of "fraud and deceit and breach of contract" in a 1979 home 
sale that resulted in a lawsuit. The flyer read, in part: "We just don't need 
any more people in government who play fast and loose with the law . . . do 
we?" 
</P>
<P>
According to Blackwelder, her real estate firm sold a house described as having 
a new roof, and the buyers sued her, saying she misrepresented the house's roof 
as new. On her lawyer's advice, Blackwelder and the former homeowner each paid 
$2,500 to settle the suit out of court. She said it was the only legal dispute 
during a career of 40 years in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Another flyer suggested Kudrave has allowed unsafe and unsanitary living 
conditions in rental property in which, it alleges, he has a financial 
interest. Under photographs showing the unkempt interior of a dwelling, the 
mailer asserted that tenants living in property over which Kudrave is executor 
may be in violation of city health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer said seven people "are crammed into one of his rental units forcing 
some to sleep on a mattress laying on the living room floor. Even tenant pleas 
for help on simple things like leaking faucets go unanswered." 
</P>
<P>
"Without using the word, they did everything to lead the reader up to think I 
am a slumlord," said Kudrave, who denied the Sport Chalet's allegations. He 
said he does not own the property, which was willed to his sister after his 
mother died last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave said he is the non-paid executor for the trust and receives no money 
from managing the property. He said he is in the process of helping his sister 
sell the rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Sport Chalet's Executive Vice President of Marketing Bob Haueter defended the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"The question we raised was the condition of those units," said Haueter. "The 
unsafe condition of those units . . . points to the issue of Mr. Kudrave's 
responsibility as a landlord." 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave countered: "Clearly I am not the landlord; I do not own the property. 
Yes, I have a responsibility. But to imply that it is mine in the traditional 
sense is a lie." 
</P>
<P>
Breitman was the target of a third flyer that attacked her solely because of 
her association with Blackwelder and Kudrave. 
</P>
<P>
Breitman has criticized Haueter, who last year was a senior assistant in state 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan's Glendale office. She said Haueter is not a marketing 
executive, but a paid political adviser hired by the local sporting goods store 
to elect a council favorable to their proposed retail development. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a professional political hit man," Breitman said, "and they call him a 
marketing director. These guys know how to play dirty politics." 
</P>
<P>
Haueter denied he was hired by the Sport Chalet to influence the campaign. He 
said a City Council vote on the proposed project was expected long before the 
election, and that his employment interview did not mention the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Haueter said the flyers were fair because the three candidates named in them 
raised the very issues that the flyers examined. He said Breitman, Kudrave and 
Blackwelder were deceiving voters by publishing statements in support of the 
proposed Sport Chalet project when they, in fact, opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran a campaign where they were attempting to get elected by the people 
who opposed the project and the people who supported it too," said Haueter. 
"Our assumption going into this election was if Blackwelder, Breitman and 
Kudrave were elected, there was no way they would vote for this project." 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave said he is afraid the Sport Chalet's tactics may keep some people from 
running for elected office in La Canada Flintridge in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although critical of the last-minute mailings, Feehan said the Sport Chalet 
flyers did not do any real damage. As evidence, she cited the absentee ballots, 
many of which were cast before the controversial mailers were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
"The absentee ballots were overwhelmingly for Edwards, Hastings and myself," 
said Feehan. "That gives validation to the whole election." 
</P>
<P>
According to City Clerk Pat Anderson, 1,038 of the absentee ballots were 
returned before the Sport Chalet mailed its flyers. Anderson said the margin of 
support for Feehan, Edwards and Hastings among the absentee votes was far 
greater than the distribution in the other ballots. A total of 1,367 absentee 
ballots were received. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwelder, although disappointed by the Sport Chalet's critical mailers, said 
she enjoyed the race and is ready to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an illuminating experience," said Blackwelder, "and I loved meeting so 
many wonderful people who could see beyond the smoke screen, and all the hue 
and cry, and who dearly love this community as much as I do. Maybe things will 
settle down now, and the community can go about solving problems." 
</P>
<P>
A vote on the Sport Chalet's proposed expansion will be one of the first items 
on the agenda when the new council meets May 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to set the dates on the hearings for the Sport Chalet appeal," said 
Edwards. "I would think that, given the amount of hearings, it will probably 
take us May and June before we hear all the testimony. We have to go over all 
the conditions and over the primary project itself." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new council will face a number of personnel issues, including 
the selection of a new city manager and the appointment of several city 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I would like to see us set some long-term goals for where we want 
the city to go now," said Feehan. "I am excited about having a new team of 
people to work with."

FAA RULE THREATENS SAFETY ABOVE LAX, PILOTS' GROUP CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The busy airspace over seven U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International 
Airport, has been declared "critically deficient" in safety by an airline 
pilots' group because of an FAA rule that gives air traffic controllers more 
latitude in determining how far apart to keep planes. 
</P>
<P>
The seven locations -- areas of rigidly controlled airspace called Terminal 
Control Areas -- were placed on a "Black Star' list by the 70-member 
International Federation of Air Lines Pilots Assns., meeting this week in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The change was instituted at the seven locations in 1988 as part of a two-year 
test program. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous FAA rules, planes were required to be at least three miles 
apart. Under the change, which the pilots' group says was quietly instituted by 
the FAA, the controller "can now let aircraft get as close as he wants, as long 
as in his judgment they will not collide," according to Capt. Henry Duffy, 
president of the U.S. Air Line Pilots Assn., which is associated with the 
international group. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles spokesman for the federal agency Wednesday defended the FAA's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a compromise of air safety," FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said. 
"This was done with full cognizance of the airlines in 1988. It's a test 
program. The objective is to reduce the near-midair-collisions possibility, 
increase service to the pilots and to handle more air traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said in a prepared statement that the newly adopted Black Star 
designations were aimed at the controlled airspace at the seven locations -- 
not the airports beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Black Star rating does not mean that these Terminal Control Areas are 
'unsafe,' " he said. "It simply means that they now have a safety deficiency 
that warrants notification of airline pilots worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Though the FAA instituted the change two years ago, the pilots' association did 
not discover the "positive separation" rule change at LAX and the six other 
sites until late last year, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Los Angeles, the Terminal Control Areas added to the "Black Star" list 
include Charlotte, N.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, 
Philadelphia and Phoenix..

A FORMER NUN'S CHANGE OF HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barbara Dugan graduated from law school, she didn't start her own practice 
or get a job in a law firm. Instead, after working for awhile in a police 
department, she entered a convent at the age of 39. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was coming to the close of law school, I began thinking of it, or it 
began pressing itself into my mind," said Dugan, who was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan was introduced to her order, Religious Sisters of Charity, by an ex-nun 
who taught catechism classes with her at St. Bonaventure Church in Huntington 
Beach. Dugan was impressed that someone who had left a community would still 
think so highly of it. 
</P>
<P>
She later followed that woman's path, becoming one of the many sisters to leave 
religious life. Now, seven years later, Dugan, 54, lives by herself and has a 
private law practice in a Huntington Beach high-rise where she specializes in 
personal injury, family and probate law. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of adjusting for me was gearing myself to a more contemplative 
form of life," Dugan said. "It took quite awhile to accept the fact that I was 
going to live my life in a different way, that my life wasn't going to be 
measured by the money I earned." 
</P>
<P>
While a nun, Dugan worked in parishes, jails and nursing homes in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. She also worked for the Christian Service Agency, training 
people to do parish work and later started the Community Law Center in Santa 
Ana, a legal service for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dugan gradually adjusted to religious life, she began to question 
whether it was time to move on after she moved out of St. Hedwig's Convent in 
Los Alamitos to care for her ailing father in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There are as many reasons why people have left as there are people who have 
left," Dugan said. "But in some situations, and mine was one of them, we wanted 
things to change in the church to allow for more independent decision making. I 
would guess that was one of the paramount reasons people left." 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said her order was very supportive of her decision, and she still sees 
some of the sisters on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my dearest friends are in that order. I have deep regard for them and 
love for them," she said. "The people I know are so dedicated to what they do. 
What they do is an invaluable gift and it can't be purchased at any price, and 
no amount of salary could compensate them for what they do." 
</P>
<P>
Once she left the convent, she had to readjust to a new life again. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was not living there, I missed it," she said. "I missed the presence of 
the others. And I really knew what they meant by the support of the community." 
</P>

JOSEPH N. BELL: MEASURE N SEEMED TO SEEK OUT FRED PLUMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you look closely at the sidewalk in front of Reuben's restaurant across from 
the new airport terminal, you will see -- faintly engraved in the concrete -- 
"Fred, '71." The scratching was made in another life by a man very much in the 
public eye in the city of Irvine over the past year: Pastor Fred Plumer of 
Irvine's United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Inscribing his name in front of a favorite Newport Beach watering hole is 
history of which Fred Plumer is neither proud nor ashamed. He left his mark in 
many other places and ways -- not always warmly recalled -- in Orange County 
two decades ago, that might as well be two millenniums when weighed against the 
distance he has come since then. These are facts of his life, and he dealt with 
them matter of factly when we met for lunch at Reuben's last week. 
</P>
<P>
Although we had postulated identical positions during the recent bloodletting 
in Irvine over Measure N -- which denies homosexuals the protection of Irvine's 
Human Rights Ordinance -- I had never met Plumer until the Sunday before our 
lunch when I visited his church to listen to a wonderfully rational talk by 
Prof. James Nelson of the United Theological Seminary of Minneapolis. Nelson -- 
who has written several books on the subject and whose scholarship has been 
widely praised -- spoke on Christian ethics and sexuality with warmth, lucidity 
and authority. He gave his lecture without a fee because word of the yeoman 
service of Fred Plumer and his congregation in the Measure N fight had filtered 
all the way back to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Some local citizens who knew Fred Plumer in his early Orange County years are 
probably still rubbing their eyes at his reincarnation. Until 10 years ago, 
very little of his history would have predicted such a turn. 
</P>
<P>
As he told it to me over lunch, Plumer grew up in a middle-class family in West 
Covina and married his high school sweetheart while he was in college at UC 
Riverside. Since he had one child and another on the way when he graduated, he 
started a janitorial-service company in Newport Beach to produce enough money 
to support his family and to put him through graduate school in political 
science, which he wanted to teach at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, the janitorial company was prospering sufficiently for Plumer 
to apply to graduate school at UC Irvine -- and he says the whole course of his 
life changed when he was turned down in spite of impressive credentials from UC 
Riverside. He went back to his company, built it up to 250 employees, and 
became a man about town, leaving his imprint on more than the sidewalk in front 
of Reuben's. He prospered financially, but his marriage broke up after five 
years (and two daughters, both of whom have grown up to become world-class 
runners). 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed life," he told me, "but I didn't understand then that what 
I was doing was very destructive, a kind of running away." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, he sold his company and became a partner in a 
commercial-development venture that went broke in the economic recession of 
1973. Plumer married his secretary (his present wife, Charron), moved to 
Colorado and started over literally in a log cabin. There, he became a 
successful restaurateur and began to repeat the same cycle. "Slick Fred," he 
recalls wistfully, "was about to lose once again some things that were very 
important to him. But this time, I knew how much it was going to cost." 
</P>
<P>
So he turned to the local United Church of Christ pastor for help -- and found 
it, "although I hadn't been to church for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
There was no lightning revelation, no transcendent vision, "just a full 
acceptance of the responsibility for my actions that brought an incredible 
release I'm still trying to figure out. But I knew it was from a power beyond 
me." 
</P>
<P>
His wife realized that the change was real and profound, and she prodded him to 
pursue the goal he had always wanted: graduate school. But this time, he chose 
theology rather than political science. He enrolled in the Pacific School of 
Religion in Berkeley and got a janitorial job on the side, and Charron found 
secretarial work. Both of them got involved with the local United Church of 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
When Fred graduated, he badly wanted to work in an inner-city church, and he 
applied to several. When none of them came through quickly, he was approached 
by a small and struggling church in Irvine. He visited with enormous misgivings 
-- "it was an area that seemed to epitomize everything we wanted to avoid" -- 
but he found a group of "wonderfully creative, hungry people," and he stayed. 
</P>
<P>
That was six years ago, when the church consisted of 30 people meeting at a 
local school. Today, it is a vital group of 200 meeting in a new church 
structure that members built themselves -- under the direction of a newly 
minted general contractor named Fred Plumer. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer didn't seek out a leadership role in the Measure N struggle. He says he 
first got involved when the Human Rights Ordinance was being drafted and a City 
Council member called to find out his position on it, then asked if he would 
round up support from other pastors to counter the aggressive opposition of the 
fundamentalist churches. He called "lots of pastors who either didn't agree 
with the ordinance or said they didn't want to touch it because it was too 
controversial. I felt pretty lonely." 
</P>
<P>
But he also decided to take a strong public position after "a whole lot of 
fundamentalists showed up at a City Council meeting to oppose the ordinance. 
There was a form of energy in that room that blew me away because it was so 
full of hate. It was my first experience with this sort of thing, and I found 
my voice shaking when I spoke out. It didn't make me mad. It made my cry 
because the man whose teachings we all professed to believe and who taught us 
to love was being so badly distorted." 
</P>
<P>
He thought the controversy was over after the ordinance was passed, but it 
heated up even more when Measure N was put on the ballot. "I didn't really want 
to get drawn into it again, but when I went to the gay pride festival and heard 
and felt the hatred of the protesters -- all in the name of Jesus -- I knew my 
moment of truth had come. I went to my board and announced from my pulpit that 
I was being pulled into this and I no longer had a choice. If it's a problem, 
come and talk to me. Only two couples did -- with thoughtful questions that we 
dealt with. But I kept asking myself if this was good for the growth of my 
little church -- or for me. The church doesn't look kindly on 49-year-old 
unemployed pastors." 
</P>
<P>
He has his answers now. The church grew by almost 50%, along with the 
resolution of the congregation. "The people in my church," Plumer says, "became 
more lively and confident and clear that we had a role to play in the community 
and that role was connected to what I had been saying theologically." 
</P>
<P>
It continued to be a lonely path. Among his pastoral associates, he says that 
only Susan Klein from the Irvine Episcopal Church got into the trenches with 
him. There were threatening letters and threatening phone calls and personal 
attacks in the press. (A Register editorial called him "one of those handsome 
'progressive' clergymen who can speak of unconditional love and send the church 
ladies into swoons"). But there was also a standing ovation for Plumer from the 
audience at a City Council meeting when he expressed disappointment at the 
passage of Measure N and spoke about "the hope of getting this community back 
into balance." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who supported Measure N," Plumer told me, "fall into one of 
three groups. First, there are a significant number of people who are confused 
about the issues and believe the lies and horror stories served up by Measure N 
proponents. Second, there are politically conservative people who don't care 
about the basic issues but just don't want to be told what they can or cannot 
do by any level of government. And, finally, there are the fundamentalists who 
are either afraid of their own sexuality or are caring, conservative religious 
people who have been brought up to believe that the Bible supports 
discrimination against homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
From a dozen or so conversations with members of Plumer's congregation after 
the Nelson lecture, I know that if an effort is made to restore the original 
Human Rights Ordinance in Irvine, they will go into the fray united, committed 
and battle-hardened. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly," Plumer says, "about standing in solidarity among these 
people as Jesus demonstrated over and over. When that happens, people move past 
themselves and find God in a very positive way."

EAST GERMANY'S MASUR TO TAKE OVER N.Y. PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

East German conductor Kurt Masur was named to a five-year term as music 
director of the New York Philharmonic, effective with the 1992-1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
Masur, music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, replaces Zubin 
Mehta, whose last season with the Philharmonic is 1990-91. When he assumes his 
post, Masur will conduct a minimum of 14 subscription weeks with four weeks of 
other work. As a member of New Forum, the East German pro-democracy movement, 
he was hailed as a hero in his country for averting bloodshed during last 
year's anti-communist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-91 season, Masur will conduct two subscription weeks, and will 
provide an overview of artistic matters, which will include guiding the 
planning of the 1991-92 season and orchestra auditions. 
</P>
<P>
Stephan Stamas, chairman of the N.Y. Philharmonic, said that Masur will remain 
with the Gewandhaus Orchestra through the 1993-94 season, its 200th anniversary 
season. After that, Masur will maintain some association with the Leipzig 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Stamas said that it will be a difficult transition, "but we are confident" that 
whatever relationship evolves "his focus and interest will be on his life with 
the Philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
Masur, who was in Paris rehearsing with the Orchestre National de France for 
Bach's "St. Matthew" Passion, issued a statement: "I believe very strongly that 
after all we have talked about regarding the future of the N.Y. Philharmonic 
that we will succeed together in building up a close relationship between the 
audience, the orchestra members and the leadership of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been very attracted by the musical life and the audiences of New 
York City. I promise everyone that I will work as honestly as I have with my 
Gewandhaus Orchestra for the past 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, N.Y. Philharmonic conductor laureate, said in a statement: 
"I couldn't be happier. I have nothing but esteem and affection for maestro 
Masur as a musician and as a human being. I congratulate all sides." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Mehta said he welcomes the appointment. "I've admired his work 
as a guest conductor for many years and he has created a wonderful, world-class 
orchestra in the Gewandhaus." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta took over the directorship of the N.Y. Philharmonic in 1978, after 
leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Bombay-born conductor has declined to announce his future plans, other than 
to say, as he did in November, 1988, that, "having held the position of music 
director with various North American organizations since 1961, I must at this 
juncture pursue other artistic endeavors which have to do with less 
administrative activity than that with which a music director is usually 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Masur was one of the earliest figures in East Germany to speak out against the 
government. He was hailed as a hero for averting bloodshed during last year's 
anti-Communist revolution in East Germany, but he said recently that he wanted 
to keep his distance from politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a professional politician and have no wish to get involved in petty 
party politics," he said last month at a news conference in Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
Though he ruled out full-time politics, Masur stressed he would continue to 
speak out if he felt it necessary -- and he did so, lambasting West German 
politicians for interfering in the recent East German elections. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1991, Masur is scheduled to bring his Gewandhaus Orchestra to the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and to San Diego during a U.S. tour. No repertory has 
been announced.
