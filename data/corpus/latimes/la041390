S.D. COUNTY WATER AGENCY SEEKS MANDATORY CUTBACKS 
</P>

<P>
In an unprecedented effort to tighten the taps while facing a drought that has 
parched the state, the San Diego County Water Authority voted unanimously 
Thursday to ask its 24 member agencies to enact mandatory water-reduction 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
The water authority directors recommended cutbacks that prohibit residents from 
washing cars, watering lawns or filling swimming pools during the daytime; 
restaurants from serving water to customers except when requested, and 
homeowners from hosing down sidewalks, driveways or tennis courts at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also suggested that all ornamental fountains be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
The action is a recommendation to the 24 individual governments and water 
boards in the county, which now must independently decide whether to follow 
through with the restrictions that officials hope will bring about a 10% 
savings in water. 
</P>
<P>
Water authority officials said they believe that most of its members will adopt 
the water-saving measures. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt any will go against them," said Byron M. Buck, director of the 
agency's water resources planning division. "This shouldn't have any lifestyle 
impact; we're just asking people to cut wasteful use." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is not alone in its efforts to conserve. About 50 of California's 58 
counties have issued some kind of water restrictions, said Dean Thompson, a 
spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources' Drought Center in 
Sacramento. They include rationing, moratoriums on new water connections, 
mandatory curbs and requests for voluntary conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Of the counties that have issued restrictions, about half asked residents to 
voluntarily join the battle to curb water use; the others made the restrictions 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego water authority members opted for mandatory restrictions Thursday 
after a 1987 program calling for voluntary water-saving efforts achieved only a 
4% savings. 
</P>
<P>
To help enact the new Drought Management Action Plan, the water authority board 
created a $185,000 fund to encourage widespread use of conservation techniques, 
such as low-pressure shower heads and devices to reduce the amount of water 
used by toilets. The board plans to launch an intensive two-month campaign -- 
beginning in May -- to inform residents, and to hire two more employees to help 
investigate reports of water waste. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed water curbs were developed after agency staff members consulted 
business people, such as car wash operators and landscapers, who feared the 
restrictions would hurt them financially, said Bill Jacoby, a water resource 
specialist with the water authority. The restrictions will mostly affect 
homeowners, he said, who use more than 60% of the agency's water. "None of 
these are meant to make anyone lose a job or to sacrifice landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each member agency, should it choose to endorse the recommendation, will be 
responsible for enforcing the restrictions. The city of San Diego already 
employs eight water code compliance officers, who can issue warnings to those 
in violation, Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
If the restrictions were made a law, an errant resident could be charged with a 
misdemeanor and fined up to $1,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Ramona, the Municipal Water District imposed mandatory water-saving 
restrictions last May because of problems with an aging distribution system. 
Officials there have said that most residents abide by the rules and that only 
a few have been hit with fines. 
</P>
<P>
Under the water authority's Water Alert Plan, the 24 member agencies will be 
asked to adopt these mandatory regulations: 
</P>
<P>
* Lawn watering, landscape irrigation, filling of swimming pools and car 
washing will be permitted on designated days from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Watering or 
washing by a hand-held hose, equipped with a shut-off valve, will be permitted 
any time. The designated days mean that property with even-numbered addresses 
can use water on even-numbered days; those with odd-numbered addresses use 
water on odd-numbered dates. 
</P>
<P>
* Farmers and commercial nursery operators will be exempt from restrictions but 
will be asked to reduce all non-essential water use. 
</P>
<P>
* The use of water from fire hydrants will be limited to firefighting and 
activities related to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
* Water will not be used to wash sidewalks, driveways, tennis courts or patios, 
unless it alleviates a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
* Ornamental fountains will be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
The board's approval of the restrictions paves the way for the 24 member 
agencies to decide whether to adopt them. The San Diego City Council is 
expected to consider the proposal April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said the mayor 
generally favors voluntary conservation measures but has not reviewed the 
specifics of the water authority's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"It has surprisingly not been a major issue in terms of letters and phone 
calls" to the mayor's office, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty said she would be against imposition of a mandatory 
lawn-watering schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a problem with whether or not this (staggered schedule) is going 
to gain the support of the public," McCarty said. "If they don't believe there 
is a problem, they're not going to support something mandatory, and we're just 
wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
Before the San Diego panel voted, officials with the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, which supplies water to Los Angeles and 
Southern California, urged the San Diego County Water Authority to adopt the 
tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a secure water supply," said Carl Boronkay, the MWD's general 
manager. "What is needed is a comprehensive statewide policy." 
</P>
<P>
The MWD supplies water from Oxnard to the Mexican border. Among the 130 cities 
in its region, only about 10 have adopted ordinances similar to that proposed 
here, said Jay Malinowski, an MWD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping all cities will respond in a fashion similar to San Diego," 
Malinowski said. "Virtually every city south of Sacramento should be adopting 
such ordinances if they haven't already." 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions supported by San Diego's water authority resemble an ordinance 
passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council.

Mayoral proclamations are usually harmless gestures that generate a bit of 
publicity for a business or cause, not to mention the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mayor Bradley -- and the City Council -- declared a Miss Universe Day 
in honor of this weekend's beauty pageant in Century City, the action drew a 
thumbs-down response from feminists. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely distressing that society condones this and that the mayor of 
the country's second-largest city can't see anything wrong with it," said Tammy 
Bruce of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
No mayoral resolution had attracted such flak since Water Bed Weekend '83, 
which prompted the American Innerspring Manufacturers to fly an angry spokesman 
to L.A. to assert that "a water bed is one of the worst things . . . for a 
person with a bad back." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark, one of the Miss Universe hosts, expressed confidence that the 
hubbub would die down because beauty contest protests are no longer 
"fashionable," as he put it. Actually, dozens of protesters staged a Myth 
California demonstration last year at the Miss California competition in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Clark defended the principals in the current controversy thusly: 
"They are not air heads." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the contestants, we presume, not to the mayor and the 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
With those jowls and his constant drooling, Sidney would never win any beauty 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
You may have seen him on the most recent end-of-the-year special by KNBC 
sportscaster Fred Roggin. He was the bulldog that had a vicious habit of 
hijacking skateboards after pushing the riders aside. He's such a skilled rider 
that he's also made a skateboard video. 
</P>
<P>
"He just loves riding -- he doesn't even want to be rewarded with any treats or 
anything," said his publicist, Barbara Jo Peterson. "He's like a kid. The only 
way you can get him to stop is to take away his skateboard." 
</P>
<P>
Publicist? Sure. Sidney, who is currently mulling over two feature film offers, 
also has an agent, a trainer and a business manager. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of this week's Malathion Poetry Contest is Betty Darling of Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
She requests that we bow our heads so that she may intone, "Let us spray." 
</P>
<P>
All together now: 
</P>
<P>
Cover your car, 
</P>
<P>
 Hide your pet, 
</P>
<P>
 Close the windows, 
</P>
<P>
 Wash your swing set. 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion kills Medflies 
</P>
<P>
 And ladybugs too, 
</P>
<P>
 But remember this: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will never hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, another type of drive-through: 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police nabbed an alleged bank robber who, at one point during a 
high-speed chase, detoured into a McDonald's hamburger stand Thursday. The 
suspect fled out another exit without stopping at the speaker's box. Good thing 
it wasn't a Winchell's, or the cops might have lost the scent.

NATURE CENTER DIRECTOR INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND THE CITY OF CHULA VISTA ARE 
PROBING ALLEGATIONS THAT HE SHOT ANIMALS THERE WITH A PELLET GUN.

<P>
The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the city of Chula Vista are 
investigating allegations that a nature center's director shot and killed 
several animals on the center's grounds and in the surrounding wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints, filed last Friday by two former employees of the Chula Vista 
Nature Interpretive Center, charge Steve Neudecker with using a high-powered 
pellet rifle to shoot and kill birds, squirrels and rabbits at the center, 
Assistant City Manager Gene Asmus said. 
</P>
<P>
Asmus also confirmed that the complaints charge Neudecker with shooting the 
animals from his office window on at least one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any validity to the allegations made, they are very serious," 
Asmus said. "But we only have the statements from the two former employees 
saying that they saw it. We don't have anything beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
Asmus would not release the complaint or the names of the former employees. 
</P>
<P>
Neudecker, who was out of the country and unavailable for comment, is director 
of the Bayfront Conservancy Trust, the city agency that operates the nature 
center on Gunpowder Point. He has run the center since its inception in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It boggles the mind a little bit that even allegations like this would be made 
against a man of his caliber," said Asmus, who described Neudecker as a "very 
environmentally sensitive individual." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-acre center is part of the 316-acre wildlife refuge, which falls under 
federal jurisdiction. The environmentally sensitive marshland is home to the 
California least tern and the clapper rail, birds on both the state and federal 
endangered species lists. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista and the Fish and Wildlife Service are conducting separate 
investigations into the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators would not comment on the progress of their probe, which 
began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asmus said the city was informed of the allegations several weeks ago, but a 
formal complaint was not lodged until one of the former employees resigned last 
Friday. The other employee, who resigned in November, also stepped forward last 
Friday to issue a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking to as many people as we can who could or might have any 
information regarding these allegations," Asmus said of the investigation. "If 
these allegations are true, it shows a severe lack of judgment on Steve's 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Asmus said investigators have yet to talk with Neudecker about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service prohibits hunting or shooting on the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The nature center is managed and funded by the city, and all employees there 
are responsible directly to Asmus.

HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We hereby express our appreciation of a most humane article "The Forgotten 
Hostages: Lebanese" (Part A, April 2). The perceptive writer, Marilyn Raschka, 
has dealt with a thorny subject that is much ignored by the international as 
well as Lebanese media. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the general anarchy, thousands of innocent Lebanese citizens have 
been abducted not only because of their religion, but also because of their 
courage to speak their minds, their peacemaking efforts or their prominence in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
One of the forgotten hostages is our father, Sarkis Zeitlian, a Lebanese 
editor-in-chief of Armenian origin who was kidnaped on his way to work on March 
28, 1985, at a time when many Lebanese and foreign journalists and media 
persons disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In our ordeal we are comforted to know that there are still people who care to 
remember the forgotten hostages and the anguish of their families.

MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1950, American farmers have produced enough food so that the United 
States can export about a third of each year's production. That year marked the 
beginning of widespread availability of synthetic pest control products. 
</P>
<P>
It took 130 years, starting in 1820, to raise the number of people fed per 
American farmer from 4.1 to 15.5. Only 38 years later, that number had risen to 
114, according to 1987 statistics from the Agriculture Council of America. Ag 
chemicals have contributed to this increase in productivity by providing every 
farmer protection against loss due to weeds, insects or disease. 
</P>
<P>
Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug estimates that, without modern pest control 
technology, crop losses worldwide would escalate to about 50% of current 
production. For Americans, the result of more efficient crop production has 
been the availability of a high-quality diet at an ever-lower cost. It's 
estimated an average family of four spends the 1989 equivalent of $50 per week 
less on food than in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are not the only ones who stand to benefit from our vast production 
potential. Every day the world has 200,000 more mouths to feed and by the year 
2000 the world's population will exceed 6 billion people. Although hunger is 
endemic in less fortunate parts of the world, only modern crop management has 
enabled us to make any headway against this pressing human problem. 
</P>
<P>
What would happen if the United States and other countries could not produce 
food for overseas export? Not only would more people go hungry, but the 
environmental impact could be devastating.

THE BISHOPS' CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the page opposite this one, lay theologian and conservative commentator 
Michael Novak argues with his customary force that criticism of the Catholic 
bishops' recent intervention in the abortion question is hypocritical and 
unfair. One would have to be mean-spirited and bigoted indeed not to concur in 
Novak's belief that the bishops have a role to play in bringing about that 
"happy day" when "America's public square will no longer echo emptily but will 
be alive with serious moral argument, as a free country ought to be." But that 
is precisely why the bishops' recent decision to hire a powerful 
public-relations firm and a politically well-connected pollster to press their 
opposition to abortion under any circumstances is troubling. 
</P>
<P>
Public relations and polling are not instruments of ethical persuasion or moral 
argument. They are tools of electoral politics. When the bishops choose to take 
them up, it is fair to ask precisely what they intend. In a nation of 
believers, such as ours, no one wants or expects our lawmakers to check their 
moral convictions at the door to the legislative chamber. But in a pluralistic 
country whose well-tested charter of liberty prescribes the absolute separation 
of church and state, we also expect that those convictions are dictated by the 
individual's conscience and not from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are many things that Americans of all creeds esteem as essential 
to a decent life without even realizing they are the product of Catholicism's 
rich and sophisticated system of moral reasoning. Among them are the notion of 
a living wage, the idea that true individual fulfillment is found in the 
fulfillment of our responsibilities to others, the concept that all social 
classes have a mutual duty to ensure each other's rights and well-being, and 
the insistence that higher authorities ought not to preempt those decisions 
that smaller social units, particularly the family, can make for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a sad -- perhaps tragic -- day, if the custodians of such a 
fruitful tradition transformed themselves into just another political lobby.

Sarah Vaughan is prematurely dead of cigarette smoking, hard on the heels of 
Lucille Ball and Ava Gardner. My sadness at the Divine One's passing is tinged 
with anger that a singer blessed with such a magnificent voice could destroy it 
-- and herself -- with nicotine addiction.

ARAB ATTEMPTS TO STOP THE IMMIGRATION OF SOVIET JEWS IS A NEW TWIST IN A LONG 
CAMPAIGN TO ELIMINATE THE JEWISH STATE.

A domestic political crisis has erupted in Israel, the only state in which the 
rise and fall of governments is determined not by social, economic or 
environmental issues, but by the agonizing dilemma of how to expedite the 
pursuit of peace. 
</P>
<P>
As Israel grapples with this crisis, the course of Jewish history is being 
affected by watershed developments in the Soviet Union. The mass immigration of 
Soviet Jews to Israel marks the successful culmination of a long and strenuous 
international effort. This momentous development is of particular importance 
today, as the darker side of democratization generates a resurgence of 
anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an ugly campaign is being waged by Arab states with the aim 
of halting immigration of Jews to Israel altogether. Threats of terrorism and 
coercive diplomacy are being employed on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
After thousands of years of repression and persecution culminating in the 
slaughter of 6 million Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, the state of Israel was 
reborn. There, the Jews of the world were finally guaranteed a permanent safe 
haven to which they could immigrate. Never again would they remain helpless in 
the face of mortal danger as gates of freedom were shut to them. The gates of 
Israel will forever be open. This is the very essence, the raison d'etre, of 
Israel. Indeed, Israel has absorbed wave after wave of destitute refugees, 
including the survivors of the concentration and death camps in Europe and 
800,000 refugees from Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
The concerted Arab effort to stop Jewish immigration dates back to the 
beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is part of a systematic campaign 
against the essence of Israel as the home of the Jewish people, against the 
right of Jews to a state of their own, and against peace and accommodation with 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s and '40s, Jewish refugees fled anti-Semitic persecution in Europe 
for British-governed Palestine, only to be met by belligerent Arab opposition. 
Acquiescing to unceasing pressure by the Arab leadership, Britain responded 
with the notorious "White Paper" of 1939, which restricted Jewish immigration 
even as the danger facing the Jews of Europe was urgently apparent. The moral 
implications were disregarded then as they are disregarded today. 
</P>
<P>
Absolutist hostility to Jewish presence led Arab states to oppose the emergence 
of a Jewish state in their midst, an attitude that remains paramount today. 
Moammar Kadafi calls for all-out war on Israel with bloodcurdling imagery: 
"Palestine is another oven, a collective oven for all the Jews. I advise the 
Jews to leave the oven before it gets hot for them." Yasser Arafat concurs: 
"The Jews in occupied Palestine should return to their countries of origin." 
Hafez Assad calls for eternal Jihad, a holy war against Israel, "until the end 
of time." Assad, Arafat and Kadafi declare that Jews have no right to a 
sovereign state -- and that, in any case, they are not even Jews but 
descendants of the Khazars, a Turkic tribe converted to Judaism in the 8th 
Century. Kadafi calls, therefore, for the deportation of Israel's population to 
Estonia and Lithuania (where the Khazars migrated) as the way to achieve "just 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
As verbal incitement often leads to bloodshed, such statements cannot be 
ignored. Two months ago, nine Israeli tourists were killed when their 
sightseeing bus was attacked in Egypt. The motive, according to the Islamic 
Jihad: to remind Soviet Jews that Israel is not the land of milk and honey, but 
the land of death. 
</P>
<P>
Arab states and the Palestine Liberation Organization have now conjured up a 
major diplomatic storm in a worldwide effort to block the flow of Jewish 
immigrants from the Soviet Union. Pretexts aside, it is the potential 
strengthening of Israel by immigration that arouses their vehement opposition. 
As the Saudi newspaper Al-Riad puts it: "Unless Palestine is turned into an 
inferno through escalation of the military struggle . . . the Jews in Palestine 
will number over 8 million by the beginning of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
This is the true nature of the "problem": Israel is committing a colossal crime 
by refusing to simply wither away. 
</P>
<P>
An acceptable smoke screen had to be found. Hence, the trumped-up and 
preposterous charge that Israel intends to displace the Palestinians by 
settling Jewish immigrants in their place. There are no grounds for this 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Far from displacing Palestinians, Israel is the only party engaged in their 
rehabilitation. Since 1971, Israel has rehabilitated 150,000 Palestinians who 
left the refugee camps of their own volition and reside today in permanent 
housing in Gaza. Israel has also facilitated the return of 70,000 Palestinians 
from Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
Those who refuse to accept the reality of the Jewish state, and who persist in 
pursuing the dream of overrunning it, continue to oppose Jewish immigration to 
Israel. Yet the mass return of Jews to their homeland confirms that the 
anachronistic dream of doing away with Israel is becoming increasingly 
unpalatable and self-defeating.

ISRAEL WHO WILL LEAD?; 
</P>
<P>
PREDICAMENT CRIES OUT FOR A DE GAULLE; 
</P>
<P>
WORD THAT A BROOKLYN RABBI BLOCKED SHIMON PERES' NEW GOVERNING COALITION MAY 
SPARK POLITICAL REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN M. YODER JR., Edwin M. Yoder Jr. is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Israeli government has become so fragile and unstable in the 1980s that it 
can barely decide anything. A mere word from President Bush deploring new 
settlements in East Jerusalem, a reiteration of familiar U.S. policy, was 
blamed by some for the fall of the Likud government in March. A few days ago, 
the embryo coalition that was to have replaced that government fell apart as 
the prospective prime minister, Shimon Peres, prepared to seek his first vote 
of confidence in the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the coalition's collapse -- at the whim, it was said, of an aged 
Brooklyn rabbi who has never set foot in Israel -- may be exaggerated. Even so, 
it is richly symbolic of the besetting problems of Israeli democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In the narrowly divided Knesset, Peres looked to a small sectarian party, the 
Agudat Israel, to support him. It has become routine practice for would-be 
prime ministers to court the favor of these mini-parties, many of which have 
extremist and sectarian views. The Agudat Israel, after weeks of negotiations, 
was pledged to support Peres. Then, at the last moment, two of its members 
bolted. 
</P>
<P>
One of them explained that he had sought long-distance counsel from the Rabbi 
Menachem Schneerson of Brooklyn, a charismatic Hasidic leader in whom many 
followers see messianic qualities. The rabbi is vehemently opposed to the Labor 
Party's standing promise to swap land (in the occupied territories) for peace. 
So much for the Peres coalition. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, no political consensus has existed on the vital issues for more than 
10 years -- since the signing of the Camp David accords, in fact. Meanwhile, 
the Palestinian revolt in the occupied territories is a continuing 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of Menachem Begin during the invasion of Lebanon, in 1982, 
no government has had the strength to negotiate for a West Bank agreement with 
the Palestinians or to control a settlement policy which, however technically 
legal, is an irritant and affront to every American Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The institutional structure of Israeli government, moreover, accentuates rather 
than eases its divisions. The Knesset confers proportional representation on 
every fractional party, however insular or irrelevant its views. Every 
government coalition is therefore a fragile mosaic, no stronger than its most 
sectarian constituent. This is a recipe for extremism and drift in Israeli 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Parallels are never exact, but Israel's predicament recalls, in nearly every 
particular, the nearly fatal paralysis of France in the '50s due to the 
Algerian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
When the crisis came, France could call on Charles de Gaulle, a great man of 
character who cared nothing for public-opinion polls or for the squalid 
compromises on which factional pseudo-democracy operates. A strong presidency 
with power to make decisions was grafted onto parliamentary anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the spectacle of the Peres disaster seems to have galvanized public 
opinion in Israel. The idea that the government itself might turn upon the whim 
of some sectarian rabbi in Brooklyn who has never so much as visited Israel has 
revolted every sensible Israeli. Reform is in the air. But what kind of reform? 
A mild dose of De Gaullism would probably be good for Israel. But who will play 
De Gaulle?

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted sex offender has been arrested in El Cajon on suspicion of two 
counts of sodomy and five other sex offenses in the alleged molestation of a 
14-year-old boy, El Cajon police said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Montgomery Lieggi, 28, had been living in El Cajon for several months 
and was frequently seen with young boys at two El Cajon parks, Detective Mark 
Bunday said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an El Cajon patrol officer saw Lieggi at a neighborhood bowling 
alley with several boys. The officer took Lieggi aside, and, as he questioned 
him, a 14-year-old boy came up and put his arm around Lieggi, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police then ran a record check and discovered that Lieggi had been convicted in 
1985 of committing lewd and lascivious acts with children under 14 in Lakeside, 
police said. Police said he served a 25-day jail sentence and was placed on 
probation for three years.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire started by a smoldering cigarette left on a living-room recliner caused 
$205,000 in damage Thursday to seven apartments in the 1400 block of Bonair 
Road in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began about 10:30 a.m. in an apartment without a sprinkler system, 
the Vista Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
It took Vista firefighters more than two hours to extinguish the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the shower this morning, and I heard the smoke alarm go off," 
said Joe Licata, who lives next door to the burned apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran over to my car and got my fire extinguisher and tried to put out the 
fire, but the apartment was completely engulfed in flames. No hope," Licata 
said. "Flames were coming out of the dining-room window, and the bushes in 
front caught on fire, the fence was on fire. There wasn't much that wasn't on 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Harlan, a fire engineer, was treated for heat exhaustion at a local 
hospital and released.

CARTER LIFTS HIS BURDEN, NEW TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: HIS FIRST HIT OF THE SEASON, A BASES-LOADED SINGLE IN THE EIGHTH 
INNING, SCORES TWO RUNS TO PUT TEAM AHEAD FOR GOOD ON THE WAY TO AN 8-6 VICTORY 
OVER THE DODGERS.

<P>
Joe Carter was sitting alone in front of his locker Thursday morning, hours 
before the Padres would defeat the Dodgers, 8-6, when Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
stopped by for a quick chat. 
</P>
<P>
"How's it going?" Carter said, looking up nonchalantly. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon: "I'm doing great, but I want to know how you're doing, Joe? I want you 
to quit worrying. Just go out there and have fun. Everything will take care of 
itself, don't worry about it, because I'm sure not." 
</P>
<P>
Carter: "Thanks, but I'll be all right. Things could be a lot worse than this. 
I could be back in Cleveland, and it's snowing there right now." 
</P>
<P>
Carter managed a weak smile, hoping to convince McKeon, along with everyone 
else in the clubhouse, that he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
But who was he trying to kid? Here he was, the new guy in town, making more 
money than any player in Padre history, and he still had yet to reach base this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he had hit the ball hard a few times, all the way to the warning track 
twice Wednesday night, but all he had to show for it were zero hits in 11 plate 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what he was going through," said Fred Lynn, the Padre left fielder. "No 
matter how many times guys tell you to take it easy and not to worry, it 
doesn't do any good. I know it was eating him up. We all knew that." 
</P>
<P>
Carter even started to incur the wrath of the 37,204 fans at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium Thursday, and when he struck out for the second time in the game 
in the sixth -- extending his hitless streak to 14 at-bats -- what could he do 
but stand there and listen to some wise guy yell, "That's a $3 million swing?" 
</P>
<P>
So you can just imagine the anxiety churning inside Carter when he stepped to 
the plate in the eighth. The bases were loaded. No outs. The infield was in. 
And the game was tied, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
It's the situation every power-hitter dreams about. Yes, even if you are 0 for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was ever a time for me to get a hit," Carter said, "that was the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He walked slowly to the plate, allowing the bat to dangle from his hand. He dug 
his spikes into the batter's box, then stepped out as catcher Mike Scioscia 
walked to the mound to discuss strategy with pitcher Don Aase. 
</P>
<P>
They decided they would pitch Carter just as they have this entire series. 
Throw him an assortment of breaking balls and off-speed pitches outside and 
hope he chases them. Heck, it had worked for the past 3 1/2 games, Scioscia 
said. Why change anything now? 
</P>
<P>
Aase went into the stretch and fired a slider about six inches outside. Carter 
swung anyway. Strike 1. 
</P>
<P>
Carter groaned, stepped away from the plate to tell himself to relax, dragged 
his bat across the plate and stepped in to try again. 
</P>
<P>
Aase threw another slider, this time across the strike zone. Carter swung 
again. This time, there was contact. The ball scooted sharply across the 
infield dirt . . . past shortstop Alfredo Griffin . . . and, yes, into the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Base hit. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar came running across the plate. Tony Gwynn was right behind him. 
And Jack Clark stopped at second. 
</P>
<P>
The mighty drought had ended. 
</P>
<P>
Carter showed no emotion as he stepped across first base and didn't even look 
in the dugout toward shortstop Joey Cora, who had predicted after Carter's 
pop-up in the second that Carter would later get the game-winning hit. Instead, 
Carter said a word of thanks to the man upstairs and for the first time was 
able to take that deep breath and relax. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit the outfield grass," Carter said, "you're talking about a big sigh 
of relief. I said, 'Baseball's not supposed to be that hard, is it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Carter's hit opened the floodgates for what surely figures to be one of the 
ugliest innings the Dodgers will play this season. The Padres scored two more 
runs in the eighth after a walk to Lynn and a two-run single by Benito 
Santiago, and by the time the inning was over, the Padres had an 8-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers allowed just two singles in the inning, but when you walk five 
batters and botch a double-play ball, funny things can happen. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was a rather strange game all-around. The Padres' eight-run 
outburst was three more than they scored in the first three games combined. 
Calvin Schiraldi, who came onto the scene in the eighth, won his first game in 
relief since July 28, 1989. Lynn, who hit his second home run in the second 
inning, recorded eight putouts, just one short of the club record for 
outfielders in a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
And by the time Craig Lefferts induced Jeff Hamilton into a fly out -- 
obtaining his second save in less than 19 hours -- 39 players, including 12 
pitchers, had wandered in and out of the game. Little wonder it lasted 3 hours 
34 minutes, tying the franchise record for a nine-inning home game set in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like an American League game," said Lynn, who spent his past 15 seasons 
there. "I'm used to these type of games. Hey, after about five innings, I was 
just getting warmed up." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, maybe it's the Padre offense that is just warming up. They were on 
base 15 times Sunday, including six by the top two hitters in the lineup -- 
Joey Cora and Roberto Alomar, who also stole three bases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what we want to do," Gwynn said. "We showcased ourselves 
today. I can see a lot of games like this. Just get on base. Start running at 
every opportunity. And let the big guys drive us in." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, even if the big guys are driving in runs with singles instead of homers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather get 100 hits with runners in scoring position rather than getting a 
bunch of homers with no one on," Carter said. "The home runs will come, anyway. 
I'm not worried. Especially now, because I feel like a huge burden has been 
lifted from my shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel at home now." 
</P>
<P>
And not just because he finally was able to move out of a hotel Wednesday and 
into his new house in Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter where you're staying," Carter said. "If you're not hitting, 
you don't do a whole lot of sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, after reading about the plight of San Diego 
motorcycle Sgt. Jim Kelley, telephoned him Thursday morning at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital before the game and then visited him afterward, showering him with 
gifts. Besides sending flowers and a card, McKeon brought Kelley and Kelley's 
12-year-old son Padre caps, shirts, autographed baseballs, notebooks, pens and 
about everything else McKeon could rummage out of his office. Kelley was hit 
while on his motorcycle Tuesday night at 9:15, when directing traffic, by a 
48-year-old woman who was charged with drunken driving. He suffered five 
fractures in his lower left leg. "I just wanted to cheer him up," McKeon said. 
"When I called him up, he said, 'You really made my day.' I feel good just 
doing something like that for someone." Besides, McKeon figured, "Now if he 
stops to give me a ticket, maybe he'll think twice." . . . As long as McKeon 
was talking to Kelley, Padre catcher Mark Parent wondered, could he ask for a 
tiny favor? You see, a certain major league catcher happened to be driving 78 
m.p.h. on Interstate 15 Thursday morning on the way to the game, was stopped 
and received a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and Padre chief executive Jerry Kapstein 
spent the afternoon together watching the game. National League President Bill 
White also attended. . . . Former Padre pitcher Dave Leiper is scheduled to 
undergo open-heart surgery today in Redwood City, and several Padres are 
planning to visit him Saturday after their afternoon game with the Giants. . . 
. Padre reliever Mark Grant arrived in the clubhouse recently a bit surprised 
to see the item someone had left above his locker. Heck, he didn't even know 
what it was. To his best guess, it's a wooden Chinese dragon head. "Hey, who 
left me this thing, come on, who did it?" Grant yelled to no one in particular. 
Finally, Padre traveling secretary Doc Mattei stepped forward and admitted that 
he was the culprit. Mattei said the item is actually a Japanese dragon head 
that was presented to him this spring by the Yakult Swallows baseball team. 
"It's to ward off all the demons and evil spirits," Mattei said. Said Grant: 
"Thanks, I could use all the help I can get." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City reliever Mark Davis, who got his first save Wednesday night, sent 
his regards to his former teammates via a telephone call with Grant. The 
biggest adjustment for Davis? "He told me he can't believe how clean the 
stadium is in Kansas City," Grant said. "There's not even a gum wrapper in the 
stands. And as soon as there's a piece of paper in the bullpen, someone picks 
that up." . . . Shortstop Jose Valentin of the Padres' double-A team in Wichita 
suffered a dislocated left shoulder while playing Wednesday and is expected to 
be out four to six weeks. . . . McKeon rested infield regulars Garry Templeton 
and Bip Roberts, instead starting Joey Cora at shortstop and Mike Pagliarulo at 
third for the first time this season. Catcher Benito Santiago will be given the 
day off Sunday, McKeon said, allowing Parent to make his first start. . . . 
McKeon said he wanted to keep Roberts out of the starting lineup for a day to 
help him relax and quit putting so much pressure on himself to hit .300 again. 
Roberts, the Padres' leadoff hitter, is one for 12 this season without a walk. 
"I told Bip, 'The only way you can help me is by getting on base,' " McKeon 
said. " 'Don't worry about hitting .300 again. Just get on base.' "

LACK OF PENA REAL PAIN IN DODGER LOSS

The game featured 39 players, including 12 pitchers, two pinch-hitters who 
never batted and one pinch-runner who never ran. But Thursday's marathon, in 
which the San Diego Padres beat the Dodgers, 8-6, was decided by a guy who 
wasn't there: Alejandro Pena. 
</P>
<P>
The former middle reliever's presence might have helped the Dodgers hold a 
two-run lead. Instead, the lead was squandered in the sixth inning before 
37,204 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The official deciding runs came in the eighth inning against reliever Don Aase 
on Joe Carter's first hit as a Padre, a two-run bouncing single through a 
drawn-in infield. The hit followed a botched double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
But the game was blown when Aase was still wearing his warmup jacket. 
</P>
<P>
After Kal Daniels' two-run, pinch-hit double in the sixth inning had given the 
Dodgers a 6-4 lead, somebody was needed to stop the Padres. Last year that 
somebody was Pena, but he has been traded with the more celebrated Mike 
Marshall to the New York Mets for Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, rookie pitcher Mike Hartley stood where Pena would have in the 
bottom of the sixth. Six pitches later, Joey Cora jogged to first base with a 
walk. Four pitches later, Roberto Alomar hit a forkball into the right-field 
stands for a two-run homer to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't bring your stopper into the game in the sixth," lamented Tom 
Lasorda, Dodger manager. 
</P>
<P>
As the Dodgers (2-2) travel to Houston for a weekend series, they wear the 
first black eye in an otherwise healthy start. 
</P>
<P>
The starting pitching is fine. Ramon Martinez gave up two runs in five innings 
Thursday to join Orel Hershiser, Tim Belcher and Fernando Valenzuela with 
effective starts this week. The four have given up five runs in 25 innings for 
a 1.80 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers collected 12 hits Thursday, including Eddie Murray's first homer of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the bullpen is struggling. After Martinez departed, the five relievers gave 
up five runs in four innings with seven walks. The game took 3 hours 34 
minutes, tying a Padre record for a nine-inning home game. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's nightmare was followed by decent outings from left-hander Ray Searage 
and John Wetteland, who allowed one hit in two innings. But Aase and rookie 
Mike Munoz, both of whom had a chance to fill Pena's set-up role, allowed four 
runs in one inning with five walks. 
</P>
<P>
For those who remember Pena only as a pitcher who took an hour between throws, 
note that among active pitchers with 750 or more innings, only teammate Orel 
Hershiser, Dwight Gooden and Dan Quisenberry have lower earned-run averages 
than his 2.93. And note that last year, in the 68 games the Dodgers led after 
six innings, they lost only nine. 
</P>
<P>
"To get something of value like a Samuel, you've got to give up something of 
value, and we knew what we were giving up in Pena," said Fred Claire, Dodger 
vice president. "But I don't think the situation should be exaggerated. With 
Jim Gott hurting, we're trying to get people in there, and some days they do 
it, and some days they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Gott, who was signed this winter to be the next Pena, is still recovering from 
last year's elbow surgery and likely will not be ready until next month at the 
earliest. The Dodgers also were missing sore-shouldered stopper Jay Howell, 
although because they never got the lead in the late innings, he might not have 
pitched anyway. He said he should be ready to make his first appearance this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some of our younger pitchers just have to go out there and go through 
the hard times," Howell said. "All of us did it. It is just a matter of 
confronting it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers regret that this learning process must come during the regular 
season. Particularly in the middle of a comeback like Thursday's, in which they 
fell behind, 2-0, after three innings on Fred Lynn's homer and Alomar's single. 
</P>
<P>
The comeback began with a run in the fifth inning on Willie Randolph's two-out 
RBI single. It scored Alfredo Griffin, who had begun the inning by extending 
his hitting streak to four games with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the sixth inning, which started with Murray's homer off just-entered 
reliever Mark Grant. A couple of walks later, Daniels, who didn't start to rest 
his knees, pinch hit against left-handed pitcher Pat Clements. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate pinch-hitting," said Daniels. "But, hey, I'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
His line drive in the right-field gap scored both runs to make it 4-2. Hartley 
entered in the bottom of the inning, his first appearance of 1990 before his 
hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a classic start for me, that's for sure," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
The tie was broken in the eighth inning after Aase had walked Alomar. Tony 
Gwynn hit a slow roller to Aase's right. He grabbed it and spun and fired to 
second base . . . where both Randolph and Griffin stood. Griffin stuck his 
glove in front of Randolph's glove, the ball went into right field and one walk 
later the bases were loaded for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got confused. I was supposed to cover second base, but Willie thought 
I was going to help the pitcher," said Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Ramon Martinez's first pitch to Rick Dempsey Thursday, Dempsey became the 
third catcher in modern baseball history to catch a game in four decades. Tim 
McCarver and Carlton Fisk are the others. Dempsey rolled that first ball to the 
Dodger dugout, where pitcher Tim Belcher saved it for him. "It really sunk in 
there, with that first pitch," said Dempsey, 40. "That ball is going to mean an 
awful lot to me." . . . The Padres stole three bases in the first six innings. 
In an attempt to stop runners Joey Cora and Roberto Alomar, Dempsey threw one 
ball into center field for an error, and afterward was left muttering to 
himself. "I should have had at least two of those attempts," he said. "I just 
haven't thrown in a while . . . Nobody ran on me in spring training, and it's 
hard to get the rhythm right away." Only one of the steals led directly to a 
run. In four plate appearances, Dempsey singled and walked.

NICKLAUS SHOOTS 68 FOR A THREE-SHOT LEAD

<P>
Jack Nicklaus says there's no such thing as a "home-court" advantage in playing 
golf courses he designs. 
</P>
<P>
He might have had a hard time convincing anyone of that Thursday, after 
shooting a 68, four under par, for the first-round lead in the 51st PGA Seniors 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the 6,630-yard Champion course at PGA National Golf Club, which he 
redesigned within the past year, Nicklaus took a three-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, on a course he built in Scottsdale, Ariz., Nicklaus won his 
first start on the Senior PGA Tour, the Tradition at Desert Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to play two practice rounds here to see what I had done, and today 
(Thursday), the wind had completely turned from what it was earlier in the 
week," said Nicklaus, who lives 10 minutes from the course. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus made five birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Tied for second at 71 are Mike Hill, the first-round leader a year ago with 67; 
Dale Douglass, the runner-up to Chi Chi Rodriguez in 1987; Al Kelley, an 
alternate who replaced Dave Hill earlier in the week; and Jim Ferree, who had 
four birdies on the back nine, the best effort among the leaders coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Larry Mowry was eight strokes behind with 76, familiar 
territory for him. He trailed Hill by seven after an opening round of 74 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Others of the new "Big Four" on the senior tour did not fare as well as 
Nicklaus. Lee Trevino, like Nicklaus a rookie senior, had two double bogeys on 
the way to a 77. Gary Player shot 74 and Arnold Palmer had an 80. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nicklaus) is not just another 50-year-old out here, is he?" Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nicklaus: "I played reasonably well today. As a matter of fact, I played 
very well. My putting was medium . . . not bad and not good. I only made four 
putts, including a 10-footer to save par at the 12th hole. That isn't very 
many, but I've had a lot of rounds lately where I didn't make any. So I guess 
it's not too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus birdied the second, third, 10th, 14th and 17th holes Thursday and 
bogeyed No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
He turned in his most spectacular effort on the 540-yard 10th, the longest hole 
on the course. What he called "a rather large tee shot" hit an asphalt cart 
path on the fly and bounced another 50 yards, he estimated. He was left with a 
seven-iron, 142 yards to the front and another 15 yards back to the cup. His 
second shot was 13 feet short and he was two feet short on his uphill putt for 
an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Champion) course will be harder to win on than the one in Arizona because 
more guys will play well here," Nicklaus said. "My goal here was to make it 
easier for the average player, but not easier from the back tees."

Ryne Sandberg has won seven Gold Glove awards for his always steady and 
sometimes spectacular fielding for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg made history Thursday in Chicago, playing in his 92nd and 93rd 
consecutive errorless games as the Cubs split a double-header with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg eclipsed the record of 91 consecutive errorless games by a second 
baseman set by Cincinnati's Joe Morgan in 1977-78. Sandberg had four putouts 
and an assist as the Cubs lost the first game, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago won the second game, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best second baseman I have ever watched," Chicago Manager Don Zimmer 
said of Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Ricky Jordan drove in three runs for the Phillies and Terry 
Mulholland allowed five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings to beat the Cubs for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson hit a home run in the eighth-inning for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McDowell earned his first save for the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, right-hander Jose Nunez (1-0) pitched five inning to earn 
his first NL victory. Nunez was obtained from Toronto during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams pitched a perfect ninth inning for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dascenzo hit a two-run homer and scored the go-ahead run on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 13, Atlanta 4 -- Will Clark drove in three runs with two hits to 
pace the Giants' 14-hit attack at Atlanta, and Brett Butler tied a major league 
record by drawing five walks. 
</P>
<P>
The record, shared by many, was accomplished last by Atlanta's Dale Murphy on 
May 23, 1987, against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Butler also had a run-scoring single, scored four runs and stole two bases. 
</P>
<P>
Mike LaCoss gave up five hits and a run in five innings to earn the victory. 
Jeff Brantley pitched 3 2/3 hitless innings for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, New York 2 -- Pitcher Neal Heaton picked up where left off last 
season, and outfielder Barry Bonds drove in three runs and threw out a runner 
at the plate as the Pirates took two of three games in their season-opening 
series at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton, who won five of his last six decisions in 1989, allowed an unearned run 
and six hits against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds had a two-run single in the second inning and a run-scoring double in the 
seventh. He threw out Met pitcher Sid Fernandez (0-1), who attempted to score 
from second on a second-inning single by Keith Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Redus homered for the Pirates.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
YANKEES BEAT INDIANS IN OPENER, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Winfield missed the 1989 season with back problems and went one for 29 in 
spring training, fueling speculation the 12-time All-Star outfielder might not 
be able to come back at age 38. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday at New York, Winfield doubled and scored the New York Yankees' 
first run in a 6-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians in a much-delayed season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were rained out Tuesday and snowed out Wednesday at Cleveland. They 
returned to Yankee Stadium for a game, rescheduled because of the lockout, and 
became the last two major league clubs to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I do is kind of new," Winfield said. "It's like I'm a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 50,114 saw the Yankees win their fifth consecutive opener and John 
McNamara lose his first game as manager of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Luis Polonia, batting for rookie Mike Blowers, singled home the 
tiebreaking run off reliever Doug Jones in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Plunk, the Yankees' fourth pitcher, went 1 1/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cory Snyder, who had a home run wiped out by the snow on Wednesday, hit a 
two-run homer off Dave LaPoint in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly, a notorious slow starter, had two hits, 
including a run-scoring single. Mattingly is a .285 lifetime hitter in April, 
38 points below his career average. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 11, Boston 7 -- Lou Whitaker hit the 150th home run of his career and 
Tony Phillips had four hits at Detroit to help the Tigers end an 11-game losing 
streak against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker's two-run homer off rookie Mike Rochford in the first inning gave 
Detroit a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips singled in two more runs during a four-run second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Former Angel right-hander Urbano Lugo relieved Frank Tanana in the fifth and 
earned his first victory for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Pena hit his first home run for the Red Sox in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Texas 1 -- Fred McGriff, Pat Borders and Kelly Gruber hit home runs 
to lead the Blue Jays at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff's second-inning homer off Jamie Moyer was his first in his past 108 
at-bats and tied the score, 1-1. McGriff led the American League with 36 home 
runs last season, but his last homer was on Sept. 4 against the Chicago White 
Sox at Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Borders hit a solo homer and Gruber had a three-run home run during a four-run 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flanagan (1-0) allowed five singles in five innings, struck out one and 
walked none. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer (0-1) allowed four runs and nine hits in six-plus innings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Anderson matched his season high with 26 points and scored 12 in the 
final nine minutes as the San Antonio Spurs came from behind to defeat the 
Clippers, 105-98, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson's 32 points led the Spurs, who have won 51 games, 30 more than 
last season. Danny Manning scored 23 points for the Clippers. Benoit Benjamin 
had 21 and Charles Smith 20. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers led, 95-94, with 4:05 to play, but the Spurs scored the next seven 
points, four by Anderson, to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Coach Don Casey complained about his team's poor shooting late in the 
game. The Clippers made only one field goal in the final four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Young teams consistently lose when they can't hit from the outside, and we did 
that tonight," he said. "When our guys shoot, they shoot until they miss, and 
it wasn't enough at the end." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers shot 43.8% and committed 21 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Still trailing Midwest Division leader Utah by 2 1/2 games, the Spurs can break 
the all-time NBA record for biggest turnaround with three victories in their 
final five games. Boston set the record in 1979-80, Larry Bird's rookie season, 
improving 32 games over the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored 15 points in the first quarter and added four more in the 
second as San Antonio took a 56-47 lead at halftime. The Spurs led by 15 in the 
second quarter, but a 9-0 run by the Clippers, including six points by Manning, 
kept the game close. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs are 10-0 when Anderson scores 10 or more points in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the game, Coach (Larry Brown) just said make something happen," 
Anderson said. "I have a lot more confidence down the stretch than I did last 
year. Now I'm looking for the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Strickland added 16 points for San Antonio, which played most of the game 
without ailing Terry Cummings, who played only nine minutes. Cummings was 
suffering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely into the game even though I was sitting on the bench," 
Cummings said. "I didn't feel good all day and I didn't even want to get out of 
bed. But this is the type of game and the time in the season when you have to 
suit up for every game."

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: JIMMY ELLIS SEEKS PRO JOB, WOULD TAKE LOYOLA'S FAST 
BREAK WITH HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Paul Westhead fast-break system has touched fellow coaches as well as 
players and fans, and now Jimmy Ellis is hoping to take the break to the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who was a volunteer coach at Loyola Marymount for four seasons under 
Westhead, is interviewing next month for the head coaching position with the 
Oklahoma City Cavalry of the Continental Basketball Assn. Ellis, who spent this 
season as an assistant with the San Jose Slammers of the CBA, is hoping some of 
Loyola's recent tournament magic will rub off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sweating it out. There are some other options, but Oklahoma City is 
definitely the first option," he said. "A head coaching position would really 
put me on the way. I need just one break." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, he hopes, a fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Like other coaches who have seen the Westhead regimen from the inside, Ellis 
says he will run The System. "Absolutely. I like that style. It's exciting to 
watch, the players love it, you force the action. I think we could break the 
all-time (pro) scoring record," Ellis said. "You'd have to modify it for the 
CBA because you get a point for winning each quarter, but I think we could get 
that all-time record." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is also trying to use his Loyola contacts to enhance his chances with the 
Cavalry. Westhead has written a letter for him, and he has gotten 
recommendations from the likes of UCLA Coach Jim Harrick and Philadelphia 76ers 
Coach Jim Lynam. He has even gotten the Lakers' Magic Johnson to talk to one of 
the Cavalry owners -- Wayman Tisdale of the Sacramento Kings. It's a virtual 
Cavalry stampede. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a kick out of talking to these people, and they've (helped) put me right 
there to be considered," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, a native of Memphis, played at Arkansas State and headed West when he 
graduated in 1977. "I had California fever," he recalled. He ended up getting 
his teaching degree at Cal State Los Angeles and landing a job in the Inglewood 
school system. He began coaching elementary-level leagues, then assisting at 
Inglewood High, and was hooked. "That got me back around the game, and being 
there in Inglewood where you had two solid teams (Inglewood and Morningside 
high schools) and the Forum nearby spurred my interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis went to San Jose last fall, and returned to Los Angeles the weekend Hank 
Gathers died. He was planning to attend the conference tournament the next day 
when he learned of Gathers' death. He watched the Lions practice for the NCAA 
Tournament the next week and had dinner with them the night before they whipped 
New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really wondering how everybody was, if they were still quiet about 
(Gathers' death). They were up; they didn't hide anything. They were full of 
excitement," Ellis said. "We spoke of (Gathers) with the affection we all felt 
for him, remembering him laughing, upbeat. It was interesting to see how they 
came out against a very good New Mexico State team. To sit back and watch 
Loyola with so much on the line, to see them mentally and physically break 
teams down, was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said that even without Gathers, The System prevailed. "I always believe 
they can beat anybody," he said. "That particular system, if they're shooting 
well, they can beat anybody in the country. This year they had the senior 
leadership they needed in the key positions." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis hopes to get the chance to try that style in Oklahoma City. Another goal, 
down the road, is to return to Arkansas State as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel in the next month or so I'll wind up someplace," he said. "Everything 
is predicated on what happens in Oklahoma City. I just need that first break." 
</P>
<P>
On the first basketball signing day this week, Loyola Marymount got commitments 
from two standout high school guards, Rahim Harris of Skyline High in Oakland 
and Kareem Washington of Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
When those two officially sign, the Lions will have five new players for next 
season -- four of them guards, the other a 6-foot-6 swing man. In a nutshell, 
the Lions' future appears to be small but fast. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 6-3, averaged 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists for Skyline. 
He's the son of Art Harris, who played in the National Basketball Assn. after 
starring at Stanford in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 6-2, averaged 28 points in earning all-state honors in Lansing, the 
hometown of Lakers star Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The new recruits join three preseason signers -- 6-4 guard Craig Holt from West 
Valley Community College, 6-2 guard Greg Evans from Ocean View High and 6-6 
swing man Ross Richardson from Central High in Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The five newcomers join a squad that figures to be led by the T 'n' T guard 
combo, Terrell Lowery and Tony Walker, and swing man Tom Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
At the Loyola Marymount basketball team banquet last week, school officials 
announced that Hank Gathers would be awarded a posthumous bachelor of arts 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Lions Coach Paul Westhead brought a tear to many eyes with a closing 
remembrance of his late star. "My last comment about Hank Gathers is from my 
family," Westhead began. "When he was at our home, he'd put a bear hug on our 
youngest daughter, Julie. He'd say, 'Julie, who's your favorite player?' 'You 
are, Hank.' When he'd see my wife, Cassie, around campus, he'd go to Cass and 
say, 'Cass, who's your favorite player?' 'You are Hank, you are.' 
</P>
<P>
"He never asked me. But if he were to now -- you are, Hank." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular awards at the Loyola banquet was bestowed by emcee Bob 
Courtney, who made up a special three-point trophy for the team's top 
long-distance shooter. After weighing the three-point accomplishments of Bo 
Kimble and Jeff Fryer, Courtney awarded the trophy to senior center Marcellus 
Lee, who came off the bench to hit three-pointers against Michigan and Nevada 
Las Vegas in the NCAA playoffs. Courtney explained that Lee "didn't miss a 
three-pointer in the NCAA Tournament." 
</P>
<P>
No respect: At the Loyola banquet, Bo Kimble introduced teammate Per Stumer as 
"the Roger Dangerfield of the team." 
</P>
<P>
When Kimble introduced redshirt forward Brian McCloskey, who is expected to 
step in as the shooting forward next season, he called him "pretty much the 
next Bo Kimble. He can shoot it from anywhere on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Said Westhead: "Bo, there are some differences. Brian, I hope you play 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Hot hitters: Cal State Dominguez Hills first baseman Darrell Conner and catcher 
Mike Gabbani batted their way into the Toro record book last week. Conner hit 
safely in his 17th straight game to break the season record, though it took him 
an extended period to do so. Conner's streak was stalled at 14 as he sat out 
two weeks with a wrist injury. He returned last weekend to get hits in all 
three games against UC Riverside. He kept the streak alive Saturday by doubling 
in his last at-bat in the eighth inning. Conner now is aiming at the overall 
school record of 22 straight set by Fred Hanker over two seasons -- the last 16 
games in 1985 and the first six in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gabbani, a senior catcher, needed only one game to enter the record book. 
Against U.S. International last week, Gabbani homered in three consecutive 
at-bats, an unmatched power display in Toro history. He also tied another 
record by knocking in eight runs in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: All eight position players for the Loyola Marymount baseball 
team are hitting above .300. Outfielder Rick Mediavilla leads the West Coast 
conference with a .401 average. The lowest average among the regulars is 
catcher Miah Bradbury's .314, but Bradbury ranks among conference leaders in 
most power categories. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount catcher Miah Bradbury was named West Coast Conference baseball 
player of the week. Bradbury batted .500 in a three-game WCC sweep of St. 
Mary's last weekend, with a grand slam and seven runs batted in in one game. . 
. . Loyola first baseman Joe Ciccarella remains out of the lineup with a pulled 
hamstring. The sophomore was hitting .344 when he was injured on March 31. . . 
. Paul Westhead Jr. will not be back as an assistant basketball coach for his 
father next season at Loyola. He's starting a job in the banking/investment 
field. . . . Dominguez Hills softball standout Jennifer Boen had a 
school-record 12-game hitting streak snapped over the weekend. In the streak 
she was 19 for 42 (.452) with five doubles to raise her season average to .403. 
She also leads the pitching staff with a 13-6 record. . . . Lady Toros 
outfielder Maria Romero broke the school career record for triples with her 
17th over the weekend. . . . The Lady Toros (22-19-1) resume California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. play with a double-header at Cal State Bakersfield 
today and a double-header at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at noon Saturday. They 
are 1-9 in the CCAA.

It was a huge turnout for the Santa Monica Halibut Derby last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 2,000 anglers participated in the annual two-day charity event with 460 
legal halibut weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
Once again this year, Big Berthas (a $25,000 tagged fish) eluded the bait and 
jigs. Tim Crissman from Newhall, fishing off Torrance Beach from his boat the 
Mad-Gaffer, was grand-prize winner with the 31-pound 2-ounce halibut he caught 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Crissman said he knew when he set the hook it had to be a big fish. It started 
taking line immediately, and after it came aboard he was sure of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Crissman has a choice of trips to fish in Alaska or Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners of prizes and cash awards were William Northington of Redondo 
Beach, landing his 20-pound 4-ounce halibut at the Pipeline; Robbie Henderson 
of Redondo Beach, fishing at the El Segundo Stacks where he used dead anchovies 
and decked a 20-pound 3-ounce halibut, and Scott Herman of Torrance, who was 
drifting off Torrance Beach when he landed an 18-pound 7-ounce halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The team event winners were Redondo Beach anglers Jerry Foot and William 
Northington for catching four fish each. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers turned in 25 fish with research tags attached and will receive $5 from 
the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
A ton of fish were caught in the fourth annual feed for homeless rock cod 
derby. 
</P>
<P>
As the First String returned to San Pedro, with 50 anglers who fished San 
Nicholas Island, charity organizer Tony Salas said angling success stories were 
too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
All were expert rock cod fishermen. Their entire catch will go to feed the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Benn and John Moore of the Los Angeles Life Food Recovery Program said 
this catch should feed 2,300 needy persons. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot and prize winners included Torrance angler Jack Komda for limiting 
out first and second place for Jay Grossflam of Carson. John Glover won a 
sheephead jackpot with his 15-pounder.

BATTERS MAKE DIFFERENCE AS LOYOLA TOPS CONFERENCE, MAKES TOP 10 NATIONALLY;

BASEBALL: LIONS HITTERS ARE BATTING A COMBINED .355 THIS SEASON TO BOLSTER SOME 
SHAKY PITCHING.

Hockey's L.A. Kings isn't the only team off Manchester Avenue showing some 
strong stick work these days. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount baseball team, which had an 11-game winning streak snapped 
this week, resumes West Coast Conference play today at San Francisco with a 
two-game lead over Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (31-10 overall, 17-5 in the WCC) have vaulted into the top 10 in both 
major-college polls, and have been able to overcome some shaky pitching by 
battering opposing staffs for a .335 team average. Even in losing to 
Pepperdine, 7-6, on Tuesday, the Lions had a six-run rally in the ninth inning 
and left the tying run on third base against the Waves' ace, Britt Craven. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' recent streak included wins over non-conference foes USC and 
California as well as some wild WCC wins, 10-9 and 11-9, over St. Mary's last 
weekend. The Lions averaged 9.4 runs during the streak, 8.4 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost remarkable with our lack of depth on the mound that we've done as 
well as we have," said Lions Coach Chris Smith. "The big difference from last 
year is we're playing much better defense. (Shortstop) Chris Gomez has been an 
outstanding freshman. (Catcher) Miah Bradbury is as good as they come in 
college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just gotta keep scoring runs and play good defense. We've patched (the 
pitching) along pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, an all-CIF star at Lakewood High last year, has stepped in to hit .357 
with a team-high 17 doubles while starting all but two games. Two others who 
have bolstered the team are transfers Rick Mediavilla, leading the WCC with a 
.401 average, and Tony Kounas, hitting .377 with a team-high 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The other heavy hitter has been junior Tim Williams, hitting .343 with nine 
home runs and battling for the conference lead in runs batted in with 46. He 
platooned his first two seasons but has started every game this year. "Nobody 
questioned he could have that kind of year," Smith said of the former St. 
Bernard High standout. "He's a real fine hitter. Now he's in every day, knowing 
he's going to be in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who holds the school record for career doubles with 68, is hitting 
.314 with 41 RBIs but Smith said his real value has been in holding together 
the patched-up pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a big difference when you have a guy like Bradbury behind the plate," 
he said. "The team will go as Bradbury goes. Day in, day out, he's the hardest 
worker I've ever seen. He calls a great game. Team chemistry is a great thing. 
. . . Ours starts with Bradbury." 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Jon Willard has been the pitching leader at 9-2, but Smith didn't 
use him Tuesday and plans to hold him out until Saturday to let him rest his 
arm. Darryl Scott, the team's relief ace as an underclassman, is 8-2 as a 
starter this season. Among the other starters, Chris Spears is 5-0, Joe Caruso 
is 4-2 and Steve Surico is 2-2. However, Caruso and Surico are struggling with 
earned-run averages above five. 
</P>
<P>
Smith plans to start Surico today at the University of San Francisco, then 
Caruso and Willard in Saturday's double-header there. But it's been tough to 
stick to a rotation. "Nothing goes like that with our staff," Smith admitted. 
</P>
<P>
USF, which struggled with injuries early in the season, is in last place in the 
WCC at 4-18 (11-26 overall). But the Dons took one game from Loyola in Los 
Angeles, 10-9, and can hit. Outfielder Arnie Sambel leads the WCC in homers 
with 14. 
</P>
<P>
"They're tough. It'll be a difficult weekend," Smith said. "There was a time in 
this league you looked to sweep. Now you look to win series. The league is a 
lot better. We've had dogfights. I like the league better this way." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions play their next nine games on the road, playing nationally ranked 
Long Beach State at 2 p.m. Tuesday. They don't return to conference play again 
until April 27 at San Diego.

BERLINE WINS TWO MORE FOR NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think Notre Dame High softball Coach Cindy Kramer has tongue in cheek when she 
says, "As Becca Berline goes, so goes Notre Dame"? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Just compare the team's record to Berline's. 
</P>
<P>
Berline (9-3) tossed a pair of two-hit shutouts Thursday as Notre Dame (also 
9-3) remained unbeaten in pool play of the Easter Bunny Bash softball 
tournament at Chaparral High in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, the senior right-hander struck out nine and walked none as 
Notre Dame defeated Rolling Hills, 1-0. Catcher Simona Errico supplied all the 
offense with a third-inning home run, her third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Berline struck out six and walked none in a 7-0 win over 
Chaparral. Karen Erickson and Susan Gulliver each slammed their first home runs 
of the year for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Against Chaparral, Berline pitched 5 2/3 innings of no-hit ball before settling 
for a two-hitter. The four hits allowed by Berline in the two games were all 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame can win its pool with a victory over Mar Vista today.

Chatsworth 6, Mt. Carmel 5 -- Terry Powell's bunt single in the bottom of the 
seventh inning scored Mike Mancuso from third base with the winning run as 
Chatsworth finished fifth in the Far West Classic in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (13-3-1) rallied from 3-0 and 5-4 deficits. The Chancellors scored 
two runs in the bottom of the seventh to win, the first coming in when Mitch 
Root singled to score Nestor Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-1, in the fifth, Chatsworth scored twice. Martinez delivered a 
run-scoring triple, then scored on a passed ball. Chatsworth took a 4-3 lead in 
the sixth on a fly by Doug Dean. Mt. Carmel scored twice in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 11, St. Genevieve 4 -- Justin Stark hit his second two-run home run 
in as many days and Ted Corcoran (3-3) allowed three hits and struck out eight 
in five innings to lead visiting Chaminade (9-6-1, 2-2) in a San Fernando 
Valley League game.

CS NORTHRIDGE SIGNS BEVERLY HILLS CENTER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Micelli, a 6-foot-8 center from Beverly Hills High, signed a national 
letter of intent Thursday to play basketball for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Micelli, who averaged 24 points and 14 rebounds a game, was the Bay League's 
Most Valuable Player last season. He is the seventh player to sign with 
Northridge, which will move from the NCAA Division II to Division I level next 
season. Five junior college players signed Wednesday; a high school player 
signed in November.

MCGUIRE OVERCOMES A TIGHT SPOT TO THROW A SHUTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino Real High's Ryan McGuire sustained a pulled right hamstring making a 
long stretch for a ball while playing first base last week. But the last thing 
he wanted to do was miss a longer stretch because of a little tightness. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his teammates and discussing his injury with Coach Mike 
Maio, McGuire asked if he could again pitch, something he had not done in 
almost a week. 
</P>
<P>
Maio agreed, but made it clear to his standout left-hander that he wanted 
up-to-the-inning progress reports. Otherwise, he'd show McGuire what being 
pulled was really all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised I'd let him know the first time I had any problems," McGuire said. 
"And he said, 'If you don't, I'll beat you up.' It was one of those things 
Coach Maio says.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGuire shortened his delivery and tossed a three-hitter in a 6-0 victory over 
Ventura on Wednesday to give El Camino Real third-place honors in the Thousand 
Oaks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, it was McGuire's first shutout of the season. After striking out 38 
batters in an impressive two-game stretch two weeks ago, the UCLA-bound McGuire 
(4-0) struck out four and walked two against Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure cooker: Being tabbed as the league favorite in any sport is worth an 
extra wrinkle in a coach's forehead. It's even worse when his team is so loaded 
with talent that it is expected to win a City Section title. 
</P>
<P>
Can losing a rather meaningless spring tournament game ease the burden of an 
undefeated season? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Sure, Maio wasn't at all pleased with his team's 7-6 loss to Montclair 
Prep on Tuesday, but it could serve as a pressure valve of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Going undefeated is a nice lofty goal," Maio said. "But on a given day, if the 
ball isn't moving or you hit it right at people, things happen." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (11-1-1) didn't go easily. The Conquistadores left 10 runners on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit it hard," he said. "But that's exactly what I mean -- you have days 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said McGuire: "Looking back, it was a big load off us. At the time, we didn't 
see it that way, though." 
</P>
<P>
And it's definitely better to lose now than in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"Or the playoffs," McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
Red numbers: Chaminade golf Coach Mark Kardon calls Tim Powers the best golfer 
in the Valley. Powers, a junior, is doing his best to prove his coach correct. 
</P>
<P>
In Powers' last 63 holes of competitive play, he is five under par. The streak 
includes a four-under 67 at Simi Hills Golf Course and a two-under 34 at Encino 
Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino round included a birdie and two eagles. 
</P>
<P>
After recording a nine-hole average of 37 strokes last season -- playing on 
Chaminade's first-year team -- Powers is averaging 36 this season. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kardon, Powers has never been beaten in high school competition. 
</P>
<P>
R &amp; R: A freshman can only be expected to do so much, so when Birmingham 
middle-distance runner Deetra Dear pulled her right quadriceps in a dual meet 
with Reseda last week, Coach Scott King pulled her from Saturday night's 
Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason (to over-race) a ninth grader," he said. "We'll probably 
rest her for a couple of weeks (and) only bring her back when it's safe." 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday, Dear had the fastest girls' time in the Valley area for 800 
meters, at 2 minutes 21.82 seconds, until Buena senior Fanya Bryant recorded a 
2:19.07 in Arcadia's Open competition, which preceded the featured 
invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Dear, scheduled to run in the invitational 800 at Arcadia, first injured her 
leg March 24 while competing in the Pasadena Games' Open 800 at Occidental 
College. Just after the 400 mark, Monica Callan of San Diego Poway ran up on 
Dear's leg, causing her to stumble into Lane 3. 
</P>
<P>
Heir apparent: It may be difficult for sprinter Marion Jones to escape the 
shadow of Angela Burnham, but no one can say she isn't trying. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a freshman at Rio Mesa, follows Burnham, the UCLA freshman who won five 
state high school titles. 
</P>
<P>
As a 13-year-old eighth-grader, Jones shattered Burnham's national age-group 
record of 24.90 seconds in the 200 meters. Jones clocked 24.30. 
</P>
<P>
At the Arcadia Invitational, Jones, running into a slight head wind, broke 
Burnham's record of 24.08 in the 200 as a 14-year-old with a time of 23.80.

Avoid It: Lady Bird Johnson said that some of the things written about her 
husband would make her angry if she read them, so "the simplest thing is not to 
read them." She was responding Tuesday to the furor over Robert Caro's "Means 
of Ascent." 
</P>

The book has been sharply criticized by some as being unduly harsh. The former 
first lady was in Washington for a reunion of Johnson Administration officials.

Arrested: Steve Gobie, the former paid lover of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), 
was arrested in Washington on charges of marijuana possession and destruction 
of property, police said Thursday. The charges stemmed from an incident 
Wednesday in which Gobie confronted an off-duty female police officer who was 
driving her personal car. The officer said Gobie was driving erratically and 
later jumped on the roof of her car. Frank admitted that he in the past paid 
Gobie for sexual favors.

Grave Dispute: According to historical letters released Wednesday in 
Springfield, Ill., Abraham Lincoln was almost buried in Washington, D.C. rather 
than Illinois. Mary Todd Lincoln was prepared to move the President's remains 
to the nation's capital if Gov. Richard Oglesby insisted on the President being 
interred several miles from Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, where Lincoln is 
in fact buried. "They began to build a vault . . . before Mrs. Lincoln finally 
convinced them Oak Ridge was the place where she wanted the body to be," said a 
spokesman for the state's historical agency.

By Degrees: George Bush will give the commencement addresses at television

LISTEN: BALMAIN GOES SCOT

<TEXT>

The French fashion house of Balmain has named a new designer, Alistair Blair of 
Scotland, for its line of luxury ready-to-wear. Blair is well known in Britain 
where he has been designing his own collection for Jaeger, the upscale 
sportswear company. Earlier, he worked in the Paris couture houses -- Dior, 
Givenchy, Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld -- for nine years. Erik Mortensen, Balmain's 
Danish-born designer, will keep his post as head of haute couture, which he has 
occupied since Pierre Balmain's death in 1982. The Balmain label has a classic 
image, and no matter what creations Blair comes up with, the prices will remain 
in the high rent district -- say, about $1,000 for a suit.

VIRGIN DRESS: Madonna has a new dress and it's the first ever made by Richard 
Tyler, the L.A. designer best known for his men and women's suits. She 
requested something in black with a velvet collar and he came up with what 
looks like a priest's frock, except that it is slit on the sides to show off a 
sheer black underskirt. Madonna will wear it during her concert tour and Tyler 
will stock a version of it in his L.A. boutique, says the designers' partner, 
Lisa Trafficante. Janet Jackson is also sporting Tyler togs in her latest 
video. Her black silk suit with hand-stitched white pinstripes is a featured 
attraction on "Alright." They're showing the video at the Tyler Trafficante 
store.

LIMELIGHTS AND NOLAN MILLER: In the play "Sleeping Beauty -- Coma," playing at 
the Coronet Theatre in Hollywood, thousands of dollars were spent to create the 
Mod fashion world of London in the '60s, but nothing was left for a showpiece 
outfit for the final scene. So Charles Busch, the play's creator/star, shopped 
the racks at Sym's, a New York store, to come up with the final fashion 
statement for his character, a Mary Quant-type designer he plays in drag. For 
the last scene (which takes place in 1990) Busch found an off-the-rack, beaded, 
white, Nolan Miller suit bargain-priced at $250. He reports that the suit, 
which resembles the styles Miller created for Joan Collins in "Dynasty," stops 
the show every night. "As soon as I walk out on stage in that suit the audience 
screams," Busch said. "I'd like to think it's my acting, but. . . . "

BAG CAMPS: Prada accessories are becoming so popular that two of their bags are 
becoming the status symbol among fashion folks, including many fashion editors 
at the recent European collections. The nylon and silk chain-handled tote is 
seen on the shoulders of models Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Linda 
Evangelista and big-haired blondes Dyan Cannon and Diandra Douglas. The other 
camp -- led by designer Isaac Mizrahi -- slings on the Prada backpack.

<P>
They look like they should be hanging from the ceiling, but in reality, they 
are the newest accessory for ears. They're earrings shaped like chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Made of crystal, gold, silver, pearls and semi precious stones, most of them 
are long enough to brush the shoulders -- at least. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles jewelry designer Deanna Hamro was on top of the trend two years 
ago, but it was just recently that the demand caught up with her vision. 
</P>
<P>
Her 24-karat gold door-knockers with gold chains and lavender Austrian pave 
crystals for $405 (pictured here) are available at Buffalo in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela McGivern, a San Francisco jewelry designer, calls her line of 
Victorian-looking gold filigree and pearl earrings Chandel Ears. Priced from 
$185 to $265, they are available at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
You can have your earrings as long as you please by ordering gold or silver 
pearls by the inch at Faux Body Ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Hillary Ellison, a pair measuring up to seven inches run $98. 
</P>
<P>
At Madeleine Gallay, an incredibly long pair of earrings designed by Eric 
Beamon go for $210. They are made of Austrian crystals, pearls and beads.

ANTI-ABORTIONIST STIRS STRONG REACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am so angry and resentful that I can barely write this letter. I am a poor, 
black woman barely able to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
I resent McMillan who is rich, well-educated and privileged telling me and 
others how to live our lives. She had the choice of abortion which allowed her 
to be where she is now regardless of her regrets. Those regrets are her 
problems, not others'. She states the abortion was a secret because it was a 
private life. So it is in all women's lives and we resent her and others 
invading our private lives. Why should she have a private life and others not? 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who have had an abortion, there have been no regrets or soul 
searching. I thank God every hour for the right to have aborted. It was longer 
than 20 years ago and it wasn't legal and it was expensive, but worth every 
penny it took me to get it. I became very ill but I'm not sorry. Thank God 
women today needn't go through my experience.

McMillan says, ". . . I murdered a child." I suggest she mitigate her offense 
by hopping in her Mercedes 380SL, driving up to Central L.A. and adopting one 
of the hundreds of black, Hispanic, or physically challenged babies whose 
mother practiced what McMillan preaches. 
</P>
<P>
That would accomplish so much more than attempting to deny a woman the right to 
choose. Better yet, McMillan should gracefully bow out of the fight. Her thread 
of credibility is hopelessly frayed.

That this aging co-ed, with her big hair, big Rolex, big diamonds and big 
Mercedes wants to dictate her version of morality would be comical if it 
weren't so frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have a woman who wants for nothing (including first-class air travel to 
Europe to peddle her self-righteousness) and it is totally disconnected from 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
I am puzzled by the very term pro-life. She isn't pro-life. She is pro-birth. 
McMillan doesn't consider life an ongoing experience. Once you have the baby, 
you're on your own, ladies. The unfortunate mothers then have to contend with a 
vicious circle of poverty and despair, presumably while Susan is having her 
roots retouched.

I always understood that she had had an abortion in her youth. That is what

Thanks for your article on Susan McMillan, the outspoken pro-life activist. 
</P>
<P>
Many papers are shrinking from presenting objective coverage on people who are 
"on the wrong side" of the abortion issue -- those who believe it takes life. 
Susan has generated much controversy because of her stance against abortion and 
because she is articulate, wealthy, and visible. I felt your reporter captured 
McMillan's warmth and depth of conviction fairly, and let her quotes stand for 
themselves.

RELATIONSHIPS: BERTRAND BLIER UPENDS TRADITIONAL MALE FANTASY IN THE SERIOUSLY 
COMIC 'TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Bertrand Blier's "Too Beautiful for You" (at the Royal), Gerard Depardieu 
plays a happily married car dealer with a model-perfect wife (Carole Bouquet) 
who falls swooningly in love with his frumpy temporary secretary (Josiane 
Balasko). 
</P>
<P>
This may sound like a marital infidelity farce, but the mood is hypnotic and 
almost rhapsodically self-obsessed. Blier has often made movies that seem 
clocked to the metronome of his own dream-time. Films like "Get Out Your 
Handkerchiefs" and "Menage," to name two of his most popular art-house hits, 
advance the plot in poetic leaps that make sense only retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
Blier isn't interested in traditional narrative successes, and that can make 
his movies a little maddening sometimes. Particularly, as in his new film, when 
the poetic linkages are so vague and "personal" that at times it seems as if 
the film we're watching is only the residue of Blier's unconscious imaginings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a residue from Blier is more interesting than the fully aware, fully 
worked out scenarios of most other filmmakers. Gerard Depardieu, a Blier 
perennial, is well-cast as the husky, smitten Bernard. When he first sees 
Colette, his secretary, we can understand his infatuation. Bernard may look 
like an affable lug but he has surprising emotional depths; it makes sense that 
he would be attracted to Colette, who proves to be not only his physical but 
his spiritual counterpart. Her frumpiness is as deceptive as his huskiness. 
There's a sensual undertone to the dutiful, resigned dailiness of her life. 
She's poised to be lifted into a lyrical realm of sex and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
By casting the two women in Bernard's life as polar opposites, at least in 
terms of their looks, Blier is setting up what at first appears to be an almost 
diagrammatic male fantasy. The fantasy is upended, of course: In the normal 
scheme of things, Bernard's wife would be the frump, his mistress the goddess. 
That's what's so potentially humorous about Blier's setup here. After Colette 
first meets Florence, she fumes at Bernard because she can't understand why he 
might prefer her to his wife. She thinks he's making weird fun of her. 
</P>
<P>
But Blier doesn't play the situation for laughs, and he doesn't simply provide 
a standard reversal of fantasy expectations, either. For, as it turns out, 
Florence isn't just a prettified cipher. She's got depths of her own. She 
anguishes over her loss, and fights to get Bernard back. The more we see of 
these two women the harder it is to categorize them. Bernard, who is in love 
with the unfathomable, is, naturally enough, torn between them. They prove 
equal mysteries, equally out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
In his earlier movies, Blier was famous for expressing the sort of uncensored 
male romantic fantasies that most filmmakers have the tact to avoid. The women 
in his films have almost always been species of the Other: lyrical creatures 
who confound men with their ultimate unknowability. In his new film, men are 
the Other too. In that sense, "Too Beautiful for You" (rated R for brief 
nudity), for all its humorlessness, is the film Blier has been working up to 
since the beginning of his career. Women and men are linked in the same 
trance-like continuum. 
</P>
<P>
It's a measure of how far-gone Blier is in this film that, given so many ripe 
opportunities for comedy, he remains resolutely serious. With Pedro Almodovar 
and David Lynch, Blier is probably the most original comic talent to come along 
in the movies in the past decade or so. "Too Beautiful for You" certainly 
resonates with his earlier work, but in academic ways that don't always excite. 
</P>
<P>
The hallucinatory dourness of what Blier has given us can't quite compensate 
for the lyric comic highs of his best work. Blier can't, or doesn't want to, 
separate out his own fantasies from Bernard's. That's why the film seems so 
involuted and personal in ways that don't always connect with an audience. 
Blier identifies so strongly with Bernard's spiritual-romantic dilemma that he 
doesn't recognize the raving narcissism at its core. 
</P>
<P>
The film is really about how Bernard needs both halves of the mystery -- 
Colette and Florence -- and how he will never be satisfied. The women's 
dissatisfactions are not presented with the same heft as Bernard's, and so, at 
its worst, the movie is like the sanctification of some spoiled pasha who can't 
decide which concubine to idealize. Quelle problem! 
</P>
<P>
As good as Depardieu is in this film, the two actresses are equally fine 
(particularly Balasko, noted in France for her comic roles). They deserve a few 
more drafts of Blier's ah-sweet-mystery-of-the-sexes elixir. It's possible to 
admire this film and still feel cheated. 
</P>

Organizers said the benefit, to be called "Red, Hot and Blue," will heighten 
awareness of AIDS through music and education. The performers will do versions 
of Cole Porter songs in the 90-minute show, which will be broadcast on 
television and made into a video. "Red, Hot and Blue" will be broadcast Dec. 1

Schools Out for Grateful Dead: The Grateful Dead have been banned at UC 
Berkeley and Stanford University because of "Deadheads" who like to camp out 
while awaiting concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools told the Bay Area band that it is no longer welcome to perform its 
annual concerts on the campuses. Police said 30 to 50 arrests -- mostly 
drug-related -- are made each summer when the Dead performs its three-concert 
stand. The band was also bounced from Irvine Meadows in Orange County this year 
because of similar disruptions. GREG BRAXTON

Hardest Working Man?: Imprisoned soul singer James Brown was freed from prison 
Thursday after 16 months to begin a work-release program. Brown will act as a 
counselor with the Aiken and Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission in 
Aiken, S.C. Brown, often billed as the "hardest-working man in show business," 
likely would be required to talk with children and adults in the largely rural 
area and work to increase public awareness of the poor. He will spend nights 
and weekends at a minimum security prison in Aiken County. GREG BRAXTON

A SPIRITUAL REFLECTION ON LIFE OF KRISHNAMURTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movies about philosophy are so rare that "Krishnamurti: With a Silent Mind" 
(Monica Showcase) gets points for daring its subject at all. This multi-faceted 
portrait of the late philosopher-teacher-world traveler J. Krishnamurti mixes 
archival footage of his life and early years, videotapes, TV shows and 
interviews, with extracts from his notebooks, read with studied lyricism over 
quiet pastoral scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnamurti is a more fascinating subject than he might first seem, yet the 
film is ultimately too worshipful. Producer Evelyne Blau and director Michael 
Mendizza want to spread the word, get us to accept Krishnamurti -- or "K" as 
his acolytes reverently-affectionately call him -- as a great man. To that end, 
they've enlisted several dozen interviewees, who either discuss K.'s life or 
praise him to the skies. These interviewees, never identified until the end 
credits, distract from the story and subject -- as if the "witnesses" from 
Warren Beatty's "Reds" took over the whole last half of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame. As we see it here, the story of Krishnamurti's early years -- 
from his birth in India in 1895 to his great public crisis in 1929 -- has the 
subtle twists and turns, the absorbing ironies of a great 
philosophical-psychological drama. 
</P>
<P>
A Brahmin Hindu from a civil servant's family, the 16-year-old K. and his 
younger brother were spotted near the Ganges one day by a pan-religious British 
group called the Theosophists, who immediately recruited him as the potential 
next World Teacher, in the Christ-Buddha line. He was brought to England, 
sheltered, shown off, educated, indoctrinated. Meanwhile, his little brother, 
left behind on a tour in San Francisco, died alone: a loss that shattered him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, after Krishnamurti had assumed the leadership of the order of the 
Star, he announced that he was dissolving it. Apparently, he renounced his own 
destiny, resigned as World Teacher -- while then embarking on the same path, 
teaching around the world, which his patrons had mapped out for him. His creed 
preached the renunciation of all creeds, the abandonment of preconceptions, 
mistrust of potential messiahs. He died in 1986; his admirers apparently 
included such crusty skeptics as Bernard Shaw, Henry Miller and novelist Howard 
Fast -- interviewed in this movie. 
</P>
<P>
This is a clearly a great story, rife with possibilities for barbed social 
satire, and psychological revelation, but after the first half of 
"Krishnamurti," Mendizza and Blau don't follow it up. The last 47 years of 
Krishnamurti's life are never examined in depth. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, unfortunately, is his philosophy. We learn, vaguely, that he advocates 
emptying the mind; wise-crackers will see empty minds behind the entire 
project. They're wrong, but we'd like to know what happened to K. afterwards, 
how he detached himself from the group and how the Krishnamurti Foundation -- 
which publishes his writings, distributes his tapes and, not coincidentally, 
produced this movie -- was formed. What happened to K.'s old patroness, Annie 
Besant? What happened to the Order of the Star? 
</P>
<P>
Those are subjects other movies, unfortunately. What we see here certainly 
piques the interest, but it doesn't fully satisfy either the mind or soul. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's something admirable about a film that so completely disproves 
the old adage about the difference between European and American films. 
European films, it is said, begin with a shot of clouds, then dissolve to 
clouds, then dissolve to more clouds. American movies begin with clouds, then 
cut to an airplane, and finally cut to the plane exploding. In "Krishnamurti: 
With a Silent Mind" (Times-rated: Family), Mendizza and Blau start us off with 
more clouds than even a Swedish pastoralist or Japanese Buddhist director like 
Yasujiro Ozu would have dared.

'COOK': GROSSNESS FROM GREAT TALENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever pretentious filmmakers want to defend their excesses on the screen, 
they invariably cite Shakespeare or -- better yet -- lurid Jacobean tragedy as 
a whole. That's where England's Peter Greenaway found his alibi for the 
repulsive "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover" (selected theaters). 
</P>
<P>
"Jacobean drama was excited by sheer corporeality," Greenaway is quoted in the 
film's attending publicity. "It took high risks with taboo, melodrama, violence 
and sexual darkness. I wanted to engage in some of the excitements of 
unrestricted license." 
</P>
<P>
Unrestricted license, yes. Excitement, no. Greenaway's "Cook" is full of gross 
behavior and jolting images, but its effect is not engaging, and since the film 
is only occasionally amusing, it is not even cathartic. Miramax, the film's 
American distributor, has refused the MPAA's X rating (the ratings board 
reportedly said they wouldn't know where to suggest cutting it), and the film 
is being released unrated. 
</P>
<P>
The film doesn't even justify itself on intellectual grounds. It is pointless 
self-indulgence, more likely to bore sophisticated audiences than shock or 
titillate them. If Greenaway, the coldly brilliant maker of "The Draughtsman's 
Contract," was exorcising some personal demons in making this film, good 
riddance to some very bad demons. But audiences should know going in that 
they're going to be sharing pain, not pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The film is deliberately theatrical, to the extent of opening and closing with 
a proscenium curtain. The principal setting is an immense, posh, four-star 
restaurant decorated in lush period formality in dark blood red and dominated 
by a copy of Frans Hals' 1614 painting "Banquet of the Officers of the St. 
George Civic Guard." The officers' uniforms in turn have inspired the outfits 
of the restaurant's most regular customers, the Thief (Michael Gambon) and his 
henchman. 
</P>
<P>
At least Greenaway lets us know what we're in for as soon as he draws aside the 
curtain to reveal a couple of trucks filled with garbage flanking the 
restaurant's entrance -- and attracting a pack of howling dogs. An unfortunate 
man in debt to the Thief has been stripped and smeared with excrement; as a 
final touch, the Thief urinates on him before proceeding into the restaurant 
for an evening of serious gluttony. (Had enough? The last reel introduces 
cannibalism.) 
</P>
<P>
Sadist, bully and boor, the Thief revels in endless talk about bodily functions 
at the top of his voice and in physically abusing his companions. Soon, his 
browbeaten Wife (Helen Mirren, working nude or in her knickers throughout most 
of the film) becomes attracted to a pleasant-looking man (Alan Howard) dining 
alone with his stack of books. He becomes her Lover and, between courses, the 
couple slip off to the restroom or the kitchen, where the Wife shows as grand 
an appetite for sex as the Thief has for food. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Wife and her Lover are discovered and, with the Thief and his 
thugs in pursuit, they go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
What is the symbolism of all this gluttony, and what does its Grand Guignol 
consequences tell us about human nature that we do not already know? Greenaway 
has said that his film can be seen as "a morality tale about greed" and that he 
has "tried very hard with this film to make the violence solid and serious and 
adult so that it cannot be avoided" in comparison to the "deodorized and 
sanitized" violence of most movies. 
</P>
<P>
Yet how puny are Greenaway's grotesque, patently fake tableaux in comparison to 
the horrors chronicled in countless Holocaust documentaries. So much balderdash 
in defense of so much balderdash. 
</P>
<P>
What is disturbing about the film is not what we hear or see but rather that it 
is so clearly the work of an important and original talent performed 
masterfully by a first-rate cast and realized by such greatly gifted 
contributors as cinematographer Sacha Vierny, production designers Ben Van Os 
and Jan Roelfs, costume designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and composer Michael Nyman 
(whose weirdly insistent score is a match for Vierny's ominous images). 
</P>
<P>
Greenaway is a man of distinctive ideas and insights who this time out has 
expended his abilities and perceptions -- and those of many others -- on an 
exercise in grossness that depresses rather than enlarges the human spirit. 
"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover" (Times-rated mature) is 
sensational, all right, but hardly entertaining.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Two light but enjoyable films from last year lead off the selections: 
</P>
<P>
"Look Who's Talking" (RCA/Columbia, priced for rental, PG-13) has such a great 
premise -- the audience hears a baby's thoughts -- it's amazing that there 
haven't been a half-dozen films like it already. Directed by Amy Heckerling, 
the surprise megahit ($130 million at the box office) revived the career of 
John Travolta and also stars Kirstie Alley, Olympia Dukakis and the voice of 
Bruce Willis as the precocious infant. 
</P>
<P>
"Shirley Valentine" (Paramount, priced for rental, R) got veteran British 
actress Pauline Collins an Oscar nomination in the role for which she'd already 
won a Tony. The film version of the play features the perky performer as an 
English housewife whose Greek vacation brings her more than she bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
Also from '89 theatrical runs: 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny Handsome" (IVE, $89.95, R), a Walter Hill film with Mickey Rourke as a 
petty criminal with a new face but the same old nasty attitude; "Cold Feet" 
(IVE, $89.95, R), an offbeat comedy with Keith Carradine, Sally Kirkland and 
Tom Waits. 
</P>
<P>
And for fans of '50s black-and-white B-movies, Republic has these three 
new-to-tape examples for $19.98 each: "Hoodlum Empire" (1952), starring Brian 
Donlevy and Clair Trevor, directed by Joseph Kane; "When Gangland Strikes" 
(1956), starring Raymond Greenlead, directed by R. G. Springsteen; and "The 
Finger Man" (1955) with Frank Lovejoy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Remember that plaintive cry from early '60s TV -- "Car 54, Where Are You?" If 
you have cable, you're probably already sick of the reruns on Nickelodeon. If 
not, you might grateful that Republic has just released four volumes of the 
sitcom about silly cops, starring Fred Gwynne (later wasted in "The Munsters" 
but great here) and Joe E. Ross (even -- oo! oo! -- greater). Each volume has 
two episodes and is priced at $14.98. TERRY ATKINSON

'CARBON': A MOVING HISTORY OF OLD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lothar Baumgarten's "Carbon" works on the memory in subtle and surprising ways. 
The installation, composed chiefly of bars of color and typographically crisp 
words affixed to the walls, is immensely sophisticated. That such spare means 
could be so quietly moving is an indication of the artist's considerable 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"Carbon," which is installed in two adjacent rooms of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, is a work of cultural anthropology given powerful visual 
form. In 1976 and 1989, the West German artist spent several months traveling 
the United States by rail and residing on several Indian reservations. Around 
the gallery walls Baumgarten has mapped two overlapping histories: The network 
of railroads integral to the settling of the American West and the homes of the 
indigenous tribes who were displaced, imprisoned or eradicated in the face of 
what was claimed, with God-and-country fervor, to be Manifest Destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Names of 66 Indian tribes are inscribed on the walls, their placement 
geographically keyed to the East/West axis of the two galleries -- Oneida, 
Seneca, Mohawk, etc., are in the "East"; Teton, Apache, Cheyenne, etc., occupy 
the "West." Relative scale of the print varies from name to name, a visual 
device that clearly seems meant to indicate the relative sizes of the tribes. 
Baumgarten chose Monotype Grotesk as the typographical style for the printed 
names. The word, Monotype, suggests the collapsing of distinctly different 
groups into a single species ("the" Indians), while Grotesk describes a 
traditional kind of art in which the forms of persons are radically distorted. 
For the subject, this pointedly chosen style is more than apt. 
</P>
<P>
The tribal names have been printed upside down, an effective yet devastatingly 
simple means for making your eye momentarily stumble over their reading. 
Prevented from sliding easily through a litany of familiar names -- Iroquois, 
Iowa, Osage -- the mind haltingly reconstructs the displaced groups of letters 
into sounds, then syllables, and finally coherent words. As it rolls around 
your tongue taking expressive form, each name a sharp and distinctive entity, 
the abstraction of language becomes oddly tangible and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgarten's process of mapping names is unobtrusive and subversive. In an 
effort to mark cultural diversity, English, the unifying language of North 
American conquest, is subtly undone. The repressed fact that virtually no part 
of the world can claim as many distinctly different native languages as the 
Western Hemisphere is made startlingly perceptible. 
</P>
<P>
The second principal language Baumgarten employs for "Carbon" is an abstract 
system of bars, curves and crosses, which are cut from colored paper and pasted 
to the walls. Reminiscent of nothing so much as the abstract paintings of 
Kasimir Malevich and Russian suprematism in the '10s and '20s -- an art long 
claimed as the first truly modern language of industrial culture -- these 
material forms are arrayed to shape a physical, environmental map of American 
railroads in relation to the displaced names of Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
(At the door to the larger gallery is a revealing chart of railroad companies 
the artist logged during his travels: the Marinette Tomahawk &amp; Western, the 
Nezperce, the Monongahela and many more.) The shapes rhythmically traverse the 
rooms, converging, dispersing, paralleling, intersecting, connecting. Unlike 
the words, these tracking shapes have no right side up; therefore, they cannot 
be displaced. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgarten's deft ability to stir up dense, sedimentary layers of thought is 
typified by the installation's title. "Carbon" poetically evokes organic 
substance created over centuries by geological pressure, while also suggesting 
the harnessing of industrial power, as manifest specifically by the locomotive. 
It even puts you in mind of carbon-14 dating, the high-tech method for tracking 
obscured points in human history and prehistoric time. As each layer ricochets 
off the others, the museum's galleries become resonant echo chambers in which 
the present resounds off the past. 
</P>
<P>
In this way, the native cultures of North America -- typically trivialized, 
deformed, forgotten, eradicated, obscured -- regain complex power as peoples 
viscerally remembered. Baumgarten italicizes the museum as mausoleum, a 
socially consecrated place in which the lost bodies of our ancestors profoundly 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgarten's work, being shown in Los Angeles for the first time, is informed 
by the legacy of conceptual art of the last 20 years. His most apparent debt, 
as with so many German artists of his generation, is to the trenchant work of 
the late Joseph Beuys, with whom he studied in Dusseldorf from 1968 to 1971. 
And once again the specific confluence of language and mapping in his work 
suggests the important precedent of Jasper Johns to European conceptual art, a 
precedent very apparent last year at MOCA in the retrospective of Belgium's 
Marcel Broodthaers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Baumgarten's birth in Germany in 1944 seems an equally important bit of 
data. For the particular elements deployed in "Carbon" cannot help but recall 
the three genocidal holocausts of the modern era -- one in Hitler's Germany, 
one in Stalin's Russia, one in 19th-Century America. That the first two are the 
subject of varying degrees of public scrutiny while the third remains almost 
completely repressed only serves to make this exceptional installation all the 
more momentous. 
</P>

Through June 17 at the Museum of Contemporary art, 250 S. Grand Ave. (213) 
621-2766.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'SHANNON' GETS A RAW DEAL IN JOURNEY FROM PILOT TO SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
Flashback: 
</P>
<P>
 The NBC movie "Shannon's Deal" airs June 4, 1989. It gets the highest Nielsen 
ratings in its time slot. What's more, it finishes in the Nielsen Top 10. As a 
bonus, the critics love it too. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder, for "Shannon's Deal" is one terrific zinger, an excellently 
made, distinctively crafted, mostly cream-of-the-crop series pilot that 
introduces one of the more interesting and appealing TV characters to come 
along in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Shannon is a divorced, disenchanted Philadelphia lawyer who once made big 
money helping corporate polluters finesse environmental groups, but is now so 
much in debt from gambling that he's stalked by a loan collector and has to 
borrow $10 from his precocious 12-year-old daughter to take her to lunch. He 
takes public transportation. He has a smoky office in a crummy building 
inhabited by a subculture of professional low-lifes. He's a flawed hero who 
cuts corners and makes deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a good man," his new secretary tells him. "No," he replies, running 
his hand through his thick unruly hair. "But I'm a good lawyer . . . at least I 
used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that interestingly off-center filmmaker John Sayles ("Eight Men Out," 
"Return of the Secaucus Seven," "The Brother From Another Planet," "Matewan") 
who has created "Shannon's Deal" and written the script interlaced with 
poker-playing metaphors. It's director Lewis Teague who has guided the 
characters through this fascinatingly underlit, grainy haze. It's Wynton 
Marsalis who has provided the simple score that gives musical resonance to the 
story's moody urban tone. 
</P>
<P>
 And certainly not least, Shannon has been given a continuously charming 
presence by Jamey Sheridan, an actor whose rugged, furry browed 
street-fighter's face belies his easy way with his character's bemused humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Swell cast. Swell movie. Swell ratings. Swell ending to story, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancel the flashback. We're now in the present, with last year's "Shannon's 
Deal" pilot rerunning tonight at 9 on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39) in advance of 
Monday's 10 p.m. premiere of "Shannon's Deal" the series, a six-episode trial 
whose opener is shockingly unlike the admirable movie that spawned it. A 
leopard has given birth to a cocker spaniel. 
</P>
<P>
Those choosing to watch both tonight's and Monday's programs will see a 
textbook example of a pilot being unrepresentative of the series it precedes. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Sheridan (in a goofy new yuppiesque hairstyle) remains as Shannon in this 
utterly artless, sanded-down premiere written by Sayles, who is supplying two 
of six scripts. But most everything else that made the pilot special has been 
diminished, if not eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that "Shannon's Deal" is now undistinguishable from the rest of 
TV. That intriguingly dark, brooding tone is gone, erased by simpleton 
brightness in an hour so overlit that you almost need sunglasses to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, there is no mystery or edge Monday, only rosy comfortableness 
throughout a played-for-laughs hour in which Shannon reluctantly takes the case 
of a young country songwriter (Michelle Joyner) who claims one of her tunes has 
been ripped off by a shady recording firm. The romance between Shannon and this 
grating gee-whiz of a hillbilly is never convincing, nor is there any logic to 
her hickishly stereotyped Tennessean ex-husband (played by Sayles) being able 
to repeatedly locate Shannon in the big city and harass him. Meanwhile, 
real-life singers David Crosby and Tanya Tucker also have cameo roles. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the premiere soften Shannon, it also mostly squanders two of the 
pilot's best and most-amusing supporting characters. One, a comic shyster 
lawyer played by Martin Ferrero, surfaces all right, but far too broadly. Even 
worse is the inexplicable near-omission of Shannon's secretary Lucy, played so 
engagingly by Elizabeth Pena in the pilot. Better more of Pena than 
manufactured time for David Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Good as it was, the pilot could have been better. Its now-outdated plot -- 
ensnaring Shannon in a conspiracy involving right-wingers, drugs and arms to 
the Contras -- got ever thinner as it neared conclusion. At all times, however, 
the pilot held your interest, ending on an unconventional note that showed 
Shannon to be more pragmatist than idealist. 
</P>
<P>
If not downbeat, this was at least refreshingly middlebeat, in contrast to 
Monday's standard upbeat conclusion offering triumph, closure and 
predictability. Now that's the old-fashioned television we've come to expect.

'A TUDOR EVENING' TONIGHT ON PBS DANCE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The early ballets of Antony Tudor were created for a stage scarcely 18-feet 
square -- which can make them problematic in an opera house but nearly ideal 
for television. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, "A Tudor Evening with American Ballet Theatre" proves far from 
ideal, largely because TV director Thomas Grimm consistently disfigures the 
choreography with clumsy and intrusive camera work. 
</P>
<P>
This studio-taped, hourlong "Dance in America" telecast airs tonight on PBS (at 
9 on Channel 15; at 9:30 on Channel 28; at 10 on Channel 24; also Sunday at 10 
p.m. on Channel 50). 
</P>
<P>
Early in Tudor's "Jardin aux Lilas," the distraught bride-to-be (Leslie Browne) 
has a solo. It lasts less than 75 seconds, yet Grimm switches camera position 
eight times. The result makes no sense whatever as dancing. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, when Browne danced the same solo five years ago for "American 
Ballet Theatre in San Francisco" (a program released on Home Vision and 
sometimes shown on cable), there were no changes of viewpoint; the camera 
simply followed the dancing and allowed it to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he's not chopping "Jardin" and "Dark Elegies" into video hash, Grimm 
is so blind to the movement design of these familiar '30s classics that he 
blunts their compositions and flow of images. That takes the emphasis off Tudor 
in "A Tudor Evening" and places it on the fine Ballet Theatre principals -- 
most of them seen in these same roles during the company's recent engagement at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Browne proves less vulnerable in this "Jardin" than in the San Francisco 
performance, but she understands Tudor's style and, as always, her partnership 
with Ricardo Bustamante (the lover) is electric. As the other woman, Martine 
van Hamel dances capably, but the photos of Tudor himself as the husband-to-be 
-- seen during the documentary portions of the telecast -- suggest a much more 
compelling figure than Michael Owen manages to portray. 
</P>
<P>
Browne, Van Hamel and Owen return for "Dark Elegies," with Johan Renvall, 
Kathleen Moore and Danilo Radojevic in the other major roles. They give solid, 
committed performances and if they looked very far away on the large Costa Mesa 
stage, the intimacy of television brings them very close indeed. If only TV 
artists of equal sensitivity had been involved in this project.LEWIS SEGAL

PIANO WORKS BY WUORINEN, RAVEL, BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Romantic late-19th Century Lisztian rhetoric and abrasive late 20th-Century 
motorism make an odd pairing. But the combination worked convincingly when Alan 
Feinberg played at the Arnold Schoenberg Institute on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The American pianist, making his third appearance at the USC facility, offered 
Charles Wuorinen's complex, belligerently atonal and hyperactive Third Sonata 
(1986) to end his recital, then immediately followed it with an encore in Mrs. 
H.H.A. (Amy) Beach's "Dreaming," a Schumannesque nocturne of stunning beauties 
and virtuosic bent, written in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
Feinberg's versatility, already proven in the earlier part of this program -- 
when he played three pieces by Ravel, surrounded by works of George Edwards, 
Robert Helps and Iannis Xenakis -- made this juxtaposition seem natural. He 
gave each composer his/her due, made the appropriate stylistic differentiations 
and delivered each musical dialect in the right accent. 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen's sonata, written for Feinberg -- and which the pianist described as 
"a little bit of New York . . . 20 different people speaking 20 different 
languages, all rushing to get in the subway" -- is a construct of nervous 
hostility, in its outer movements a perpetual motion of urban dissonance. Mrs. 
Beach's ballade-like Opus 15, No. 3, deals in an earlier sophistication, but 
one ostensibly foreign to Wuorinen's. The two composers share only their 
earnest Americanness. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based pianist made the most of his opportunities here, as well as 
in Edwards' provocative "Suave Mari Magno," which Feinberg translated as "Over 
Calm Seas." He also gave satisfying attention to Helps' "Trois Hommages" and to 
Xenakis' brief, disturbing and delightful "Hommage a Ravel." 
</P>
<P>
His playing of the French composer's "Menuet Antique" Prelude (1913) and 
"Ondine" suffered only from a lack of the coloristic variety that another piano 
might have been able to provide. It is time the Schoenberg Institute got 
another keyboard instrument, preferably one with another brand name.

CURTAIN ALSO RISES ON AMATEURS;

ACTING WORKSHOP STUDENTS TAKE CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The difference between the Saturday Matinee Players Showcase and most other Los 
Angeles acting classes becomes apparent during the coffee breaks. 
</P>
<P>
At most classes that's a time when the conversation naturally turns to upcoming 
auditions, agents and roles, both won and lost. At this workshop, which meets 
at a former child-care center in Granada Hills, the chatter is far less 
desperate. After all, most of those enrolled here already have secure, 
successful careers -- but not, with one exception, in acting. 
</P>
<P>
"For the people who take my classes for non-professional actors, acting is a 
hobby," said the teacher, Susan Lehman, 38, an actress whose career has ranged 
from Glad bag commercials to Broadway. "And for some of them, it turns into a 
serious hobby." 
</P>
<P>
So serious that they are willing to go one giant step further than the private, 
safe confines of a workshop. On May 12, after seven weeks of instruction, 
coaching and rehearsals, the nurse, lawyer, psychologist, radar engineer, 
insurance saleswoman, property manager and others in the workshop will present 
a performance of scenes at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
They will be performing for friends and relatives -- the actors sell the $5 
tickets to those they want to invite, and the proceeds go to charities the 
group chooses. Previous workshops have given the funds to the Shanti 
Foundation, American Cancer Society, Big Sister and the Wildlife Waystation. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how friendly the audience, the experience of performing in public 
is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
"I would go to plays and think that it has to be either an exhilarating or 
terrible experience to be up there," said Stephen Oxford, 36, a radar engineer 
at Hughes Aircraft who has never performed on stage. "I always wondered how it 
would feel. I guess I'll soon know," he added with a nervous laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Oxford was intensely looking over a short play, "The Unexpurgated Life of 
Bernard Mergendeiler," by Jules Feiffer that Lehman had given him to work on 
with Terry Kane, 31, a registered nurse. After a group meeting at the beginning 
of each workshop session, the students go off into separate rooms to rehearse 
scenes Lehman assigns to them for practice. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning progresses, Lehman calls them into the living room so that she 
can hear their scene and coach them. 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Boumeester, 39, who sells life and health insurance for an agency in 
Pasadena, was sitting with her scene partner, Ann Sundin White, a property 
manager, in what used to be a playroom at the child-care center. In one corner 
of the almost empty room was a rocking horse and an alphabet chart on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Boumeester first enrolled in the workshop in 1986 -- this is her fourth time 
through. "I love it," she said with a mixture of gusto and awe. "The first time 
I finished a scene and came off the stage my first thought was, 'I don't care 
if anybody liked it, it worked for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"I actually think they did like it," she continued with a giggle, "but that's 
not what mattered. My lines were right, the feelings I had up there were right 
and the feeling when I was done was just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that she was having a good time working on scenes from John 
Guare's "House of Blue Leaves" and Lanford Wilson's "Ludlow Fair," both of 
which she did in a Brooklyn accent. 
</P>
<P>
"Naomi would rob a bank, if she could be sure the video cameras would be on," 
Lehman said later with affection. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, who appeared on Broadway in the short-lived "The Goodbye People" and on 
television in "General Hospital," "Days of Our Lives," last year's "Robert 
Guillaume Show" and several made for television movies, primarily earns her 
living through teaching. Indeed, she has developed a cottage industry out of 
teaching acting techniques to non-professional actors. Her classes include some 
that give people just a taste of the acting process and others that encourage 
them to apply those tools to their everyday lives. One of her courses is 
called, "Career Power Through Acting Techniques." 
</P>
<P>
She started the Saturday Matinee Players Showcase in 1986 for her 
non-professional acting students who wanted to go further than improvisation 
games and exercises. The students pay $175 for the seven-session showcase 
course that is entirely geared toward scene work. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my people become total acting junkies," Lehman said. "I call it a 
life-threatening hobby." 
</P>
<P>
The threatening aspect of getting up on stage before an audience is exactly 
what appeals to some members of the workshop. "It deals with anxieties and 
fears that are difficult for me," said Craig Childress, 35, a psychologist 
involved in schizophrenia research at UCLA. "So I am throwing myself into a 
situation that is anxious and fearful so I can work on that." 
</P>
<P>
Childress and Terry Markwell were outside on the front walk, competing against 
traffic, jet and lawn mower noise to read through a scene from Michael Weller's 
"At Home." Markwell is the only career actress in the group. She recently 
returned to Los Angeles after filming several episodes of the revived "Mission 
Impossible" in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was part of the regular team on the show," she said, "until they killed me 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Markwell said she was taking the workshop because she enjoyed working with 
Lehman and because the idea of putting on a show by non-professionals with the 
proceeds going to charity appealed to her. She helped some of the students 
through their anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
White, a soft-spoken woman who was working on "Ludlow Fair" with Boumeester, 
said she had previously challenged herself to be more assertive in public by 
joining a public-speaking club. The acting workshop, White said, carries that 
assertiveness into her more private life. 
</P>
<P>
"I got married a little over a year ago," she said, "and since I met my new 
husband it seemed that all of my interests were eclipsed by his. I tried to get 
into the things that he likes -- golf and what have you. But I was getting a 
little resentful. I wanted to do something just for myself." 
</P>
<P>
The results, so far, have been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"He has really encouraged me," White said. "If we both have things that we can 
do, separately, it makes it so much better when we are together." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the students in the workshop consider acting just a hobby, no 
matter how "life threatening," a few have been so seriously bitten by the bug 
that they are interested in going a step further. 
</P>
<P>
Kane has quit her full-time job in a hospital to work free-lance through a 
nursing agency. This is to give her more time and a flexible schedule for 
acting classes and eventually, she hopes, roles. Vicki Roth, a bookkeeper at 
Beverly Hills Escrow, is looking for an agent for commercial representation as 
she continues with classes. And not surprisingly, Boumeester has thought about 
going professional. 
</P>
<P>
"Toward the end of last year I actually ventured out and auditioned for a 
national commercial and for a community theater role, neither of which I got," 
she said. "But just the experience of putting myself out there and taking that 
kind of risk was so wonderful that I might do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Would she consider a career in acting? 
</P>
<P>
"I like my job and the security a lot, don't get me wrong," Boumeester said 
with a laugh. "I'm basically a conservative person with a flamboyant side to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"But would I drop everything if I thought I could make a living at acting? The 
answer is: in a second." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Lehman's acting classes for non-professionals are scheduled throughout 
the year. For more information, call (818) 705-0654.

TIMES' JIM MURRAY WINS PULITZER FOR COMMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jim Murray, veteran sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, won the 
Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary on Thursday, while in a rare 
action, twin gold medals for public service were given to the Philadelphia 
Inquirer and to the Washington (N.C.) Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
August Wilson, one of the nation's leading black playwrights and a previous 
Pulitzer recipient, won the drama award for his play "The Piano Lesson." In the 
fiction category, Oscar Hijuelos received the Pulitzer Prize for his book "The 
Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love," edging out E.L. Doctorow"s book "Billy 
Bathgate." 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize for distinguished musical composition was awarded to Mel 
Powell for "Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra," which had its 
premiere in January by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Powell, a native New 
Yorker, has been a resident of Los Angeles for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
He heads the composition faculty at California Institute of the Arts and is 
holder of the Roy E. Disney chair in musical composition. 
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer won its medal for reporting by Gilbert M. Gaul, disclosing how the 
American blood industry runs with little governmental regulation or 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington (N.C.) Daily News received its public service Pulitzer for 
revealing that its city's water supply was contaminated with carcinogens, a 
problem that local government had neither disclosed nor corrected over a period 
of eight years. It was the first time in 23 years that two public service gold 
medals were given. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, 70, who has been named America's best sports writer 14 times by the 
National Assn. of Sportscasters and Sportswriters, received his first Pulitzer 
Prize. He began his career with the Los Angeles Times in 1961 after serving as 
West Coast editor for Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Academy Award of our business. It's something you don't even think 
about," he said. "I never thought I would get a Pulitzer Prize. . . . I always 
thought you had to bring down a government or expose major graft or give advice 
to prime ministers. Correctly quoting Tommy Lasorda shouldn't merit a Pulitzer 
Prize. I never really expected it. I am very pleased and happy to have won it." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Columbia University awarded 15 prizes in journalism and seven in 
the arts. Each award carried with it a $3,000 prize, except the award for 
public service in journalism, which is a gold medal. The Pulitzer Prize Board, 
often criticized in previous years for giving a disproportionate share of 
awards to Eastern newspapers, gave 7 of the journalism awards this year to 
Western newspapers. Coverage of two major disasters -- the San Francisco Bay 
Area earthquake and the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill -- earned three 
Pulitzers. 
</P>
<P>
The entire staff of the San Jose Mercury News won the general news reporting 
prize for its work on the quake and its aftermath, while the Oakland Tribune 
won the spot news photography prize for its quake pictures -- including the 
photograph at right taken by Michael Macor of rescuers removing a victim from 
the rubble of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times won the national reporting prize for its coverage of the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill and its aftermath. Reporters cited were Ross Anderson, 
Bill Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn and Eric Nalder. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn of the New York Times, a husband-and-wife 
team, won the international reporting prize for the paper's coverage of China's 
mass movement toward democracy last spring and the subsequent repression. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Kilzer and Chris Ison of the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis won the 
investigative reporting prize for exposing a network of local citizens and 
members of the St. Paul Fire Department who profited from fires, including some 
described by the fire department as being of suspicious origin. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Vise and Steve Coll of the Washington Post won the explanatory 
journalism prize for stories scrutinizing the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the way it had been affected by its former chairman, John S. R. 
Shad. 
</P>
<P>
The specialized reporting prize went to Tamar Stieber of the Albuquerque 
Journal. The Pulitzer board cited her for "persistent reporting" in linking a 
rare blood disorder to the over-the-counter dietary supplement L-tryptophan. 
The articles were followed by a national recall of the product. 
</P>
<P>
Also nominated as a finalist in the category was Claire Spiegel of the Los 
Angeles Times for investigation of mismanagement and abuses at the Martin 
Luther King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. Her stories led to reforms at 
the hospital. The other finalist was Jim Dwyer of New York Newsday for his 
coverage of the New York City subway system. 
</P>
<P>
The feature writing prize was given to Dave Curtin of the Colorado Springs 
Gazette Telegraph for what the Pulitzer jurors called "a gripping account of a 
family's struggle to recover after its members were severely burned in an 
explosion at their home." 
</P>
<P>
David C. Turnley of the Detroit Free Press won the feature photography prize 
for photographs of the political uprisings in China and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism prize was given to Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle for 
his articles on architecture, while Thomas J. Hylton of 
</P>
<P>
the Pottstown (Pa.) Mercury won for editorials about a local bond issue for the 
preservation of farmland and other open spaces in rural Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Toles of the Buffalo News won the editorial cartooning prize for a year's 
work, exemplified by a cartoon about the First Amendment. The cartoon pictured 
the White House and Capitol with language citing various threats to the 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction was given to Dale Maharidge and Michael 
Williamson for their work "And Their Children After Them." The book explores 
the lives of 128 descendants of Alabama sharecroppers portrayed by writer James 
Agee and photographer Walker Evans in a book they collaborated on in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Maharidge is a reporter for the Sacramento Bee and Williamson is a photographer 
for the same newspaper. They are collaborating on another book about hobos who 
ride the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian de Grazia, author of "Machiavelli in Hell," won the prize for 
biography, and the history prize went to Stanley Karnow for "In Our Image: 
America's Empire in the Philippines." A professor of political philosophy at 
Rutgers University in New Jersey, De Grazia also has worked as a director of 
research at the Twentieth Century Fund. A veteran journalist, Karnow has worked 
for Time magazine, the Washington Post and the New Republic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The prize for poetry went to Charles Simic for "The World Doesn't End," his 
12th volume of poems. Simic, born in Yugoslavia, was awarded a prestigious 
MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1983. His poems have been translated into 11 
languages and have appeared in magazines including the New Yorker, The Nation, 
Esquire, the Atlantic and the Paris Review. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the winner of the drama prize, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize 
for drama in 1987 for his play "Fences," the story of a black ballplayer and 
his relationship with his son. 
</P>
<P>
His latest play, "The Piano Lesson," which opens on Broadway on Monday, deals 
with a brother and sister at loggerheads over what to do with the ancestral 
piano they jointly own. 
</P>
<P>
In her review when "The Piano Lesson" played at the James A. Doolittle Theater, 
Times theater writer Sylvie Drake praised the production as "not a play you 
just watch." 
</P>
<P>
"It insists that you listen to it and listen carefully," Drake wrote. "It is 
filled with subplot -- rich tangential stories that flow freely into the main 
current, nurturing ancient cultural and metaphysical roots." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's latest play topped two other finalists in the drama category -- Maria 
Irene Fornes' "And What of the Night?" and "Love Letters" by A.R. Gurney. 
</P>
<P>
Hijuelos' winning, street-smart work of fiction "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of 
Love," is largely set in New York City in the early 1950s and is the story of 
the immigrant experience, of lost opportunities and hopes. It is a colorfully 
written story of two brothers who realize a lifelong dream of playing in Ricky 
Ricardo's band on the "I Love Lucy" show. But the experience proves to be a 
fleeting moment of triumph, and the book chronicles their growing 
disillusionment and unhappiness back in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the awards set off celebrations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town since the Union 
cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main Street in 1862, 
and there's been nothing like that since," said Bill Coughlin, the Washington 
Daily News' executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
They broke out the champagne at the Philadelphia Inquirer after the paper won 
it's Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. It is a terrific honor," said reporter Gaul. "The paper showed 
an incredible amount of courage to allow me to spend a year and a half on the 
story and to report on a subject that is of great importance to everyone that 
we don't often think about -- blood." 
</P>
<P>
Gaul, 38, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 
1979. The blood series, which found that the industry is little regulated, was 
inspired by his questions about what happened to the blood he donated four 
times a year.

$20,000 PAY HIKES QUIETLY OKD FOR COUNCIL DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Constrained by law from granting themselves large pay raises, Los Angeles City 
Council members have quietly authorized new rates that could boost salaries for 
their top staff members by $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the raises are necessary to keep top aides from leaving 
city government. 
</P>
<P>
The pay rates, approved unanimously two weeks ago, were buried in the arcane 
language of a routine personnel ordinance covering 26 city departments. The 
rates apply to two categories of council deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agenda contained no hint of the raise, and the ordinance was 
passed without debate on March 30. Mayor Tom Bradley signed it into law five 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their unity on the matter, several council members interviewed Thursday 
said they are less than happy with the action, because it means their top 
deputies could earn as much as $76,463 a year -- $15,000 more than council 
members get. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to pay anybody in my office more than I'm getting," said Council 
President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to individual council members whether to authorize the raises for 
specific deputies. There was no immediate indication Thursday whether any 
planned to grant the raises. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is especially delicate now as City Council members are seeking voter 
approval for a June 5 ballot measure that would raise their own pay of $61,522 
by 40% to $86,157. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise is tied to a broad ethics-in-government measure, and some council 
members have predicted that voter opposition to the raise is likely to bring 
about the defeat of the entire package. 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval is needed for council pay raises that exceed 5% a year. However, 
the council has the authority to set the pay levels of its staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest staff raise was approved, the top pay allowed for a chief 
deputy was $56,125. Clerks, secretaries and other lower-ranking aides make 
substantially less. 
</P>
<P>
The money is paid from the $667,658 office budget allocated to each of 14 City 
Council offices. The council president's office, which has extra 
responsibilities, gets $705,513. 
</P>
<P>
The council has not allocated additional money to pay for staff pay hikes 
allowed under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"All this ordinance does is give them the ability, within their budgets, to pay 
their people more if they want to," said William McCarley, the council's chief 
legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of the staff raise proposal remained murky Thursday. McCarley, whose 
office drew up the ordinance, said he could not recall who gave the 
instructions to draft it. "It was kind of one of those things that just 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the idea has surfaced periodically and has been discussed 
informally for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact that a lot of good people leave because we don't have the 
capacity to pay them what they can earn in the private sector," said Councilman 
Hal Bernson, who says he lost a valued deputy to private industry several 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were limited by budget reasons what we could pay him," Bernson said. "We 
offered to raise him to the highest level we could, and it still wasn't 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he does not mind paying a subordinate more than he is paid. He 
said other council members are willing to do the same if it means keeping key 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We need qualified people in order to do our jobs," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his own chief deputy has requested a raise, Bernson said, "I would 
imagine he will." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said, "We want for our offices the very best 
that we can get, and it's important to have continuity as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to make more than my deputy, but I don't feel that I should hold them 
back," Flores said. "Frankly, I probably won't use it because I have such a 
large staff and I try to treat everybody fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said that her staff of 18 in five offices already has overextended her 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really stretched and many of my employees are underpaid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus said she recognizes the problem but has some difficulty 
accepting the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has been that it's hard to hire chief deputies," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
But is she willing to pay someone on her own staff more than she makes? "I 
don't love that idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council staff members apparently have not rushed to request pay raises. 
Four top deputies interviewed Thursday said they were unaware that they are 
even eligible for the raises. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really news to me," said Greg Nelson, chief deputy to Councilman Joel 
Wachs. "I usually know just about everything that happens around here, and this 
is a surprise."

U.S. 'LECTURES' NOT NECESSARY, GORBACHEV SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, baring his frustration at U.S. reaction 
to the Lithuania crisis, said Thursday that Americans should stop giving him 
"lectures" that could imperil achievements in superpower relations made since 
he came to power. 
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting Democratic senators, Gorbachev tried to shift the focus 
of U.S.-Soviet relations away from their current fixation on the Kremlin's 
treatment of the breakaway Baltic republic. He stressed that he is determined 
to initial the framework for an accord to halve strategic nuclear arsenals at 
his summit meeting with President Bush in Washington, scheduled to begin May 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he is ready to make concessions to close a deal on the draft of 
a strategic arms pact by then, but he added that he expects the President also 
to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Lithuania overshadowed three days of talks held in Washington 
last week between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to lay groundwork for the summit, the second 
between Bush and Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has been at odds with the republic since it unilaterally declared 
independence a month ago, a decision that Gorbachev and the Soviet Congress of 
People's Deputies have said is illegal and invalid. 
</P>
<P>
After his meetings with Shevardnadze, Baker told reporters he made clear that a 
Soviet military crackdown in Lithuania would jeopardize the entire gamut of 
improved superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said his seven-member 
delegation told Gorbachev much the same thing, face to face. 
</P>
<P>
"A reversal would undoubtedly occur should the Soviet Union resort to force," 
the Maine Democrat told a news conference after the meeting with Gorbachev, 
which lasted more than two hours. "Such action would, I advised President 
Gorbachev, have grave consequences for relations between our two countries." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks reported by the official Tass news agency, Gorbachev again said he 
did not wish to use force to impose the central government's will on Lithuania, 
but he showed obvious pique at the scope the question has acquired in the 
superpower relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not need to be convinced that political methods are better," Gorbachev 
told Mitchell's group. "Not everything depends on us, however. And senators, 
like Americans in general, should realize this and avoid giving lectures. 
</P>
<P>
"They might prompt resentment in our society, affecting Soviet-American 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
The Baker-Shevardnadze talks made little apparent headway in narrowing 
disagreements in the strategic arms treaty negotiations. Baker said the 
superpowers had not yet "come to closure" on air- and sea-launched cruise 
missiles, or on how to distinguish between missiles with nuclear warheads, 
which would fall under the treaty, and those carrying high-explosive charges, 
which would not. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he had personally intervened to narrow the gap, but said he also 
expects the Americans to do their part so that an agreement can take shape by 
the time Baker is next scheduled to visit Moscow, which is two weeks before the 
summit starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave instructions to speed up work," the Soviet president said. "We shall 
present our considerations by James Baker's visit in May. We hope that he will 
not come with empty hands either." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev noted that he expects Bush to "meet him halfway." Mitchell said that 
in separate talks, the senators were told by Shevardnadze that Moscow wants a 
finalized strategic arms treaty signed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Including the majority leader, the visiting Senate Democratic delegation 
consisted of Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, 
Wyche Fowler Jr. of Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland 
and Jim Sasser of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of the three Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia 
-- are striving at different cadences to restore the independence their 
homelands enjoyed between the world wars. Consigned to the Kremlin's orbit by a 
secret 1939 Soviet-Nazi agreement, they were annexed by the Soviet Union the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania's capital of Vilnius, the prime ministers of the three republics 
signed a "Baltic Common Market Agreement" on Thursday pledging mutual economic 
and political assistance. It foresees the elimination of trade barriers between 
the republics by 1992, mutually convertible currencies and an "open border" 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, said the pact shows 
pan-Baltic support for her beleaguered government and presages a disengagement 
of the three republics' economies from the vast state-run bureaucracy now run 
from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important aspect of the treaty is political and moral support," 
Prunskiene told reporters in Vilnius. "Economic cooperation obviously has 
economic aspects. The chief aim of this treaty is to remove the Soviet paws 
from our economy." 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, a mass student rally took place in the capital to support the 
independence declaration, according to Tass, the official Soviet news agency. 
It gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
In another Baltic refusal to submit to policies made in Moscow, Estonia's 
Parliament voted 71 to 3 to declare conscription for the Soviet army illegal in 
the republic and to abolish criminal penalties for draft-dodging. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian lawmakers called for talks with the Soviet Defense Ministry to 
discuss alternative civilian forms of service, and also asked Gorbachev to 
begin negotiations immediately "on the restoration of independence." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate Kremlin reaction to the Wednesday night vote by the 
Estonian Supreme Soviet, but the official news agency Tass, in its report on 
the session, complained that the decision "prods hundreds of youths to violate 
the Soviet law on universal military service." 
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Defense Minister Konstantin Kochetov had visited Tallinn, 
Estonia's capital, on Saturday to insist that the spring call-up for the armed 
forces proceed as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
If Lithuania's experience is a guide, the Estonian vote may provoke a tough 
response from Moscow. Lithuanian lawmakers passed a similar measure, but the 
Kremlin rejected it as illegal. Teams of Soviet soldiers were then sent into 
two mental hospitals to grab deserters taking refuge there.

SENSING A LOSS OF LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
AMID PROSPERITY, MANY WORRY THAT ISSUES THAT COULD SPELL DISASTER AREN'T BEING 
TACKLED BY CONGRESS OR THE ADMINISTRATION.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the Bush White House to the predominantly Democratic halls of Congress, 
the federal government is engaged in a retreat from leadership, sidestepping an 
array of politically difficult long-term problems that shadow the nation's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
On the economy and education, on health care and poverty, on the deteriorating 
infrastructure of roads, bridges and basic facilities, on a growing list of 
other festering issues and budding crises, Congress and the executive branch 
have repeatedly understated the magnitude of problems and settled for partial 
responses instead of seeking effective long-term action. 
</P>
<P>
Those stark judgments, shared by a substantial number of officials in both 
parties, stand in sharp contrast to the rosy litany of progress that many 
Washington politicians recite in public: unemployment at rock-bottom levels, 
double-digit inflation banished, record numbers of young people in college, the 
economy creating thousands of new jobs each month. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even some inside the Bush Administration have begun to worry that today's 
politically palatable policies will prove inadequate for the future. What stirs 
the politicians' concern is the failure of national leaders to take political 
risks and mount comprehensive attacks on problems that threaten the quality of 
life in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Similar apprehensions can be found among business leaders, ordinary citizens 
and scholars and other experts across the land. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge facing the nation's leaders today is to take some very strong 
initiatives to prevent some of our serious problems from turning into 
disasters," said James David Barber, a Duke University professor and author of 
several books on the presidency. "But in terms of initiatives," Barber said, 
President Bush is not in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The country faces "a failure of political leadership," said Felix G. Rohatyn, 
the prominent financier who headed the government effort to restructure New 
York City's finances during the 1970s. The country's leaders "are intelligent, 
they're sincere and they're patriotic and they know what the problems are," 
Rohatyn said. But, he charged, on many of those issues they are avoiding strong 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, enormous unmet needs clutter the landscape, many of them 
draining money away from investment in future productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Obligated to spend billions of dollars to bail out the savings and loan 
industry, for instance, the government will soon be called upon to spend 
billions more to dispose of commercial nuclear wastes -- a problem successive 
presidents and Congresses have neglected. Similarly, Transportation Secretary 
Samuel K. Skinner says $80 billion will be needed just to repair decaying 
highway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, profound structural dangers wait over the economic horizon. 
Productivity growth is barely half of what it was in the 1950s and 1960s, for 
example; but the richest country in the world does not save enough to support 
its own level of investment in productive enterprises -- relying instead on 
large trade deficits and foreign borrowing. Similarly, though the nation 
continues to lag in high-technology industries, its high school and college 
students are measurably weaker than those of other developed nations in math, 
science and other subjects -- raising concern about the future competence of 
the American work force. 
</P>
<P>
And the staggering problems of the poor are well known. So are the costs to the 
larger society of ignoring the problem. The gap between rich and poor is now 
greater than it has been at any time since the end of World War II. One out of 
every five American children now lives in poverty; among blacks, the ratio is 
one out of every two children. The United States now has the highest infant 
mortality rate in the western industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
'No Lack of Ideas' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no lack of ideas, all that is needed is the political will," declared 
a blue-ribbon commission assembled by the Ford Foundation to study the problem 
of poverty and possible solutions. The commission said it could not "overstate 
the shortsightedness of ignoring America's social challenges." 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs, teen-age pregnancy, poverty, homelessness, violence -- individually or 
in combination, these factors threaten the well-being of children and families 
and threaten to overwhelm the systems designed to serve them," Greg Coler, 
health secretary for the state of Florida, told Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
A costly new federal program is not the cure for every need, such critics are 
quick to say, but they argue that -- whatever the ultimate solutions -- little 
progress on fundamental problems is possible without strong national 
leadership. And trumpet calls to decisive -- possibly painful -- action are 
seldom heard, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of Paul Krugman, one of the nation' leading economists, who teaches 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the problem is that: "Ours is an age 
of diminished expectations, an era in which most Americans appear willing to 
accept far less for themselves and their children than anyone would have 
imagined only 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"So, too, with economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Policy makers simply let problems drift and the public goes along, at least so 
long as there is no immediate, palpable pain: no double-digit inflation, no 
severe recession, no conspicuous decline in living standards," Krugman said. 
</P>
<P>
For many, that may be an unduly pessimistic assessment. But there is 
surprisingly widespread agreement that, good as things may be for many people 
now, too little is being done about basic problems for the future. 
</P>
<P>
At the grass-roots level, for example, a new Times Mirror poll found that 
President Bush retains an enormously high approval rating of 74%, yet a large 
majority of those surveyed said they do not think he is doing a good job 
tackling the country's long-term problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gets Low Ratings 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, by large margins they rated his performance no better than poor 
to fair in tackling the long-term problems of the economy, health care, 
education and the environment -- the latter two, fields in which Bush promised 
to excel. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in answer to a question at a recent breakfast session of The Times' 
Washington Bureau, 29 officers and directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce and their spouses were unanimous in indicating they believe both 
Congress and the Bush Administration have failed to seriously address the 
nation's most deep-seated problems. 
</P>
<P>
Republican pollster Richard B. Wirthlin said part of the reason for the absence 
of strong leadership in Washington today is that "traditionally leadership is 
most tested and revered in times of crisis and if ever there was a period when 
crisis doesn't describe the situation, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting time with people fairly well satisfied with the here and 
now, but they still are very much looking over their shoulders and expressing 
concern on the longer-term dimensions of social problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wirthlin, who has done polling for both Ronald Reagan and Bush, said that never 
during the past two decades he has worked in Washington has he "seen so little 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Among Washington politicians, says Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), it is now 
accepted as fact that neither Democrats nor Republicans can demonstrate 
leadership to tackle the most critical domestic issues. Why? "Because the 
government is broke." Federal budget problems are unquestionably difficult, 
critics concede, but they find the government's response to the challenge 
troubling nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Return of 'Malaise' 
</P>
<P>
One senior Administration policy maker, conceding that long-range domestic 
issues are getting short shrift, likened the Bush presidency to that of Jimmy 
Carter when Carter -- in the third year of his term -- declared that the 
country was suffering from a "crisis of confidence" and that progress was being 
stymied by a lack of spirit, which others labeled a "malaise." 
</P>
<P>
"It's that malaise business that Carter spoke about, but this time the malaise 
is on the government's side," the Administration official said. "There are more 
similarities between Bush and Carter than you would think. They both appear to 
think that this leadership 'thing' is overrated, and they believe in fixing 
problems -- resolving matters -- but no big themes." 
</P>
<P>
While Congress must share a substantial measure of responsibility, the primary 
burden of leadership and initiative in the federal government rests with the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Far more than any member of Congress, the President can command the nation's 
attention -- using his office as "a bully pulpit," in Theodore Roosevelt's 
words. Nor can Congress match the President's resources for developing programs 
and stimulating public debate. 
</P>
<P>
That is particularly true now, when the Democrats have solid majorities in both 
the House and Senate but lack the unity and strong leadership that would be 
required to seize control of the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran GOP political consultant John D. Deardourff said that in Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
of Washington "you have essentially two new leaders who are trying to find 
their way and be effective. They are basically cautious, not risk takers, and 
neither is a commanding public figure." 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Deardourff said, "It would take an extremely strong personality 
to be an effective leader in the face of a President going nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget Bush was a junior partner in the Reagan revolution," Deardourff 
said. "Anyone anticipating major initiatives would be misreading him. He has no 
passionate commitments to any problems. He could be viewed as a guy who 
squandered a great deal of personal popularity at a time when the nation faces 
serious problems. But the Bush White House is a careful reader of the polls and 
so far they don't see people upset about these problems." 
</P>
<P>
Attitude Changes 
</P>
<P>
Some political strategists believe public attitudes may be changing more 
significantly than Washington officials realize. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1970s, said political consultant Kevin Phillips, national 
leaders who were wedded to the Great Society tradition of activist government 
missed signs that the public was fed up with big government. Many of those 
leaders lost their jobs when Reagan was elected. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Phillips, "the idea of activist government is coming back" in the 
form of demands for greater action on the environment, increased support for 
medical insurance and child care and re-regulation of industries ranging from 
the airlines to cable television. "The politicians in the United States more 
often than not are lagging whatever public trend is bubbling up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President, for his part, freely acknowledges the limited role he is playing 
in attacking long-term national problems. He argues that this is the prudent 
and proper approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be able to match the highest bidder on federal funds for education or 
federal funds for drug rehabilitation or federal funds for the homeless, 
whatever it is," Bush said shortly before he took office, "but that does not 
mean that I don't care. No, it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the Administration say the President's more limited role is desirable 
on philosophical grounds, as well as being in tune with the mood of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner says Bush and Reagan, "and at least 
a minority of Congress have weaned people away from the idea that all solutions 
lie in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
"Ronald Reagan and George Bush and Sam Skinner believe that much more can be 
done, and done better, by state and local involvement rather than relying on 
federal funding and federal answers," Skinner said, pointing to the California 
gas tax initiative as a example of greater state effort. 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Richard L. Lesher, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
says he is "sick and tired of the Bush Administration being criticized for the 
new federalism of pushing responsibility for taxing and spending back to the 
states. Our members concur in the new federalism," Lesher declared. "A lot of 
people think the best time is when Congress is on vacation and the executive 
branch is not doing too much." 
</P>
<P>
Haley Barbour, a Mississippi Republican official who served as Reagan's 
political adviser and now is an unofficial Bush adviser, says: "George Bush for 
many purposes is a third-term President. He wasn't elected to change things. 
His mandate was one of continuity and improvement, fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say there are no problems, but in the broad sense, people like 
the direction the country is going in," Barbour said. 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that in two areas Bush has broken significant political 
stalemates and brought forward movement on major problems: drugs and clean air. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Issue 
</P>
<P>
By getting out in front on the issue and then throwing his weight behind a 
compromise, Bush played a leading role in pushing through the Senate the first 
major strengthening of federal clean air laws in more than a decade. Senate 
Democratic leader Mitchell also played a key role, winning praise from both 
sides of the aisle for his handling of an issue that for years had produced 
only stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have also taken the lead in pushing for a federal role in child care, 
addressing a problem that arises from major changes that have occurred in the 
economy and the American family. 
</P>
<P>
On illegal drugs, when Bush took office last January, there was no consensus in 
Washington on how the problem ought to be tackled. There was constant 
squabbling and sniping in Congress and the executive branch; everyone, it 
seemed, had his own solution. Through hard work and persuasion, Bush -- and his 
drug czar, William J. Bennett -- forged widespread acceptance of the overall 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Most innovatively, that strategy argues that the fierce old debates about the 
relative importance of supply-side and demand-side solutions was misdirected. 
Instead, it contends that law enforcement measures aimed at reducing the supply 
of drugs succeed also in reducing the demand for them. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this logic that the Administration has won congressional support for 
budget proposals that devote the bulk of spending to supply-side approaches -- 
an approach previously scorned by Democrats. While most of the burden remains 
on state and local government, Bush's fiscal 1991 budget contains $10.6 billion 
for anti-drug programs, a 69% increase over the last Reagan budget. 
</P>
<P>
In a far larger number of cases, however, the scale of the response to a major 
long-term issue offered by the Administration and Congress has been 
significantly smaller than the problem. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Economic competitiveness: Americans are not saving enough to generate the 
investment needed in new production facilities if the nation is to compete with 
Japan and others at home or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Bush proposed to cut the tax rate on capital gains and institute a 
tax-sheltered "family savings account." But most economists believe a capital 
gains tax cut would not encourage significant new investment, and his family 
savings account, which would provide tax breaks not when money was deposited 
but only when it was withdrawn, is not expected to generate much new savings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Education: Bush, who has repeatedly set the goal of being "The Education 
President," has praised the Head Start program as a model of successful 
government action to solve the problems of low educational achievement among 
children born in poverty. He has pledged eventually to provide enough money to 
allow every eligible child to participate in a Head Start program. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Bush has proposed an extra $500 million 
for Head Start, a 36% increase over the level now being spent. But, critics 
note, even with that increase, roughly a quarter million 4-year-olds will be 
unable to attend Head Start programs because of a lack of federal money. 
</P>
<P>
And the Head Start increase was the dominant element in Bush's education 
strategy: Math and science education and other problem areas got far less 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Bush drew applause from the nation's governors by holding an education summit 
with them last summer. Out of the summit grew a set of lofty educational goals, 
such as a pledge to end illiteracy by the end of the century; there are 20 
million to 30 million functional illiterates in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little in the agreement to accomplish the goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I applaud the President for holding the summit," said Mississippi Gov. Ray 
Mabus, who has headed sweeping education reforms in his own state. "But Head 
Start is still not fully funded and funds haven't been provided in other areas 
where the government traditionally has been a player. There ought to be more of 
a national role." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Porter, presidential assistant for domestic policy, counters that by 
every objective analysis, the government is pouring more resources into 
education than ever before. "What is needed now," he said, "is to look at how 
resources are being spent." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Health Care: The Administration says the government cannot afford to expand 
its two major insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Congress voted two 
years ago to make Medicare cover catastrophic health care costs, but when the 
elderly taxpayers who were to finance the program rebelled, Congress repealed 
the program a year later without addressing the problem that remains. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Americans used to look on the masses of countries like Italy and 
Spain as poor and sickly but average citizens in Italy and Spain now live 
longer than the average American. While the United States can still take pride 
in its world leadership in medical science, the delivery of health care to its 
people is spotty and constrained by soaring costs. And 37 million Americans 
have no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Housing: While estimates of the nation's homeless population vary widely, a 
substantial number of low-income people are without homes because they cannot 
afford the rent in cities with tight and expensive housing markets. From the 
end of World War II until the beginning of the Reagan Administration, the 
federal government participated in a large program of building or subsidizing 
low-income housing; Reagan drastically reduced that program. 
</P>
<P>
"At the very minimum," an adequate program to meet the nation's housing needs 
would cost an additional $20 billion a year, said Maria Foscarinis of the 
Washington-based National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty. Some analysts 
might argue for a somewhat smaller figure, but federal housing assistance 
programs currently are budgeted at only about $10 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty Problems 
</P>
<P>
Beyond bricks and mortar, so serious have the social problems of the underclass 
become that many business leaders are growing alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Foundation commission, in a moderate, measured report on what needed 
to be done, recommended a $29-billion program dealing with such matters as 
prenatal and baby care, nutritional aid, Head Start, day care, job training, 
drug treatment, the minimum wage, earned income tax credits and mandatory 
health insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals for action on that scale collide with budget constraints, competing 
interests and other obstacles. In the present political climate, there appears 
to be little enthusiasm for cutting the Gordian knots that result. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats think the Reagan Administration's program of tax reductions and 
increased defense expenditures, which almost tripled the national debt from 
$794 billion in 1981 to over $2 trillion in 1988, was deliberately calculated 
to reduce the funds available for domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
But the result has been not less government but too little "responsible 
government," contends Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who added: 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do as we did in the 1980s, deliberately create a protracted fiscal 
crisis as a political strategy, making it impossible to get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
In economic matters, the Bush Administration took steps to confront two of the 
most pressing problems it inherited from Reagan: the savings and loan crisis 
and Third World debt. In the first case, its portrayal of the size of the 
problem quickly proved too optimistic. In the second case, many analysts say, 
it opted for short-term political advantage instead of longer-range economic 
benefit for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term costs of the S&amp;L bailout, originally estimated at about $200 
billion to $250 billion, continue to mount, with the Government Accounting 
Office now estimating that the full price tag over 33 years will go as high as 
$500 billion -- most of it interest costs that will be imposed on the next 
generation of taxpayers. One official working on the bailout said the final 
cost could go as high as $600 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has decided that the political risks of 
tackling the S&amp;L problem again before this November's congressional 
elections are too high. So the Administration does not plan to propose any 
additional reforms until next year, and the delay will only add to the ultimate 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly with the Third World debt dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Won't Bail Out Banks 
</P>
<P>
Most economists believe that writing off the uncollectible debts owed to major 
U.S. banks by Latin American governments would free those countries of a 
crushing burden, stimulate trade and thus redound to the economic benefit of 
the debtors and the United States. But writing off the debts would require 
federal aid to offset the banks' losses, and the Administration does not want 
to be accused of bailing out the banks on the backs of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
On the environment, as on education, Bush's positive rhetoric has prompted 
critics to measure his promises against his performance. They have found him 
wanting, except on clean air. 
</P>
<P>
He came into office pledged to act against the threat of global warming, for 
instance, then took a hesitant approach and questioned the scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has supported studies and a series of U.N.-sanctioned steps 
toward a global warming treaty. But at a meeting in the Netherlands, it joined 
Japan and the Soviet Union in watering down a proposal calling for stabilizing 
the production of "greenhouse gases" -- chiefly methane and carbon dioxide -- 
at 1988 levels by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The promised global environmental conference at the White House is scheduled 
for next Tuesday and Wednesday. But the session's agenda has been roundly 
criticized for focusing on economic projections and computer modeling rather 
than abatement.

<P>
CONCERN OVER LONG-TERM PROBLEMS 
</P>
<P>
A Times Mirror poll found that Americans are concerned about President Bush's 
handling of long-term problems, even though they give him a 74% approval 
rating. Here is how those surveyed answered when asked how they would rate the 
job Bush is doing in dealing with the following long-term problems:

BAY AREA MAYORS BLAST U.S. AGENCY CHARGED WITH EARTHQUAKE RELIEF

The mayors of San Francisco and Oakland attacked the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency on Thursday, accusing it of shortchanging homeowners and poor 
people who remain displaced six months after the Loma Prieta earthquake struck 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos told congressional representatives that FEMA 
failed to deliver the aid promised by President Bush. Instead, the mayor said, 
FEMA has attempted to protect "the public treasury against the victims of the 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson lashed out at FEMA's "arrogance," telling how the 
relief agency dispatched only one agent to handle the thousands of people in 
Oakland left homeless by the Oct. 17 earthquake. The person had no idea how to 
deal with problems of a disaster in an urban area, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know where he was," Wilson said at the hearing chaired by Rep. 
Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente). 
</P>
<P>
Don Perata, chairman of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, appeared with 
the mayors and noted that while citizens may complain about the Internal 
Revenue Service, the IRS is a "Mary Poppins to FEMA's Freddy Krueger," a 
reference to the character in a series of horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
"If these people worked for me in Alameda County, they would be summarily 
dismissed," Perata declared, accusing FEMA of "disrespect and callousness" 
toward disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
The two days of congressional hearings, which began Wednesday, were called to 
review the efforts of agencies in the aftermath of the Oct. 17 earthquake and 
to determine whether more funding was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), a member of the panel, said she was 
"discouraged" by the stories of quake victims and the explanations offered by 
federal officials in response to complaints. She vowed that there would be more 
hearings in Washington, where the heads of the federal relief agencies would be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings underscored the problems of dealing with an urban disaster, 
particularly one in California, which has some of the nation's highest housing 
and labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners testified about red tape imposed by FEMA and the Small Business 
Administration, and said grants and loan amounts consistently fell far short of 
the cost of reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most moving testimony came from Sylvia and Horace Morden, a retired 
couple whose $450,000 home in San Francisco was rendered uninhabitable by the 
quake and will cost several hundred thousand dollars to repair. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Morden listed numerous contacts with FEMA and the Small Business 
Administration, and recited details of the complicated forms they have been 
asked to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mordens, who have been living in rented quarters, have received no 
government money. If it weren't for insurance coverage, she said, "We'd be 
living on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether to have nightmares or a nervous breakdown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos recommended that the panel of the housing and community development 
subcommittee consider legislation that would allow homeowners to use their 
equity as collateral for loans to repair damaged houses. This would assist 
retired people who own their homes but lack income to qualify for loans to 
repair their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area also is home to thousands of poor people who had lived in low-rent 
residential hotels damaged or destroyed by the quake. As many as 4,000 such 
people still need replacement housing in San Francisco and Alameda County, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials attacked FEMA's refusal to help quake victims who could not prove 
that they had lived in one place for at least 30 days. Low-income occupants of 
residential hotels generally vacate rooms after less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
FEMA officials insist they have turned down only 100 residents of 
single-room-occupancy hotels for failure to prove they had lived in the hotels 
for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Legal-aid lawyers who have sued FEMA on behalf of the low-income residents 
contend that they were denied benefits in form letters that failed to point out 
they had a right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Lorri L. Jean, FEMA deputy regional director in the quake area, defended the 
agency's response, and said many residents and officials have "erroneous 
expectations" that FEMA has the authority to rebuild lost housing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want us to rebuild lost housing in the aftermath of a disaster," she 
said, "then you are going to have to broaden our authority, because we don't 
have it now." 
</P>
<P>
Other federal officials also noted that FEMA has given $26 million in temporary 
housing assistance to earthquake victims.

FUTURE OF EMBARCADERO FREEWAY DIVIDES SAN FRANCISCO; 
</P>
<P>
CITYSCAPE: MANY CALL THE QUAKE-DAMAGED STRUCTURE UGLY AND WANT IT RAZED. BUT A 
POWERFUL GROUP OF MERCHANTS FAVORS REOPENING IT.

<P>
When he looks at the elevated Embarcadero Freeway, Mayor Art Agnos sees an 
opportunity to tear down an aging eyesore and replace it with a sunken parkway 
that would more befit one of the most scenic parts of a most scenic city. 
</P>
<P>
When Chinatown merchants look at Agnos' plan, all they see is red. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos' proposal to raze the double-deck waterfront freeway, which has been 
closed to traffic and propped up with timbers since last October's earthquake, 
has renewed an old argument over what to do with a highway San Francisco never 
wanted but now may be unable to live without. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants from the city's northeast corner -- Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach 
and especially Chinatown -- argue that the Embarcadero is essential to bring 
customers and commuters into the city. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown community leaders say they will illustrate their displeasure with the 
idea of losing the freeway by closing down their neighborhood shops Monday and 
flooding City Hall with protesters while the Board of Supervisors takes up the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in 205 years of Chinese history in the United States that 
we've had any kind of protest or movement," said Rose Pak, blunt-talking 
spokeswoman for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. "Shutting down business is a 
very strong political statement. It's unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
She said 600 of Chinatown's 850 business owners had agreed by Thursday to close 
their doors from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Monday. She said this is a measure of how 
important the freeway is to merchants, who report an estimated 30% decline in 
customers since the highway was closed by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos, supported by preservationists who never liked the freeway and newspaper 
editorial writers who have come to hate it, nonetheless plans to ask the state 
to replace the 65-foot-high freeway with a tree-lined boulevard that would 
reacquaint the city's Financial District with its historic waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- a chance to remove one 
of the worst blights on the face of any American city," he said in announcing 
his plan. 
</P>
<P>
He has likened the freeway to a recalled automobile whose safety was called 
into question by the Oct. 17 Loma Prieta Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, "San Francisco is faced with the choice of spending more money 
on a defective and hopelessly unsightly model or trading up for a new and 
improved version." 
</P>
<P>
The existing model snakes off the west end of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge and slithers through a new forest of high-rise office towers that have 
slowly replaced the warehouses and wholesale fruit markets that once butted up 
against the city's northern waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Embarcadero was intended to connect the Bay and Golden Gate 
bridges by running along the city's northeast shoreline -- and coursing through 
such treasured areas as the Embarcadero, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Public resistance in the 1950s stopped construction in mid-span, but what had 
already been built was allowed to open. Many San Franciscans have hated it ever 
since -- for killing views of the bay, hiding the historic Ferry Building, and 
for just being a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
San Franciscans have long resisted freeways, an attitude visible in any one of 
several unfinished projects -- including sections of the Embarcadero Freeway 
itself -- that curiously dead-end in mid-air. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos' plan would make the Embarcadero Freeway a long off-ramp spilling traffic 
onto a wide, tree-lined boulevard. This surface-level road would slide 
underground in front of the Ferry Building, built in 1898 and once the busiest 
transit station in the United States, to accommodate ferry commuters and 
reintegrate the venerable structure into downtown. 
</P>
<P>
An underground off-ramp would shunt some traffic to streets leading directly to 
Chinatown before the main road would resurface and connect with an existing 
waterfront street called The Embarcadero. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos estimates the project would cost $120 million and take four years to 
construct. He said this is about 2 1/2 times the estimated cost of merely 
repairing the old freeway, a job that could be finished by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said 86% of the cost of the new project -- about $103 million -- 
could come from the money Congress allocated to repair earthquake-damaged roads 
and freeways. Such funding would require federal approval, as well as the 
completion of detailed environmental review documents. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the plan contend an environmental review will find that the new 
expressway would jam traffic on side streets downtown and extend the lines of 
cars waiting to squeeze onto the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Those fears were supported by an independent consultant hired by the city, who 
estimated in a report released Thursday that the new expressway would be able 
to accommodate 25% fewer cars waiting to get on to the bridge. The excess would 
back up onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears are not new. Dozens of irate commuters expressed similar worries in 
1985, the last time the Board of Supervisors seriously debated a plan to do 
away with the freeway. Although a majority of supervisors privately supported 
demolition then, the board voted 10-0 in favor of further studies of the plan. 
The idea lay dormant until Agnos revived it. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Bill Maher, who favors demolition of the old freeway, predicted the 
vote on Monday will be close -- and unlikely to really settle the matter. Even 
if state and federal officials bought the Agnos plan, Maher predicted merchants 
would then pursue their protest in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
EMBARCADERO FREEWAY PLAN 
</P>
<P>
Long an object of scorn, San Francisco's quake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway has 
been nominated for partial demolition by Mayor Art Agnos. Money set aside to 
reinforce the double-decked highway would be used to tear down part of it, 
making room for a wide boulevard that would dip below ground in front of the 
historic Ferry Building before tying into existing waterfront streets. 
Highlighted portion in map is the section that would be demolished under Agnos' 
plan.

Folks, you may have caught the act during its long-running engagement, 28 years 
in Berlin, and now it's here, in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, let's say "Ich bin ein Venturer," and give a big Simi 
Valley welcome to a big performer; the concrete you love to hate -- the Berlin 
Wall! 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, in a sunny outdoor ceremony that blended patriotism and razzmatazz -- 
a German oompah band direct from San Diego and Mel Torme singing the national 
anthem -- a 9 1/2-foot-high section of the Berlin Wall was unveiled at the 
Reagan Presidential Library in the Ventura County city, where the workmen wear 
caps that read "Building One for the Gipper." 
</P>
<P>
It's too big for a coffee table, and too small to restrain any freedom-loving 
person in Simi Valley, let alone East Berlin. But it will fit right into the 
archives, ephemera and landmarks of the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite three years ago, Reagan visited West Berlin and, in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate, demanded, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." On Thursday, 
Reagan, dwarfed by the 6,338-pound piece, said his 1987 phrasemaking "wasn't 
merely a polite suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
The donated section is one of only seven complete wall panels in the United 
States. Such intact sections sell from $60,000 for a plain one to $125,000 for 
elaborately painted or graffitied specimens. 
</P>
<P>
This one, more pristine than the much-graffitied stretches of the wall, shows 
only a red butterfly hovering above flowers on a blue-green background, artwork 
that "obviously couldn't be more than a year old," said Joseph Sciamarelli, 
president of the Berlin Wall Commemorative Group, the exclusive U.S. 
distributor for the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan library "originally contacted the government of East Germany and 
asked how they could secure a section of the wall for the library," Sciamarelli 
said. He and his group decided "we didn't want Ronald Reagan to have to make a 
purchase of the wall, with his commitment and what he had done." So with 
fast-food magnate Carl Karcher to help with the buying and shipping costs, the 
wall came west, gratis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very positive for the President to have a section of the Berlin Wall," 
said Sciamarelli. And, from a strictly business point of view, it's "good 
public relations" to "let people know the wall is available and it is an item 
that is for sale." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1,000-plus invited locals, and old Reagan associates like MCA Chairman 
Lew Wasserman, Reagan's former agent, Thursday's unveiling afforded them not 
only a look at Reagan and the wall, but it was the first chance to see what had 
been going on at the hilltop library building site. 
</P>
<P>
After the spit-and-polish of Reagan's presidency, the dedication had the 
easygoing mood of a block party. Nancy Reagan hoisted a yellow and orange paper 
sun parasol that wouldn't stay open, and once threatened to collapse around her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The accordionist with the Bavarian Beer Garden band wore shades with his 
lederhosen. A few folks showed up in shorts and flip-flops. The contingent from 
the UCLA marching band blared out favorites like the theme from "Hawaii 
Five-O," and a Marine in the color guard muttered, "I could use a beer right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The 38-minute ceremony, emceed by Johnny Grant, the so-called "Mayor of 
Hollywood," began with the band playing the movie fanfare from 20th Century Fox 
to welcome Reagan, a former Warner Bros. star. Also present were officials from 
East and West Germany, and a young woman who escaped from East Germany before 
the wall was brought down. 
</P>
<P>
The former President's own remarks were classic "easy listening" Reagan, 
stirring oratory now free of the political constraints of policy-making: The 
wall "shattered dreams and crushed hopes. It made us angry . . . it seemed for 
a time to be impenetrable," but when it came down, "that night, all 
freedom-loving people in the world were Berliners." 
</P>
<P>
"We accept it with solemn remembrances of the past and the resolution of what 
happened must never happen again. . . . Let our children and grandchildren come 
here and see this wall and reflect on what it meant to history. Let them 
understand that only vigilance and strength will deter tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Tyranny was certainly on Ray Mulokas' mind. The Lithuanian-American, his wife, 
daughter and a friend wore black crepe paper armbands to the unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't here to demonstrate, not to take away the good done by Ronald 
Reagan," he said. But "we hope we can celebrate with the East Germans one day." 
</P>
<P>
For Simi Valley student Jason Oliver, 15, one of the designated escorts who got 
"this close" to Reagan, it was on-the-job training for when he is president, in 
2016, he figures. He has dedicated himself to that goal "since I was 6 years 
old. That's been my life, except for like going to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Locals snapped one another's picture in front of the fragment of wall. Boy 
Scouts collected the discarded Pepsi cups that were blowing away. 
</P>
<P>
And German bandsman Joe Dyke loaded up his musical gear for the drive back to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he liked it, he said. "Show business is my whole life."

A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
24 days left to register to vote before the May 7 deadline. 53 days left until 
the June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Gender: Now that a woman stands in serious contention for the governorship of 
California, the buzz is all about gender and Dianne Feinstein and women in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this one: Robert Shrum is the political TV advertising consultant who 
just lost a brutal primary runoff campaign in Texas -- Shrum working for the 
losing man, Jim Mattox, and against the winning woman, Ann Richards. Now Shrum 
heads west where his client is John Van de Kamp up against, yes, Feinstein. 
Your move, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Gender: If somebody had to wander right into the thorn bush over gender 
and politics, it might as well be a representative of a macho American 
stereotype. And so it is that the Peace Officers Research Organization endorsed 
the Republican in the gubernatorial race, Sen. Pete Wilson. The group dismissed 
Van de Kamp because he is personally opposed to the death penalty. And they 
nixed Feinstein because: "I don't think the voters are ready for a woman 
governor," Assn. President Larry Malmberg told the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
<P>
Next day, Malmberg was pulling his brogan out of his mouth: "That was my 
personal opinion . . . I apologize. There was no discussion of this at the 
board meeting. In fact, there was little or no discussion of the candidates at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down the tubes: Voter Revolt and its leader Harvey Rosenfield have pulled the 
plug on a rather half-hearted effort to get an initiative on the November 
ballot that would establish state-run auto insurance. Rosenfield, the author of 
the 1988 auto insurance reform measure Proposition 103, said he will use 
students this summer and try for the 1992 ballot. It is the second initiative 
flop for Voter Revolt, following last fall's failure to get on the ballot a 
measure that would raise property taxes for businesses while lowering them for 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead: Voters still might get a chance to see Democrats Feinstein and 
Van de Kamp debate face-to-face. Aides for both campaigns met quietly this week 
and reached a debate agreement that they are taking back to their respective 
bosses. A joint announcement by the campaigns is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
SOUNDINGS 
</P>
<P>
From actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr., critiquing politicians: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many weather vanes out there and not enough compasses." 
</P>
<P>
From Jeff Greene, 21-year-old candidate for the Republican gubernatorial 
nomination, on front-runner Pete Wilson: 
</P>
<P>
 "He is truly a Democrat in elephant's clothing . . . Pete would like you to 
think he's a conservative. But, hey, I know conservatives. Conservatives are 
friends of mine. Pete Wilson, you are no conservative." 
</P>
<P>
From The Green Party, in announcing a voter registration drive: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Green Party will work toward a radical shift in California's political 
debate by providing California voters with a new political alternative based on 
ecology, social justice and grass-roots democracy." 
</P>
<P>
EXIT LINE 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Brown, but a different shade of Brown." -- -- Kathleen Brown, 
Democratic candidate for state treasurer, explaining that she is differernt 
from her father and brother, both former governors.

WINDS FAN BLAZE IN BRITAIN'S MOORS

More than 100 firefighters worked around the clock Thursday battling a blaze 
that swept across about 1,000 acres of the dry, heather-covered moors of a 
national park. 
</P>
<P>
The fire threatens some of Britain's most valuable grouse moors and one of the 
loveliest valleys in the North Yorkshire Dales, a region known to the world 
from James Herriot's descriptions in "All Creatures Great and Small." 
</P>
<P>
Additional firefighters were called in late Thursday to reinforce those who had 
been trying to contain the blaze, which began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and officials of Dales National Park urged people to stay out of 
the area. The blaze, which firefighters believe was ignited by a discarded 
burning cigarette, is being fanned by winds sweeping across northern England.

ROMANIA BLOCKS VISIT BY KING MICHAEL;

<P>
EAST EUROPE: THE TIMING IS CALLED 'INOPPORTUNE' BECAUSE OF UPCOMING ELECTIONS.

<P>
The Romanian government Thursday blocked the country's former monarch, King 
Michael, from returning to the country on what his friends and family described 
as a "private visit." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Council of National Unity described the timing of the proposed 
visit, less than six weeks before national elections, as "inopportune," and 
said the former king would be welcome to visit after the elections, set for May 
20. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old king, who was forced to abdicate when a Soviet-backed Communist 
government was installed in 1947, lives in Geneva, where he has worked as a 
flight instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed," said the king's daughter, Princess Helen, who lives 
in England but arrived here several days ago to help pave the way for her 
father's visit, which would have been his first since he was sent into exile. 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government earlier said it had no objection to the king's visit 
and had provided visas for Michael, his wife, Queen Ann, and their eldest 
daughter, Princess Margarita, who were to join him. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, one of the leading opposition political parties, the 
National Liberal Party, protested the visit, arguing that it should be 
postponed until after the May vote. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front, which dominates the provisional government 
installed after the December revolution here, agreed with the National Liberal 
Party and pushed a decision through the Council of National Unity, the 
policy-making body that presides over the government. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Romulus Neagu said the king had been informed of the 
decision Wednesday night by a Romanian diplomat in Bern, the Swiss capital. 
</P>
<P>
There was a good deal of confusion, however, at the headquarters of the king's 
entourage in the Inter-Continental Hotel in Bucharest, where preparations were 
under way to celebrate his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Maillefer, a spokeswoman for the group, said that King Michael had 
begun his journey Thursday morning, flying from Geneva to Zurich to board a 
flight to Bucharest. She said that Romanian officials informed Swissair, whose 
flight the king was to take to Bucharest, that the king's visa had been revoked 
and that he should not be allowed on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sad situation," Maillefer said. "I think this shows the true 
colors of the National Salvation Front." She described the king's visit as "a 
kind of personal pilgrimage." 
</P>
<P>
"The visit has no political overtones whatsoever," she added, although she said 
the king has expressed his willingness to assume his reign once more, in a 
constitutional monarchy, if the Romanian people want him to. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people who had gathered at the airport to meet Michael raised a mild 
protest, shouting slogans against the government, but the reaction among most 
Romanians was mild. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is good for him not to come right now," said Irena Ionescu, 55. "I 
think of his safety. People are excitable here these days. But I would like to 
see him. I hear he is a nice man. But, no, I don't think we want to have a king 
in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the government acted correctly," said Chiran Danultz, 21. "During the 
elections is not a good time to visit. Some incident could happen. Maybe later 
it would be OK for him to visit. I don't think anyone here wants a monarchy. 
We've had enough of totalitarian power. We want a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Neagu, the government spokesman, said the visit "could not help but be 
political." He said that a meeting with the king in Timisoara and a celebratory 
Mass in Bucharest had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," he said, "events of this scale are political events." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The only son of King Carol II, who abdicated in 1925, King Michael ruled 
Romania twice: from 1927 to 1930 (between ages 5 and 8) under the supervision 
of a Regency Council, and again between 1940 and 1947. In the interim, his 
father returned to the throne. In 1940, Gen. Ion Antonescu, who involved 
Romania in World War II on the Nazi side, forced out Carol II and installed 
Michael, under his strict control. After the war, the Communists, Michael's 
backers say, forced his abdication at gunpoint by threatening to massacre his 
supporters.

THATCHER'S WOES BOOST SPECULATION: WILL SHE 'CRACK' UNDER THE HEAT?; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER'S FUTURE IS CLOUDED BY A DROP IN POPULARITY. SHE 
SAYS SHE'S NOT READY TO RETIRE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A subtle but significant change has crept into the seemingly incessant 
speculation here about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's political future. 
</P>
<P>
While the focus has previously been on such outward signs of her problems as 
plummeting popularity ratings and humiliating anti-government demonstrations, 
it now seems increasingly to deal with her state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Parliament member from Thatcher's own Conservative Party volunteered 
at the end of an interview the other day that he thinks the British government 
can still turn its fortunes around "if she keeps her nerve." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking between hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party, an admiring Western 
diplomat said the main, near-term question about the prime minister is whether 
she will "crack." 
</P>
<P>
And even one of her aides conceded that a much discussed scenario has her so 
overcome by depression at the state of her administration that she resigns. 
</P>
<P>
The aide quickly dismissed that possibility. "We're not for mid-term cracking!" 
he assured. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, few claim to see any obvious signs that Thatcher is buckling under the 
political pressure. And she makes light of such suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not come here to retire," she assured party stalwarts with a smile in 
the opening lines of an address shortly after her party suffered a stunning 
defeat in a parliamentary by-election. 
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech to the Scottish Distillers' Assn. not long before, she 
said: "As I come up to the 11th anniversary as prime minister (May 4), I take 
great comfort from the fact that malt whiskies reach their full maturity only 
in the 12th year -- and after that, there is a premium in their price and their 
value." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the fact that even one of her closest Tory collaborators would call into 
question her nerve is a remarkable change in the image of the woman Moscow once 
dubbed the "Iron Lady." Skeptics may have doubted whether Thatcher was skilled 
enough to control the fire, but until now they seldom suggested that she 
couldn't stand the heat. 
</P>
<P>
The change occurs on the eve of a summit meeting with President Bush in Bermuda 
today that should theoretically provide a welcome reprieve. Leaders the world 
over count on high-visibility foreign forays to deflect attention from domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
This visit, however, seems to be generating more British press comment about 
Thatcher's allegedly diminished role on the world stage. It hasn't diverted 
attention from her troubles at home; it threatens to compound them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 14 months since Mr. Bush's inauguration, the balance of Atlantic and 
European power has shifted quite dramatically," wrote Peter Jenkins, a widely 
read political columnist for The Independent newspaper. "The Soviet Union has 
become a less formidable adversary; Germany -- about to be united -- the 
dominant Western European power, while Britain has looked increasingly isolated 
from the mainstream of international developments. This has diminished Mrs. 
Thatcher's usefulness to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The press here has also picked up the psychological theme. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively pro-Thatcher Sunday Times editorialized the other day that she 
"is clearly entering a night of the soul." The Independent ran a lengthy piece 
of commentary on "what makes prime ministers give up the ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Several papers have probed the possible psychological implications of new, 
10-foot high gates that now block the end of Downing Street, where No. 10 is 
Thatcher's official residence. One psychiatrist was quoted as saying that the 
person so protected must feel "an enormous sense of isolation and betrayal at 
the hands of people who had failed to be grateful for years of selfless public 
service." 
</P>
<P>
Probably more pertinent is that a Thatcher abdication seems the only likely way 
this government will change before the next general election, scheduled for 
mid-1992. With a 98-seat majority in Parliament, her Tory party doesn't have to 
worry about votes of confidence in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, she could face a leadership challenge from within her party 
that, if successful, would also force her out of No. 10. A Sunday Times poll of 
100 Conservative members of Parliament last month found one in four saying that 
Thatcher should stand down before the next election. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no clear-cut successor, and a possibly bitter struggle to replace 
her could damage the party badly. Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine 
appears to be the front-runner in any succession race, but former party 
chairman and spokesman of the party's right wing, Norman Tebbit, has pledged to 
fight rather than see Heseltine take over. 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario I think is quite likely is that when she becomes convinced that 
she'll lose the next election, she'll go quietly," commented author and 
political scientist Anthony Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is now the most unpopular prime minister since Gallup began polling 
here 50 years ago, with only one in four Britons approving of the job she is 
doing. All the polls show the Conservatives trailing the arch-rival Labor Party 
by at least 20 points, with the gap widening. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson speculated that Thatcher may step down voluntarily before next fall's 
annual Conservative Party convention. She could "go in a respectable way by 
using Denis (her husband) as a pretext," he added. Denis Thatcher is 10 years 
older than the prime minister, who will be 65 in October. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher insists she intends to run for a fourth term. And her strategists 
present a cogent case that she could still pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
They concede that the economy, an issue that has helped her tremendously in 
past elections, has turned sour, with interest rates at a punishing 15% and the 
latest inflation figures, released Thursday, showing prices headed upward at 
more than an 8% annual rate. However, her strategists see a turnaround by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
By then they hope that a combination of time and tinkering will have made the 
highly unpopular "poll tax" for local government services more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Even under that scenario, however, a harsh test of the "Iron Lady's" mettle is 
likely over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives face a drubbing in local elections scheduled for May 3. The 
initial installment payments are due on the new "poll tax" later this month, 
and soon opponents of the levy promise that a boycott campaign will force the 
government either to back off or start throwing ordinary people into jail. 
Neither option would do much for Thatcher's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
As The Economist weekly put it the other day: "The idea that Mrs. Margaret 
Thatcher may no longer be prime minister by the autumn must now be taken 
seriously."

Following are excerpts from a joint statement by East Germany's Parliament on 
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 We, the first freely elected parliamentarians of the GDR (East Germany), admit 
responsibility as Germans in East Germany for their history and their future 
and declare unanimously before the world: 
</P>
<P>
Immeasurable suffering was inflicted on the peoples of the world by Germans 
during the era of national socialism. Nationalism and racial madness led to 
genocide, particularly of the Jews in all European countries, of the people of 
the Soviet Union, the Polish people and the Gypsy people. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament . . . admits responsibility on behalf of the citizens of this land 
for the humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children. We 
feel sorrow and shame, and acknowledge this burden of German history. 
</P>
<P>
We ask all the Jews of the world to forgive us. We ask the people of Israel to 
forgive us for the hypocrisy and hostility of official East German policies 
toward Israel and for the persecution and humiliation of Jewish citizens in our 
country after 1945 as well. 
</P>
<P>
We declare our willingness to contribute as much as possible to the healing of 
mental and physical sufferings of survivors and to provide a just form of 
compensation for material losses. 
</P>
<P>
We are for giving persecuted Jews asylum in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
We wish to integrate Germany in a pan-European security system in such a way 
that our people are guaranteed peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
We are aware that the changes in our country would not have been possible 
without new thinking and perestroika (program of reform and restructuring) in 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The East German Volkskammer (Parliament) acknowledges that East Germany shares 
guilt for the crushing of the "Prague Spring" (reform movement) of 1968 by 
Warsaw Pact troops. Because of fear and cowardice, we failed to hinder this 
violation of international law. 
</P>
<P>
The . . . Parliament of East Germany asks the people of Czechoslovakia to 
forgive us for the injustice done. 
</P>
<P>
The East German people, through their peaceful revolution in the autumn of 
1989, removed the dividing effects of the inhuman inter-German border. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two parts of Germany should grow together and thus promote the creation 
of a pan-European peace order within the framework of the CSCE (35-nation 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) process. 
</P>
<P>
We declare solemnly once more our unequivocal recognition of the German borders 
with neighboring states that resulted from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish people in particular should know that their right to live within 
safe borders will not be questioned by territorial claims from us Germans, 
either now or in the future. 
</P>
<P>
We confirm the inviolability of the Oder-Neisse border with the Republic of 
Poland as a foundation for the peaceful coexistence of our peoples in a common 
European house. This should be confirmed by treaty by a future pan-German 
parliament.

RETURN FORMS, CENSUS CHIEF PLEADS; 
</P>
<P>
HEAD COUNT: IT'S NOT JUNK MAIL, THE OFFICIAL STRESSES. A LOW POSTAL RESPONSE 
MEANS A COSTLIER DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASS.

<P>
Fearing that many of the nation's households may have mistaken their census 
forms for junk mail, the U.S. Census Bureau Thursday implored everyone to 
return the forms immediately to help avoid an expensive door-to-door count. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that over the last 10 years the American people have been 
bombarded by junk mail," said Barbara Bryant, director of the census. "This is 
one piece of mail that counts." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the population count is used in dividing up federal funds 
among states and local governments and in determining how many U.S. 
representatives will be elected from each state. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpectedly low census form return rate is the most recent setback for the 
Census Bureau, which has suffered lawsuits, protests and misplaced mailings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a group of cities and states, including Los Angeles and 
California, returned to court to press their argument that census officials are 
not doing all they can to count minority members in large urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau acknowledged recently that census forms were not delivered to some 
neighborhoods -- and, in a few extreme cases, entire towns were missed. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, homeless advocates refused to cooperate in the bureau's two-day 
attempt to count the nation's homeless population, the first such survey 
undertaken by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to ensure a high rate of compliance with the census included an 
earlier-than-usual starting date for mailing forms to about 100 million U.S. 
households and a nationwide advertising campaign aimed at hard-to-reach groups 
in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the effort, bureau officials said they have gotten back only 57% 
of the forms, well below the expected 70%. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, only 51.5% of the mail-in forms had been returned, slightly 
below the state's return rate of 52.9%. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, when neighborhood canvassers are expected to begin door-to-door 
interviews at households unaccounted for in the mail survey, census officials 
estimate they will have received about 62% of the mail forms. Unless an 
avalanche of forms arrives by mid-week, the bureau will be required to spend at 
least $80 million more than had been expected to hire and train census counters 
to make in-person interviews. The entire census is budgeted at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Do it now!" Bryant pleaded during a hastily called news conference that 
assumed the atmosphere of a pep rally. "If this slow response rate continues, 
it will cost the American taxpayer. For each 1% of the mail return that falls 
below our projected 70% rate, we will need an additional $10 million to hire, 
train and pay enumerators to complete the job on the doorsteps of America." 
</P>
<P>
The plea prompted Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown to call on President Bush 
to "spend five minutes on prime-time television urging everyone to fill out 
their 1990 census forms." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really speculate about whether the President would make a public 
speech on it," responded Alixe Glen, deputy White House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer (D-Ohio), chairman of the House census and population 
subcommittee, scheduled a hearing for next week, saying he was "deeply 
concerned" by the low rates of return of census forms. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryant and other bureau officials stressed that an accurate count of the 
nation's population was not threatened. Rather, they said, the issue is cost. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about is not a loss of the census count but the cost 
difference of going out to chase down an extra 8% to 10%" of the population, 
Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the bureau, Wisconsin led the nation with a 
census form return rate of 72.4%. Columbus, Ohio, at 63%, had the highest rate 
of any large municipality. At the other end, Alaska (44.2%) and Nashville, 
Tenn., (35.6%) trailed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau had no definitive reasons for the public's failure 
to send in the census forms. She suggested that "sociological trends such as 
dual career couples, working women, less time spent in the home" were among the 
causes of the low participation rate. 
</P>
<P>
She noted also that the time for returning census forms may have become 
confused with the deadline for another government mailing -- the federal income 
tax form, due on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
"April 1 was our goal for filling out and mailing back forms," she said. "It 
was not, I repeat, not a deadline. This is a census form, not a tax return."

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS ASSAILED BY HEAD OF EPA

EPA Administrator William K. Reilly criticized environmental activists 
Thursday, saying that they hurt their cause by being relentlessly critical of 
President Bush and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Reilly said in an interview, environmentalists were excluded from 
a recent White House meeting with business and industry leaders to discuss the 
Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't learned to deal with a White House (that) clearly wants to engage 
them, take their ideas and move the environmental agenda forward," Reilly said. 
"Maybe it's expecting too much to expect that they will, but I think it's going 
to hurt the (environmental) community." 
</P>
<P>
He particularly faulted environmentalists for focusing on Sununu, who has 
become a lightning rod for criticism on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Several leaders of environmental organizations expressed surprise at Reilly's 
comments, which an EPA spokesman said were harsher than any he has made 
publicly before. 
</P>
<P>
"What it does is signify that Bill is being co-opted, and co-opted in order to, 
I presume, be a more effective team player," said Jay D. Hair, president of the 
National Wildlife Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's saying what he has to say to earn his way out of purgatory," said 
Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, who noted that Reilly's loyalty 
to the Administration had been questioned after he lost several internal 
fights.

BUSH PAYS TAX OF $101,382 ON '89 INCOME OF $456,780 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For all those stragglers working on last-minute tax returns, here's a small bit 
of comfort: President Bush pays a lot of taxes too. 
</P>
<P>
The President and First Lady released their 1989 federal tax return -- all 21 
pages of it -- Thursday. The bottom line was $101,382 in taxes on a taxable 
income of $456,780, about 40% of which came from Bush's salary as President. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's annual salary as President is $200,000. Because he was not inaugurated 
until the 20th day of 1989, he earned $189,167 as President and $6,229.15 for 
his last few days as vice president. Bush also earned $259,970 from various 
investments and business holdings, most of which are in a blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush family also reported $94,702 in itemized deductions. Bush does not 
have a mortgage on his home in Kennebunkport, Me., so his chief source of 
deductions were contributions to charities, a total of $37,866. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recipients of the Bushes' largess were relief funds for victims of 
Hurricane Hugo ($3,000) and the Northern California earthquake ($2,000); the 
United Negro College Fund ($8,141) and the traditionally black Alcorn State 
College in Mississippi ($1,000); Bush's alma maters, Yale ($440) and Phillips 
Academy ($1,500); the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ($7,141) and 
several other medical charities ($2,650) and churches ($1,550). 
</P>
<P>
The contributions to the M.D. Anderson center and the United Negro College Fund 
are not round numbers because Bush gave them all the proceeds from his campaign 
biography, "Looking Forward," which earned him $14,282 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's investments did better in 1989 than the year before. His trust earned 
$208,274 in interest and dividends this past year, compared to $155,662 in 
1988. Those looking for investment tips, however, will have to look elsewhere. 
Because the trust is blind, there is no public accounting of what is in it. 
</P>
<P>
The President earned far more than his understudy, Vice President Dan Quayle. 
Although Quayle comes from a wealthy family, the $133,696 in taxable income he 
and his wife, Marilyn, reported is almost entirely from his $106,528 government 
salary. Quayle also reported $14,572 in dividends from the family-controlled 
Central Newspapers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's tax bill would have been somewhat lower had the Administration prevailed 
with one of its major policy initiatives of 1989 -- lowering the capital gains 
tax. The President's blind trust reported $36,608 in capital gains, which at 
the 28% rate cost Bush $10,250 in income taxes. Bush has proposed lowering the 
maximum capital gains tax rate to 20%, which would have lowered his tax bill by 
about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife, Barbara, checked the box that provides $1 each to the 
Federal Election Commission to help publicly finance presidential campaigns. 
However, the Quayles declined to participate in the effort. According to the 
Internal Revenue Service, about 20% of taxpayers check the box to earmark $1 of 
their taxes for the campaign fund, begun in 1972.

BUSH FEELS 'LIKE A SPRING COLT' BUT PHYSICAL REVEALS GLAUCOMA

President Bush emerged from a five-hour health examination Thursday and 
pronounced himself "like a spring colt." White House doctor Burton Lee agreed 
that Bush is in excellent health, although the routine physical did turn up "an 
early glaucoma" in Bush's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was made at Bethesda Naval Hospital outside Washington. Bush, 65, 
will be required to take eye drops daily for the ailment. Extensive tests 
showed no visual impairment. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't felt a thing, felt it at all," Bush told reporters. "I'm taking 
drops now . . . one in the morning and one at night, but the vision is very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
With early detection and continual treatment, the President should not develop 
vision problems, doctors said. Glaucoma can lead to blindness if not treated, 
but can be controlled by drugs or laser surgery. The disease is characterized 
by increased pressure and hardening of the eyeball. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case in past physicals, doctors reported that Bush has "mild 
degenerative osteoarthritis" in his hips and neck.

Iowa environmental officials said that a federal agency and a grain elevator 
operator were equally responsible for cleaning up 12,755 bushels of corn 
heavily tainted by aflatoxin, a natural cancer-causing toxin. The order from 
the Iowa Division of Environmental Protection gave the Farmers Home 
Administration and the Pruess Elevator Co. of Lowden, which purchased the corn, 
until next Friday to remove it. But a lawyer representing the FmHA, which sold 
the corn from a foreclosed farm at Chouteau, Okla., and knew that it was 
tainted, contended the agency has no responsibility.

A judge's decision to give legal protection to seven frozen human embryos went 
far beyond his authority and should be overturned, a lawyer said in an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made last September in the divorce case of Junior Lewis Davis 
and Mary Sue Davis. The only issue was what to do with the eggs that resulted 
from in-vitro fertilization. Mrs. Davis testified she wanted the embryos in an 
attempt to have children. Davis said he did not want the embryos used in any 
fashion without his consent. A judge ruled "life begins at conception" and 
accorded the embryos the same legal status as children would have in a custody 
dispute. He granted temporary custody to Mrs. Davis.

<P>
Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, a fixture in Florida politics for three decades, 
shook up the state's gubernatorial race by entering the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Chiles, 60, formed a ticket with former Rep. Buddy MacKay as his lieutenant 
governor candidate -- a pairing some Democrats immediately called the "dream 
team." Chiles retired from the Senate after the 1988 election. He served in the 
Florida Legislature from 1958 to 1970, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. 
MacKay was defeated in 1988 by Republican Connie Mack in a race for the seat 
Chiles vacated.

CINCINNATI TO TRY OBSCENITY CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
Hamilton County Prosecutor Art Ney said the city of Cincinnati, not the county, 
will prosecute an obscenity case against the Contemporary Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The center and its director were indicted by a grand jury on April 7 for 
exhibiting sexually explicit photographs taken by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. 
Officials said that, because the alleged misdemeanor occurred in the city, 
state law requires the city to prosecute. Ney said that, if the county 
prosecuted, the defendants could argue that they were being tried in the wrong 
jurisdiction. Despite the indictments, the exhibition is still on display.

LOTTERY WINNER VOWS TO SPLIT FORTUNE WITH GOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cesar T. Gonzalez of Rialto learned Wednesday morning that he had won a 
share of the $46.7-million state lottery, he thanked God for the blessing and 
went on about his business. 
</P>
<P>
"I continued on with my work," he said later in the day, "and I haven't felt 
any different yet." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, 50, who said he makes a modest income as an electrical contractor, 
will receive an estimated $15.6 million of the Lotto jackpot. His share will be 
paid in yearly after-tax installments of $623,000 for 20 years, lottery 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez will share the prize with the holders of two other winning tickets who 
were not immediately identified. One of the tickets was purchased in Petaluma 
and the other in the Contra Costa town of Brentwood, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez plans to donate half of his prize money to church work. 
</P>
<P>
"Half is mine," he said, "and half is the Lord's." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said his wife, Ana, recommended that only 10% of the money go to 
church work. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to give half," he insisted. "I'm the one that won it." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez purchased his winning ticket at a liquor store in Rialto. He used a 
machine to randomly select the winning numbers, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He was unaware when he started to work Wednesday morning of his good fortune. 
As he drove to an electrical job in Los Angeles, his 28-year-old son, Moses, 
who was riding with him, checked his father's ticket against a printout of the 
winning number that he had picked up. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me to stop the truck and take a look," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
After checking the number and giving thanks, Gonzalez drove to the job despite 
his new riches "because I was committed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Along with sharing the money with the First Baptist Church in Rialto, he plans 
to use some of the funds to send his son, Moses, to ministry school and to buy 
his 24-year-old son, Aaron, a truck to do missionary work in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez also plans to invest some of the money and take his wife on a month's 
vacation to Alaska. He doesn't plan to quit working. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the Bible tells you that you need to work," he said. "This is 
just a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
The $46.7-million jackpot was about $3 million lower than lottery officials had 
predicted but was the fifth-largest Lotto payoff in California history and the 
ninth-largest in North America, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen second-place finishers picked five of six winning numbers and will 
collect an estimated $283,000 each, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools receive 34 cents of every dollar bet in the lottery, 50 cents goes to 
prizes and 16 cents is used for administration. 
</P>
<P>
In Lotto, the odds of choosing all six numbers from a possible 49 selections is 
calculated at 14 million to 1.

TOUGH CURBS ON WATER USE URGED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Water Authority voted unanimously Thursday to ask its 24 
member agencies to enact mandatory water-reduction measures. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented effort to tighten the taps while facing a drought that has 
parched the state, the authority's board of directors recommended prohibiting 
residents from washing cars, watering lawns or filling swimming pools during 
the daytime, restaurants from serving water to customers except when requested, 
and homeowners from washing down sidewalks, driveways or tennis courts at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The authority's action is a recommendation to the 24 individual governments and 
water boards in the county, which now must independently decide whether to 
follow through with the restrictions that officials hope will achieve a 10% 
savings in water use. 
</P>
<P>
Authority officials said they believe most of the member agencies will adopt 
the water-saving measures, which would be mandatory after the failure of a 
voluntary program in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt any will go against (the recommendations)," said Byron M. Buck, 
director of the authority's Water Resources Planning Division. "This shouldn't 
have any lifestyle impact -- we're just asking people to cut wasteful use." 
</P>
<P>
Before the San Diego panel voted, officials of the Metropolitan Water District 
of Southern California, which supplies water to Los Angeles and Southern 
California, urged the authority to adopt the tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a secure water supply," said Carl Boronkay, MWD general manager. 
"What is needed is a comprehensive statewide policy." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District supplies water from Oxnard to the Mexican 
border. Among the 130 cities in its region, only about 10 have adopted 
ordinances similar to the San Diego proposal, MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping all cities will respond in a fashion similar to San Diego," he 
said. "Virtually every city south of Sacramento should be adopting such 
ordinances, if they haven't already." 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions supported by San Diego's water authority resemble an ordinance 
passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council. That ordinance also 
prohibited hosing down hard surfaces such as driveways; serving water in 
restaurants unless requested, and allowing irrigation water to run off into 
gutters, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego proposal goes further than the Los Angeles ordinance in that 
it restricts the watering of residential lawns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 of California's 58 counties have instituted some kind of water 
restrictions, said Dean Thompson, a spokesman with the Department of Water 
Resources' Drought Center in Sacramento.

U.S. officials put a popular entertainment and disco district in Seoul off 
limits to American personnel Thursday in an attempt to stem anti-American 
violence and protect U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the U.S. 8th Army for the 43,800 U.S. troops, thousands of 
civilian employees and their dependents in South Korea said the Itaewon 
entertainment district would be off limits from midnight until 5 a.m., 
effective today. 
</P>
<P>
Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks long near the 
8th Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and U.S. military personnel 
shop there by day, and at night its neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of 
young Koreans as well. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement apparently was a move to avoid clashes between South Korean 
civilians and American soldiers who frequent late-night bars and entertainment 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-American feeling is strong here, especially among radicals and dissidents 
who have demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops, contending that their presence 
hinders unification of South Korea with Communist North Korea.

President Frederik W. de Klerk, leading his country out of diplomatic

It would be the first visit to Washington by a South African head of government 
since the Afrikaner-based National Party assumed power in 1948 and introduced 
apartheid, its legislated system of racial segregation.

President Bush invited De Klerk to the White House in February after the

FBI TO INVESTIGATE DEATHS THAT MAY BE WORK OF SERIAL KILLER

The FBI has entered the investigation of the murders of three young women in 
the same San Diego neighborhood, which authorities believe might be the work of 
a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
"They (San Diego police) submitted the case to us for analysis after the second 
murder in February," said John Douglas, chief of the Behavioral Science Support 
Unit at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency has intensified its efforts since the third murder, the 
April 3 slaying of a Michigan teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case like this, we pull out all the stops," Police Sgt. Dorothy Powell 
said in confirming that the FBI has been called in. 
</P>
<P>
Police theorize the slayings in the Clairemont area might be the work of one 
killer because the victims were young women who were stabbed; the murders all 
were committed at midday in apartments with no sign of forced entry; the 
victims were found semi-nude, and the crimes took place within four months.

LONG BEACH HAD STATE'S LARGEST INCREASE IN SERIOUS CRIME IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state report says Long Beach had the largest increase in serious crimes of 
any major California city last year, prompting police to demand that more 
officers be hired and neighborhood activists to organize special citizen 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Major crimes shot up 25% in 1989 over the previous year, with the murder rate 
increasing by 46% in the same period, according to the Bureau of Criminal 
Statistics in the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence Binkley blamed much of problem on gangs moving 
into Long Beach from nearby cities like Los Angeles. According to police 
statistics, 31 of 97 murders last year were either drug-related or gang-related 
-- compared to 15 of 63 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang sweeps in Los Angeles have aggravated the problem in Long Beach, 
Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Police Chief Daryl F.) Gates puts 1,000 cops on the streets, he drives 
them out here," Binkley said. "It doesn't take very long before gangs figure 
that Long Beach is a better place to be." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police spokesman Fred Nixon said Thursday: "It's an unfortunate 
fact that if the pressure is here, they'll go someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Though the percentage increases can be startling, Binkley noted that because 
Long Beach has also experienced an influx of new residents, the overall picture 
may not be as grim when the city's population is figured into the formula. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, for example, has 71.1 violent crimes per 1,000 residents, 
compared to Long Beach's rate of 54.8 violent crimes per 1,000 people, 
according to police statistics. 
</P>
<P>
In the upscale, middle-class and working-class neighborhoods of Long Beach, 
residents seem to be adopting a greater awareness of the need for crime 
prevention measures. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and my son are locking the house for once," Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
In one northern Long Beach neighborhood, where mostly retirees and blue-collar 
workers live, about 60 people take turns driving around to check for suspicious 
activity from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day. Since the patrols started a month 
ago, neighbors have helped police arrest at least five people seen breaking 
into homes, said Jim Lemieux, a 45-year resident of the community near DeForest 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
In Naples, where gondolas are often seen gliding past million-dollar 
residences, homeowners are considering taxing themselves to pay for additional 
police to patrol their islands. In the Virginia Country Club area, home to some 
of the city's most prominent residents, citizens are considering closing off 
the neighborhood with gates and hiring security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"This has always been a wonderful, safe neighborhood and now crime that we hear 
about in other communities is tiptoeing here," said Barbara Shoag, a Virginia 
Country Club resident and long-time community activist. 
</P>
<P>
The crime increase last year in Long Beach was 2 1/2 times greater than it was 
in the city of Los Angeles. Overall, major crimes increased 10% in Los Angeles, 
where the number of homicides jumped 19.2% from 736 in 1988 to 877 last year, 
according to the Bureau of Criminal Statistics. The bureau's report measured 
crime rates in California cities with populations of 100,000 or greater. 
</P>
<P>
Major crimes include murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries 
and motor vehicle thefts. In the category of violent crimes -- defined by state 
officials as murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- Long Beach 
saw an increase from 5,153 in 1988 to 7,169 in 1989, a jump of 39%. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police reported to the state bureau that 85 murders took place in 
their city in 1989, but that figure did not include those considered 
justifiable homicides -- which actually bring the number up to 97, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Criminal Statistics counts only "willful killings," not 
justifiable homicides such as those involving officers or citizens who kill in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the new statistics, Binkley and city officials are asking voters to 
support a property tax levy next June to raise money for an additional 75 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
If the trend holds up, officers would no longer be able to provide some 
non-emergency services unless the department's staff of 643 is expanded, 
Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of internal memos in the Police Department signalled the 
arrival of recommendations to reduce services to cope with inadequate staffing 
and a higher incidence of crime. 
</P>
<P>
In one memo, a police commander recommended that investigators begin ignoring, 
among other things, petty thefts of less than $400 and battery cases in which 
the victim requires no medical treatment -- with the exception of gang-related 
investigations. Binkley said this week that those are among the cuts he is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
Already, many residents complain that police are slow to respond. "Because we 
have not been getting good police response, our neighborhood association 
chapter decided to have our own volunteer civilian patrol," Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another North Long Beach neighborhood, residents are talking about 
taking strolls in groups each evening in search of people who may not belong in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, City Councilman Jeff Kellogg said, would ask people they don't 
recognize questions such as: "Can I ask you what business you have in this 
neighborhood? Can I help you?" Kellogg said he plans to join the group on some 
of its outings. 
</P>
<P>
Some community leaders are highly critical of such citizen patrols because they 
fear they will further polarize the community. 
</P>
<P>
"This vigilante attitude doesn't help the problem," said Frank Berry, president 
of the Long Beach chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. "Those kinds of things in a racially diverse community could be very 
dangerous."

U.S. URGES PRISON FOR EX-BANKER; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: A TWO-YEAR SENTENCE IS RECOMMENDED FOR THE FORMER HEAD OF THE NOW 
DEFUNCT WESTLAKE THRIFT &amp; LOAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office recommended a two-year prison sentence Thursday for 
the former president of Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan for his admitted role in a 
massive phony loan scheme that has triggered one of the major fraud 
investigations in Ventura County history. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. David C. Scheper also asked U.S. District Court Judge 
Richard A. Gadbois Jr. to levy a $30,000 fine against Steven Smith, who pleaded 
guilty in December to charges of conspiracy, bank fraud and misapplication of 
bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 46, of Thousand Oaks is scheduled to be sentenced by Gadbois Monday in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Smith could receive a minimum sentence of 
eight to 14 months in prison, 85% of which he would be forced to serve. 
</P>
<P>
According to a sentencing memorandum filed Thursday by Scheper, Smith "fully 
confessed his own involvement, and matter-of-factly described the conduct of 
others" in a scheme to allegedly build the largest video rental store chain in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Smith's cooperation, federal prosecutors are asking for the 
two-year sentence instead of a longer term, Scheper said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Smith's attorney, I. Mark Bledstein, said he will seek a maximum 
sentence of one year in prison for the Thousand Oaks banker, a punishment that 
still "is a lot for someone like Smith" to serve. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sentencing memorandum, Smith's troubles started in January or 
February of 1987 when he apparently realized that the now defunct Westlake 
Thrift had approved more than $2 million in bogus loans to Walter Vladovich, a 
Riverside businessman who allegedly set up a phony scheme to build a video 
store empire. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of exposing the scheme -- including bogus loans issued to people who 
never existed -- Smith went along with Vladovich and approved $2 million more 
in phony loans, according to the memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich, a Riverside businessman, has pleaded guilty to charges of 
conspiracy, unlawful payment of bribes and bank fraud. He is scheduled to be 
sentenced in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Smith was not aware of what Mr. Vladovich was doing until half the money 
was taken," Bledstein said. And when he realized what was happening, he thought 
that the bank could recover the money by continuing with the plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, Westlake Thrift went out of business. Initially, the exact 
nature of the company's many problems was not revealed. Then in December, 1989, 
the troubles became clearer when a 26-count federal bank fraud indictment was 
returned, naming Smith, Vladovich and three of his salesmen as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Salesmen George Loayza Sr., 52, and his son, George Loayza Jr., 25, both of 
Eagle Rock, each were sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $15,000. 
Salesman Jerry Tulak received six months in prison, a $30,000 fine and three 
years' probation in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich could face up to 45 years in prison and $2.25 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of sources have alleged in interviews with The Times that Vladovich, 
who also owned a mortgage firm, Pioneer Acceptance Corp. of Riverside, began 
his fraudulent activities in 1984 with a banker, Henry Schneider, vice 
president of First United Thrift and Loan of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich is accused of submitting false loan packages to Schneider for video 
store franchises that supposedly were going to be operated by some of his own 
employees and others. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement between Vladovich and Schneider allegedly lasted about a year. 
Scheper said Vladovich received about $550,000 in loans and paid $15,000 in 
bribes to Schneider. He said Schneider has pleaded guilty to three counts of 
conspiracy and fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
First United ultimately was absorbed by a larger bank, however, and the loans 
to Vladovich were stopped in 1985. About that time, sources said, Schneider 
introduced Vladovich to Westlake Thrift officials. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Smith, who then was a vice president of Westlake Thrift, 
Vladovich allegedly came up with a different scheme that involved obtaining 
about 800 bogus loan packages through Pioneer Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
The loan packages were submitted to Westlake Thrift on behalf of individuals 
who supposedly were going to buy 48 video movies and video equipment with which 
to launch their own video store businesses. But, sources said, Vladovich 
allegedly used some of the money to pay himself a $1,800-a-month salary and to 
cover his business operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that an FBI fraud investigation into Westlake Thrift's 
demise now focuses partly on Olen B. Phillips, a stockholder in both the United 
Community Bank of Thousand Oaks and Westlake Thrift. Phillips is also under 
investigation by state and county officials in connection with allegations of 
fraudulent real estate transactions.

REAGAN GETS PIECE OF THE WALL; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: THE FORMER PRESIDENT UNVEILS A HUGE CHUNK OF COLD WAR HISTORY AT 
HIS LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Folks, you may have caught the act during its long-running engagement, 28 years 
in Berlin, and now it's here, in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, let's say "Ich bin ein Venturer," and give a big Simi 
Valley welcome to a big performer: the concrete you love to hate -- the Berlin 
Wall! 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, in a sunny outdoor ceremony that blended patriotism and razzmatazz -- 
a German oompah band direct from San Diego and Mel Torme singing the national 
anthem -- a 9 1/2-foot-high section of the Berlin Wall was unveiled at the 
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, where the workmen wear caps that 
read "Building One for the Gipper." 
</P>
<P>
It's too big for a coffee table and too small to restrain any freedom-loving 
person in Simi Valley, let alone East Berlin. But it will fit right into the 
archives, ephemera and landmarks of the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite three years ago, Reagan visited West Berlin and, in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate, demanded, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." On Thursday, 
Reagan, dwarfed by the 6,338-pound piece, said his 1987 phrasemaking "wasn't 
merely a polite suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
The donated section is one of only seven complete wall panels in the United 
States. Such intact sections sell for from $60,000 for a plain one to $125,000 
for elaborately painted or graffiti-covered specimens. 
</P>
<P>
This one, more pristine than the stretches of the wall with the most graffiti, 
shows only a red butterfly hovering above flowers on a blue-green background, 
artwork that "obviously couldn't be more than a year old," said Joseph 
Sciamarelli, president of the Berlin Wall Commemorative Group, the exclusive 
U.S. distributor of the wall pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually offered the President a gray section . . . for a specific reason 
originally -- that the wall should be perceived as a wall rather than as art," 
but they specifically requested a painted portion, Sciamarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan library "originally contacted the government of East Germany and 
asked how they could secure a section of the wall for the library," Sciamarelli 
said. He and his group decided they "didn't want Ronald Reagan to have to make 
a purchase of the wall, with his commitment and what he had done." So with 
fast-food magnate Carl Karcher to help with the buying and shipping costs, the 
wall came West, gratis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very positive for the President to have a section of the Berlin Wall," 
Sciamarelli said. And, from strictly a business point of view, it's good public 
relations to "let people know the wall is available and it is an item that is 
for sale." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1,000-plus invited local residents, Thursday's unveiling afforded not 
only a look at Reagan and the wall, but also the first chance to see what had 
been going on at the hilltop library building site. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Gallick, an artist and a volunteer at a Moorpark senior citizens center, 
hiked up the hill about 7:30 a.m. to get a long look at the place before 
security moved him back. Gallick creates his art from "disposable things," and 
when the library is finished he plans to check out the leftover debris for his 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Take the wall, he pointed out. "This piece of trivia suddenly becomes very 
valuable . . . a discard of our culture all of a sudden in a prestigious 
setting." 
</P>
<P>
Casually prestigious, perhaps. Nancy Reagan hoisted a yellow and orange paper 
sun parasol that wouldn't stay open and once threatened to collapse around her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The accordionist with the Bavarian Beer Garden band wore shades with his 
lederhosen. The UCLA band blared out favorites such as the theme from "Hawaii 
Five-O," and a Marine in the color guard muttered, "I could use a beer right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The 38-minute ceremony, emceed by Johnny Grant, the so-called "Mayor of 
Hollywood," began with members of the UCLA marching band playing the movie 
fanfare from 20th-Century Fox to welcome Reagan, a former Warner Bros. star. 
Also present were officials from East and West Germany, and a young woman who 
escaped from East Germany before the wall was brought down. 
</P>
<P>
The former President's own remarks were classic "easy listening" Reagan, 
stirring oratory now free of the political constraints of policy-making: 
</P>
<P>
"We accept it with solemn remembrances of the past and the resolution of what 
happened must never happen again . . . Let our children and grandchildren come 
here and see this wall and reflect on what it meant to history. Let them 
understand that only vigilance and strength will deter tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Tyranny was certainly on Ray Mulokas' mind. The Lithuanian-American, his wife, 
daughter and a friend wore black crepe-paper armbands to the unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't here to demonstrate, not to take away the good done by Ronald 
Reagan," he said. "But I think maybe we're getting a little duped with all the 
fancy-speaking Russians. . . . We hope we can celebrate with the East Germans 
one day." 
</P>
<P>
For Simi Valley student Jason Oliver, 15, one of the designated escorts who got 
"this close" to Reagan, it was on-the-job training for how to act when he is 
President. He said he has dedicated himself to that goal "since I was 6 years 
old. That's been my life, except for, like, going to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
More than an hour before the unveiling, the base of Presidential Way in Simi 
Valley was tangled in a crowd of tour buses loaded with people hoping to be 
part of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Students on vacation and politicians gathered at the half-completed library 
that commands a view of the Tierra Rejada Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too many areas have a piece of the Berlin Wall," said Brad Schield, 23, a 
senior at Cal State Chico who was on spring break. "It's kind of neat to have 
it in this area." 
</P>
<P>
He and classmate Melody Loerke, 20, said they had given up a day of vacation to 
see the wall. Dressed in shorts and T-shirts, the two stood out from the 
well-dressed audience and Secret Service men. 
</P>
<P>
Schield, a former Westlake resident, said his grandfather owns a small piece of 
the Berlin Wall, but that it looks no different from a rock. 
</P>
<P>
"This is better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a carnival-like scene as the crowd sipped at paper cups full of soda. 
Some sat on lawn chairs on a hill overlooking the stage where the slab of wall 
was unveiled. Most carried small flags that rippled in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
The midday heat drove some to carry parasols and Panama hats, including Simi 
Valley Councilwoman Vicky Howard, who a donned one of the "Building One for the 
Gipper" caps honoring the former President. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Howard had visited the Berlin Wall and took pictures of it 
during a tour of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"To see East and West coming together in, of all places, Simi Valley, well, I 
find it incredible," said Howard, a Republican who voted twice for Reagan. "It 
doesn't matter if you're a Republican or Democrat. It's historic." 
</P>
<P>
Brendan Hooley, 13, said he and 13 members of Simi Valley Boy Scout Troop 618 
turned out in uniform for the special event. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here because we might become the color guards for the Reagan library, 
and we didn't have anything else to do," Brendan said. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan said he became especially interested in seeing what will be in the 
Reagan library after he visited the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum in West 
Branch, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is anywhere near as good as the Herbert Hoover library, this is going 
to be really nice," he said.

LAGOMARSINO VISITS INSPIRATION FOR CHILD-CARE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino paid homage Thursday to an innovative child-care 
center in Ventura that has inspired a small part of the nation's developing 
child-care policy. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ventura Republican also took the occasion to say that he may eventually 
vote against a child-care bill he helped write because of its overall cost. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Ventura, Lagomarsino thanked Anita Garaway, child-care 
coordinator for Patagonia's employees, for helping him author a section of a 
national child-care bill that passed the House of Representatives last month. 
</P>
<P>
His section, co-authored by Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.), would provide $75 
million a year to improve the quality of day care by paying model day-care 
centers to help smaller, less-established centers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can magnify the effectiveness of a center like this," Lagomarsino said, 
"then the child-care bucks would go a lot farther." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, the manufacturer of outdoor and sports clothing, has won 
considerable attention for offering discount child care since 1984 to its 
employees through the Great Pacific Child Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Working Mother magazine listed Patagonia and its parent company, 
Lost Arrow Corp., as one of the top 16 most desirable places to work. 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for Lagomarsino's bill came in 1988 when Lagomarsino 
accompanied Johnson on a tour of the child-care center for 85 children, ranging 
in age from 8 weeks to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She was impressed by what she saw," Garaway said. "We compared what we knew to 
what she was seeing in Connecticut and one thing led to another. . . ." Garaway 
ended up spending weeks on the phone with Lagomarsino's staff and ultimately 
flying to Washington to help his staff draft separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Lagomarsino's bill was incorporated into the more comprehensive 
legislation that passed the House on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
Linking Garaway and Johnson in 1988 proved to be a political blessing for 
Lagomarsino during his tough reelection campaign against a popular challenger, 
state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Johnson had come to Ventura County on a short campaign swing to help 
her Republican colleague. But the political marriage that spawned the 
child-care legislation added an extra boost to Lagomarsino's reelection efforts 
by robbing Hart of one of his issues. Hart has been a vocal leader on 
child-care issues in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Lagomarsino said that even though he authored part of the national 
child-care legislation, he would be unable to vote for its final passage unless 
Congress reduces its overall price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill, which directs most of its benefits to low-income working 
parents, would cost $27.5 billion over five years. Among other things, it would 
expand tax credits for parents with children in day care, enlarge grants for 
child-care centers, set standards for child-care centers and create a new 
school-based program before and after classes for "latch-key" children. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate has approved a similar measure and a committee of lawmakers from 
both chambers are expected to meet soon to iron out the differences in the two 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
But President Bush has threatened to veto any legislation unless Congress 
dramatically reduces its cost. Lagomarsino indicated that he is not willing to 
cross the president, the leader of his party, even though he has a personal 
stake in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino's provision would establish 10 regional centers to spread their 
knowledge and experience to neighboring child-care centers. Although the Great 
Pacific Child Development Center inspired the idea, it would have to compete 
with others for the limited grant money to become a regional center.

<P>
At the request of the city of Ojai, the California Public Utilities Commission 
has scheduled two public hearings on a rate increase proposed by Southern 
California Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company is seeking rates 25% higher next year for its 2,688 customers. 
</P>
<P>
The hike would increase an average residential water bill by $6.17 a month and 
would be followed by smaller increases the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai City Council formally objected to the proposed rate structure after 
City Manager Andrew Belknap said it would do little to encourage water 
conservation and would actually penalize those who are most thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
The two public hearings were scheduled for June 25 at 3 and 7 p.m. in the 
council chambers of Ojai City Hall, 401 S. Ventura St. Attorneys for the 
utility and PUC staff will present their reports on the proposal to 
Administrative Law Judge Eric Stalder, who will also take comment from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The firm offered to make unspecified modifications to the rate request in a 
letter to the city from Floyd Wicks, Southern California Water Co. Vice 
President of Operations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wicks also asked that the council endorse the company's attempts to swap water 
with Casitas Municipal Water District, which he said would benefit the 
company's Ojai customers and would save 500-acre-feet per year of Lake Casitas 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the City Council nor the Casitas Water Board has publicly considered 
the water exchange proposal to date. THIA BELL

'PEOPLE'S ART' COVERS WALLS IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Walls enclose, divide, confine. But for the muralist, walls liberate. 
</P>
<P>
Around Ventura County, the walls of school gymnasiums, restaurants, furniture 
stores and community centers offer canvasses for muralists. 
</P>
<P>
One is Michael Mora, who has painted walls in Ventura, Saticoy and Santa Paula. 
He and Jaime Estrada are completing another on the north wall of El Concilio 
del Condado in Oxnard to be dedicated April 28 and 29. 
</P>
<P>
While many muralists paint large open areas of sky or mountains, Mora said he 
prefers detailed work. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to trip out on every inch of our murals," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
For Linda Taylor, painting a mural can be therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
As a concerned parent, she watched anxiously in 1983 when children were bused 
to Oak View Elementary School. Taylor suggested that the children paint a mural 
on the school to draw everyone into a common project. 
</P>
<P>
Students chose an "Over the Rainbow" theme and each class participated. 
Kindergartners painted the butterflies and flowers at the bottom. Older 
children climbed scaffolding to paint elves and unicorns. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor went on to work with teen-agers on murals at Ventura High School's 
Larrabee Stadium and on a grocery store wall in Moorpark. She also created a 
mural on the old Pierano Grocery Store wall across Main Street from Mission San 
Buenaventura. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's oldest mural was painted in 1936-37 by Gordon Grant as a federal arts 
project. The work winds around the upper part of four interior walls of the 
main post office lobby and shows the county's major industries, resources and 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
A city landmark, the mural is listed on the Federal Register of Fine Arts of 
the Smithsonian Institution and has been appraised at $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's newest mural, in the City Hall atrium, relates to an older age. A 
collage of ancient cave paintings by Santa Barbara artist Kathleen Conti was 
completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
For Mora, murals are unique. 
</P>
<P>
"I always appreciated murals and liked the concept behind them -- that they are 
the people's art rather than gallery art or art in people's homes," Mora said. 
"They belong to the community."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET IN STANDOFF AT HOME OF SHARON 
GLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A preliminary hearing will be held April 25 for a woman prosecutors describe as 
an obsessed fan who broke into the Studio City home of actress Sharon Gless 
while armed with a rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was scheduled Thursday for Joni Leigh Penn, 30, who pleaded not 
guilty on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Penn is charged with two counts of residential burglary to commit theft. Both 
charges included firearms allegations. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on both counts, Penn could face 10 years in prison. She was being 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was arrested March 30 after a seven-hour standoff with police officers. 
She was armed with a .22-caliber rifle, but no shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Gless, who played a police detective on the "Cagney &amp; Lacey" television 
series, was not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, a judge ordered Penn to stay 200 yards away from Gless.

BOATING ACCIDENTS DECLINE BY 60% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of boating accidents in Ventura County has dropped by 60% since 
1987, reflecting an overall decrease statewide, according to the state 
Department of Boating and Waterways. 
</P>
<P>
State Boating Administrator Ben Benites said the number of reported boating 
accidents in the county has decreased from 35 in 1987 to 14 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The overall amount of accidents, injuries, deaths and property damage since 
1984 has fluctuated, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Benites listed the following boating accident totals for the county in 1989: 
</P>
<P>
* Number of reported accidents: 14, down from 19 in 1984, up from 7 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* Number of injuries: 3, up from 0 in 1984 and 2 in 1988 
</P>
<P>
* Number of deaths: 3, up from 2 in 1984 and none in 1988 
</P>
<P>
* Property damage: $30,400, down from $95,400 in 1984 and $247,700 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the figures represent an overall decrease in boating 
accidents and decreasing fatalities statewide. The number of reported accidents 
in the state is down from 747 in 1988 to 620 in 1989, and the number of 
fatalities has declined to 43 from 103 since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Benites credited the overall decrease to "better education" in boating safety 
sponsored by the state through boat shows and school programs. He also said 
that the reason for most injuries was speed. JEFF SCHNAUFER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES WON'T BE FILED AGAINST 43 IN DRUG 
RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city attorney's office will not file charges against 43 people -- including 
a stockbroker, pop singer Appolonia and an accountant -- arrested on drug 
charges last September at MacArthur Park because of "procedural glitches" 
encountered by the arresting officers, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
When the cases were referred to the city attorney, they were not accompanied by 
analyses of the substances seized, police spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Arresting officers believed they could wait for a more comprehensive laboratory 
analysis and submit that later, he said. But when the cases arrived with no 
analyses of the substances at all, the city attorney decided not to pursue the 
cases, Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have since straightened out our procedures on administering tests of drugs 
that are seized, and we hope this won't happen again," the lieutenant said.

COUNTY BACKS PLAN TO FUND CRIME LABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation designed to fund an expansion of fingerprint, photograph and 
genetic identification databases in Ventura and other counties has been 
endorsed by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
By doubling the amount of money counties could collect on fines levied by the 
courts, the pending legislation would provide funds for an electronic 
photograph and fingerprint scanners and a DNA identification system. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is now collecting 50 cents for every $10 on all criminal fines 
for a statewide fingerprint database. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the legislation will allow the Sheriff's Department to use the 
additional money to purchase electronic scanners that would give law 
enforcement officials instant access to mug shots and fingerprints entered into 
the system, Lt. John Brockus said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds would also be used to create a laboratory to carry out DNA analysis.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ARRESTS PLANNED IN DEATH OF MAN HIT BY 
BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Thursday that no arrests were planned after an accident late 
Wednesday in which a 45-year-old man was crushed to death by an RTD bus in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no crime involved that we can determine at this particular time," said 
detective John Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
The man was killed about 11 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Hollywood 
Boulevard and Bronson Avenue, Officer John Balicki said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was not identified, was run over by the right rear wheels of the 
bus. It was not clear how the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus driver sits 40 feet up in front of the rear wheels, and sometimes they 
don't know if they hit anybody," Kelley said. He said several similar accidents 
happen every year.

RACKETEERING SUIT DISMISSED; NAMED BANK, 16 DEFENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has dismissed a civil racketeering suit against the Bank of San 
Pedro and 16 other defendants that alleged they conspired to bankrupt a local 
businessman who was trying to market a pollution-reducing fuel additive. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Richman, the bank's attorney, said the decision handed down Monday by 
U.S. District Court Judge William Rea clears the bank and prohibits any 
rehearing in federal court for the other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Richman said the bank was named in the suit only because one of the defendants 
was a director. "There were no allegations of wrongdoing against the bank," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in February, alleged that James Birakos, former media liaison 
for the South Coast Air Quality Management District; Steven Podesta, a former 
Bank of San Pedro director, and others waged a three-year campaign of 
questionable business tactics, including check forgery and the use of spies to 
infiltrate a business owned by Richard Skaggs of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The judge granted the bank's motion to dismiss the case, saying that there was 
no issue of fact involving the bank that could be decided at trial. But the 
ruling did not address factual issues involving other defendants and does not 
bar a suit in a state court against them on the same issues. 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs' attorney, Raymond Mulligan of Irvine, did not contest the bank's motion 
and said he plans to refile the case against all defendants except the bank in 
a state court in several weeks. "We feel we would have a cleaner and better 
shot at prevailing by pursuing a state action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the federal case had been hurt when two witnesses who had been 
expected to bolster the racketeering claims decided not to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Birakos said Thursday that he intends to bring a defamation suit against Skaggs 
because of the lawsuit. "It was a cheap publicity stunt and nothing beyond 
that," he said. "It is absolutely unbearable and unethical, and we are 
preparing litigation to right this awful deed." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from Skaggs' efforts to market and distribute a fuel additive 
intended to reduce pollution. In 1987 he formed a company called Renergy 
International Inc., which Birakos still heads. 
</P>
<P>
Renergy was financed by Podesta, a major shareholder, with a $75,000 loan from 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs alleged that he was forced out of Renergy by the defendants and that 
when he tried to market the fuel additive under the name of his own company, 
Omstar Products, his former partners interfered, forcing Omstar into bankruptcy 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged that Birakos forged Skaggs' signature on a $3,000 check 
made out to Birakos and that Podesta ordered a teller at the Bank of San Pedro 
to cash it. 
</P>
<P>
Birakos said there was no forgery and that Skaggs authorized him to sign the 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Once the two sides became competitors, the suit alleged, Birakos, Podesta and 
others affiliated with Renergy sent spies pretending to be potential customers 
to Omstar offices. 
</P>
<P>
Birakos said it was Skaggs who engaged in such tactics, once posing as a 
Renergy employee and instructing the post office to send Renergy mail to 
Omstar. 
</P>
<P>
Richman, attorney for the bank, said he had filed a motion for summary judgment 
and that Skaggs decided not to contest it.

<P>
The city of Camarillo, which earlier this year reported that its finances were 
back in the black after a $25-million loss from high-risk investments two years 
ago, has been awarded a certificate of achievement for excellence in financial 
reporting, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The certificate, from the Government Finance Officers Assn. of the United 
States and Canada, is awarded to city governments for submission of 
comprehensive annual financial reports, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year that Camarillo has won the award, Assistant City 
Manager Larry Davis said. "We're very pleased because this is only the second 
time we've submitted for the award," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The association, a nonprofit organization serving 12,200 government finance 
professionals, also gave an award for financial reporting to Joyce A. Marsh, 
the city's former acting director of finance. Marsh is now assistant finance 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Bingham, the city's present finance director, said that as of February, 
the city had $464,615 in reserves, contrasted with one year ago, when the 
city's books showed a deficit of about $3 million. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

COUNCIL URGED TO KEEP MUSEUM OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts Commission have urged the City 
Council to remove the Carnegie Art Museum from a list of proposed budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairwoman Mona Broyles said Tuesday at a City Council meeting that 
closing the museum to help balance the city's budget is "totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Closing the museum is included in a list of budget reduction options that the 
council will consider when it adopts the 1990-91 budget in June. The proposed 
cuts come after the council decided last year to cut $1 million from the city's 
budget by eliminating about 15 positions because of a decline in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too 
high, and the city had spent $850,000 more than its budget allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The city can save $175,000 a year by closing the museum, said Assistant City 
Manager John Tooker. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said Tuesday they will try to keep the museum off the budget 
chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
"A city that is growing must have art. No questions about it," Councilwoman 
Dorothy Maron said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-square-foot museum, which houses a permanent collection of 250 
paintings and sculpture, opened in 1981 and has a staff of one part-time and 
three full-time employees, according to museum Director Andrew Voth. HUGO

PLANNERS VOTE TO LET TRAILER RESIDENTS STAY PARKED 
</P>

Residents of a Van Nuys trailer park who say they cannot afford to move 
elsewhere won the first round Thursday in their fight to save their park from 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Going against a staff recommendation, the Los Angeles city Planning Commission 
unanimously approved a zoning change that will protect the park from 
development and its 38 residents from being forced to move, at least for the 
immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to change the zoning from manufacturing to multiple-family 
residential. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning of the battle," said Don Schultz, president of the 
Van Nuys Residents Assn., which is aiding the park's residents. "We want to 
help them save their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area, initiated the zoning change for 
the 27-unit Woodley Trailer Lodge after the park property was bought last year 
by Yechezel Lehavi. 
</P>
<P>
Lehavi said at the time that he planned to close the park and put an industrial 
development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning change still must be approved by the City Council's Planning and 
Land Use Management Committee and the full council before it is final. 
</P>
<P>
The park, sandwiched between small factories, has existed on almost an acre of 
land at 7936 Woodley Ave. since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to develop the property, then he will have to find residents a 
suitable place to live," Wachs aide Tom Henry said of Lehavi. "The councilman's 
concern lies with the residents." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Bowman said on behalf of Lehavi that the burden of providing 
low-income housing should not be placed on the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
"The area is clearly incompatible with a residential use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park resident Dawn G. Couch said she and her neighbors like living there 
and fear what might happen if they are forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to move our trailers out on the street if the park closes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailers owned by the park's residents are an older type banned at most 
mobile home parks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not poor but we can't qualify for loans to buy homes and we can't afford 
apartments. What it boils down to is that we've found a lifestyle that fits our 
budgets," Couch added. 
</P>
<P>
Park resident John Kulp said while waiting for the Planning Commission to 
consider the trailer park zoning change that he had heard the commissioners 
extensively discuss saving oak trees from development. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we're talking about saving people," he said. "Shouldn't that be just as 
important? You can't just come in and bulldoze people." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner William R. Christopher said the change to residential zoning will 
provide an incentive for the park owner to find suitable housing for residents. 
"Then, he can seek another zone change if he wants to develop the property," 
Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman William G. Luddy agreed that the zone change offers the 
most protection for park residents. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "We can't just say we're going to change the zone and walk away 
from it. This is a citywide problem. We have to create more affordable housing. 
We must continue to push for solutions." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Bowman said Lehavi will fight the zone change. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the city is really abdicating its responsibility here," he said.

CHARGES DISMISSED IN THREATS AGAINST BUSH AND REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge dismissed charges Thursday against a Glendale man accused of 
threatening President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan after ruling the 
indictment against him was too vague. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Court Judge Terry Hatter ordered Karl Robert Schmidt, 44, to 
remain in federal custody because the government may refile charges against 
him. A bail hearing will be held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A jury had been sworn in for the trial of Schmidt, indicted on two counts of 
making threats against Bush and one count each of threatening Reagan and his 
wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
A federal complaint and Secret Service affidavit contended that Schmidt called 
the White House on Nov. 9 and said he was "sick and tired of what Bush is 
doing" and that he was "going to blow the President's brains out." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Schmidt called the Secret Service in Los Angeles and made 
similar statements, including threats against the Reagans. The conversations 
were recorded, and Schmidt allegedly admitted to Glendale police that he had 
made the threats, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
But the indictment did not specify the nature of the statements that Schmidt 
allegedly made or indicate when they were made -- whether during one of the 
phone conversations or at the police station, Schmidt's attorney successfully 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the government can make a specific claim against a person, it shouldn't 
bring a case," attorney Mary Gibbons said after the dismissal. "The indictment 
simply said Karl Schmidt threatened the President." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman said he told Hatter in court Thursday which 
specific statements or phone calls were being prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"His action today was to grant a mistrial based on an indictment which did not 
provide enough details," Hochman said in an interview. "We believe the 
indictment sufficiently advised the defendant of what threatening statements he 
made . . . and it is our contention that each count sufficiently stated the 
threats." 
</P>
<P>
Hochman refused to comment on whether the government would file new charges. 
Hochman and Gibbons said that Hatter on Thursday said he did not expect double 
jeopardy -- the unconstitutional prosecution of a person twice for the same 
crime -- to occur if a new indictment was sought. 
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons said she will raise the question of double jeopardy if new charges 
are filed against Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Hochman said he will request on Monday that bail be denied. Schmidt has been in 
custody without bail since Nov. 9 at the Metropolitan Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Gibbons said Schmidt, disabled with a back injury, 
called the White House and Secret Service because he had not received benefits 
promised to him by the Social Security Administration. 
</P>
<P>
She said Schmidt made statements against Bush and Reagan but that they were 
made out of "frustration" and did not constitute an actual threat.

POLICE HONOR BOY WHO 'CAUGHT A BIG BURGLAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As crime-busters go, Tyler Scott Gossett of Glendale is definitely an early 
bloomer. He thwarted a daylight burglary at his neighbor's home -- at age 4. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Tyler, who turned 5 last month, spotted the break-in and gave them a 
description that led to an arrest and the recovery of his neighbor's jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, Glendale police visited Sunshine Nursery School in Tujunga to 
pay tribute. In front of his applauding classmates, Capt. Glynn Martin gave the 
boy a framed certificate of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you all know what he did?" Martin asked the children. "He caught a big 
burglar for us." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Martin, a 25-year department veteran, described the 
achievement in adult language: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first instance we know of where someone this young saw a burglary 
taking place and was essentially able to cause the arrest of the burglar," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Tyler was playing in his room Jan. 23 when he 
heard glass break and saw a man in his neighbor's back yard. He ran to tell his 
mother, who was in another room. 
</P>
<P>
"I went and looked, and I didn't see anything," Betsy Gossett recalled 
Thursday. "I went back to what I was doing, and being a kid, he kept watching 
because he knew what he saw." 
</P>
<P>
When the suspicious man returned to the yard, Tyler "came and got me, and we 
both saw him climbing in the window," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Gossetts had just moved in, the mother and her son walked next door 
and checked with another neighbor to make sure that the man they saw was not a 
resident of the house. The neighbor called 911. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Joseph Anthony Piraino, 24, of Los Angeles, who they said was 
carrying jewelry and rifle ammunition from the house. Police said Piraino is a 
state prison parolee who has been linked to one other burglary in Glendale and 
five in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a written report, Officer Michael Walker said Tyler "provided a detailed 
description of the suspect, notified his mother, Betsy, of the suspect's 
actions and guided me to the point of entry. This arrest would not have been 
possible without Tyler's assistance," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler told police that the burglar was a white man with a mustache, wearing 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred at the home of real estate agent Gloria Barnes, who 
attended the ceremony honoring Tyler. The boy's father, Scott Gossett, brought 
his video camera to proudly record the event. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father and teachers described Tyler as an outgoing child who enjoys 
riding his bicycle and watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on television. 
</P>
<P>
But surrounded Thursday by police officers, flashing cameras and inquisitive 
reporters, the boy turned shy and declined to talk about the crime or the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll remember this," Scott Gossett assured onlookers. "This is pretty good." 
</P>

COUPLE CARING FOR 5 CHILDREN WITH AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
FOSTER PARENTS: A WOODLAND HILLS COUPLE MAKES A HOME FOR AILING YOUNGSTERS AND 
SHARES THEIR LOVE WITH SIX OTHER ADOPTED CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bureaucratic designation for the five small children Christine and 
Roosevelt Coleman have taken into their home is "medically fragile." 
</P>
<P>
That means the children, all under 3 years old, probably won't live more than 
five more years because they all have AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best luck the children have had in their short lives is that there 
are foster parents such as the Colemans. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills couple care for more children with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, than any other foster parents in Los Angeles 
County, according to officials of the county Department of Children's Services. 
And they have six other adopted children from troubled backgrounds, for a total 
of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Coleman carries gloves, a mask and goggles in a diaper bag on her 
frequent trips to the hospital, in case she must be present during procedures 
that might splash her with blood. She uses medical terms with an ease gained 
from intensive independent study of the disease as she recounts how she watched 
5-month-old twins die in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The wasting stage of the illness attacks the body systemically," she said 
Thursday. Her husband and their six healthy adopted children joined her during 
an interview in a cramped radio station studio in Sepulveda, part of a campaign 
to encourage foster care and adoption of AIDS-afflicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
"No part of the body is spared . . . They died five days apart to the minute." 
</P>
<P>
But, Coleman said: "The most difficult time in dealing with it is when they are 
healthy. In their own little minds they might have plans for the future. When 
they talk about 'When I grow up,' that's when it's the saddest. That's when I 
have to get up and go out of the room." 
</P>
<P>
When the Colemans first decided to adopt children after learning Christine 
could not give birth, they chose to take in those from troubled backgrounds, 
including children of drug addicts. Growing news about AIDS-infected babies 
born to intravenous drug users caused them to consider the possibility that one 
of the children they had adopted might be at risk. In looking for information, 
they learned of the pressing need for adults who would care for AIDS-infected 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
County child welfare officials estimate that they encounter 20 such babies a 
month. The incidence of AIDS among pregnant women in Los Angeles County is 
estimated at 1 in 1,000 by groups and officials trying to deal with the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Christine, who grew up in a family torn by drug addiction, studied the risk of 
transmission and decided that caring for AIDS-infected babies was something 
that she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Coleman, who runs a toxic chemical disposal company from the family 
home, said it took some persuading. 
</P>
<P>
"The main concern was about the possibility of them biting and stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the family and two live-in housekeepers have undergone training that has 
prepared them to handle the babies and increased their sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about infection, 13-year-old Teddy said, "It doesn't 
concern me. When there's blood, the kids don't touch it because they've been 
trained not to touch it." 
</P>
<P>
Only one neighbor family grew suddenly reticent about letting their children 
play with the Coleman children, she said. Otherwise, she said, the family has 
encountered no local hostility, such as that confronted by Ryan White, who died 
Sunday of AIDS at age 18 after becoming nationally known for fighting prejudice 
in his Indiana school. Instead, they have gotten much support and encouragement 
at school and activities such as Little League baseball, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is more awareness," Christine Coleman said. "You might get 
problems in more backward areas or parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman is active in encouraging and training foster parents interested in 
caring for babies with AIDS. She promotes the cause at events such as an 
upcoming benefit for a group called Caring For Babies with AIDS, which wants to 
establish a group home for afflicted babies in Los Angeles. 
</P>

also caring for five children with AIDS. Welfare officials would not permit the 
AIDS-afflicted children to be photographed because of state privacy guidelines.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HOLLYWOOD MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old North Hollywood resident was found guilty Thursday of shooting a 
man to death after robbing him of his gambling winnings. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated one day before finding Manuel 
Castellano guilty of first-degree murder in the March 31, 1987, shooting death 
of Enrique Mendoza, 32. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after Mendoza won an undisclosed sum of money in a card 
and dice game in a garage in the 7300 block of Tampa Avenue, said Deputy Public 
Defender Daniel A. Kuperberg, Castellano's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
After offering Mendoza a ride home, Castellano drove him to the parking lot of 
the Loehmann's Plaza shopping center at Victory Boulevard and Tampa Avenue and 
shot him, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of a delivery truck found Mendoza's body the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Kuperberg contended that the key witness against Castellano, Bonerge Maldonado, 
shot Castellano. Maldonado, who was present at the card game and shooting, was 
given immunity in exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano, a native of El Salvador, faces a maximum sentence of 27 years to 
life when he is sentenced on May 10, Kuperberg said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 ARRESTED IN RAID BY CARGO THEFT TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A multiagency task force of law officers caught four suspected thieves Thursday 
morning as they unloaded $74,000 worth of stereo speakers from a stolen cargo 
trailer at a North Hollywood warehouse, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cargo Criminal Apprehension Team, made up of officers from the California 
Highway Patrol, FBI, Los Angeles Port Police, Long Beach Police Department and 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, raided the warehouse in the 13100 
block of Sherman Way at 1:30 a.m. and made the arrests without incident, 
Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Ben Bachsiam, 46, of Tarzana, who leased the warehouse, and Gilbert 
Ventura Tinker, 59, Carlos Navarette, 50, and Ramon Marcos Arellano, 26, all of 
Los Angeles, were arrested on suspicion of grand theft, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo trailer containing the speakers had been stolen Monday night in City 
of Industry, Hunter said. It was seen by sheriff's deputies Wednesday evening 
parked on Peck Road near the Pomona Freeway. The task force, which was formed 
earlier this year to combat thefts of shipping and trucking cargo, placed the 
trailer under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that late Wednesday the officers watched as the suspects arrived 
and hooked a tractor to the trailer. It was driven to the North Hollywood 
warehouse, and the arrests were made as the truck was being unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
In the warehouse, officers also found 45 filing cabinets that had been stolen 
three weeks ago in Santa Fe Springs, Hunter said. The suspects were being held 
at the sheriff's station in Carson on a bond of $1,500 each.

INGLEWOOD OFFERS TEACHERS FUNDS TO CUT ABSENTEEISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to break an impasse in contract talks, negotiators for the 
Inglewood Unified School District this week offered to give teachers half the 
money the district would save if teachers reduce their absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
The district has allocated about $1 million for substitute teachers this 
academic year but expects to actually spend almost twice that amount, according 
to Lester Jones, the district's chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
The Substitute Teacher Reduction Partnership Agreement would split any savings 
for next year between year-end bonuses for teachers and school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a 'win-win' opportunity for the entire district," Jones said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Teachers Assn. President Cheryl Bell, however, called the latest 
district offer "no big deal" and said the two sides are still far apart. The 
teachers have authorized a strike if no resolution comes soon.

RESIDENTS SUE UNIVERSAL IN DISPUTE OVER NEW ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing an increase in traffic, noise and pollution, disgruntled neighbors of 
Universal Studios are suing to halt construction of a roadway they say violates 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from nine residents of Blair Drive stopped work for three days earlier 
this week to give Los Angeles County officials time to inspect the project and 
determine whether it violates provisions of a 1980 conditional-use permit. 
Inspectors found no violations and work was allowed to resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In their suit, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the 
residents claim that MCA Inc., the studio's parent company, violated county 
zoning laws by building a road that will connect Coral Drive, which runs 
alongside the northbound lanes of the Hollywood Freeway, to an existing parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Residents claim a 1980 conditional-use permit requires that the land where the 
road is being built be preserved as a buffer between the studio and the homes 
that cover the hillside to the south. Other provisions of that permit stipulate 
that the land not be accessible to the public and prohibit parking, residents 
said. The residents also argued that an environmental impact report should have 
been prepared before bulldozers began grading the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you imagine living across from Disneyland?" asked Myriam Giovannini, a 
resident involved in the lawsuit. "We are going to have thousands of cars going 
by on this road." 
</P>
<P>
But county officials said Thursday that MCA has abided by all provisions of the 
permit that still apply. Some conditions applied only to a 1980 grading project 
and are no longer in effect, said Rudy Lackner, an assistant administrator for 
the county's regional planning department. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Spungin, president of MCA Development, said provisions prohibiting public 
access to the land were invalidated when the city annexed Coral Drive, once 
MCA's private access road, and made it a public street. 
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on using the land for parking still apply, but Spungin said MCA 
has applied for a change to the permit that would allow construction of a 
parking facility. That request is scheduled to be considered by the county in 
the next few weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spungin said MCA built the road to ease congestion along Universal Center 
Drive, which currently provides access to the existing lot, where visitors to 
the Universal Studios Tour park. 
</P>
<P>
Following repeated calls from the residents of Blair Drive, the county 
counsel's office on Monday ordered work at the site to halt long enough for 
regional planning inspectors to assess whether MCA was in violation of its 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Charles Moore said in a letter to the Department of 
Building and Safety that no violations were found and work "can resume 
immediately based upon its substantial conformance to the controlling zoning 
and environmental clearances." 
</P>
<P>
The nine residents involved in the suit are a faction of a community group that 
has been negotiating with MCA over the proposed changes to the conditional use 
permit, said Dan Riffe, president of the Hollywood Knolls Community Club. Riffe 
said Wednesday's suit was "not an action of the club and not sanctioned by the 
club." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Thursday, many of the nine residents complained that the 
neighborhood association moved too slowly in its negotiations with MCA.

AGENCIES BANKING ON APPEAL OF EAST BLOC IN ADS

GE is bringing Eastern Europe to life. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, so are Pepsi, McDonald's and Shearson Lehman Hutton. In fact, 
companies are jumping on the advertising bandwagon that portrays the East Bloc 
countries as rather happily falling under the magical spell of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
The latest is General Electric, which last Sunday morning tried to appeal 
directly to America's opinion leaders and business executives by airing its 
East Bloc-themed commercial on such shows as "Meet the Press" and "This Week 
With David Brinkley." The commercial, filmed in Hungary, portrays General 
Electric's joint venture to manufacture light bulbs there as something no less 
historically significant than, say, McDonald's hamburgers being sold near Red 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting the business executive," said Barbara Parsky, manager of 
corporate advertising at General Electric. "The message here is that General 
Electric continues to undergo global expansion. This is, perhaps, our most 
dramatic example." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second commercial is set to the music of "Hungarian Rhapsodies" and 
opens with a striking shot of late afternoon sunlight reflecting off the Danube 
River. A young man with a thick accent says: "Freedom's all that matters. 
Freedom is everything." 
</P>
<P>
Lights seem to appear everywhere in the city as the sun slowly sets. "There's a 
new light shining over Eastern Europe," says an off-camera announcer, who 
briefly explains the venture between GE and Tungsram Co., one of Hungary's 
largest light bulb makers. In November, GE purchased half of Tungsram for $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial continues with a candlelight procession of people crossing a 
bridge as electric lights illuminate monuments and museums. The spot ends with 
the familiar slogan, "GE -- We bring good things to life," as a little girl 
lights a single candle. 
</P>
<P>
To film the ad, GE spared few expenses. Although GE declined to reveal its 
production budget, industry executives say the commercial could have cost 
nearly $1 million to produce. It was created by the New York agency BBDO 
Worldwide, which also created an ad for Pepsi that aired during the Christmas 
season showing people celebrating at the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Pepsi's message was to the consumer. But the GE message is business to 
business," said Ted Sann, executive creative director at BBDO. "Maybe we have 
jumped on a bandwagon with these ads. But these are events on the tops of 
people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, an ad for Shearson Lehman Hutton aired during an ABC "Monday 
Night Football" game that showed signs of acceptance by some Communist 
consumers of capitalistic trends. One boy in an unspecified Communist nation is 
even seen skateboarding in a park behind a monument of the Communist Party 
symbol, the hammer and sickle. And a soldier from some East Bloc nation is seen 
munching a hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, one New York agency brought the whole Eastern European 
advertising theme into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
That agency, Deutsch Inc., produced an ad for a Swedish furniture maker, Ikea, 
that lampoons how "hip" the East Bloc themes have become. 
</P>
<P>
In the ad, a snobbish woman is on the phone discussing her upcoming East 
Bloc-themed party. She orders a special caterer from Budapest. And she even 
requests a cake made to look like the Berlin Wall. Explains the woman to her 
friend: "Everyone will chip away at it with their forks." 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in the Golden Age of capitalism," said Amil Gargano, chairman of 
the New York agency Ally &amp; Gargano, which created the ad for Shearson 
Lehman Hutton. "A lot of people are embracing capitalism. And certainly 
Shearson Lehman can be influential in helping some people get into the free 
enterprise system." 
</P>
<P>
"These changes are so fundamental and so far reaching that it is not something 
that will go away," said Gargano. "The question is: Who are the companies that 
will profit from this?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has had a manufacturing facility in Hungary for 
years. But the company says that factory isn't about to be the focus of any 
commercials. After all, most Levi ads are targeted toward teens. "This is not 
to say that teen-agers aren't interested in what's happening in Eastern Europe, 
but we usually go with something much closer to home," said Dan Chew, marketing 
manager at Levi Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Madison Avenue has also found ways to have some fun mixing the 
customs from two very different cultures. But the commercials haven't always 
pleased everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Who can forget the commercial Wendy's ran several years ago that featured 
oversized Russian women parading around with flashlights and beach balls in an 
off-the-wall Russian fashion show? The ad was created by the New York agency 
Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the commercial's popularity, a reporter from a New York TV 
station persuaded an official from the Soviet news agency Tass to watch the ad 
while the station's cameras filmed his reaction. The official chuckled through 
the entire commercial, but when he was asked what he thought of the ad, he got 
very straight-faced and said it wasn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't blame advertisers today for wanting to tap into the incredibly 
emotional situation in Eastern Europe," said Cliff Freeman, chairman of the 
agency that made the ad. "But I still haven't seen any ads that do it very 
well."

GROUP WILL TARGET THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OF PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initiatives aimed at stopping what are described as deceptive practices by 
consumer product makers -- including an "Environmental Hall of Shame" and 
supermarket efforts to police environmental claims -- will be unveiled today. 
</P>
<P>
Under one program, retailers -- including Ralphs supermarkets -- will for the 
first time establish environmental standards for products and ask manufacturers 
to substantiate environmental claims that have popped up on everything from 
trash bags to disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to have tough, specific and comprehensive standards to keep 
Green Consumerism from turning into a ruse," said Craig Merrilees, special 
projects director for the National Toxics Campaign Fund, which is part of a 
loose knit coalition of environmental, consumer, law enforcement and retailing 
groups that will present their plans at a Washington news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern on this issue generally has been that there are all kinds of 
advertising product claims and the public has very little way to judge," said 
Dave Rapaport, toxics campaign director for Greenpeace U.S.A. "When you do look 
in-depth at some of the claims being made on behalf of products, what we've 
seen is that they seem more based on a marketing strategy for selling them than 
addressing true environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from consumer and environmental groups will also induct 
products they claim use deceptive or exaggerated environmental claims into an 
"Environmental Hall of Shame." 
</P>
<P>
This assault, however, will focus on retailers who carry the products. Previous 
attempts to deal with misleading environmental labels have focused on the 
manufacturers themselves, said Merrilees. 
</P>
<P>
"Many retailers have turned a blind eye to a lot of the manufacturers' 
environmental claims that are turning up in the merchandise they sell," said 
Merrilees. "The retailers and environmentalists are recognizing a common 
interest and opportunity here." 
</P>
<P>
Four Western supermarket chains -- Ralphs, Raley's in Northern California, Fred 
Meyer in the Northwest and ABCO in Arizona -- will set up standards on 
environmental claims and ask manufacturers to support those claims, said 
Merrilees. For example, a supermarket might allow a product to claim it is 
recyclable only if 50% or more of its contents can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
An even tougher set of criteria must be met for products to pass a "green label 
certification" program. For example, a green label might be awarded to a paper 
towel that was made from timber grown on a tree farm, whitened with a steam 
process instead of chlorine bleach and packaged in a biodegradable material. 
</P>
<P>
Merrilees says environmental and consumer groups will also commission and 
publish a survey of retailers' efforts dealing with environmental claims. 
</P>
<P>
New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams, who is working with his counterparts in 
other states, will unveil plans to investigate and prosecute false and 
misleading environmental claims. 
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of the campaign is being supported by a wide-ranging coalition 
that includes Public Interest Research Groups, Public Citizen and Clean Water 
Action. But some groups were less than supportive of specific initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace's Rapaport, for example, was skeptical about the retailer's green 
label certification. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's going to take more than a simple green seal saying this is 
environmentally friendly to spur truly environmentally sound products," said 
Rapaport. "In some, the real environmental impacts of consumer products are not 
simple. It may also involve impacts during the use and disposal of the product, 
and it's difficult for an environmental seal that simply says this is a good 
product and this is a bad product to evaluate those things."

SEC Probing First Chicago Statements: The Securities and Exchange Commission 
has begun an inquiry into allegations that First Chicago Corp. leaked certain 
sensitive information to securities analysts in advance of a public 
announcement projecting lower first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the probe has the potential to change the landscape of their 
profession. The SEC declined to comment on the inquiry. The analysts worry that 
allegations that First Chicago improperly disclosed an impending increase in 
non-performing loans could freeze the information flow that is their lifeblood. 
They said what they learned from First Chicago was the routine information that 
their profession relies on.

GLADSTONE'S 4 FISH SOLD BACK TO ORIGINAL OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gladstone's 4 Fish, a Los Angeles beachfront institution, has been sold back to 
its original owner and a prominent Orange County businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Enterprises Group of Irvine sold Gladstone's, a seafood house 
located at the base of Sunset Boulevard near Pacific Palisades, and another 
restaurant, R.J.'s the Rib Joint in Beverly Hills, to IHV Corp. for $13.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
IHV is owned by Gladstone's founder, Robert J. Morris, and former Balboa Bay 
Club president Richard S. Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Morris sold Gladstone's and R.J.'s to W. R. Grace Co. in 1983 for $6.5 million, 
and the the two restaurants were later acquired by Restaurant Enterprises in a 
leveraged buyout. Morris has remained manager throughout the ownership changes. 
</P>
<P>
Gladstone's serves 1.1 million guests a year, with gross receipts of $13 
million, which Morris said makes it the top restaurant in sales in California 
and eighth-largest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled at owning the company again," said Morris from his office at 
Gladstone's. 
</P>
<P>
He said he sold the two restaurants seven years ago so that he could pay off 
loans from his father before he died. And he has no regrets about having to pay 
twice what he sold it for to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more money, and we made it worth a lot more money," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, now a resident of Bel Air, described Gladstone's as "the eighth wonder 
of the world" and said the deal is the first of several ventures IHV is 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who grew up in Malibu, built Gladstone's in 1972 along the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Its fresh fish menu and picturesque location gave the restaurant 
a distinctly California appeal that attracted locals and visitors alike. The 
restaurant features barrels of free peanuts for waiting customers and chocolate 
chips served with after-dinner coffee.

Paramount Modifies Rental Fees: Paramount Pictures, which last year provoked a 
congressional investigation after changing the film rental fees it charges to 
discount movie theaters, said it has modified the fees. Paramount said it will 
now charge theaters a percentage of a film's box office gross four months after 
a movie is released, instead of five months after the release. 
</P>
<P>
In the first four months after release, Paramount will continue to charge 
theaters a minimum per person payment of $1.05 for adults and 75 cents for 
children, or 35% of the box office gross, whichever is higher. Paramount last 
May instituted the minimum per-capita payment, prompting an outcry from 
discount movie theaters, which show second-run films for an admission price as 
low as $1.

OPEC READY TO HELP RESTORE OIL PRICES TO KEY $18-A-BARREL LEVEL

In the midst of wild price swings in the oil market, OPEC President Sadek 
Boussena said Thursday that the oil cartel is ready to act to restore prices to 
their benchmark level of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Prices again dropped Thursday, following the wild session Wednesday that saw 
prices plunge but then recover. 
</P>
<P>
Spot crude oil closed 28 cents lower at $17.78 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, adding to this week's setback of $4. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is unhinged from its one-day rally, and there's some skepticism 
about OPEC," said Andrew Lebow, analyst with E.D.&amp; F. Man. 
</P>
<P>
An Energy Department report of a 7.2-million barrel buildup in crude stocks 
last week also weighed on prices. 
</P>
<P>
The markets are closed today. 
</P>
<P>
May heating oil was the sole gainer, closing up 0.20 cent to 53.83 cents a 
gallon. May gasoline eased 1.03 cents to 58.55 cents a gallon on selling fed by 
market views that supplies will be plentiful as refiners process the huge 
amounts of crude oil that are now swelling U.S. inventories.

SEC PROBE ADDS TO LANDMARK LAND CO.'S WOES; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: AN INVESTIGATION INTO ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IS THE GOLF COURSE 
DEVELOPER'S LATEST REGULATORY PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problems are mounting at Landmark Land Co., the nationally recognized golf 
course developer whose operations have been hammered by growing losses in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The Carmel, Calif.-based firm recently disclosed in public documents that it is 
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for questionable 
accounting practices on a land deal last year near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the probe, the firm said it may have to postpone taking more 
than $24 million in profits on the sale. A deferral would boost Landmark's 
losses in 1989 to $61.7 million and wipe out its shareholders equity, the firm 
said in its annual 10-K report on file with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark's SEC problems are the latest in a series of woes that include major 
losses in a savings and loan subsidiary from repossessed mobile homes, real 
estate foreclosures and junk bond writeoffs, the firm has disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also is a victim of last year's thrift bailout law, which in effect 
cut off a major source of funding, forcing it to sell or refinance its prime 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark Land owns about two dozen golf courses around the country -- including 
Mission Hills, PGA West and La Quinta in the Palm Springs area -- as well as a 
savings and loan in New Orleans, known as Oak Tree Savings, that financed 
Landmark's extensive development activities. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark also has developed major properties in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Florida, 
South Carolina and throughout California. It has major developments under way 
in California near Riverside, Sacramento and Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark is known in sporting circles as one of the nation's premier developers 
of high-end golf courses. One of its best-known properties is the Oak Tree Golf 
Club near Oklahoma City, where the 1988 PGA golf championship was played. 
</P>
<P>
The company's principal shareholder is Gerald G. Barton, a 58-year-old native 
Oklahoman who owns about 29% of Landmark's stock. Another major shareholder is 
Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Toronto real estate company, which owns 
25%. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock, traded on the American Stock Exchange, has been extremely 
volatile, trading as high as $22.625 and as low as $6 a share in the past year. 
Ignored by most financial analysts, the stock closed Thursday at $17.50 a 
share, up $2.125. Landmark suspended its dividend last December. 
</P>
<P>
Barton has run Landmark, a one-time sugar company that had major real estate 
holdings, for about 20 years, making money by developing golf courses -- 
surrounded by residential homes -- for a wealthy elite who spend weekends in 
tony places such as Palm Springs and Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
"His basic premise was there is an affluent set of people who will pay 
astronomical prices for premier golf courses and the houses around them," said 
Kenneth D. Campbell, president of Audit Investments, an investment advisory 
firm in Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The company, however, ran into deep trouble last year after Congress passed 
tough bailout legislation for the S&amp;L industry that placed severe 
restrictions on thrift investment in real estate developments. 
</P>
<P>
The law shut off Landmark's funding from Oak Tree Savings and is forcing the 
thrift to divest itself of more than $1 billion in real estate assets, 
according to Landmark Vice President Doug Barton, Gerald Barton's son. The 
senior Barton was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to sell most of these properties, or restructure their loans, 
by the end of 1990, the younger Barton said in a phone interview. Landmark 
already has an agreement to sell its luxurious Carmel Valley Ranch Resort to 
American International Golf Resorts for $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark's problems with the SEC arose after it recognized a $24.3-million 
profit in 1989 on a vacant piece of land near the PGA West golf course that it 
had sold to a real estate syndication company. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, however, objected to 
the way the loan was structured, pointing out that the property's down payment 
came from Oak Tree Savings. Regulators don't want Landmark to recognize the 
full profit until additional payments on the Oak Tree loan are received. 
</P>
<P>
Both Landmark and its outside auditor, Price Waterhouse, have objected to the 
OTS interpretation, and it's up to the SEC to decide who is correct, Doug 
Barton said. The accounting dispute has also sparked a shareholder lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS also wants Landmark to increase its reserves for loan losses by another 
$48 million on other development loans, including one on the La Quinta Hotel.

BOND PRICES DECLINE IN QUIET TRADING 
</P>

<P>
Bond prices slipped Thursday in light trading, with little economic news to 
affect the direction of the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/32 point, or about $2.19 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which rises when the price declines, rose to 8.59% from 8.57% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>

Late in the day, the Resolution Trust Corp. announced plans to borrow $45.3 
billion for its savings and loan bailout in the current quarter. The RTC's 
oversight board, a panel led by the Treasury Department that controls the 
policy and purse strings of the program, said it has authorized regulators to 
borrow up to $45.3 billion in the April-June quarter. It had authorized $11 
billion in the January-March period. 
</P>
<P>
Economists caution that the heavy borrowing could unsettle debt markets and 
nudge up short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, unchanged from late Wednesday.

TIGHT PORK SUPPLIES BOOST THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pork prices rose strongly Thursday as tight supplies and steady demand for pork 
products continued to boost the market. 
</P>
<P>
In New York commodity markets, copper prices fell for a second straight day, 
while cocoa ended higher after a volatile trading session. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices fell in choppy trading as dealers squared their books ahead of the 
three-day Easter weekend. All U.S. commodity markets will be closed today. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Thursday, live hog prices set contract highs 
in all months, while pork bellies also ended strongly. 
</P>
<P>
According to livestock analysts and traders, many of the larger hog-producing 
operations are already at capacity and are unable to increase herd size to meet 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Live hogs for June delivery closed at 60.05 cents a pound, up 0.15 cent. 
</P>
<P>
Pork bellies for May delivery rose 1.225 cents to close at 59.025 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, copper traded on the Commodity Exchange in New York fell again, 
marking the first time in nearly two weeks the volatile market has moved in the 
same direction for two consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
Copper for April delivery fell 1.70 cents to $1.1930 a pound after a late 
selloff that most traders said was based on technical factors.

DOW GETS IN HOLIDAY MOOD, ADVANCES 22.07 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market broke the stalemate of the past several sessions with a rally 
in quiet pre-holiday trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 22.07 to 2,751.80, finishing the 
week with a net gain of 34.68 points. 
</P>
<P>
That snapped a streak of six consecutive trading days in which the Dow 
industrials neither rose nor fell by as much as 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 908 up, 573 down and 518 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 142.47 million shares, against 141.08 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
173.70 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders came into the session with low expectations, given the 
market's recent sluggish behavior and the approach of a long holiday weekend. 
The markets will be closed for Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of selling pressure 
helped produce some pleasant surprises in the price fluctuations of individual 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported that retail sales dropped 0.6% in March, in contrast to 
advance estimates of a small increase. That served as a new suggestion of 
continued sluggish, erratic economic growth, along with possibly less upward 
pressure on interest rates than has been feared of late. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted that favorable profit reports from several companies 
contributed to the upbeat mood. For example, Chemical Banking, which posted 
higher quarterly profits, gained 1 1/8 to 24 1/2. Most other money-center bank 
issues moved up in sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Federal National Mortgage jumped 1 3/4 to 36 3/4 after reporting on Wednesday a 
67% increase in its first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae warrants, which give their owners the right to buy the stock at 
$14.75 a share, rose 1 1/2 to 21 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Cities/ABC jumped 15 1/4 to 541 1/2, apparently on optimism about 
earnings. Elsewhere, Teledyne tumbled 3 1/4 to 67 7/8 after reporting that 
earnings from continuing operations fell 7% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Vons lost 1 1/4 to 21 1/4. But the drop appeared to be the result of a single 
trade of a large block rather than broad selling, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chip industrials included GE, up 1 1/8 at 66; IBM, up 
3/4 at 107 1/8; McDonald's, up 1/2 at 32 5/8; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1/2 at 
71 1/4, and Coca-Cola, up 1/2 at 80 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei stock index closed at 29,623.20, up 182.92 
points, or 0.62%. In Frankfurt, the DAX index jumped 24.40 points, or 1.3%, to 
1,918.17, driven by foreign demand for shares, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares closed mixed with a firmer tone taking heart from gains on 
Wall Street, but volume was light ahead of the Easter holiday. The Financial 
Times 100-share index closed up 6.6 at 2,222.1.

TOM WAITS SUES FRITO-LAY, SAYS HIS VOICE APPROPRIATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Tom Waits testified Thursday that he was shocked, embarrassed, and 
"angry -- very angry," the first time he heard a corn chip radio jingle that 
imitated his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody had studied me a little too close," Waits said on the third day of 
what is expected to be a two-week trial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the equivalent of all the scars, dimples, the lines all being in the 
same place. . . . It was a little spooky." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Waits are trying to persuade U.S. District Court jurors of a 
novel claim: that his voice was illegally impersonated when Frito-Lay Inc. of 
Plano, Tex., used a sound-alike artist in an ad campaign for a new corn chip, 
the Salsa Rio Dorito. Waits has asked for at least $4 million from Frito-Lay 
and its ad agency, Tracey-Locke Inc. of Dallas, because they allegedly damaged 
his reputation and conducted a false advertising campaign by airing the 
commercial, which sounds very similar to Waits' "Step Right Up." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, Steve Carter, the Texan who sang in the commercial, 
testified that while doing the commercial, he deliberately tried to copy Waits' 
voice.

KARCHER POSTS AN $8.9-MILLION LOSS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said Thursday that it lost $8.9 million in the 
fourth quarter, largely because of the establishment of a reserve to pay for 
the restructuring of its struggling Arizona operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based company set aside $14.5 million in the three-month period 
ended Jan. 29 for the restructuring, which could involve the sale, closing or 
franchising of its 40 Carl's Jr. outlets in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent that the Arizona market does not make economic sense 
for corporate operations," said Donald F. Karcher, the company's president and 
chief operating officer. "The future investment required would be prohibitive 
in view of the expected return." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter loss was on revenue of $118 million, compared to net 
earnings of $4.2 million on revenue of $111.3 million for the same period a 
year ago. For the year, the company's earnings slumped to $5.6 million on 
revenues of $511.3 million from $20.8 million on revenue of $445.9 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials attributed the fourth-quarter loss to the soft Arizona 
economy, which is depressed because of a real estate slump and the failure of 
many local financial institutions. The firm also cited strong competition, 
discounting and higher food prices as contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher, which entered Arizona in 1983, said operations there, particularly in 
the Phoenix area, have been a drain on earnings. The fast-food firm estimated 
that it lost $5 million in the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher said the company wants to redirect into stronger markets, including 
California, Nevada and Oregon. The company is also trying to expand its 
international presence with restaurants in Japan. Others are planned for 
western Canada and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"We will now focus our resources on our other proven markets," Karcher said in 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $9, down 25 cents in trading Thursday on the New 
York Stock Exchange. But industry analysts viewed Karcher's decision to 
reorganize, and possibly abandon, Arizona as a good one. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Rockwell, a fast-food industry analyst for Alexander Brown &amp; Sons 
in Baltimore, said the company was sound but was not willing to withstand 
losses for several years in a depressed market. "Carl's just said, 'enough is 
enough,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher officials said the chain, which has 553 company-owned and franchised 
restaurants that carry its distinctive Happy Star logo, has faced a series of 
obstacles ever since entering the Phoenix market seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Wisely, Karcher's group vice president for marketing, said that some 
of the best locations and opportunities for reasonably priced leases had been 
grabbed by competitors by the time the first Carl's Jr. restaurants were being 
established in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Greater Phoenix's suburban sprawl holds down sales because many areas are not 
densely populated enough to generate adequate sales volume at individual 
stores, he said. Advertising is expensive because of competition for the 
airwaves from manufacturers that have discovered Phoenix as a test market. 
</P>
<P>
In the less-developed Tucson market, however, Karcher has prospered enough that 
it was able to buy out eight former Wendy's locations to give it a total of 14 
Carl's Jrs. Wisely said that the restaurants in Tucson, which is a separate 
media market from Phoenix and is not as sprawling, have approached an average 
of $19,000 in sales a week, compared to $23,000 in the average Carl's Jr. 
restaurant in California. 
</P>
<P>
Though the market remains lucrative, Wisely said that the Tucson operations 
would become too unwieldy to manage from afar if the Phoenix restaurants are 
sold off or franchised. A Flagstaff outlet is already franchised. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial problems in Arizona, Loren Pannier, Karcher's chief 
financial officer, said the company is still growth-minded in its proven 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole exportability of Carl's Jr. is alive and well," he said. "What we 
have is the weak link of Phoenix."

Mitsubishi Rayon Co., a leading Japanese chemical company, said it plans to 
open a facility at the Bayport Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dianal America Inc., a fully owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Rayon, will 
specialize in production of acrylic specialty polymers, used in production of 
toners for copy machines, inks, adhesives and paints. 
</P>
<P>
The first Japanese chemical plant opened six years ago in the Bayport 
Industrial Park, along the Houston Ship Channel near Pasadena, said John Brock, 
president of the Greater Houston Partnership's Economic Development Division. 
</P>
<P>
Houston now is the only American city with six such facilities, he said. The 
others are Kaneka Texas Corp., Evalca, Zeon Chemicals Texas Inc., Nisseki 
Chemical Texas Inc., and Arakawa Chemical Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Dianal facility is expected to begin in July, with 
production beginning in mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique situation that will greatly benefit Houston's economy and job 
market," said Saadat Syal, an Economic Development Division vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, every job created at the actual chemical plant site will create 
another five more jobs in the community in construction, supplies and 
services." 
</P>
<P>
Houston was chosen over other cities because of the availability of its 
petrochemical infrastructure, port facilities and human resource capabilities, 
said Yataro Nagai, president of Mitsubishi Rayon.

LUMBER GROUP: JAPANESE ARE 'STONEWALLING'; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: AN AMERICAN INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS THERE'S NO REAL PROGRESS IN TALKS AIMED 
AT AVERTING U.S. SANCTIONS FOR ALLEGED UNFAIR PRACTICES. 
</P>

<P>
The president of the National Forest Products Assn., a U.S. trade group, has 
accused Japan of "stonewalling" in negotiations aimed at averting U.S. 
retaliation against Japan for allegedly unfair trade practices involving forest 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"Real progress in these negotiations could increase American sales to Japan by 
$2 billion a year," Barry M. Cullen said at a news conference here Wednesday. 
"We are not even close to that right now in these negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
He said last year's sales to the Japanese, mostly logs, amounted to $2.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The forestry talks opened on the heels of the settlement of disputes over 
supercomputers and satellites, and U.S. officials had hoped that they would 
wipe the slate clean, at least for the moment, of unfair trade complaints 
involving threats of retaliation against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. government negotiator, who asked not to be identified by name, said 
it is "very, very unlikely" that negotiators will reach agreement in the 
present round of talks on forest products. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no movement toward what we want," the negotiator said. 
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached by June 16, President Bush is empowered to impose 
retaliatory sanctions against Japan. The current round of talks is expected to 
continue today for a fifth day of talks that originally were scheduled to end 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen said U.S. forestry products firms are seeking "progress from the 
standpoint of an entire package" that deals with "tariffs, building codes, 
product standards, certification and classification procedures, subsidies and 
other structural issues such as housing and land-use policies." 
</P>
<P>
He said "to date, all of the discussion has focused on building codes and 
product standards, and that discussion has been very, very disappointing to us. 
We want to see substantial progress, (not) stonewalling." 
</P>
<P>
Cullen and other representatives of the U.S. forest products industry dismissed 
as out of date Japanese fears that construction of three- and four-story wooden 
buildings, including apartment houses, could put people in danger from fires 
and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which limits the height of wooden buildings to two stories, has offered 
to permit construction of three-story buildings in resort areas and uncrowded 
sections of small towns but not in urban areas, where demand for lumber would 
be the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald R. Walker, another official of the National Forest Products Assn., said 
Japanese negotiators had argued against accepting American building standards 
by saying that Japanese earthquakes are unique because of their severity. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet the strongest earthquakes that have occurred to date have been in other 
countries," Walker said.

RETIRED PILOTS DIE EARLIER THAN MOST, STUDY SAYS;

<P>
Sixty percent of 282 retired airline pilots included in a recent study died 
within five years of leaving their jobs, according to an international pilots 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Assns., which met 
in Washington this week, refused to speculate on the reasons for the large 
proportion of untimely deaths but said they have begun a worldwide study of the 
matter. The group represents about 700,000 pilots in 69 member organizations, 
mostly pilots unions. 
</P>
<P>
Mike M. Clarke, a pilot for British Airways and a vice president of the group, 
said he had based the initial study on pilot retirement records spanning the 
period 1953 to mid-1988. He said he had received little or no cooperation from 
the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said: "I told the pilots at the meeting (in Washington) that 60% of them 
would not be around when they were 65 years old. I told them that was what the 
current figures told us," he said in an interview this week. The longevity 
figures for the pilots are markedly worse than for the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the overall average 
life expectancy for Americans 60 years old is 20.4 years. At 65 it is 14.7 
years for men and 18.6 years for women. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the original study -- conducted by Clarke in Britain, Canada and 
Argentina -- involved only the 282 pilots, the findings were surprising. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Clarke said, pilots must undergo complete physical examinations 
before they begin work and subsequently must take physicals twice a year. Thus, 
if they have any illness, it is found much sooner than it is among the general 
public. Moreover, airline pilots retire at age 60 or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we should all be concerned that our profession, which demands such 
stringent mental and physical requirements for entry, does not appear, in spite 
of frequent medical checks throughout our careers, to enjoy life expectancy 
that could reasonably be expected from such an excellent starting position," 
Clarke said in a letter to member organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we work too hard? Are the stress levels in aviation too high? Do pilots 
smoke and drink too much and exercise too little?" 
</P>
<P>
Clarke conceded that 282 pilots is only a small sample but added, "Pilots are a 
very small segment of the population." 
</P>
<P>
Though there has been continued controversy in this country about the early 
retirement age for airline pilots, some other countries have even lower 
retirement ages. Retirement for pilots of British Airways, for example, is 55, 
and most other European airlines ground pilots at between 57 and 60. Nowhere in 
the world do airline pilots fly past the age of 60. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Buckhorn, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the 
controversy "has been going on for decades" but the rule has been unchanged 
since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an arbitrary rule," he said. "We don't have a vast amount of data." He 
said efforts by senior pilots to extend their flying years if they are in good 
health have been rejected by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The IFALPA study has been mailed to its member organizations, which will 
distribute and collect them from their members. When all of them have been 
returned and that is expected in June, they will be analyzed independently by 
the British Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation, which also helped write 
them. The group hopes to get 70,000 responses. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which will be anonymous, asks 47 questions of pilots, including the 
kind of planes flown, the pilot's age, sex, rank and whether the flights are 
long haul or short haul. The pilots are also asked how well they sleep away 
from home, whether they take medication to sleep, how they feel at the end of a 
flight, whether they smoke, drink or take drugs and if so how much. Questions 
also ask if they have had certain diseases and how their flying career has 
affected their sex lives. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Loftus, manager of work force education of the worker equity department 
of the American Assn. of Retired Persons, said: "It is a well-known truism that 
people who have not prepared for retirement will not survive for long. Pilots 
have a single focus in their lives -- flying. Take that away and they don't 
have anything to replace the sense of who they are." 
</P>
<P>
She said some pilots "do make sure that they other interests such as businesses 
or special hobbies that can take up the slack when they leave flying so they 
are not out on a cliff."

Champion Spark Plug will consolidate its U.S. manufacturing operations by 
closing two plants, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Champions's plan, plants in Toledo and Detroit will be integrated over 
the next two years into the company's Burlington, Iowa, and Cambridge, Ohio, 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the company and the United Auto Workers to meet regarding the 
timing and effects of the consolidation on production and maintenance 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
There currently are 245 salaried and hourly workers in Detroit and 403 in 
Toledo whose jobs would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said new jobs in Burlington and Cambridge would be created as 
a result of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely regret the impact this announcement would have on employees in 
Detroit and Toledo and on the two cities," said Jerry Godwin, Champion 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"Champion has been struggling for several years with an overcapacity of 
production facilities, while at the same time selling a product -- spark plugs 
-- whose overall market has declined," Godwin said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Champion plants in Toledo produce spark plug shells and assemble the final 
spark plugs. The Detroit plant manufactures ceramic insulation used in the 
plug. 
</P>
<P>
Champion is a division of Houston-based Cooper Industries Inc., which purchased 
the company last year.

MIKE DOWNEY: A DEADLINE POET FINALLY GETS DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't easy trying to be Lou Gehrig when they make you bat behind Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
With his one good eye, Jim Murray just keeps knocking 'em out of the park. He 
sees more clearly than anybody I know. "King of the Sports Page," is what 
Sports Illustrated called him, and that's what he is, the sultan of thought. 
</P>
<P>
They have finally presented my not-so-old friend a Pulitzer Prize, which is 
only about 20 years overdue. All those deserving pundits, editorial 
cartoonists, TV and movie critics who have won Pulitzers now have in their 
company a man who pounded out his poetry on deadline, in bad lighting, worse 
weather, rickety press boxes and hellish hotel rooms, from Malibu to Munich, 
night after night after night. 
</P>
<P>
We sat around swapping Jim Murray stories at the Masters golf tournament last 
week, so I told some of my favorites. Privately I was having a particularly 
giddy time, because I had been tipped off to the probability of the Pulitzer, 
which made me feel like a kid whose favorite uncle had just won the Irish 
Sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
I told the one about Arnold Palmer's golf ball being buried in the bunker, and 
Palmer spotting Murray somewhere in the gallery, and saying: "OK, Jim, you're 
always writing about how great Ben Hogan was. How would Hogan do in a situation 
like this?" 
</P>
<P>
To which Murray replied: "Hogan wouldn't have been in a situation like this." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the one Jim is always telling me, about how he tried to 
arrange an interview with Gary Player, and how the golfer was reluctant because 
somebody had informed him that Murray had a habit of misquoting people. 
</P>
<P>
"Misquoting people?" Murray replied. "Go tell Gary that I don't even quote 
people." 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who hasn't noticed, he doesn't. Not often, anyway, and certainly not 
at any substantive length. Jim Murray doesn't do interviews; he does 
impressions. He might visit with a subject for any number of hours, then go 
back to his keyboard and not use a word of it. Jim Murray doesn't quote people; 
people quote Jim Murray. 
</P>
<P>
I have long suspected that Murray has an automatic pilot on his word processor 
that he can punch any time he's on a tight deadline or feels tired. There is a 
button to punch marked: "One-Liners." All Murray has to do, then, is choose the 
proper category, quiz-show style -- as in, U.S. Cities for $100, Jim. ("There's 
nothing to do in Spokane after 10 o'clock." Pause. "In the morning.") 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the guy has to be cheating somehow. Nobody can be that good, day in and 
day out. 
</P>
<P>
This is the guy who rewrote the opening line of the Indianapolis 500 -- 
"Gentlemen, start you coffins." 
</P>
<P>
He also drove the Indy Speedway oval in 1975, after which Parnelli Jones 
approached Murray with his hand extended and said: "Congratulations! You have 
just completed the first Speedway run in history that could be timed by a 
calendar." 
</P>
<P>
Here is Jim Murray's lead from Zaire, Africa, when Muhammad Ali and George 
Foreman invited the eyes of the Western Hemisphere to follow them there: 
</P>
<P>
"All right, my good man, hand me my jodhpurs and pith helmet and polish my 
monocle. Get the elephant ready. Fire up the African Queen. Phone Berlitz and 
see what they have in the way of Swahili. Get Tarzan and Jane on the drum and 
see what they're doing Tuesday. See what you can find out about the tsetse fly. 
Call me Bwana. Let's hope Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner get to fight over me in 
the steaming jungle night." 
</P>
<P>
And that was just the first paragraph. That's a whole column's worth for some 
people. Jim hadn't even gotten around yet to saying that he thought Kinshasa 
was one of the Gabor sisters. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoy the privilege of knowing Jim Murray beyond the printed page. We have 
sort of a routine. We sit side by side in hermetically sealed press booths and 
I tell him who I saw on the late movie last night on TV and he tells me what 
that person was like in real life. 
</P>
<P>
He tells me about having drinks with DiMaggio and Monroe, or playing poker with 
Duke Wayne, or what a chatterbox Jack Webb could be when he wasn't shooting 
"Dragnet." I tend to shut up and nod a lot. 
</P>
<P>
One day I asked Murray about his house, which happens to be in a fashionable 
part of town. I wondered who some of his neighbors were. 
</P>
<P>
"Peggy Lee lives pretty close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"How far apart?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"About $900,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Very amusing, Mr. Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead, be that way. Be funnier than the rest of us. Be wiser than the rest 
of us. Win more Pulitzer Prizes than the rest of us, smarty pants. 
</P>
<P>
If you think we're just going to sit here and accept the fact that we are never 
going to be half the sportswriter you are, well, all I have to say is, mister, 
you're right. And you can quote me.

CRITICISM HAS FLAMES ABLAZE, 5-1;

<P>
NHL PLAYOFFS: TERRY CRISP JUGGLES EACH OF HIS LINES, AND CALGARY CUTS KINGS' 
LEAD TO 3-2.

<P>
Hold that funeral. The body has a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least. 
</P>
<P>
The Calgary Flames, buried under an avalanche of goals by the Kings Tuesday 
night, and riddled by a vicious attack from the Calgary media Wednesday, came 
back to life Thursday by beating the Kings, 5-1, to stave off elimination in 
the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings still lead the series, 3-2, after losing at the Olympic Saddledome 
before 20,166, with Game 6 at the Forum Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
If you believed the local headlines, there would be no Game 6. After the Kings 
embarrassed the Flames with an NHL playoff record 12 goals Tuesday night, 
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp became the whipping boy in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"Crisp Has Got To Go -- Now," blared a headline in the Calgary Herald. There 
was a choke handkerchief to be clipped out by faithless readers. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose, you get trashed," Crisp said after getting a little breathing room. 
"That's the way it is in the sports world. Coaches get hired one day and you 
lose, you get fired the next. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have no control over that, so we met as a team and said, let's go out 
and do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, in his third year and coming off a Stanley Cup-winning season, was 
criticized for not doing anything as the Kings slapped shot after shot into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
No timeouts. No line changes. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism was blunted Thursday when he shook up all of his lines. 
</P>
<P>
Theoren Fleury moved onto a line with Joe Nieuwendyk and Gary Robets, replacing 
Sergei Makarov. Joe Mullen was placed on a line with Paul Ranheim and Joel 
Otto. 
</P>
<P>
And in the biggest change of all, the Flames scored on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's loss of power on its specialty teams had been the most shocking 
aspect of the series. Look for clues as to how the Kings, fourth in the Smythe 
Division, could win three of four games from the Smythe winners and defending 
Stanley Cup champions, and the power play might be a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames had the best power play in the league during the regular season with 
a 27.7% success rate. 
</P>
<P>
When the Flames missed on their first three tries Thursday, it gave them a 
string of 22 consecutive misses in this series and a one-for-24 mark overall. 
That's just over 4%. 
</P>
<P>
And the one power play goal they got came on a penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
But they finally broke the string Thursday by going ahead, 1-0, in the first 
period on a goal by Dana Murzyn. He scored from 45 feet, with goalie Kelly 
Hrudey screened by both a Flame and a King. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk put some juice in the power play early in the second period, but it 
took three shots to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a wraparound by Gary Roberts that Hrudey blocked. The puck 
bounced out to Al MacInnis in the left circle. His shot from there was also 
blocked by Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
But again, it bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
In came Nieuwendyk from the right side. He knocked the puck down with his right 
hand and shoved it past Hrudey with his stick. 
</P>
<P>
The life, the euphoria and the confidence generated in the previous games 
seemed to go out of the Kings at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out flat," Todd Elik said. "We should be ready for every game, but 
something was just missing." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Blake scored the goal for the Kings on a night they had only 19 shots on 
goal, nine through the first two periods. 
</P>
<P>
"We passed up good quality shots," King Coach Tom Webster said. "We were 
probably overpassing." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly on the power play. That the Kings were only one for eight in that 
situation was bad enough. But they managed only a total of three shots on goal 
on the eight power plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames didn't exactly solve all their power-play problems either, going 
just one for seven. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Nattress added two goals for the Flames and Roberts got the other. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Webster said "that we were missing three quality defenseman." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Laidlaw (lower back injury), Tim Watters (bruised ankle) and Bob Halkidis 
(sore shoulder) were all back home nursing their ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Defensman Larry Robinson is also hurting today, after taking a blow in the back 
from Brian MacLellan. He was sore but finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody has any pride at all, with all that has been said in the last few 
days in the media about the players and the coaching staff, you know they'd be 
more than a little mad and hungry," Robinson said. "With all the things that 
were said, they were going right for the jugular. Had (the Flames) all been 
illiterate, we might have had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Last Add, Record Dept.: the Kings' three hat tricks in the 12-4 victory in Game 
4 was one fewer than the previous total in team history. The other playoff hat 
tricks were scored by Marcel Dionne against Boston in 1976, Tom Williams 
against Chicago in 1977, Butch Goring against Atlanta in 1977 and Chris Kontos 
against Edmonton last year. . . . The previous playoff scoring high was 10 
goals in a 10-8 victory over Edmonton in 1982. The Kings scored a dozen goals 
once before, in a regular-season 12-1 win over Vancouver in 1984. The five 
second-period goals in Game 4 tied a mark reached twice before by the Kings, 
both times in a 1982 playoff series against Edmonton.

PULITZER: MURRAY'S PRIZE-WINNING WORK OFFERED INSIGHT, HUMOR FROM MIAMI TO 
ROCHESTER, N.Y., AND POINTS IN BETWEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jim Murray, who won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary Thursday, has often said 
that his job is to make Los Angeles laugh, and for doing that, he has more than 
earned his pay. 
</P>
<P>
But it has not been all yuks and chuckles and shouts of glee. Murray has also 
dispensed insight and compassion along the way, while putting the pompous in 
their place and the seemingly profound in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the datelines on his columns included the Super Bowl in Miami, the 
Kentucky Derby in Louisville, the Indianapolis 500, the U.S. Open golf 
tournament in Rochester, N.Y., and the World Series in the earthquake-stricken 
San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
In between, he enlightened and delighted readers with, among other offerings, 
an open letter to Pete Rose, baseball's 20 greatest moments -- as seen from the 
other dugout -- and a comparison of Ram Coach John Robinson's fake field-goal 
attempt against the San Francisco 49ers with other notable, ill-fated calls, 
such as those by the captain of the Titanic, General Custer, the Charge of the 
Light Brigade and Tom Lasorda when he told Tom Niedenfuer to pitch to Jack 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
But the best way to trace Jim Murray's year is in his own words, some of which 
are contained in this random sampler extracted from his 1989 columns: 
</P>
<P>
On a recently acquired Kings' hockey player: "I always thought Wayne Gretzky 
came with the Stanley Cup attached. He took a bath in it in the off-season. 
Used it as a flower pot on the back porch. . . . You look at Gretzky's numbers 
and you figure there must be two of him." 
</P>
<P>
On baseball's designated hitter: "I think it's time to come to a uniform 
decision on this indelicate matter. I mean, either a team is the home nine or 
it's the home 10." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Silence: "A horse they thought so little of they did everything but 
leave him on a park bench with a note on him won the Kentucky Derby Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
On Magic Johnson: "Giving Magic the basketball is like giving Hitler an army, 
Jesse James a gang, or Genghis Khan a horse. Devastation. Havoc. He's one of 
the more demoralizing forces in sports. Dempsey with a hook, an Unser with a 
car, Henry Aaron on a slow curve. . . . Magic Johnson without a basketball is 
an offense against nature." 
</P>
<P>
On a certain blubbery former heavyweight champion making a comeback: "George 
Foreman made his fight like a guy waiting for a bus. If it was outdoors, 
pigeons would have lit on him. Guys have moved faster in checkout lines at the 
market. George may be the Great Fat Hope." 
</P>
<P>
On the state of U.S. tennis: "You know tennis in this country is in scandalous 
condition when a couple of guys named Boris and Ivan are playing for our 
national open title." 
</P>
<P>
On the Rams: "Ram fans are schooled to fear the worst. They are conditioned to 
believe if there are two ways to do a thing, the Rams will pick the one with 
the least chance of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
On former Washington Redskin Dexter Manley: "Spending 16 years in or around 
classrooms and coming out unable to read or write is like spending your life in 
a cornfield -- and starving to death." 
</P>
<P>
On Orel Hershiser: "His manager likes to call him Bulldog, but if Orel were a 
canine, he'd probably be wearing a jeweled collar and a shaved torso. If he was 
any paler, he could haunt a house." 
</P>
<P>
On the America's Cup being decided in the courts, an imaginary maritime legal 
parallel from the past: "SAN FRANCISCO, 1898 -- The Spanish-American War was 
awarded to the King of Spain, and Cuba was ordered returned to him, as the 
Appellate Court of California today upheld a lower-court ruling that Admiral 
Dewey illegally trapped the Spanish Fleet twice." 
</P>
<P>
On Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: "He dominated his sport in the way few have in the long 
history of games men play. God made him more than 7 feet tall. He took care of 
the rest." 
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Open golf tournament: "Welcome to Wuthering Heights West. How do 
you par a swamp? What club do you use for Ooze? . . . The leader board looks as 
if it's bleeding to death." 
</P>
<P>
On Oklahoma's ex-football coach: "They said Barry Switzer had one of the most 
successful football programs of his day. Depends on what you're counting. Bowl 
games, yeah. In the important contests of life, he had one of the worst 
football programs I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
On the supposed wonder horse, Houston: "Now, if I paid $2.9 million for a 
horse, I'd at least want him to talk." 
</P>
<P>
On Nolan Ryan's arm: "It is an American heirloom, a work of art. Ryan should go 
to the Hall of Fame. The arm should go to the Louvre." 
</P>
<P>
On Pete Rozelle: "As a PR man, he's without an equal. He could make Castro 
President of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
On Oregon's legalized football betting: "America the Beautiful is turning into 
the world's biggest bookie parlor. The numbers racket used to be run by Murder, 
Inc. Now it's run by the state." 
</P>
<P>
On racing's greatest jockey: "Nobody ever rode a horse with the skill and grace 
of Bill Shoemaker. The worst rogues on the track turned into swans when he got 
on them. It wasn't a race, it was a romance. A love affair. Shoe didn't ride a 
horse, he joined him. Most riders treat horses as if they were guards in 
slave-labor camps. Shoe treated them as if he were asking them to dance." 
</P>
<P>
On the ex-coach of the San Diego Chargers: "You remember Don Coryell. He was 
the guy who used to stand on the sidelines with his hands on his knees and 
stare out at the line of scrimmage like a guy who just got a peek at his own 
coffin." 
</P>
<P>
On Pete Rose: "The count is 0-2, Pete, but you always were a good two-strike 
hitter. Besides, how tough can that be for a guy who beat out Ty Cobb?" 
</P>
<P>
On the Indy 500 champion: "Every time you see Emerson Fittipaldi in a garage in 
Gasoline Alley or on a pit wall in Kokomo or Sheboygan, you want to ask him, 
'What's the matter -- butler got the day off?' Or, 'Get lost on your way to the 
palace at Monaco, did you?' " 
</P>
<P>
On the owner of the Clippers: "You're Donald Sterling, financier, and your 
basketball team is the equivalent of junk bonds. It looks good on paper but not 
on court." 
</P>
<P>
On athletic supremacy: "You always get great athletes from the bottom of the 
economic order. That goes back to the days of ancient Rome, when the gladiators 
were all slaves (later Christians, and we all know the early Christians were 
the poor)." 
</P>
<P>
On the Triple Crown: "If you're going to win just one race, make it the Derby. 
If you're going to win two, you better win the third, too, or you get to be 
forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
On USC's 42-3 rout of Ohio State: "Now we know what a Buckeye is. A land animal 
most often found on its own 20-yard line." 
</P>
<P>
On trainer Charlie Whittingham: "Charlie has been around horses so much he 
sleeps standing up." 
</P>
<P>
On Sugar Ray Leonard: "He looks like he just walked off a can of baby food. If 
you saw him in the park, you'd want to take him down to the precinct and buy 
him a lollipop till his parents showed up." 
</P>
<P>
On the race at Indy: "It was the greatest Indianapolis 500 -- at least that I 
have seen. . . . A crash on Lap 199 between the two leaders is not something 
you're apt to see outside the pages of pulp fiction. It makes for great theater 
and puts the 1989 Indy 500 alongside the Babe Ruth called-shot World Series, 
the Dempsey-Tunney fight or the 1960 Arnold Palmer Open. . . . A vintage event. 
A great year. A collector's item." 
</P>
<P>
On the earthquake at the World Series: "You might have lost your heart in San 
Francisco, but it hasn't lost its. The city that the late Doc Kearns would call 
'a good game town' is getting off the floor one more time. It is reaching for 
the bottom rope to pull itself up for one more go. The city by the bay is like 
a grizzled old club fighter who keeps getting to his feet and carrying the 
fight to his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
On taking time off: "Every vacation you go on, you hope for three things: To 
take 10 strokes off your handicap. To get a tan. To get a rest. Well, one out 
of three ain't bad. The tan, I got."

NHL PLAYOFFS: DEFENDING CHAMPION CALGARY QUIETLY REGROUPS AND FORCES GAME 6.

<P>
Embarrassed by the Kings two nights earlier and chastised by the local media 
for two days, the Calgary Flames reacted not with anger Thursday night, but 
with quiet desperation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all afraid of what might happen," center Joe Nieuwendyk told reporters 
after contributing a goal and three assists as the Flames beat the Kings, 5-1, 
before 20,166 at the Olympic Saddledome in Game 5 of their best-of-seven Smythe 
Division semifinal playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
So afraid that nary a word was spoken among them beforehand. Down 3-1 in the 
series, the defending champion Flames saw their Stanley Cup slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys were quiet," Nieuwendyk said. "We were all sitting around, not saying 
anything, but just concentrating on what we had to do. We've taken some abuse 
the last couple of days, but we showed a lot of composure." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames responded to the media heat by applying pressure of their own on the 
Kings, who were overwhelmed for the first time in a series that many expected 
the Flames to dominate. Limited to nine shots on goal in the first two periods, 
the Kings fell behind, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after finally scoring at 1:48 of the third period, the Kings surrendered 
a pair of goals in the next eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"They are desperate," Coach Terry Crisp said of the Flames. "That's why they 
played like a desperate team." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames arrived from Los Angeles Wednesday to find that the local media had 
not reacted kindly to their 12-4 loss Tuesday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Send this shell of a team to Moscow and make it stay," wrote columnist Alan 
Maki of the Calgary Herald. "Send it in a row boat with a slow leak. Put it in 
an airplane -- third class or baggage? -- with only one movie to watch, 
Tuesday's disgrace against Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Maki also called for Crisp's ouster, saying that the third-year coach "should 
be given a root canal without Novocain." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the rips continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Are these sleeping beauties going to bother showing up at the Olympic 
Saddledome tonight?" wrote columnist Larry Wood, also of the Herald. "If it's 
really true that this disgraceful exercise is aimed at unloading His Crispness 
as coach, they should do us all a favor and stay home. It would be even more 
unprofessional to continue going through the motions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If these Flames get any worse than they have been lately, there should be an 
asterisk placed beside their Stanley Cup victory of last season. Theirs, over 
four games, has been history's shabbiest, most undisciplined, careless and 
embarrassing defense of the game's Holy Grail." 
</P>
<P>
And Maki again asked Flame management to unload Crisp. 
</P>
<P>
Of Crisp's role in Game 4, Maki wrote: "He stood back and did nothing as the 
Flames panicked, took penalties and collapsed like a gutted building." 
</P>
<P>
On the verge of elimination, the Flames flickered again. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt embarrassment more than pressure," Crisp said. "The guys were quiet 
after the last game, and they've been quiet ever since." 
</P>
<P>
But they weren't beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first series of shifts showed that we were really into it," Nieuwendyk 
said. "Everybody was pumping, everybody was going hard." 
</P>
<P>
The lopsided loss in Game 4 hadn't mortified them. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to say, that I went home and kicked the cat?" said 
defenseman Ric Nattress, who scored a pair of goals in Game 5. "It wasn't so 
much being mad. It was just disappointing to be so undisciplined. We were 
totally upset with ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The media criticism hadn't affected them, they claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us put that right out of our mind," said Dana Murzyn. "We're 
not winning for the media. We're not winning for anybody but ourselves. So, I 
don't think anybody was angry about what was written." 
</P>
<P>
But they were concerned that their season might end. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody wants a good season like this to end so early in April," 
Nieuwendyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it still could end as early as Saturday night at the Forum, where 
the Kings could wrap up the series with a victory.

SHOT GUN SCOTT 'CALDER HORSE' IN BLUE GRASS WITH A CHANCE AT WINNING KENTUCKY 
DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When a Florida trainer has what's known as a Calder horse, he's not receiving a 
compliment. It's not as denigrating as having a Caliente horse, but it's in the 
same rhetorical ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott is the Calder horse in Saturday's Blue Grass Stakes at 
Keeneland, the Calder horse with a chance of winning the Kentucky Derby at 
Churchill Downs on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Since it opened 19 years ago, Calder has always been the track from the wrong 
side of the tracks on the South Florida racing circuit. Gulfstream Park and 
Hialeah were the big leagues, Calder was triple-A. Even in recent years, when 
Hialeah's fortunes dipped to the point where the track couldn't even finish the 
season this winter, Calder was still a distant No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing people forget is that when horses come over here to run, they're 
still from over there," said a handicapper at Gulfstream a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Meyocks, the racing secretary at Calder, defends his track. Meyocks says 
Calder has kept figures over the last six years, and the track's horses have 
won a respectable 42% of the time they've run during the mid-winter dates at 
the two other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1985, a horse from "over there" really did all right. Calder-based Spend 
a Buck won the Kentucky Derby and was voted horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Shot Gun Scott is another Calder horse who seems to belong. He is 5-1 on 
the morning line in the $250,000 Blue Grass, behind odds-on Summer Squall and 
Unbridled, and Shot Gun Scott has finished ahead of Unbridled, the Florida 
Derby winner, three times. 
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott is probably an afterthought for the pundits plotting this year's 
Kentucky Derby because, besides being a Calder horse, he doesn't run very often 
and his owners and trainer have tended to downplay his ability. 
</P>
<P>
And the 3-year-old colt wasn't high on the list of many jockeys at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one of the horse's owners, Jean Friedberg, sent Dave Penna over to the 
barn. Penna worked the horse once, made a deal with Sarazin and won the 
Fountain of Youth. Penna will be aboard again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Fountain of Youth, Shot Gun Scott had won four of seven starts at 
Calder and in his only race away from that track, finished fourth in the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott earned $70,000 in the Breeders' Cup, and Meyocks ought to get a 
commission, because he was responsible for the horse's running. The day before 
payments were needed to keep horses eligible for the Breeders' Cup, Shot Gun 
Scott won the Florida Stallion Stakes, beating Unbridled by 2 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't even thinking about the Breeders' Cup," said Sarazin, 44, a 
soft-spoken former Chicagoan. "Meyocks called and said we might just as well 
give it a try. We only had about 12 hours to make up our minds before the money 
was due." 
</P>
<P>
If Penna should go all the way to the Kentucky Derby with Shot Gun Scott, it 
will be a pay-back of sorts for what befell the 31-year-old Canadian-based 
jockey with Sunny's Halo and Regal Classic. Penna rode Sunny's Halo eight times 
as a 2-year-old, winning five races, but Eddie Delahoussaye was on the horse's 
back the day he won the Derby in 1983. In 1988, Regal Classic, another horse 
that Penna had gotten familiar with the year before, was ridden by Laffit 
Pincay to fifth place in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Penna has never ridden in a Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I've ridden a lot of nice horses and I'm excited to be on this one," he said. 
"He's beaten all the big horses in Florida. He's very consistent and he always 
runs hard. Maybe he'll continue to do that and prove the best of them all -- 
just because he's trying." 
</P>
<P>
One horse that Shot Gun Scott didn't beat in Florida is Summer Squall, who ran 
just one race down there. Only Housebuster has beaten Summer Squall, who if the 
Derby were run today would be the second choice behind Santa Anita Derby winner 
Mister Frisky, according to Keeneland-Churchill Downs line maker Mike 
Battaglia. 
</P>
<P>
After running seven times as a 2-year-old, Shot Gun Scott has run only twice 
this year, in the Tropical Park Derby and the Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
His owners -- Friedberg and Scott Hamilton, both native Kentuckians -- were 
pointing for Keeneland, where they could run Shot Gun Scott before many of 
their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Blue Grass will provide the best group of opponents Shot Gun 
Scott has faced, Sarazin is not reluctant to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to find out some day about how good this horse is," he said. "He 
has to run a good race, and probably finish in the first three, to go on to the 
Derby. The timing of the race is right. This horse does better if his races 
aren't run close together." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who drew inside for his victory in the Jim Beam at Turfway Park 
on March 31, has the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass, with Pat Day 
riding. Outside them, in order, are Top Snob, with Jerry Bailey riding; 
Iskandar Elakbar, Richard Migliore; Shot Gun Scott, Dave Penna; Unbridled, 
Craig Perret; Land Rush, Angel Cordero, and Slew of Angels, Ricardo Lopez. All 
will carry 121 pounds.

FAST TIMES AT PALM SPRINGS HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
EASTER BREAK BRINGS OUT THE TEEN-AGE MUTANT NINJA PARTIERS

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's high noon at a Palm Springs hamburger hangout and the totally excellent 
seniors from the only high school in town are waiting for The Ritual to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Food fight!" shouts a 17-year-old clad in neon colors from shoulders to 
shoelaces. He launches the first Stealth burger into the air, splattering 
classmates waiting in line for similar culinary ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"A dude's gotta do what a dude's gotta do," says another senior, ducking behind 
friends who are about to be bombarded with a strawberry milkshake. Nearby, a 
student zooms in on the frenetic crowd with a video camera that barely escapes 
the fury of speeding French fries. 
</P>
<P>
In fewer than 60 seconds, the fast-food free-for-all is over. A woman sitting 
outside, chomping on an onion ring, freezes in mid-bite as the 100 or so 
students scamper wildly past her into the parking lot. They pile into trucks 
and cars and high-tail it back to school, wiping smeared ketchup, mustard, 
pickles and runny milkshakes off clothes, hair, faces, arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Cowabunga, dudes! 
</P>
<P>
The senior class has unofficially kicked off a week of spring break for the 
2,800 students of Palm Springs High. 
</P>
<P>
Even though thousands of high school and college students have been converging 
on Palm Springs since mid-March, the locals, like Robert Eaton, say, "Now it's 
our turn to have some R&amp;R. 
</P>
<P>
"And we just don't mean rock and roll either -- right guys?" the 17-year-old 
Eaton asks. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed not. For Palm Springs teen-agers, this week of vacation represents more 
than a chance to abandon textbooks and soak up some sun. It is a change in the 
routine of a community frequently associated with retirees and visitors from 
the Midwest and East who come to escape the winter. It is a break in an 
atmosphere that many young people describe as dull much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Spring break also seems to be a chance for Palm Springs youth to renew their 
commitment to hedonism. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got till Easter Sunday to party, dudes, a whole week," says Mike Irby, 
17, who is mingling with Eaton and several other students inside "the circle," 
an on-campus ring of concrete blocks where seniors gather after school. "And 
the only place to party is here in Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
During the last month, as various schools nationwide have closed for spring 
break, more than 60,000 revelers have invaded Palm Springs, which has a 
population of 40,000. "Why should we leave Palm Springs when everyone's coming 
here?" asks Sye Vasquez, 17. "We're the only party in the whole state, in the 
whole country." 
</P>
<P>
Forget Daytona Beach. Forget Ft. Lauderdale. The place to be is Palm Canyon 
Drive, the main drag in Palm Springs. The boulevard is more commonly known to 
locals and tourists in-the-know as "the strip" because of bumper-to-bumper 
cruising that goes on during spring break and the scantily clad sun worshipers 
who jam the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs High School party headquarters is located in the parking lot of 
Penguin's, a yogurt shop on -- where else? -- Palm Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know what's happening, that's where you go to see and be seen, 
to leave messages with friends for other friends," says Robert Shahnazarian, 
17, who plans to study international relations at Pepperdine University this 
fall. "It's the place to meet girls, especially on the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
"And to meet guys," says Christy Paul, 17, making sure she and her girlfriends 
have a voice in the matter. "There's a whole bunch of action for girls, too." 
</P>
<P>
Says Greg Schmale, 18: "It's about the only week most kids in Palm Springs look 
forward to 'cause it's pretty boring here the rest of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Younger students agree. Says Liam Duff, 14: "We're a small town where everybody 
knows everybody and that's dull. So spring break brings a lot of action to us. 
I'm gonna go out there with four or five friends and look for chicks in 
bikinis, myself. If I can find one who's older than I am, I'll be a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm just gonna have fun -- no drugs," Duff says. "The drug thing is not 
cool here. Even a chick who smokes cigarettes turns me off." 
</P>
<P>
For some local students, spring break means extra cash. Stephan Lenart, 17, 
says he is looking forward to working this weekend at the Wyndham Hotel, where 
he will hand out towels to guests. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring break brings jobs for many of our students," says Joyce Lessly, of the 
Palm Springs High School Work Experience program. "So far (during spring break) 
we have about 115 kids working at restaurants and in retail shops on Palm 
Canyon Drive, and every day I keep getting requests from businesses for help 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Other students get work on their own. 
</P>
<P>
By this Sunday, 450 high school and college students working at Domino's Pizza 
-- which usually has a staff of 20 -- will have delivered more than 15,000 
pizzas to hotel rooms and pools along Palm Canyon Drive, according to Tom 
Nowlan, president of Domino's in Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They work 10 hours and party for 14," Nowlan says of the extra help hired for 
spring break week. Christy Paul and Greg Schmale are part of the pizza crew, 
taking orders and delivering, respectively. Robert Shahnazarian is parking cars 
at the Oasis Water Park, a hangout for students from Palm Springs High and the 
community's College of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone on spring break is bringing home a pay check. Several Palm 
Springs high school students, at least those who work part time, estimate they 
will have spent about $200 -- on movies, the Oasis Water Park, and ice cream, 
yogurt, burgers and tacos -- by the end of Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're locals we don't need souvenirs," says 17-year-old Chris Aurilia 
as he and his friends congregate in the Penguin's parking lot. "We just need 
money for three things: Party! Party! Party! Personally, I'll be looking for a 
babe in a G-string for a meaningful relationship." 
</P>
<P>
So will his buddy, Mirwais Saifi, 17. But Saifi adds that no matter what he 
does, "I can't afford to get into trouble. If I get arrested, I have no social 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Lee Weigel, the Palm Springs Police Department's public information 
officer, says that at the end of last year's Easter week vacation, about 1,600 
people had been arrested, 800 had been jailed and about 6,000 citations had 
been issued. 
</P>
<P>
Weigel says most of last year's citations were given to out-of-towners for 
offenses ranging from jaywalking to not wearing a seat belt. "I have no idea 
who was from where on the arrests, but I can say for the most part Palm Springs 
kids are good kids. They just want to have a good time and they are doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a relatively quiet spring break," he adds, thanks to a temporary 
increase in police manpower. The police department started the practice of 
adding officers during the spring break period after student rioting on Palm 
Canyon Drive in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no turf wars between the locals and the visitors," Weigel says. "The 
majority of the kids all seem to get along fine. It's always a minority of the 
crowd that create the problems anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Weigel says the police are prepared to handle any situation that 
might arise, "especially this weekend when we're expecting the biggest crowd 
based on past experience." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the strip, Saifi and his friends agree to keep their fun clean: no 
jaywalking, no spitting, no squirting water from bottles, no water-balloon 
throwing. They agree to keep it simple: spot girls in bikini tops, follow them 
and make mindless chitchat until another group catches their attention. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kossey, 19, who attends the College of the Desert, says she has friends 
whose parents "decide to take the whole family to Hawaii" to get away from 
spring break madness. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of older people are up tight about spring break," she says. "My parents 
are. When I was a freshman in high school I was restricted from coming to the 
strip." But the house rules didn't stop Kossey from sneaking out, which she 
did. She says she also made the 11 o'clock newscast, caught in a crowd scene. 
"I was so afraid my parents would see me on TV, but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In her sophomore and junior years of high school, Kossey says her parents 
"asked me not to go cruising or have anything to do with Palm Canyon Drive." 
But she did anyway. "In my senior year they couldn't stop me. I think they 
realize now that it's just fun out there. The local kids thrive on spring break 
and some of the parents just don't understand why." 
</P>
<P>
Rene Rosen, the mother of two teen-agers, says, "Spring break is a little scary 
for some parents here. I know a couple of families who take vacations away from 
Palm Springs so their kids won't be here. I guess they feel there's more 
temptation for their kids during spring break to drink and stay out late. But 
with spring break being staggered for almost six weeks now, you can't very well 
lock up your kids. You've just got to trust them." 
</P>
<P>
The Rosens' children, Christina, 19, a freshman at the local community college, 
and Alexi, 15, both have curfews. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter is a little more rebellious than my son, and she really never does 
honor her curfew," Rosen says. "But I know she's just enjoying herself and 
she's not out there getting into trouble with drugs or drinking because she has 
to come home." 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Barber, president of the Palm Springs High School Improvement Team, a 
parent-teacher group, says, "You might have a group of kids circulating drugs, 
but the majority of kids who come here come to get sun and relax, cruise and 
flirt. I'm just very happy that my kid, a freshman in high school, doesn't go 
in for that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs vice principal Jerry B. Smith says the school doesn't send out a 
memo to students about spring break behavior "because on a personal basis we 
instill in our kids good smarts about not getting into trouble all the time." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, he adds, because "most of the police department knows a lot of our 
students, the kids know better than to get into trouble. They know that if you 
get into trouble in Palm Springs, everybody will know about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Chavez, 18, says if either he or his friends "see trouble coming -- like a 
fight -- we walk away. That's the smartest thing anyone can do." 
</P>
<P>
But if a pack of miniskirted girls heads his way, he follows. 
</P>
<P>
Apryl Kidder, 17, who attends Hemet High School -- about 40 miles east of Palm 
Springs -- and 14 other skimpily dressed teen-agers walk past Chavez and other 
Palm Springs high students who immediately shadow the girls. 
</P>
<P>
But Kidder and clan -- dressed in revealing outfits that range from miniskirts 
to rolled-up shorts to bikini tops -- are looking for rides. 
</P>
<P>
"We're into truck hopping," Kidder says as she and her girlfriends form a 
circle to primp during a break from walking the strip. Truck hopping, she 
explains, is "when you walk on Palm Canyon and you cruise for the 
hunkiest-looking guys driving the best-looking trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Then, she says, "you jump in and hang for a while until you see another truck 
with hunky guys and then you jump into that one." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend, Annette LaRocque, 17, volunteers, "We also like to motorcycle hop, 
though that's a little harder to do especially in a mini. But it's funner 
because it's wilder. You really don't want to be inside a car, you want to be 
outside on a motorcycle or in a convertible or in a truck." 
</P>
<P>
Just then the Hemet hoppers, uncontrollable hormones in high gear, spot a shiny 
blue truck. In a flash they're out in the street, weaving around three lanes of 
gridlock, making a mad dash for the truck, which is stopped at a red light. 
</P>
<P>

Unlike President Bush, heiress Karen Baum believes that broccoli is valuable, 
as desirable as something else that is green and nutritious -- money. 
</P>
<P>
But too many people equate wealth with the size of their bank accounts, which 
are really only abstract numbers, Baum told a seminar here the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more importance placed in the symbol of the money than the tuna or the 
broccoli or the potatoes it can buy," the 27-year-old philanthropist, jazz 
singer, poet and pottery collector said. "I am a materialist, I'd rather 
convert money into pottery." 
</P>
<P>
Baum, 27, came to the World Affairs Conference at the University of Colorado 
here this week, along with a few other scions of family fortunes, to express 
her opinions on myths about money and what it means to be rich. 
</P>
<P>
The North Carolina resident and her fellow inheritors were among about 100 
intellectuals, writers, artists, academics, architects, musicians, critics, 
social activists, bankers, businessmen and journalists who paid their way here 
for the 43rd installment of a conference that has become a Rocky Mountain 
monument to iconoclasm -- and, in some cases, flagrant provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Even before a word had been uttered, the Rocky Mountain News had already been 
provoked into editorializing Sunday that the conference was an exercise in 
"scorched earth" by "academics, pundits, media hounds and other questionable 
members of society." The newspaper also grumped that "it appears that a great 
deal of intellectual assault and battery will be committed -- much of it after 
thoughtful premeditation." It singled out for special mention the subjects on 
which Baum and her colleagues would speak -- two seminars entitled "Robin Hood 
Was Right" and "Growing Up Rich and What We Did About It." 
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up today, the conference also offered participants and audiences 130 
other two-hour seminars on topics ranging from "Capitalism Gone Berserk" to 
"Robots' Rights" to "Support Groups as the New Religions." For the globally 
minded there have been a plethora of panels on communism's collapse in Eastern 
Europe and the import of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
That modest selection only hints at the all-encompassing, free-wheeling, 
free-thinking, contentious, happy, intense, nonstop nature of a gathering that 
contains elements of a lecture series and encounter group, a barroom argument 
and a weeklong party. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning daily at 10 a.m. and continuing to 6 p.m. -- lunch break optional -- 
participants, students and residents could partake of their choice of panel 
discussions followed by question-and-answer sessions that were sometimes 
heated. For instance, an exploration of rap music reportedly concluded with 
university students accusing panelists, all of non-rap-generation age, of being 
out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baum -- whose fortune derives from her grandfather's success as an 
investment counselor -- and her cohorts were causing their own share of 
consternation with views of money that sometimes dumbfounded their audience and 
fellow speakers. Though she is an activist who donates money to projects such 
as low-income housing, Baum said one of her missions in life is speaking out on 
behalf of "nice rich people." She added, "I think if people were honest about 
what it's like to be rich, there wouldn't be such a mad rush to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Baum's comments earned a riposte from fellow panel member Wendy Watriss, a 
photographer and co-founder of a Texas fund that helps grass-roots 
organizations. "You can't be rich with impunity," Watriss said. "It doesn't do 
society any good that there are nice rich people." 
</P>
<P>
A woman in the audience who said "getting food out of dumpsters was how I kept 
myself in school," expressed incomprehension of Baum's blithe attitude about 
money. "What is that? I don't understand that," she said. Another listener 
expressed similar feelings after the seminar had ended. "It was real 
uncomfortable for me to stay in there," he said. "I don't think I can go back 
(to another meeting that included Baum)." 
</P>
<P>
Paul DuPont Haible, who said he inherited $500,000 at age 21, told the same 
audience that he and others like him represent a growing number of people with 
inherited wealth who are socially concerned and want to give a portion of their 
money to activist causes. Haible, 40, who is on the staff of San Francisco's 
Vanguard Public Foundation, said he has given away about half of his capital to 
various causes, including his own attempt to found a halfway house for released 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had $5 million, I know I'd be real busy passing that money around . . . I 
know a lot of people who need access to cash to do a lot of things," said 
Haible, one of many heirs to the DuPont fortune. 
</P>
<P>
In their way, Haible and Baum appeared to symbolize an unstated theme at the 
conference -- dissatisfaction with the Reagan era and its perceived emphasis on 
getting and spending, and an attempt to define, however cloudily, what comes 
next. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not on the same timetable as Eastern Europe but we're dealing with a 
system that's kind of hollow," Haible said. "We need a new infrastructure in 
place so that when the system comes tumbling down we don't have chaos." 
</P>
<P>
But veteran conference members stressed that much of the attraction of the 
meeting is its seeming anarchy. That anarchy is advanced by the calculated 
device of loading panels with three or four of the most disparate people 
imaginable -- for example, the panel "Capitalism Gone Berserk" included a radio 
talk show host, an attorney, a magazine public relations executive and an 
investment banker. Sometimes panel members had to speak completely off the 
cuff, partly because they had been drafted only minutes before the session 
began. Such was the fate of Yuri Zamoshkin, a Soviet expert on U.S. affairs who 
was hastily thrown on a panel titled "American Writing as Seen From Abroad." 
Zamoshkin used the opportunity to attack America's reading preoccupation with 
Cold War thrillers, specifically books by "The Hunt for Red October" author Tom 
Clancy. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is "an improvisational theater of the mind" and "the least 
focused thing that I've ever gone to," said June T. Golden, communications 
director of Family Circle magazine who has participated for the last five 
years. The gathering's chief product, she added, is "a whole lot of spillage," 
including articles, ideas and personal connections generated by its 
intellectual collisions and inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the point. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to arrive at a solution or an answer or to come up with a 
proposal for anything," explained conference founder Howard Higman, a 
university sociologist. The conference's purpose is to provide a forum for 
ideas, to allow audiences to "observe intellectuals debating issues in public" 
and to "help people form their own opinions" about current events and 
contemporary issues, Higman said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference began in the late 1940s as a largely local forum about the 
United Nations, Higman said, but has grown into its current highly diversified 
state with participants from around the country and the world. In the past, it 
has attracted the likes of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and 
playwright Arthur Miller. Higman recalled that while Miller was in town he kept 
getting calls from a "Miss Baker," who turned out to be Marilyn Monroe, whom he 
later married. 
</P>
<P>
But despite its growth in size and reputation, the conference is still a 
shoestring operation. Those invited must pay their own way to Boulder. Once 
here, participants are housed by residents who are responsible for serving 
breakfast and dinner. The university provides lunch, an ample supply of coffee 
and the lecture halls and ballrooms for the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
This week it is taking place against a backdrop of students hurrying to class 
and leafleting for a student government election, most oblivious to the 
gesticulating, garrulous conference participants. Indeed, most of those invited 
to the conference seemed entirely unaware of the charms of early spring in the 
Rockies -- an attitude no doubt helped by the leaden skies, occasional rain and 
infrequent pellets of snow that defined the week's weather. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden, for one, said she was aware of the contrast between the potentially 
idyllic setting and the enclosed environment of the conference. "We come to 
Boulder and drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, eat sugar doughnuts and talk," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, there were a few skeptics even in this capital of 
idealism. 
</P>
<P>
For A. Robert Lee, senior lecturer in American studies and literature at the 
University of Kent in Great Britain, the gathering is a contradiction in terms. 
</P>
<P>
"A world affairs conference in Boulder, Colo.," he said with a shrug, 
suggesting that this university town near Denver is not the center of the 
universe, this week or any other. His displeasure with the conference's title, 
however, did not stop Lee from giving spirited presentations at several 
sessions on literature and politics, in which he deplored his country's 
colonial past. One consequence of colonialism, he noted, is the rise of a 
post-colonialism literature that is unflattering to the former rulers. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Salman Rushdie, the author of "Satanic Verses" who has been under a 
Muslim death threat for more than a year, and other minority British writers, 
Lee said, "If you have had an empire, it will come back to give you an image of 
yourself that you don't particularly want." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Baum, who would not discuss specifics of her fortune, intimidated by 
the negative reaction she sometimes received. Saying that she believes American 
society needs widespread social and economic reforms, she asserted: "The whole 
society is sick. Everybody suffers from it at different levels of financial 
security." 
</P>
<P>
And that in the end, may be a unstated product of the conference: Memorable, 
trenchant, possibly infuriating observations from people from a wide variety of 
backgrounds, remarks that stand out from the gabbling blur of talk, laughter 
and smoky haze that enveloped Boulder this week.

FASHION: MATERNITY CLOTHES EVOLVE TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE CAREER-ORIENTED OLDER 
MOTHERS-TO-BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

41.

Maternity clothes are changing, but it has nothing to do with the seasonal 
whims of fashion. The number of working women over 35 who elect to be 
first-time mothers is on the increase -- they now account for 3.5% of all 
pregnancies, according the National Center for Health Statistics. And these 
women have designers hustling to meet their very particular fashion needs. 
</P>
<P>
Today's pregnant career women tend to continue working into their third 
trimester. They want well-cut suits and office-worthy dresses in quality 
fabrics and updated styles. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of this new breed are professional women with plenty of money to spend," 
says Sara Pollak, West Coast operations manager for Reborn Maternity, a New 
York-based company with three stores in Los Angeles. "They come in and buy 
entire wardrobes, not just an outfit or two. They go for a dignified, expensive 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Pollak says the average age of her customers has increased in the last nine 
years. Shoppers used to be 25 to 30, but today, most of them are in their 30s 
and 40s. 
</P>
<P>
In part, these older mothers-to-be prefer a more serious dress style because it 
helps them to maintain a businesslike image. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may be concerned that pregnancy connotes something unprofessional," 
Pollak says. "They want to counteract that. The lawyer or marketing executive 
who comes in here needs to reassure her clients that she's as capable as ever. 
So she really goes all out to look serious and impressive and well-heeled. The 
very last thing she wants is to look cutesy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, pregnant women in their 30s and 40s want to dress as they did 
before they became pregnant. They do not want to change their style simply 
because they can't find clothes that suit their tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"One principle everyone in the maternity wear business agrees on is that the 
40-plus pregnant woman should not alter her basic look just because she's 
pregnant," says Elsie Frankfurt Pollock, president of the Page Boy Maternity 
shop in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1980s, many women found that almost impossible to manage. Most 
maternity wear looked as if it had been designed for an adolescent. There were 
inverted-cone shaped blouses with little collars and bows. Floral print jumpers 
were another staple. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walked into a maternity store you felt like you'd entered a time 
warp," Pollock says. "Women would want to say, 'Hey, I'm having a baby, not 
becoming one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Says Fabienne Struell owner of the Los Angeles maternity wear company, Fontaine 
Corp., "The whole situation has changed in the last five years. Where you used 
to use cheap fabrics because these were 'temporary' clothes, now you use the 
best fabrics. You have a more sophisticated buyer who goes for more 
sophisticated styling." 
</P>
<P>
Some enterprising owners of maternity shops now enlist cutting-edge, 
ready-to-wear designers to adapt their collections for pregnant women. 
Companies such as Sketches, a New York firm, as well as ABS and Urso of Los 
Angeles, are among those known for their sportswear and separates, and more 
recently, their limited-edition maternity collections. 
</P>
<P>
At Saks Fifth Avenue, where expectant mothers over the age of 35 constitute 70% 
of the maternity department's customers, tastes are conservative. Fashion 
Director Ginny Sydorick explains: "They tend to prefer subdued colors, black 
and navy, and to stay away from bright colors. They go for a more tailored 
look." 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that pregnant business women are willing to shed their 
conservative clothes after hours. "For weekend wear they buy the bright colors, 
wear shorts with overblouses and cotton leggings with overblouses. Thicker 
cotton leggings, not the skin-tight kind," says Sydorick. T-shirt dresses and 
jumpsuits are other top sellers in the Saks maternity department. 
</P>
<P>
Struell concurs that pregnant women in their 30s and 40s tend to lighten up on 
weekends. Leggings and T-shirts are among her best selling designs. 
</P>
<P>
"Many women want to have fun and continue to show off their bodies while 
they're pregnant," she says. At the age of 35 herself, and seven months 
pregnant, Struell says that she often exchanges clothing with her 14-year-old. 
"We'll both wear miniskirts with big tops or my cotton Lycra leggings with big 
tops." 
</P>
<P>
Much as the situation has improved, Ann Stone, a veteran saleswoman in the Saks 
maternity department, sees the need for additional fashion options for 
executive pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
"The area where manufacturers are failing this group is formal wear," Stone 
says. "These women have reached the stage in life where they are attending 
formal functions frequently. They tell me all the time that they can't find 
anything to wear." 
</P>
<P>
Pollak of Reborn Maternity found evening wear in lame and sequined crepe, in 
sophisticated silhouettes, for her stores. But to do so, she says, "We ravaged 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
But professional women aren't the only influences on maternity wear. Women in 
all occupations are delaying pregnancy and are helping to revolutionize more 
moderately priced lines of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
At Motherhood Maternity in Century City, which caters to the middle-level 
buyer, 25-year-old assistant manager Chris Oswald says, "Nobody my age is 
coming into the store. They're all at least in their 30s, and we get quite a 
few 42-year-olds these days, too." 
</P>
<P>
Best sellers for the more mature pregnant women who shop at Motherhood 
Maternity include solid colored conservative styles such as a dignified, 
pleated black jumper, says saleswoman Christine Few.

AUTHOR OFFERS 'CHOICES' FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Author Bryna Fireside has three children. All were out of high school by age 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Leela, started college at 15; Douglas graduated at 16 and got a 
job; Daniel also finished at 16 and went to California. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened to tradition? Why didn't they just graduate after 12th grade 
and go straight to college? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, they're three unusual kids, bright and nonconformist, who 
followed their parents' encouragement to live a little differently, take 
chances and break a few rules if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as Fireside points out in "Choices: A Student Survival Guide for the 
1990s" ($10.95, Garrett Park Press), the rules have changed. Options for high 
school students are broader and more accessible than even she considered 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a good reason for being there, you shouldn't be in college," 
said Fireside, a free-lance writer and supervisor of student teachers at 
Cortland State College. "It's an expensive proposition that can really be a 
marvelous experience if you know what it is you're after. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things kids can do by spending a year away. By the time they 
get to college, they at least know what they don't want. They know it's hard to 
make friends in a workplace at a low-level job. For kids who travel and are 
willing to take that step in another part of the world, that can also be an 
eye-opener." 
</P>
<P>
Fireside had written magazine articles about high school students who "stop 
out" -- take time off before college -- and researched internship programs and 
summer schools. 
</P>
<P>
The students impressed her and so did the parents. For adults, "Choices" is a 
friendly arm around the shoulder from an experienced mother and writer. 
</P>
<P>
The message: Relax, trust your child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to someone in a large suburban area and I mentioned I had 
written about 'stopping out' between high school and college. One parent said, 
'What if she never decides to go to college?' 
</P>
<P>
"If parents value education, the kids will also value education. That's a very 
hard concept for parents to accept. A lot of parents think if they don't guide 
the kids all the way, if they let them step out of the mold, all will be lost. 
People mature at different rates. We ought to be able to recognize it in 
teens." 
</P>
<P>
"Choices" could be called "The Conceptual Guide to Continuing Education." 
</P>
<P>
Structured like a school workbook, Fireside's book leaves room in the margins 
for notes and comments and names dozens of organizations to contact. 
</P>
<P>
Call it pop education as well, important ideas available to all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of information out there, but it's not readily accessible to 
kids. A lot of guidance counselors don't have information either, or the kids 
don't feel comfortable with guidance counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"The information doesn't seem to be in the bookstores. It's a nice, thin book 
(111 pages), and easy to read." 
</P>
<P>
Fireside includes chapters on internships, travel and jobs programs. She also 
discusses the military, a sensitive topic for a longtime activist who once 
organized the anti-nuclear Tasteful Ladies for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
But "Choices" means all choices, and for millions the military is a serious 
option. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important part of American life. For those kids that feel there's 
something they can contribute to their country, this is a good way to do it and 
get a free education. But the object of the military is not to educate, but to 
teach how to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Education, Fireside noted, can be resumed at any time, and not only the young 
take chances. The most exciting time of her own life came in her 40s when she 
went back to school, earning a degree in children's literature at Cornell 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Fireside continues to be challenged by her own children, especially by Daniel, 
who at 19 is spending his junior year of college in Peru and hasn't hesitated 
to get involved in that country's turbulent politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I didn't agree with what my kid was doing, it was very exciting 
seeing my kid doing something he likes doing," she said. "We all want our kids 
to be productive and think more about other things than just themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the kids I talked to were not rebels, but pretty bright kids who just 
had something else they wanted to do. What I'm basically saying is that you 
don't have to plan out your whole life, you can just plan six months."

FAIRY TALE: IN COLINE SERREAU'S CHARMING 'MAMA, THERE'S A MAN IN YOUR BED,' A 
CLEANING WOMAN BECOMES A GODDESS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Why do some fairy tales work for us while others turn leaden or rancid right 
before our eyes? Tone. Characters. And, bottom line, the people must generate 
enough affection for us to will the preposterous to come true. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Coline Serreau's "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed" (Westside 
Pavilion), the story of a real insider who tips the boss to the unscrupulous 
practices and plots against him in his own company, works as charmingly as it 
does because it has a real beating heart in its central pair. They are 
Antilles-born newcomer Firmine Richard and Daniel Auteuil, minus the dental 
appliances and general look of imbecility he used as the peasant Ugolin in 
"Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring." 
</P>
<P>
Richard is formidable as Juliette, mother of five who has worked 10 years as 
the night cleaning woman at the executive offices of Romuald Blindet (Auteuil). 
Since the film will literally stand or fall with her performance, it's 
fortunate that she's the presence she is; someone who can unequivocally be 
perceived as "beautiful, funny, a fountain of goodness and a courageous woman." 
</P>
<P>
Conjuring with the same free hand with which she dropped an irresistible baby 
on three Parisian bachelors in "Three Men and a you-know-what," Serreau has 
Auteuil blind to the crosscurrents within his successful yogurt manufacturing 
company. He doesn't even know that the young and ferrety Paulin (Gilles 
Privat), whom he has just promoted to a vice presidency, and Romuald's own wife 
are . . . somewhat more than business acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
No fool but no snitch either, Juliette has observed a lot of this silently. 
When business affairs make it imperative, she does tell Romuald about the 
intriguers plotting against him -- but not the identity of his wife's lover. 
It's a crucial, nice distinction. 
</P>
<P>
With his business under investigation, Romuald must disappear for a while and 
where better, in a fairy tale, than to the already bulging walk-up apartment of 
Juliette and her brood, ages 4 to 17, where, you can be assured, he learns 
something of life from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Not too much. We notice that when Juliette lugs groceries, Romuald is something 
less than a Boy Scout or even a halfway alert human being about pitching in. 
And when she gives him her bed and takes her turn with a pillow in the bathtub 
or a spot in her kids' bedroom, he is lox enough to allow her the sacrifice. 
Pfui. 
</P>
<P>
But Serreau's whole point is the ignobility of some and the natural grace of 
others and the capacity for change. And if it takes Romuald rather a long time 
to perceive Juliette for what she is, even after a scene when he accidentally 
sees her asleep, looking like one of Gauguin's goddesses, that means more time 
for us to spend with her -- and her five children and, on occasion, her five 
previous husbands. It's some of the best fun of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to tell where Serreau is taking us, but she also throws in a few 
nice character twists or two. There's also one of those scenes you really yearn 
for, classic as the defeat of the wicked witch or the downfall of the uninvited 
fairy. "Mama's" scene, probably the universal wish-fulfillment moment, involves 
a personal private secretary and Serreau gives it the full measure of venom. 
</P>
<P>
Auteuil has a tiny streak of craziness to him, perceptible somewhere in his 
eyes. It was completely unleashed in the "Jean de Florette" films and tapped a 
bit in "A Few Days With Me," in which, again, he played a businessman attracted 
to someone -- Sandrine Bonnaire -- completely out of his milieu. It's what 
gives us hope for Romuald and is the single reason to believe that Juliette is 
not choosing beneath herself. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, "Mama" (Times-rated Family, allowing for one decorous scene of 
lovemaking) is already being tooled up for American remake: Richard Dreyfuss, 
same writer-director, co-star as yet unannounced. They may strike gold twice, 
but do yourself a vast favor: at least begin with Firmine Richard so you 
understand what the fuss was all about.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Firmine Richard, a secretary at a consulate office in Antilles, was vacationing 
in Paris when French director Coline Serreau and her agent spotted her in a 
restaurant. Just like that, Richard, 42 and married with one son, had a new 
career. Serreau cast Richard in a role the director describes as "the spiritual 
center" of "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed" and the performance has won rave 
reviews. Since finishing "Mama" in 1988, Richard has begun studying acting 
seriously and is working in Rome on a film with Vittorio Gassman.

THE ART WORLD SHOOTS FOR A $1-BILLION SPRING; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTIONS: NEW YORK'S SELLING SEASON OPENS NEXT WEEK. AFRICAN, AMERICAN AND 
IMPRESSIONIST WORKS MAY MAKE IT THE BIGGEST EVER.

<P>
The art world is gearing up for what may be the biggest New York auction season 
in history. Beginning next week with the sale of a world renowned Los 
Angeles-based collection of of African art and steaming on through May with 
auctions of multimillion-dollar Impressionist and American paintings, the 
six-week round of auctions is likely to total close to $1 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Art on the block ranges from classical Impressionist works by Pierre-Auguste 
Renoir and Claude Monet to Pop paintings by Roy Lichtenstein and photographs by 
Robert Mapplethorpe. Los Angeles will play an unusually prominent role in the 
spring auctions when collections of the late dealer Harry A. Franklin, actor 
Kirk Douglas, pop singer Graham Nash, television producer David Wolper and the 
late Taft and Rita Schreiber are offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's is looking forward to its most profitable auction in history, a May 
15 sale of 81 Impressionist and modern works that are expected to total as much 
as $331.4 million. Sixty-two of the pieces are valued at more than $1 million 
each, and five are expected to bring more than $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's is anticipating nearly as big a success the next night, with a sale 
of 71 Impressionist and modern works, valued at up to $303.5 million. Sixty-one 
are likely to top the $1-million mark, and three are expected to exceed $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Two highly revered Impressionist paintings -- Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of 
Dr. Gachet," depicting the physician who treated the troubled artist during the 
last year of his life, and Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette," a shimmering 
painting of an outdoor dance hall scene -- are expected to bring $40 million to 
$50 million apiece and possibly exceed the record $53.9 million paid in 1987 
for Van Gogh's "Irises," now in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh portrait, to be offered by Christie's, and the Renoir, from 
Sotheby's, will be the most closely watched sales of the season. But they are 
far from the only big-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
Edouard Manet's intimate garden scene, "The Bench," for example, is estimated 
at $20 million to $25 million in Christie's May 15 sale. Thomas Eakins' "The 
Swimming Hole," an icon of American art from the Fort Worth Modern Art Museum's 
collection, is valued at $10 million to $15 million in a May 24 auction at 
Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
Major contemporary works are also lining up for spring auctions. In Christie's 
big contemporary sale on May 7, for example, 76 lots are valued at a total of 
$49 million to $71 million, the auction house's highest ever pre-sale estimate 
for contemporary art. Nineteen of the 76 works are likely to fetch more than $1 
million apiece; half of them are Abstract Expressionist paintings by Clyfford 
Still, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Sam Francis. Sotheby's contemporary 
sale on May 8 includes 88 lots, expected to total between $88 million and $115 
million. Fifteen pieces are valued at over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among pricey contemporary pieces offered by the two auction houses, 
Lichtenstein's classic comic strip-style painting, "Kiss II," and Francis 
Bacon's Expressionistic "Study for Portrait" are each expected to bring between 
$5 million and $7 million. "Woman as Landscape," a 1954-55 Abstract 
Expressionist work by De Kooning, is valued at $9 million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
No one can predict the outcome of these glittering auctions. Some critics of 
the highly leveraged sale of "Irises" in 1987 to Australian industrialist Alan 
Bond say that it may be several years before another artwork commands a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
But confidence in the art market -- as well as dismay over escalating prices -- 
is widespread among dealers and collectors. While most of them say that buyers 
are becoming more selective and that the fast-rising prices for works by young 
art stars will level off, they expect top-quality pieces to climb even higher. 
Highlights of upcoming sales released so far by the auction houses indicate 
that there will be no shortage of quality for those who can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the sales include consignments from collectors and museums all across 
the country, including Southern California, but Los Angeles has an unusually 
high profile this spring. Works from at least five important Los Angeles 
collections will go on the block in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
* The Harry A. Franklin Family Collection of African Art comes up first, on 
April 21 at Sotheby's. Billed as the biggest and best single-owner sale of 
African art since the 1966 auction of Helena Rubenstein's collection, the 
Franklin auction of 431 lots is expected to total between $3.8 million and $5.4 
million. The top lot is a Cameroon wood sculpture, called the "Bangwa Queen," 
which is valued at up to $1.8 million and may challenge the $2.08-million 
record for African art, set last July for a Benin bronze head. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was a pioneering collector of African art who bought his first piece 
in 1938 and maintained a gallery in Beverly Hills until his death in 1983. His 
daughter, Valerie Franklin, who ran the gallery in later years and brought her 
scholarly expertise to the family business, decided to sell the collection so 
that she could launch a new career as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
* Rock singer Graham Nash's celebrated collection of photography will be sold 
on April 25 at Sotheby's, which calls the event "the most important 
single-owner sale of photography ever to come to auction." The sale of about 
475 photographs, including works by Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Walker Evans and 
Edward Weston, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash will donate half 
the profit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the purchase of 
contemporary photography. The money gift will augment the singer's recent 
donation of 140 contemporary photographs to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
* Actor Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, will sell 52 pieces of Impressionist 
and modern art in Christie's auctions on May 4, 16, 22 and 30. Their collection 
of works by Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Piet Mondrian and many other artists 
is expected to bring $7.5 million to $10.7 million. The couple plan to put half 
their profit into a family foundation and use the rest to collect contemporary 
art. 
</P>
<P>
* Christie's will sell 17 works from the estate of Taft and Rita Schreiber on 
May 7, 8, 15 and 16 for a projected total of $4.8 million to $7.1 million. The 
most valuable pieces are "Woman With Blue Jewel," a 1937 painting by Henri 
Matisse ($4 million to $6 million) and Henry Moore's bronze "Girl Seated" 
($500,000 to $700,000). The Schreibers bequeathed the bulk of their collection 
to the National Gallery in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 
the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. Taft Schreiber was a top official with MCA Inc. His widow died last year. 
Their daughter, Lenore Greenberg, a MOCA board member, said that the items sent 
to auction are those that her parents didn't designate as gifts to museums or 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer David Wolper will sell seven modern artworks from his collection at 
Christie's auctions on May 1, 15 and 16 and in October. The group of sculptures 
and paintings by Pablo Picasso, Jacques Lipchitz and Joan Miro is expected to 
total between $4.4 million and $6.3 million. An active collector who routinely 
buys and sells, Wolper says he will use the profit from the upcoming auctions 
to purchase more art. 
</P>
<P>
Several other collections are scheduled for sale in May. An unusually rich 
cache of Italian Futurist art, collected by the late Lydia Winston Malbin, the 
eldest daughter of architect Albert Kahn, will be offered by Sotheby's on May 
16 and 17. The sale -- expected to total $57 million to $75 million -- will 
include Giacomo Balla's painting, "Injection of Futurism" ($3 million to $4 
million) and his sculpture, "Boccioni's Fist" ($2 million to $3 million). Among 
other modern works in the Malbin collection are Constantin Brancusi's 
sculpture, "The Blond Negress" ($8 million to $10 million) and Fernand Leger's 
1913 Cubist painting, "Woman in Armchair" ($10 million to $12 million). 
</P>
<P>
Christie's on May 15 will offer five paintings from the estate of Robert 
Lehman, a New York financier and patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for 
an estimated total of $40 million to $60 million. The works include a Van Gogh 
self-portrait ($20 million to $30 million) and an Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 
portrait of a young woman, "Girl With Fur" ($10 million to $15 million). 
</P>
<P>
Paintings continue to command the art market's top prices, but photography will 
be in the spotlight late this month. Christie's will launch a four-day round of 
sales on April 23 with an auction of photographic masterworks, featuring 
vintage works that are expected to set records. Sotheby's will follow its April 
25 auction of the Graham Nash collection with a sale of 473 photographs. The 
auction will close with 36 works by Robert Mapplethorpe valued at up to $50,000 
apiece -- well above his record of $38,500 set only last November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Pre-sale estimates for this spring's round of art auctions indicate that the 
art boom of the 1980s may be carrying over into the '90s. The art market took 
off in the '80s as thousands of new collectors began putting money into art and 
the Japanese spent vast sums on French Impressionist paintings. Skeptics feared 
a collapse after the stock market crash of October, 1987, but a month later 
Sotheby's sale of Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises" commanded $53.9 million, still 
the highest auction price ever paid for an artwork. The revelation that 
Sotheby's had loaned Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond half the purchase price 
led critics to charge that the market was artificially inflated and to predict 
a decline. Subsequent auctions haven't matched that price, but prices have held 
strong and continued to rise steadily in many areas. Sotheby's reported $2.9 
billion in sales for 1989, a 61% increase over 1988. Christie's totalled $2 
billion in sales in 1989, a 70% jump from the previous year. Both auction 
houses expect 1990 to be another record year, but some art market watchers say 
business might be hurt by this year's fall of the Japanese stock market and the 
continuing troubles in the junk bond market.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: 'TURTLES' TAPES BEING SERVED AT BURGER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michaelangelo, Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo -- the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles -- are crazy about pizza but a fast-food hamburger chain, Burger King, 
scored possibly the biggest commercial coup of Turtlemania. 
</P>
<P>
Burger King made a deal with IVE to sell four previously unreleased Turtle 
animated videos exclusively at its restaurants for $3.49 each with a purchase. 
IVE is shipping 7 million copies of the Turtle tapes, according to IVE's 
marketing vice president Lauren Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Since the live-action movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" opened in theaters 
two weeks ago (box-office gross: a whopping $50.9 million ), Turtlemania -- the 
merchandising phenomenon that's bordering on last summer's Batmania -- has been 
in full bloom. Children are buying all sorts of products associated with the 
Turtles, including videos. 
</P>
<P>
Your local Burger King has become Turtlemania central. IVE's Becker reported 
booming business at Burger Kings for the videos, released through IVE's kidvid 
division Family Home Entertainment. For the last two weeks, a new video has 
been introduced in 5,000 of the chain's 5,400 U.S. restaurants each week. By 
the end of the month, all four -- "April Foolish," "The Great Boldini," 
"Invasion of the Turtle Snatchers" and "Sky Turtles" -- will be available. 
</P>
<P>
Of these 28-minute programs, 22 minutes are devoted to a Turtle episode. The 
rest is commercials, including a 2 1/2-minute ad for IVE's other Turtle videos, 
a 90-second trailer for the movie and a Burger King ad pushing its Kids Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Though these Turtle episodes are new to home video, they're not new. All have 
been previously shown on the Turtles' syndicated TV series. "It doesn't seem to 
matter that they've been shown on TV," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly hasn't mattered for IVE's other Turtle titles. Becker reported 
that in the two-and-a-half years IVE has been involved with Turtle videos, 
several million copies have been sold. Prior to the Burger King promotion, five 
titles -- each containing two episodes -- were on the home-video market, 
selling for $14.95 apiece. IVE's initial shipment of the most recent Turtle 
video, "Cowabunga, Shreadhead," was over 600,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Burger King chain was a perfect place to introduce the Turtle 
videos is that there was a previous promotional tie-in with the Turtles. In 
February, Becker said, over 14 million "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle" badges 
were dispensed as part of Burger King's Kids Club promotion. "Kids already 
associated Burger King with the Turtles, which makes selling the videos there 
much easier," Becker explained. 
</P>
<P>
To enhance the association between Burger King and the Turtles' videos, two ads 
have been running on TV -- one for adults and one for children -- as part of a 
multimillion-dollar ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
What's clever about this IVE-Burger King promotion is that not only are these 
videos new to the marketplace but they're also only sold at Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
This exclusivity is a new wrinkle in what's known as the video premium 
business. Other companies have used videos in promotions -- such as offering a 
free sports video with a magazine subscription -- but those videos had been 
previously available through traditional outlets. A magazine would buy the 
give-away videos in high volume at a low cost-per-video. Old titles are 
commonly used as premiums -- not hot, unreleased product like the Turtles 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
One reason IVE is able to sell these $3.49 videos at such a low cost -- a 
reported $2.25-$2.50 per cassette -- is that they're duplicated at the slowest 
speed (EP). Since EP duplication uses only one third the tape as standard-play 
(SP) duplication, manufacturing these videos costs much less. However, 
recording at EP generally results in picture quality inferior to any recorded 
at SP. But for kidvid cartoons that were previously shown on TV, a top-quality 
picture isn't that necessary. 
</P>
<P>
What's next for the Turtles? 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the Turtles TV series moves from syndication to network TV -- as a 
CBS Saturday morning series. The "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" movie will be 
out this fall too, Becker said. Most likely it will be released at a $20-$25 
price geared to sales in the holiday market.

Teen-agers, mostly blacks, roamed the streets of Teaneck, N.J., after a night 
of smashing windows and overturning cars following the fatal shooting of a 
black teen-ager by a white policeman. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday night street violence broke out after a peaceful candlelight 
protest over Tuesday's death of 15-year-old Phillip Pannell of River Edge. City 
Police Chief Bryan Burke said six police cars were destroyed during the 
violence and store windows were shattered. Witnesses said police pushed the 
protesters into the parking lot of police headquarters and some women and 
children were trampled. The crowd retaliated by turning over cars and throwing 
rocks and other debris.

HOLIDAY: SPRING BREAK HEADS FOR ITS WEEKEND FINALE, WITH SUNSHINE FORECAST. BUT 
AUTHORITIES EXPECT TO BE MORE BUSY WITH CROWDS THAN WITH YOUTH ROWDINESS.

<P>
It's not as hectic as Thanksgiving, and it's nowhere near as rowdy as the 
Fourth of July or Labor Day weekends. 
</P>
<P>
But with teen-agers running loose on spring break and tens of thousands of sun 
worshipers expected to descend on area beaches, Easter weekend still figures to 
be busy enough to provide some headaches for Orange County law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Some beach cities are gearing for the crowds: Police in Newport Beach tonight 
plan to continue manning barricades against nighttime cruising on the Balboa 
Peninsula; police in Huntington Beach today are scheduled to start the city's 
first-ever mounted patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Some inland areas will be no less active on Easter Sunday, with about 20,000 
people expected to crowd into all-day services at the Crystal Cathedral in 
Garden Grove and summer-like crowds predicted at both Disneyland and Knott's 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller crowds are expected at parks throughout the area for annual Easter egg 
hunts, some of which are so popular that they are already booked up. Judging 
from brisk candy sales this week, scores of children will also be opening 
Easter baskets and unwrapping chocolate bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even talk to you right now because I'm so swamped," Pat Pardoen, owner 
of the Chocolate Florist in Irvine, said Thursday as 20 people waited in her 
shop for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said they are not anticipating the kinds of serious 
traffic problems that typically occur during longer three- and four-day holiday 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, consequently, is planning no extra staffing and 
no special patrols, California Highway Patrol spokesman Ken Daily said in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The only possible congestion problem, Daily added, might come Sunday night, 
with motorists returning from the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic tie-ups are also likely at John Wayne Airport because of construction 
planned at the Michelson Drive main entrance today and Saturday. Christine 
Edwards, airport director of operations, said that while air traffic is 
generally higher than normal during Easter weekend, it is not enough to justify 
delaying construction. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic could also be troublesome in the immediate vicinity of such places as 
the Crystal Cathedral, where a church spokeswoman said more than 3,000 people 
are expected to crowd into each of the six services planned Easter Sunday. The 
Rev. Robert H. Schuller, senior pastor of the cathedral, will be preaching at 
the first five services. 
</P>
<P>
Another 10,000 people are expected to attend "Easter in the Meadows," a concert 
and Easter program Sunday morning at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine. 
A heavy traffic backup is anticipated on Lake Forest Avenue leading to the 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest crowds, though, will most likely be at the beaches. The National 
Weather Service forecast calls for highs in the 80s inland and 60s along the 
coast through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
H high temperatures Thursday were 63 in Newport Beach, 79 in El Toro, 78 in 
Santa Ana and 76 in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big weekend," said Cheryl Ryan, managing director of the Laguna 
Beach Chamber of Commerce. "There will definitely be more people, and the 
beaches will be packed and the volleyball courts filled." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, as spring break week neared an end, thousands of students, 
families and tourists gathered their towels, tanning lotions and bathing suits 
and flocked to county shores. 
</P>
<P>
Despite overcast skies along much of the county coast, large crowds were 
reported at many local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic into Laguna Beach was backed up on Coast Highway past Emerald Bay. 
Lifeguards in Newport Beach reported about 60,000 people. Another 10,000 people 
flocked to Huntington State Beach. Crowds are expected to grow as the holiday 
nears, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, lifeguard Pete Bryan said the beaches have not been as busy 
as in the last few spring breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, Easter break is real crowded," Bryan said from his tower overlooking 
the shore. "This year it's not as crowded. The weather is cold, the water is 
also cold. The stepped-up police in the area are keeping better control. That, 
in addition to the water temperature and the weather, is keeping a lot of 
people away." 
</P>
<P>
Brick Ashcraft and Jill Daucher, both 18, said they left their homes in Brea to 
stay with friends in Newport Beach for the week. To enjoy their spring break, 
the two have been on the beach all week to relax and work on their tans. 
</P>
<P>
Ashcraft, a student at Fullerton College, said he has enjoyed the crowd: "It's 
been pretty good. At night it's fun. A lot more people come down, and there are 
more parties." 
</P>
<P>
Four teen-age girls from Costa Mesa -- Carrie Neuber, Griselda Sandoval and 
sisters Heather and Lisa Arensdorf -- said they have been going to the beach 
every day during their days off from school this week. Asked why, they answered 
in unison: "Because of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
"We met seven on Tuesday night and stayed until 11:30," said Carrie, 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I got grounded for coming home past 10 p.m. but that's about it," added Lisa, 
13. "It's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach resident Blake Steelgrave, whose home fronts on the beach, said 
he does not mind the extra traffic Easter week. For him it means a better 
economy for the city -- and new friends. 
</P>
<P>
"You meet new girls," Steelgrave said as he played with his Doberman pinscher, 
Augie.

OFFICIALS ALTER TRAIN SCHEDULE, MISS THE BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Transportation Commission officials have learned at least one 
lesson when it comes to dealing with Amtrak commuters: Don't mess with the 
train schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes one way or another can make or break a commute for someone who 
depends on the Los Angeles bus system for another leg of the daily journey. 
Just ask Lorrie Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds picky, but it means the difference between riding the train and not 
riding the train," said Hutton, who commutes daily between Fullerton and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So when authorities announced plans to switch the departure time for the train 
that Hutton rides back to Orange County each evening, she was none too pleased. 
Banding together with scores of regular train riders, Hutton and her fellow 
commuters have spent the last two weeks fomenting opposition to the switch, 
which would bump the regular 5:45 p.m. departure time up to 5:30. 
</P>
<P>
Walking the length of the train daily, Hutton and others have been rallying 
their forces, collecting signatures on copies of letters of protest that are 
being dispatched to the commission, demanding the return of the 5:45. 
</P>
<P>
But the answer to the commuters' concerns may be on its way to Southern 
California from San Jose. Amtrak has agreed to lease an additional train to 
make the 5:45 p.m. run. The new train is coming from CalTrain, a commuter line 
between San Jose and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 99% sure the new train will enable us to leave Los Angeles at 5:45," 
said Adrienne Brooks, the commission's associate transportation analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arose during the planning of the new and much-heralded $1.8-million 
commuter train service between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles, scheduled 
to start April 30. In order to attract riders, the Transportation Commission 
hammered out a deal with Amtrak to institute a new morning and evening commuter 
run between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles with stops in several other 
Orange County stations. 
</P>
<P>
During the planning process, however, a glitch in the train scheduling prompted 
commission officials to propose shifting the 5:45 p.m. return trip to Orange 
County to 5:30, Brooks said. That would have meant the next available train for 
commuters who couldn't make it to the station by 5:30 p.m. would not leave 
until 6:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And that's when Hutton and her fellow travelers decided they were not going to 
sit and take it. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton pays $180 each month to ride from Fullerton to Los Angeles and back five 
days a week. From the time she leaves her home in the morning until she arrives 
back in her driveway, it's about a 12-hour day. She embarks in the morning on 
the 7:16 train to Los Angeles, arriving in about 35 minutes, and then catches a 
bus to her office at 8th and Hope streets. 
</P>
<P>
"In the evening the traffic is much worse," Hutton said. "It takes those of us 
who work in the vicinity of my office about an hour to get back to the train, 
when we allow time to wait for the bus, catch the bus and then walk to the 
train. I don't think those people who make transportation decisions factor 
these things in."

DIANNE KLEIN: ALI FANS GET A WHIFF OF THE CHAMP (WITH PURCHASE) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN

<P>
"Muhammad Ali. The man. The legend. The cologne." 
</P>
<P>
This is what I'm hearing on the car radio. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of a winner," it says. 
</P>
<P>
I think this has got to be a joke. An MTV promo. A bit from Live at the Improv. 
</P>
<P>
I've been around boxers. Nobody in his or her right mind would bottle their 
essence. 
</P>
<P>
I keep listening. This is for real. The Champ himself is going to be at May Co. 
department stores throughout Southern California, signing autographs "with 
purchase." 
</P>
<P>
I figure I should check this out, Thursday at noon at South Coast Plaza. I'm 
afraid I might be the only one there. I pull into the parking lot five minutes 
early. 
</P>
<P>
What I see is a line from the May Co. men's fragrance department snaking out 
the door, all the way to the corner. Hundreds of people -- men, women, children 
and infants -- have been waiting for Ali since the store opened at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
These people have made lots of purchases. (After shave: $17.50. Cologne: $28.50 
small, $38.00 large). They have brought many things, several of them rather 
strange, to be signed. They are patient. They are happy. 
</P>
<P>
A white limo zips by. The crowd goes nuts. Then The Champ is ushered inside. 
</P>
<P>
A plainclothes security guard asks one man near the front of the line: "Excuse 
me, sir. Did you make a purchase today?" 
</P>
<P>
"I made two purchases," the man says. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kasper, a car salesman from Huntington Beach, has brought a fresh baseball 
to be signed. This is Joe's thing. He has 150 signed baseballs at home. Richard 
Nixon, Oliver North, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, George Bush -- all of them 
have signed Joe's baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"I even have one of Wade Boggs and Margo Adams on the same ball, after they 
broke up," Joe says. "What I did is have Wade sign it first. Then later, I 
turned it around and had Margo sign it. She didn't even look." 
</P>
<P>
Ara Akoubian, 11 years old, is the first to step up to the man himself. This is 
an unbelievable coincidence, Ara tells me. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week he did an oral report on The Champ in his sixth-grade class in 
Anaheim Hills, before he knew about The Man, The Legend, The Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
Ara gives me an encore. He assumes the champion stance. He lowers his chin. He 
puts gravel in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, my name's Muhammad Ali," he says. "I fly like a butterfly, sting like a 
bee. There ain't no other fighter like me." 
</P>
<P>
Ali, 48 years old, retired from the ring since 1980, is sitting behind a table, 
an armed bodyguard standing on either side. He is wearing a very dark suit and 
a very red tie. He isn't saying much, although he is smiling a lot. His voice 
is barely above a whisper. He is shaking hands and kissing women and babies. 
</P>
<P>
He is signing color glossies (free with purchase) very, very slowly, with 
quivering hands. Nobody is talking too much about the quivering. That wouldn't 
be nice. They are noticing, however. They love this guy. 
</P>
<P>
J. Arthur Worth, president of Crystal Fragrances in New York, is the brains 
behind all this hype. The cologne, he says, was his idea and Ali has gone along 
just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Ali is the most well-known person in the world today," Worth says. "We wanted 
to do something, so we came upon the idea of a cologne. It's a clean product. 
Because of his religious beliefs, he couldn't promote any alcoholic beverages, 
or underwear, or anything too sexually explicit. . . . You know, Michael Jordan 
is doing underwear now." 
</P>
<P>
J. Arthur Worth says that the crowds have been like this one -- huge and 
adoring -- pretty much down the line. 
</P>
<P>
They started the promotion in August of last year in Detroit. It was the 
Midwest after that and then on down into the Deep South. This week's tour of 
Southern California is the first stab at the West. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Mississippi, at the store, and Gov. Ray Mabus calls," Worth tells 
me. "He says that he'd like to see us. I told Ali, 'We're in Mississippi. I 
don't see how we can refuse the governor.' So he sent for us and entertained us 
like royalty. He told us how great the cologne was, in his opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The line inching toward Ali, meanwhile, seems interminable. Nobody has been 
waiting less than two hours, most at least an hour beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
No one is complaining, except for one guy who has failed to make a purchase. He 
is removed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I make my way toward Ali. He tells me that it's Allah -- "that's 
A-l-l-a-h" -- who makes him so popular, although the cologne is pretty good 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wear anybody else's," he says. Before the essence of The Greatest made 
its way to the market, however, Ali confides that he used to splash on Calvin 
Klein's. 
</P>
<P>
J. Arthur Worth says that I should join The Champ and his entourage for lunch. 
I decline. It's already 2 o'clock, and the end of the line is still nowhere in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, I figure this may not be my last chance for a whiff of The Champ. 
Worth says that the cologne is just the start. 
</P>
<P>
"Rope a Dope" soap is one of the clean Muhammad Ali products that we can look 
forward to next.

NEW CURBS, GUTTERS CALLED BAND-AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents on three streets will be getting new curbs and gutters later this 
year courtesy of the city, but the homeowners say the repairs are merely a 
short-term solution to more serious soil problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an unstable soil condition that we're not addressing," said resident 
Jerry Young. 
</P>
<P>
"The houses are going into a big, black hole. What we're asking is that the 
city not turn their back on us." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week unanimously approved about $20,000 in street work 
along sections of Bel Air Circle, Delray Circle and Bermuda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Heeding the concerns of neighbors like Young, the council also voted to explore 
the possibility of installing a storm drain to prevent the chronic flooding and 
puddling that has plagued the neighborhood for years. Residents point to the 
flooding as proof of the soil problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Young, a Bel Air Circle resident, said the city shouldn't do any repair work 
until the soil is stabilized. The shifting earth is probably responsible for 
the damaged curbs and gutters, dips in the street and structural damage to 
several homes, according to a report by city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Young and other residents want the city to help them pay for damage to their 
homes. Westminster officials, however, contend that repairing damage to private 
property is the developer's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Curbs and gutters on the streets were replaced by the city in the mid-1970s, 
but residents say the repairs were only effective for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jerry Kenny said combining installation of a small storm drain 
with the curb and gutter replacements would cost about $80,000. Kenny said the 
storm drain probably couldn't be funded unless the city considered creating an 
assessment district. GREG HERNANDEZ

HIGH-RISES CALLED HOUSING SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON TEEBOOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County cities must allow more high-rise housing and more homes per acre 
so that enough affordable housing can be provided for the area, panelists said 
at a Thursday forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasing density is one of the easiest answers because it doesn't cost any 
extra money," said Rick Doremus, president of the Costa Mesa-based EPAC Housing 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
According to National Assn. of Homebuilders President Ira C. Norris, cities 
could encourage developers to provide more affordable housing by allowing more 
high-density projects. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Kreditor, executive director of USC's Lusk Center for Real Estate 
Development, said lower developer fees could cut the cost of new homes by up to 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
Kreditor and other real estate leaders said Thursday that the lack of 
affordable housing is a problem throughout Southern California, but is 
particularly acute in Orange County, one of the nation's most expensive housing 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusk Center, part of USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, annually 
picks the current "hot" topic in real estate as the focus of its regular 
forums, said Marilyn Ellis, a school spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Affordable housing is a problem everyone is dealing with," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, held at the Irvine Hilton, featured real estate and housing experts 
from Los Angeles and Orange counties. LEON TEEBOOM

DATE SHAKE STAND GETS NEW OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Corona del Mar merchant has won the bidding for the Sunshine Cove date shake 
stand, a landmark along Coast Highway between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Arden Flamson will take over the reins from Virginia McKinney, a Laguna Beach 
woman who has managed the business for the past 16 years, said Roberto 
Vellanoweth, chief of the Concession Programs Division for state parks, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flamson is co-owner of The Place, a Corona del Mar tavern, and Beach Access 
Inc., a South Coast Plaza beachwear store. Long active in the arts and with 
local charities, Flamson is currently board president of South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Flamson's husband, Richard, is board chairman of Security Pacific Corp., the 
nation's fifth-largest bank. Until January, he was also the bank's chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The date shake stand will be operated by Flamson's son and daughter-in-law, 
Mike and Katie Flamson of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Flamson edged out six competitors, Vellanoweth said, noting that officials 
considered factors such as previous business experience and how much rent the 
bidders were willing to pay the state. 
</P>
<P>
Flamson offered the state 18% of the first $10,000 gross per month and 18% of 
the gross over $10,000. McKinney offered a package of 10% and 12%, according to 
state concessions official Carlos Toirac. 
</P>
<P>
The business averaged $126,000 a year in gross income over the past five years, 
Toirac said. "We believe it could do a lot better and so, obviously, did the 
bidders who bid so high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vellanoweth said state officials expect Flamson to run a "top-notch" operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see a tremendous change in the way we're requesting this 
concessionaire to operate now," he said. "And I think it's going to be a 
tremendous benefit for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Flamson received extra points for being a woman and a small-business owner, 
state officials said. Since she applied for the business independently, her 
husband's position was not a factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, who had applied to keep the stand but later wearied of competing, 
said this week that she is ready to close up shop at the end of the month, as 
requested by the state. Her daughter, Teri Pollard, however, cried when she 
heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. I'm in tears," she said. "They're sitting up there in 
Sacramento dictating what's going to be done down here." 
</P>
<P>
Flamson is expected to reopen the stand in mid-June after it has been renovated 
and other necessary changes are made to bring the business into conformance 
with state guidelines for such concessions, including offering beachside 
service. The new operation will be required to sell or rent items such as 
umbrellas, suntan lotion and Frisbees, Toirac said. 
</P>
<P>
Some things, however, will not change. Date shakes, for example, will still be 
on the menu, Flamson said. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable, she said, that people will be sad to see McKinney leave 
after all these years. However, she added, "I hope they will be just as pleased 
with the service that we will give." LESLIE EARNEST

VFW POST IS GIVEN ULTIMATUM BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After emotional testimony from members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars post 
here, the Planning Commission agreed unanimously this week to give the veterans 
six months to either vacate their hall or comply with their use permit and 
install a new parking area. 
</P>
<P>
The post has been looking for a place to relocate since the City Council barred 
it last September from renting its facility to outside groups because of gripes 
from neighbors around the hall. 
</P>
<P>
VFW leaders say that renting out the hall was their main source of income. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors had complained of noise and litter caused by weddings and other large 
gatherings held in the hall. The problems came to a head last March when 
gunshots were fired in front of the lodge during a party. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Angry veterans lashed out at the commission Wednesday night, saying that they 
being victimized. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people bought their homes after the VFW was there," said John 
Curry, a member of the post. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans told the commission that they are having trouble selling the hall 
and finding a suitable place to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to go anywhere else unless we can sell it," Curry told the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Since the rental restrictions have gone into place, the VFW post has had to cut 
down on many of its charitable efforts, including visiting hospital-bound 
veterans during the holidays, members say. LYNDA NATALI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
LAW EMPOWERS CITY TO REMOVE FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council passed an emergency ordinance this week that gives the city 
the power to remove signs illegally placed on public utility poles and other 
public property. 
</P>
<P>
The vote Monday was considered an emergency measure because City Council runoff 
elections are scheduled for May 8 in council Districts 1 and 3, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach regulations already make the posting of bills anywhere other than on 
private property illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure is designed to promote safety of public workers, drivers and 
pedestrians, City Manager Robert Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Victor S. Grgas said signs posted with nails and staples on utility poles 
make it difficult for workers to scale the poles and can make their jobs more 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
"Signs placed in the roadway (also) may block the view of drivers or distract 
the pedestrian or the driver from paying attention to their safety," Grgas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A special provision was made in the ordinance to allow the staff to investigate 
how the city can accommodate local real estate agents, who protested that the 
sign laws hinder their ability to advertise properties for sale.

COURT HEARING STALLS OPENING OF NEWEST CAR-POOL LANE; 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY: THE 14-MILE STRIP THROUGH IRVINE WAS TO OPEN TODAY. CALTRANS POSTPONED 
THE DEBUT UNTIL A SAFETY ISSUE RAISED BY OPPONENTS IS RESOLVED.

<P>
The opening of a northbound car-pool lane on the San Diego Freeway through 
Irvine was postponed by Caltrans officials Thursday until after a court hearing 
next week on the safety of such lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-mile strip, from Interstate 5 to the Corona del Mar Freeway, was ready 
to open by today. But attorneys for the California Department of Transportation 
decided to delay the opening until after a hearing April 19 on a lawsuit by 
car-pool lane opponents, said Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we are waiting until after the hearing to open the freeway is to 
satisfy everyone's concerns about the safety of the car-pool lanes," Miranda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that Caltrans has already met all the standards set by the federal 
and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawsuit disagrees. Filed in Orange County Superior Court by Drivers for 
Highway Safety, the suit claims Caltrans has not adequately studied the safety 
and efficiency of car-pool lanes, said Bill Ward, a leader of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he was afraid the public would blame Drivers for Highway Safety for 
prolonging the wait to open the extra freeway lane. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not us who's delaying the opening. It's Caltrans," Ward said. "We want it 
open, and we want it opened for everyone," not just car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Although John Lenz, transportation coordinator for AVCO Financial Services, 
opposes Drivers for Highway Safety, he agreed that the group should not be 
blamed for stalling the opening of the freeway. He too blamed Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly upset," Lenz said. "We want these lanes opened now. . . . I don't 
see what's taking Caltrans so long to open them." 
</P>
<P>
Lenz, who said 125 employees at his Irvine company would use the car-pool lane, 
said he was circulating a petition Thursday among transportation coordinators 
from several companies to urge Caltrans to open the lane. He said he had 
started the petition before he learned that Caltrans decided against opening 
the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Cohen, executive director of the Cypress Business Park Transportation 
Management Assn., said she also was disappointed by Caltrans' decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a public-relations stunt," she said. "Caltrans does not want to get a bad 
public image" by opening the lane while facing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on car-pool lanes in both directions from the Corona del Mar 
freeway to the El Toro "Y" began in January, 1988, Miranda said. But it has 
taken until now to buttress the freeway's shoulders, paint new lines and make 
sure the center lanes were ready to support cars with more than one passenger. 
Some minor construction remains to be completed on the southbound car-pool 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and opponents of car-pool lanes faced off Monday in a protest atop a 
pedestrian bridge over the San Diego Freeway in Irvine. The two sides ended 
their demonstration only after a California Highway Patrol officer pulled into 
the car-pool lane below them and told them they were disrupting traffic and 
would have to disperse.

MEDICAL BOARD PULLS LICENSE OF LAGUNA DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state medical board has suspended a Laguna Beach doctor's medical license 
for three months for prescribing drugs excessively. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert A. Leslie could not be reached for comment Thursday. But according 
to records from the Medical Board of California, once his suspension is lifted 
in mid-June, the general practitioner will be monitored closely for the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the medical board accused Huntington Beach physician 
Jasmine Moini of gross negligence, unwarranted treatment and fraudulently 
altering medical records. The board recommended that her license be revoked or 
suspended if the charges are upheld at an administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment, Moini said: "There's nothing to say really. These are 
accusations. Anybody can accuse anybody." 
</P>
<P>
In Leslie's case, the medical board opened a disciplinary proceeding after he 
was found guilty in Los Angeles County Municipal Court on Oct. 9, 1986, of 
excessive prescribing. He was also convicted of prescribing Valium to a person 
not under his treatment and "prescribing Tylenol with codeine for addicts." 
</P>
<P>
At that time, medical board documents said, Leslie was fined, placed on two 
years' probation and ordered to spend 90 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
At a medical board hearing last summer, administrative law judge Rosalyn 
Chapman reviewed the misdemeanor convictions and concluded that Leslie "is not 
rehabilitated" but rather "obsessed with overturning his convictions" and so 
"unable to objectively evaluate his conduct which led to the convictions." 
</P>
<P>
She ordered that Leslie could resume practicing medicine after the suspension 
if he abstained from all personal use or possession of controlled substances. 
In addition, Leslie was ordered to provide free medical services to a community 
agency for 18 months and to take a course in drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Moini stem from half a dozen patient visits in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when treating a patient identified only as "L.H." for a sore 
throat, Moini allegedly failed to perform a proper physical exam before 
ordering a series of "clearly excessive lab tests" and diagnosing the patient 
as having "among other things, chest pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease . . . and a urinary tract infection." 
</P>
<P>
The medical board also asserted that Moini "committed a dishonest act 
substantially related to the functions and duties of a physician." 
</P>
<P>
It claimed that in January, 1987, Moini sent L.H.'s medical records to another 
physician. But when the medical board asked for the same records, the file it 
received in December, 1987, contained "supplemental information" that indicated 
the file had been "fraudulently" altered.

<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Garden Grove convenience store, who was about to deposit his 
store's receipts, was robbed Thursday of $7,000 in the parking lot of a bank, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Surjit Singh Bajwa, 31, of Westminster was approached by a man armed with a 
handgun about 2:20 p.m. as Bajwa stepped from his car in the parking lot of 
Bank of America, 6951 Westminster Blvd., Sgt. Bill Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Bajwa, who operates a 7-Eleven store, handed the robber the money and was not 
harmed, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit was described as white with brown hair, 20 to 25 years old, about 
six feet tall and weighing 180 pounds. He was wearing a light-colored shirt and 
jeans. He was seen fleeing in an older-model orange Datsun station wagon, the 
sergeant said.

ANTI-ABORTION LEADER TERRY FREE, BACK AT IT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his first public appearance since serving a four-month jail sentence in 
Atlanta for charges related to an anti-abortion demonstration, Operation Rescue 
founder Randall Terry implored supporters Thursday to expand their battle to 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said his organization would start giving out work and home phone numbers 
of judges and district attorneys who are involved in abortion issues and would 
begin picketing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're great at getting people at the 'rescues,' " Terry said, referring to 
their sit-ins, "but we're miserable at getting them in court." 
</P>
<P>
Terry drew four standing ovations from a crowd of 5,000 during an anti-abortion 
rally at the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two years that Terry has made an Easter Week 
appearance at the Fellowship. Anaheim is headquarters for Operation Rescue's 
Southern California branch, the second-largest of the organization's 125 
chapters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the church Thursday, 40 sign-carrying protesters from the Orange County 
Pro-Choice Coalition loudly jeered Terry's supporters as they entered the 
parking lot. One sign said: "The only thing they're rescuing is Randall Terry 
-- from obscurity." 
</P>
<P>
Last October the 30-year-old Terry was found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing 
charges arising from a 1988 anti-abortion demonstration in Atlanta, where 1,300 
of his supporters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Since his release in January from the Fulton County Jail, Terry has continued 
to face legal battles of his own. He told the crowd that he has been named in 
at least 17 civil lawsuits across the nation stemming from his controversial 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Terry's call to rally anti-abortion troops Thursday night is part of a weeklong 
series of Operation Rescue-sponsored demonstrations, marches and sit-ins at 
Southern California abortion clinics, in an awareness campaign coinciding with 
Easter Sunday, Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Operation Rescue and abortion rights advocates faced off at 
an Orange family planning clinic. About 50 Operation Rescue supporters armed 
with pickets, leaflets and rosaries gathered on the sidewalk outside the Family 
Planning Associates Medical Group, at times clashing verbally with a dozen 
counterdemonstrators organized by the Orange County Pro-Choice Coalition. There 
were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Past Operation Rescue demonstrations have been marked by high numbers of 
arrests. For example, during Easter Week last year 373 Operation Rescue 
demonstrators were arrested at a Cypress clinic. 
</P>
<P>
However, there have been no arrests during 12 sit-ins that have taken place 
since January. Finn said Operation Rescue uses the same tactics, but police 
have changed their strategy and limit their activity to a guard-like presence.

$8.9-MILLION LOSS BY KARCHER BLAMED ON LAG IN PHOENIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said Thursday that it lost $8.9 million in the 
fourth quarter largely due to the establishment of a reserve to pay for the 
restructuring of its struggling Arizona operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company set aside $14.5 million in the three-month period ended Jan. 29 for 
the restructuring, which could involve the sale, closing or franchising of its 
40 Carl's Jr. outlets in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent that the Arizona market does not make economic sense 
for corporate operations," said Donald F. Karcher, the company's president and 
chief operating officer. "The future investment required would be prohibitive 
in view of the expected return." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter loss on revenues of $118 million compared to net earnings of 
$4.2 million on revenues of $111.3 million for the same period a year ago. For 
the year, the company's earnings slumped to $5.6 million on revenues of $511.3 
million from $20.8 million on revenues of $445.9 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials attributed the fourth-quarter loss to the soft Arizona 
economy, which is depressed because of a real estate slump and failure of many 
local financial institutions. The firm also cited strong competition, 
discounting and higher food prices as contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher, which entered the Arizona market in 1983, said that operations in 
Arizona, particularly in the Phoenix area, have been a drain on earnings. The 
fast-food firm estimated that it lost $5 million in the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher said the company wants to redirect into stronger markets, which include 
California, Nevada and Oregon. The company is also trying to expand its 
international presence with restaurants in Japan and those planned for western 
Canada and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"We will now focus our resources on our other proven markets," Karcher said in 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $9, down 25 cents in trading Thursday on the New 
York Stock Exchange. But industry analysts viewed Karcher's decision to 
reorganize, and possibly abandon Arizona, as a good one. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Rockwell, a fast-food industry analyst for Alexander Brown and Sons 
in Baltimore, said the company was sound but was not willing to withstand 
losses for several years in a depressed market. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl's just said, 'enough is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
Karcher officials said the chain, which has 553 company-owned and franchised 
restaurants that carry its distinctive Happy Star logo, has faced a series of 
obstacles ever since entering the Phoenix market. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Wisely, Karcher's group vice president for marketing, said that some 
of the best locations and opportunities for reasonably priced leases had been 
grabbed by competitors by the time the first Carl's Jr. restaurants were being 
established in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
In the less-developed Tucson market, however, Karcher has prospered enough that 
it was able to buy out eight former Wendy's locations to give it a total of 14 
Carl's Jr. stores. Wisely said that the restaurants in Tucson, which is viewed 
as a separate media market from Phoenix and is not as sprawling, have 
approached an average of $19,000 in weekly sales, compared to $23,000 in the 
average Carl's Jr. restaurant in California. 
</P>
<P>
Though the market remains lucrative, Wisely said that the Tucson operations 
would become too unwieldy to manage from afar if the Phoenix restaurants are 
sold off or franchised. A Flagstaff outlet is already franchised. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial problems in Arizona, Loren Pannier, Karcher's chief 
financial officer, said the company is still growth-minded in its proven 
markets but is "taking a more cautious approach" in its expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company opened 52 restaurants in the previous fiscal year but is 
scaling down its expansion to 30 company-owned stores in the present year, with 
another 15 being introduced by franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see we had a disappointment on the earnings side," he said in 
explaining the slowdown in expansion. "You want to grow on the revenue side, 
but you must bring more to the bottom line."

COMPANIES ARE FEELING EFFECTS OF 'DEBT BINGE' IN '80S, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hardly a day passes, it seems, that the newspapers don't have stories about 
companies staggering or collapsing under the weight of debt. Firms like Campeau 
Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. have become synonymous with credit and 
debt problems. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other, smaller companies that have found themselves in similar 
straits, like Interco Inc., Seaman Furniture Co. and Revco D.S. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
More firms are likely to encounter trouble, economists say. As that happens, 
the economy could suffer from the fallout of the 1980s debt binge. 
</P>
<P>
"As (debt) has increased, it has become somewhat more of a problem and tends to 
further aggravate the slowdown in economic activity at the corporate and 
national level," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
At an extreme, corporate debt problems could snowball into a financial crisis 
for the entire country, Jasinowski said, adding that while such a scenario is 
unlikely, "you can't rule it out altogether." 
</P>
<P>
One danger of debt overload is that, with the interdependence of U.S. 
industries, one company's problems can threaten the stability of others. 
</P>
<P>
Before Campeau's Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores units filed for 
bankruptcy court protection, for example, the retailer's vendors worried that 
they could lose millions of dollars in business or not be paid for merchandise 
already shipped. 
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski spoke of another danger: Companies could be so stymied by debt that 
they lose their competitive edge, especially against foreigners. When a firm 
spends more money on debt payments, it has less money to grow or improve. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome E. Hass, professor of managerial economics and finance at Cornell 
University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, said Interco was an example 
of an indebted manufacturer that could lose business to rivals. Interco is 
strapped for cash because it hasn't been able to sell assets to finance a 
$2.8-billion recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Converse unit, which makes sneakers in competition with 
well-known brands like Nike and Reebok, has to keep up its research and 
advertising spending to contend with its rivals. If Interco's finances don't 
improve, funds for those key areas could be cut back, Hass said. 
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski acknowledged that loss of productivity and investment because of 
debt is not widespread now. But he said it contributes to the current economic 
slowdown, and the country could begin to feel the impact in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it could be felt if more companies run into trouble, and many 
economists expect it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economy turns down, then there's going to be numerous cases of 
financial distress," said Gregg A. Jarrell, a finance professor at the 
University of Rochester's William E. Simon School of Business. He said some 
companies will have problems even if the economy's growth remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Companies went into debt because money was easy to buy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
When junk bonds became the way to finance acquisitions or restructurings, many 
companies willingly committed themselves to millions of dollars in high 
interest payments. At its height, the junk bond market was worth more than $200 
billion, and many of the bonds carried interest rates of 16% or higher. 
</P>
<P>
When the market collapsed -- contributing to the demise of its creator, Drexel 
Burnham Lambert -- financing became scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies thought they would be unable to pay high interest bills. But many 
also didn't expect the economy to slow, which it has, and they didn't expect 
interest rates to rise or profits to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, said Jarrell, "it's inevitable as time passes that some of the 
businesses that these firms are in will turn down before they get their 
leverage down . . . and that some of the projections to support the debt will 
be overly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, he said, is that some industries are cyclical, and when 
they go through low points, highly indebted companies get hurt first. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping retail business has provided some of the most painful examples of 
the hazards of excessive debt. Besides Campeau, retailers such as Seaman and 
Revco, both of which changed owners in deals financed by junk bonds, found that 
they couldn't meet debt payments because of insufficient sales. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, debt-burdened companies are not collapsing around us, as some 
descriptions suggest. 
</P>
<P>
The number of business failures in the United States fell 5.7% from the 
beginning of this year through mid-February, compared with the same period of 
1989, figures compiled by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. show. 
</P>
<P>
For all of last year, business failures, which include bankruptcies, dropped 
12.9% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of some larger businesses may have dominated headlines, but "many 
of the small businesses did not incur lots of debt and are not weakened by 
leveraged buyouts they may have done," said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist 
with Wefa Group, an economic forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A company that can't pay bills or obtain more credit must take drastic steps to 
avoid default. 
</P>
<P>
Some look for new investors to provide a quick cash infusion. The British 
company Waterford Wedgwood PLC did this recently to alleviate some of its debt 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
Some sell assets. But, as Interco has found, finding a buyer for an entire 
division isn't as easy as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, prices for subsidiaries -- like prices for entire companies -- have 
fallen. That means the proceeds from a sale may not go as far to reduce debt as 
a company had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
A firm in trouble can also try to renegotiate terms with lenders, as Interco 
did recently. 
</P>
<P>
If all else fails, companies can begin reducing costs. That means layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"An interest payment cannot be laid off in the same way an employee can be," 
said John Lonski, senior economist with Moody's Investors Service Inc. 
</P>
<P>
If the economy slows further, he said, "we should see companies respond all the 
more quickly in the way of laying off employees."

DOWNEY S&amp;L COULD BECOME DOWNEY BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Downey Savings &amp; Loan's days as a thrift may be numbered. It could soon 
become a bank and leave the woes of the thrift industry behind. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of a Downey Bank sometime next year was revealed by Maurice L. 
McAlister, the thrift's president, and David L. Boyles, the man who was hired 
Thursday to transform Downey's operations into more bank-like services. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seriously looking at whether it makes sense to be an S&amp;L," McAlister 
said. "We could convert in a year or so." 
</P>
<P>
Boyles has grasped the regulatory woes quickly: "We're not going to be allowed 
to do anything more than what national banks can do, and yet we have to 
maintain 70% (of assets) in mortgage lending," he said. "Profitability in that 
is low." 
</P>
<P>
Boyles, 41, a senior vice president at Bank of America, was named Downey's 
executive vice president and chief operating officer. The appointment fills 
long-vacant positions and sets him up as the S&amp;L's next leader. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister, Downey's co-founder who will soon turn 65, said Boyles will expand 
the S&amp;L's car-loan and home-equity loan products, promote lines of credit 
for small businesses and oversee the thrift's traditional mortgage-lending 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L needs Boyles' commercial banking experience, McAlister said, 
because a recent federal law is forcing major changes in the beleaguered thrift 
industry -- including healthy S&amp;Ls such as Downey. The new rules caused 
Downey to post a $9.4-million loss for the fourth quarter last fall, reducing 
its annual profit to $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts greeted Downey's hiring of Boyles and its intention to expand 
into banking operations -- even possibly converting to a bank -- as a smart 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic (profit) spreads on mortgages are small and getting smaller," said 
Michael Abrahams, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. brokerage 
in Los Angeles. "So how do you make money? You go more into consumer loans and 
other bank activities." 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Bank of America's senior management, Boyles had been in charge 
of consumer markets, consisting of all card services, automobile-dealer 
banking, consumer credit administration, merchant services and electronic 
banking. 
</P>
<P>
As the person behind McAlister and Downey's chief executive and co-founder, 
Gerald H. McQuarrie, 67, Boyles could become the heir apparent to Downey's 
leadership. As one insider put it: "It's now his to win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he and McQuarrie hope to spend less time at the helm of Downey 
but have no immediate plans to retire completely. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's long-successful business plan was driven by its real estate 
investments, and regulators allowed the S&amp;L to hold three times the amount 
that other thrifts could hold. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan was derailed by the federal law enacted in August to rescue the 
industry's deposit insurance system. Among its mandates, the law requires 
thrifts to rid themselves of all real estate holdings that are backed by 
insured deposits and to put 70% of its assets in home financing. 
</P>
<P>
With Boyles in place to run daily operations, McAlister and McQuarrie are now 
free to work on the sale of the thrift's real estate projects, which numbered 
145 a year ago and included 94 neighborhood shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L, regarded as one of the best-run shops in the nation, built an 
impressive empire with $4 billion in assets on its real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
It typically took options on raw land and leased or sold the projects before it 
committed itself to buying the properties. Then, by undervaluing the properties 
on its books, the S&amp;L gained tremendous hidden value. In 1987, for 
instance, the real estate represented only 7.8% of Downey's assets but 
generated 27% of both its total revenue and its operating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he expects to sell the S&amp;L's real estate holdings within 18 
months. Already, it has sold or has in escrow 11 projects, including six 
shopping centers, for a total price of $149.9 million. The gain from those 
sales alone is expected to be about $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, 
estimates that the sales will produce gains of at least $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
In one way, the federal law has played into Downey's hands. From the 
acquisition of insolvent Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana 18 months 
ago, the S&amp;L has $95 million in tax credits that it must use this year or 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
Abrahams figures Downey will generate $45 million in pretax income this year. 
And with the sales of its properties, it should have no trouble producing the 
rest of the income it needs to use all of its tax credits, according to 
Campbell Chaney, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. brokerage in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilson said, Downey has $105 million more available in tax credits 
from the Butterfield purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds also will give Downey a gigantic capital base that will enable it 
to do just about anything it wants, including converting its charter to a bank 
charter, Downey executives believe. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L already exceeds all capital requirements mandated by federal law 
and regulations, and, as of Wednesday night, it had $148.2 million in excess 
capital -- the amount above what it would be required to have in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, however, won't abandon the real estate development business, McAlister 
said. It plans to use its real estate subsidiary to borrow money -- probably 
through short-term arrangements called commercial paper, which would be issued 
by banks -- to resume its property acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
As long as federally insured deposits are not supporting the ventures, he said, 
the subsidiary is free to obtain its capital elsewhere and continue operations. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's stock -- it closed at $15.25 a share Thursday, up 25 cents a share 
from Wednesday's close -- is considered by the analysts to be undervalued and a 
good buy for investors. The market has been treating all S&amp;Ls the same, the 
analysts said, and has not been good to the industry.

KEATING TESTIFIES HE WAS VICTIM OF VENDETTA BY REGULATOR, LOBBYIST

<P>
Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr. on Thursday portrayed himself as the 
victim of a vendetta by the thrift industry's top lobbyist and the lobbyist's 
son, a top federal S&amp;L regulator. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said William B. O'Connell, then president of the U.S. League of Savings 
Institutions, and Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin Gray began waging 
a campaign against him after he bought Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Only years later, Keating testified in U.S. District Court, he learned that 
Kevin O'Connell, the regulator in charge of drafting the memorandum justifying 
Lincoln's takeover, and William O'Connell were related. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out in 1988 that this O'Connell is (William) O'Connell's son," 
Keating testified, pointing to the younger O'Connell, who several months before 
the takeover was made the chief regulatory official over Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has now spent six full days on the witness stand in 23 days of hearings 
on his lawsuit challenging the government's takeover of Lincoln as illegal and 
seeking the return of the S&amp;L to him. 
</P>
<P>
Keating pointed to a bank board memo dated April 7, 1989 -- seven days before 
the government seized control of Lincoln -- from Kevin O'Connell to Alvin 
Smuzynski, deputy director of the board's office of regulatory activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Even our lawyers are finally getting the message," the memo said. "Under every 
document is another scam, and they seem to finally understand what type of 
thieves we are dealing with and why we need to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying memo, O'Connell said that just one day earlier -- April 6 -- 
$40 million was removed from Lincoln subsidiaries despite a December, 1988, 
directive from regulators not to engage in transactions above $10 million 
without notifying them. 
</P>
<P>
Keating defended the April 6 transaction, saying the money was non-insured 
deposits that he ordered transferred to Lincoln accounts at Bankers Trust, a 
major money center bank in New York.

TUSTIN NURSING-HOME FIRM'S REORGANIZATION OKD; 
</P>
<P>
BANKRUPTCY: CARE ENTERPRISES INC. WINS COURT APPROVAL OF A PLAN THAT WILL 
ENABLE IT TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER 11 BY YEAR'S END.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost exactly two years after seeking protection from the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, Care Enterprises Inc. has received court approval of a reorganization 
plan that would enable the Tustin-based nursing-home company to emerge from 
Chapter 11 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved March 29 by Judge Arthur Greenwald, is scheduled to take 
effect Dec. 31. The delay is designed to give the company time to raise about 
$20 million to pay its creditors, primarily through the sale of assets, said 
Care Enterprises attorney David Kupetz. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Drumwright, Care Enterprises' chief executive, said Thursday that since 
last November the company has raised about $5 million through the sale of 
interests in nine nursing homes and other facilities in California and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
To raise the remaining $15 million, Drumwright said, the company will sell its 
real estate or leasehold interests in 12 to 20 of its remaining 78 facilities. 
While most of those facilities are in California, some are in New Mexico, Ohio 
and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Under the adopted plan of reorganization, Kupetz said, the current shareholders 
in Care Enterprises will receive 10% of the stock that will be issued in the 
newly organized firm, while the rest of the stock will go to the company's 
unsecured creditors. The company's bank creditors will be paid over an extended 
time schedule, he added. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the judge issues a written acceptance of the plan, which is expected 
in about a week, Kupetz said, Care Enterprises' existing stock will be 
cancelled and a new board of directors will take charge of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Care Enterprises filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on March 28, 1988. The 
basic terms for reorganizing the company's debt were agreed to by the bank 
lenders, the company and the unsecured creditors last summer, Kupetz said. As 
part of the agreement, the founders and top two executives of the firm, 
brothers Dee Roy and Lee Roy Bangerter, resigned last July. 
</P>
<P>
But court consideration of the plan was delayed, Kupetz said, after it became 
clear that Congress would repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Health Care Act, 
thus reducing the reimbursement that nursing homes receive from Medicare. In 
response, Kupetz said, the proposed reorganization plan was modified to 
lengthen the period for repaying Care Enterprises' bank creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Drumwright said that in selecting Care Enterprises facilities to sell, an 
effort will be made to divest the nursing homes causing a drain on the 
company's earnings. He said the strategy also will be to retain geographic 
diversity and to "hold onto Health Care Network," the company's money-making 
pharmacy operation, which is believed to have strong growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
Drumwright said that while Care Enterprises will report a large loss for the 
1989 calendar year, he expects the company's operations to break even in the 
current year and to become solidly profitable in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
When Care Enterprises filed its Chapter 11 petition, it listed $256.9 million 
in assets and $180.4 million in debt. It entered bankruptcy after seven months 
of unsuccessful negotiations with lenders to restructure its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1965, Care Enterprises rapidly became one of the 10 largest 
nursing-home chains in the nation. But the firm sustained huge losses after a 
major expansion drive in 1985 when it acquired 35 nursing homes from a company 
called Americare. Care Enterprises lost nearly $10 million in 1986 and another 
$13 million in the first three quarters of 1987.

FRANK ISRAEL'S TALK IS GLIMPSE INTO HIS 'STYLIST' ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I never professed to be an originator," Los Angeles architect Frank Israel 
told his audience at UC Irvine's Beckman Center on Wednesday night. "I'm more 
of a stylist." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as he showed slides of a number of the private homes he designed during 
the past decade, his "stylist" profile was paramount. Here were lush sweeps of 
color, sybaritic fountains and pools, amusing details and fanciful furniture 
designs. Very often the project was a remodeling, a Cinderella transformation 
of a building that was too ordinary, too decrepit or simply too small to 
accommodate the Southern California lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"The client is almost always the best critic," Israel said, joking that his 
office staff says he "gives in too easily" to client demands. He maintains, 
though, that "many times a client can inspire the most avant-garde solution." 
</P>
<P>
Take the Hancock Park home of fashion designer Michele Lamy and her husband, 
avant-garde film maker Richard Newton. They hated their Colonial-style 
dwelling, bought only because it is near their daughter's school. Newton had 
already made anarchic patterns on the lawn with a machete when Israel came in 
for a consultation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple wanted to build onto the front of the house, but Israel thought it 
prudent to respect the setback of the neighboring houses, each with its tidy 
handkerchief of lawn. The solution was a monumental "pavilion" built onto the 
back of the house and overlooking the pool. Intended to "transform" but not 
"upstage" the existing house, it nevertheless features a startling facade of 
yellow and red pigmented stucco that abuts the white and blue clapboard of the 
original structure. 
</P>
<P>
It was so startling, in fact, that a neighbor threw rocks at Israel one day. 
"She just hated the color," he said. "I don't want to offend people with my 
work, but I don't believe in design controls." 
</P>
<P>
Lamy and Newton, he added, are now contemplating redoing the house in a 
Caribbean motif "with a thatched roof," a notion that drew hoots of laughter 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's sources -- or "references," as he repeatedly called them -- are the 
airy houses of leading architect Rudolph Schindler, who was active in Southern 
California during the '20s, '30s and '40s. (Schindler once said his houses 
"combine the solidity of the cave with the lightweight character of a tent.") 
</P>
<P>
In the Lamy-Newton house, the lavish use of glass creates "situations where 
you're not sure whether you're inside or outside, in the old or the new house," 
Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, a reedy 6-foot-3, was jokingly introduced by Newport Beach architect 
Alex Caragonne as "Little Frank" to distinguish him from his better-known Los 
Angeles colleague, "big" Frank Gehry. Israel, who is 45, is an associate 
professor at the UCLA School of Architecture and 
</P>
<P>
founder of Franklin D. Israel Design Associates in Beverly Hills. He was 
recently appointed a director of the American School in Rome, where he studied 
in the mid-'70s as the winner of the Prix de Rome. He was for a time an art 
director at Paramount Pictures, and he has designed film production offices and 
homes for a number of Hollywood folk. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's remodeling of a Malibu condominium owned by director Robert Altman was 
inspired by the client's desire for the openness of his New York City loft as 
much as by Altman's desire to make the most of the innate qualities of the 
beachfront site. Because the Coastal Commission forbade any changes to the 
exterior, Israel was obliged to focus on the interior. 
</P>
<P>
He opened it up, installing "a light scoop -- a periscope to the sun," redid 
the floor in limestone, and he used lots of his favorite pale sea-green. A 
pivoting transom in iridescent glass -- it reflects rainbow patterns on the 
wall -- was a typical Israel touch. So was the bedroom, designed to suggest the 
odd experience of "sleeping under the hull of a ship." A spiraling banister on 
the stairway imitates the curve of a Nautilus shell. 
</P>
<P>
During the question-and-answer period after the presentation, Israel was asked 
whether it isn't easier just to build a new house rather than attempt to revamp 
an existing one. "It costs as much to save as to tear down," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the other phenomenon that seems to accompany remodeling. "A lot of 
my clients are getting divorced," he said. "During a period of three years, I 
went through five divorces. . . . (Some people) feel they can save their 
marriage if they remodel their house. . . . But we got a lot of work out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's talk was the last lecture in "California and Beyond: the State of 
Design in the '90s," an architecture and design series sponsored by Newport 
Harbor Art Museum's member group, the Forum.

RESTAURANTS RISE TO THE EASTER OCCASION

<P>
Sunrise services, the Hallelujah Chorus, colorful baskets, egg hunts -- to all 
these longtime Easter traditions, many Orange Countians now add dining out. So 
virtually all local hotels and most restaurants meet the demand by offering 
gala brunches or holiday dinners, or both, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations, of course, are essential. Here are just a few of the 
possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
* At the Disneyland Hotel's Easter brunch, children up to 12 years old will 
hunt for eggs on the gazebo lawn from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The brunch itself, 
served in the grand ballroom from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., highlights a buffet 
of round of beef, roast leg of lamb, seafood, freshly made waffles and omelets, 
intricately decorated Easter eggs. Reservations: (714) 956-6709. 
</P>
<P>
* With an Easter bunny to snap your picture, a magician to entertain, the 
Reuben E. Lee in Newport Beach serves a champagne buffet brunch from 9 a.m. to 
3 p.m. It's $16.95 for adults, $7.95 for children ages 5 to 12. Sunday Easter 
dinner, starting at 3 p.m., features a complete ham dinner for $12.95. (714) 
675-5910. 
</P>
<P>
* At John Dominis overlooking Newport Bay, the buffet brunch will be served on 
both floors from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. A sampling: carved baron of beef, turkey, 
made-to-order shrimp scampi and sushi, fruits with Belgian chocolate for 
dipping. It's $18.95 per person without champagne and $21.95 with. (714) 
540-5112. 
</P>
<P>
* Also on the bay, Newport Landing on Balboa peninsula features a sit-down 
champagne brunch from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Selections vary from Belgian waffles 
with macadamia nuts, chocolate chips or berries to abalone benedict, New York 
steak and eggs. Afterward, move upstairs to the oyster bar and lounge, when the 
calypso band, The Islanders play from 1 to 5 p.m. Reservations: (714) 675-2373. 
</P>
<P>
* At the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, the hotel's award-winning executive chef 
Christian Rassinoux and his staff will create an Easter brunch to enjoy in the 
Cafe and at the Pavilion from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The tab is $35 per person, 
with children under 12 half-price. (714) 240-5008. 
</P>
<P>
* Spring lamb will be the specialty for Easter dinner, beginning at 5 p.m., at 
Mon Chateau in El Toro. Other entree possibilities: fresh Dover sole, mussels 
Brussels style, rabbit with prunes and red wine, and frog legs in garlic 
butter. Prices for complete dinners, including soup and salad, are $13.50 to 
$23. Reservations: (714) 830-3810. 
</P>
<P>
* Serenely located in Aliso Canyon, Laguna Beach, Ben Brown's will begin brunch 
at 9 a.m. and serve until 3. Highlights of the a la carte menu include cheese 
blintzes; poached eggs in puff pastry with Canadian bacon, Belgian endive, and 
glazed pear; and poached salmon with mousseline of tarragon. Prices range from 
$6.50 to $12.50. Dinner, starting at 4:30, will feature prime rib, roast pork 
loin German style and roast leg of lamb in addition to the regular menu. 
</P>
<P>
* To accommodate sunrise-risers, the El Torito-owned family of restaurants will 
all open earlier on Easter. Las Brisas in Laguna Beach ((714) 497-5434) will 
begin serving brunch at 8 a.m., Chanteclair in Irvine ((714) 752-8001) at 8:30 
a.m., the El Torito Grills in Newport Beach ((714) 640-2875) and South Coast 
Plaza ((714) 662-2672) and Remicks in Irvine ((714) 553-1305) at 9. Hint for 
last-minute reservations: The early spots are most likely to be open (and there 
will be no waiting for others to finish). 
</P>
<P>
* At the Bouzy Rouge in Newport, a string quartet will entertain while 
brunchers order from the menu. Specialties for Easter vary from duck lasagna 
and Danish veal frikadeller to Caribbean curried chicken and apple quiche. 
Served from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., brunch includes a glass of champagne, and prices 
range from $9.50 to $15.95. Reservations: (714) 673-3440.

A SURPRISINGLY GOOD BISTRO WHERE CARE IS NEVER PUT ON THE BACK BURNER

HUNTINGTON BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising restaurant, and not only because it's so 
accommodating (chef Rochelle Robinson recently obliged a customer's last-minute 
request for a cheese souffle, something she usually requires at least two-days' 
notice to make). 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast Highway just isn't the place one expects to find a bistro . . . 
much less a pretty good one. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant belongs to Yves Briee, of Le Biarritz in Newport Beach, and he's 
about as authentic a Frenchman as you'll find in these parts. His new 
restaurant is a combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic; walls 
and tablecloths are colored a soft pastel rose, and little Deco-style lamps are 
mounted on the walls over every booth. 
</P>
<P>
The food at Voila is rarely brilliant but, rather, basically hearty fare cooked 
with obvious care. 
</P>
<P>
One dish that is brilliant is the French onion soup, one of the most mishandled 
dishes in the country French repertoire. Here the onions are braised to 
sweetness and cooked in a superb, rich stock; a light, bubbly cheese crust and 
frizzled onions add delightful contrast and pungency. 
</P>
<P>
Salads are less inspired. The house Caesar I tasted was a bit limp, despite a 
tasty dressing. The same went for a dinner salad: The creamed herb dressing 
could not have been better, but the red leaf and bibb lettuces had almost no 
crispness. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't care much for an appetizer called California mini-pizzas, though 
properly done, the dish would have fit in at any bistro. You get six 
mini-pizzas to an order with toppings like olive, green pepper and onion. On 
the plate they looked appetizing, but the pizzas had little snap to them; it 
was almost as if they had been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pate maison, on the other hand, was wonderful, even though the waiter admitted 
that the restaurant gets it from an outside supplier. The one I tasted -- a 
grainy, country-style pate -- was flavorful, richly textured and the perfect 
match for the good house rolls baked daily by Briee's wife at her own catering 
company. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the raison d'etre of this restaurant is a dish called duck a la Voila 
-- simply the best duck I've had in Orange County. The duck is smoked on the 
premises, then braised until it's fall-off-the-bone delicious. The skin is a 
dark, cherrywood red with a rich demi-glace burnished into it. With the duck 
come garlic-roasted potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Other main dishes pale in comparison. Lamb loin Zinfandel is the best of the 
rest -- an average cut of lamb cooked in a good, eccentric sauce flavored with 
pear and mint. Fish tends to be overcooked, so be sure to tell the kitchen how 
you like it. Grilled salmon comes in a light champagne lemon-lime butter. Sea 
bass is topped with an herb butter sauce. Pritikin-style red snapper has either 
a pineapple-cilantro sauce or a tomato-caper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Now we come to that cheese souffle. As expected, it was a very good one: airy, 
buttery and firm. The chef prepared it with two kinds of cheese, as best as I 
could tell a mild Cheddar, and a Monterey Jack for extra body. A friend of mine 
-- the customer who requested it -- was very pleased. And the chef has a fan 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
I'd recommend a souffle for dessert, as well. For that only 20 minutes' notice 
is required. The house specialty is fresh raspberry souffle, but that's a 
seasonal dish you'll have to wait a couple more weeks for. Until then, content 
yourself with a full-flavored chocolate souffle, served with a runny chocolate 
sauce on the side. There's also that old warhorse of a souffle, Grand Marnier, 
crusted with slightly caramelized sugar. Among the non-puffing desserts, the 
chocolate mousse cake is terrific. Now if Robinson would only consider 
cassoulet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Voila Bistro and Grill is moderately priced. Lunch is $4.25 to $8.95. Dinners 
are $10.95 to $16.95. There is a good, reasonably priced wine list.

SINGLE LIFE: HYPNOSIS OFFERS NEW WAY TO ALTER UNWANTED TRAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brooke, 32, is a prosperous Tustin business owner who hadn't had much luck 
dating men until she tried a new approach: hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"Before hypnotherapy, I chose all the wrong men. I always went after the ones 
who didn't want commitments or who gave me a bad time." 
</P>
<P>
After a few sessions with Irvine hypnotherapist Joanna Aten, Brooke saw an 
immediate improvement. "It has been about six months since I finished my 
sessions, and everybody who knows me has commented on the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Brooke says she started dating a man who treats her exactly as she hoped 
someone would. "In the past I wouldn't have given him the time of day; he was 
too nice. But from my new vantage point I can really appreciate a good man." 
</P>
<P>
Hypnosis is a method of suggestion or persuasion that is most commonly 
performed by a facilitator (the hypnotherapist) who helps alter unwanted 
behavior. In 1958, the American Medical Assn. endorsed hypnosis as viable 
medical treatment; nevertheless it was received with widespread skepticism 
until the late 1970s and 1980s when it gained respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypnosis induces an altered state of consciousness which is achieved when a 
person is in a relaxed state," says Aten, a licensed, certified and registered 
hypnotherapist who makes house calls because many of her clients are busy 
executives. "Clients told me that they found it easier to relax in their own 
environment, and they liked being catered to, so it made sense to accommodate 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Aten is convinced that anyone can reprogram themselves through hypnosis. She 
regularly works with clients who want to increase motivation, self-discipline, 
self-esteem and prosperity, to undo negative behavioral patterns or to improve 
professional skills such as sales ability. "I recently worked with a top real 
estate salesman who had been in an eight-month slump and he needed some help to 
get back on top." 
</P>
<P>
Gail's boyfriend had given her an ultimatum: "Stop smoking or we're through." 
</P>
<P>
A smoker with a two-pack-a-day habit, she had tried to stop before, but always 
went back to the pack. She quit, but not by doing it "cold turkey," attending a 
stop-smoking clinic or taking medication. She visited Aten and stopped smoking 
after four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Did Gail stop smoking and Brooke stop dating wrong men because of hypnosis, or 
because they were motivated and would have made the change on their own? 
</P>
<P>
The desire to change is crucial to altering any negative behavior, Aten says, 
but hypnosis gives people "permission" to change. She says the mind is open to 
suggestion in a relaxed state. "The subconscious mind doesn't analyze, it 
simply takes in suggestions and plays them back, and, since very young children 
seldom question what they are told about themselves, it explains why they 
respond so strongly to early negative -- or positive -- programming." 
</P>
<P>
Years of negative programming can be reversed. "Any behavior that is learned 
can be unlearned. 
</P>
<P>
"Some bad habits and behaviors are self-programmed, as with smoking or 
overeating. Other mind-sets such as low self-esteem, fear syndromes or 
excessive shyness, are programmed into us by other people, usually during 
childhood and perpetuated by ourselves through life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A typical session begins at the client's home or office where all phones and 
other distractions are put on hold for the one-hour session. The client sits in 
a recliner or lies on a couch and listens through the headset as Aten's message 
is transmitted through a microphone while being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"This method shuts out extraneous noise and promotes greater relaxation, 
increasing receptivity," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Step one is the induction phase, or "lullaby." 
</P>
<P>
"They listen to a 10-minute tape of progressive relaxation suggestions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When this is accomplished, therapy begins. 
</P>
<P>
"I speak through the microphone to the client, and, because the message is 
taped, they are able to listen to the tape over and over again when they are 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have witnessed stage or theatrical hypnosis are afraid that they 
will do something against their will," says the hypnotist who reassures clients 
that losing mind control is impossible. What kind of suggestions does the 
individual hear? "Let's take self-esteem. I reinforce their infinite value, 
telling them that they deserve the very best, and I direct their subconscious 
to change their behavior in a way that will create the desired reality." 
</P>
<P>
Hypnotherapy is boosted by the client's repetitious use of the recorded audio 
cassette, Aten says. "They continue to listen to the tape once we've finished 
all the sessions. This enables them to become their own therapist. It takes the 
average mind 21 days to respond behaviorally to these suggestions and affect a 
change," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
The hypnotherapist promotes short-term therapy and says that most clients -- 
those who want to stop smoking or score high on a test, for example -- require 
only four sessions at a cost of about $225, but admits that more stubborn 
problems such as compulsive overeating or lack of self-esteem frequently 
require extra sessions.

HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
2 FEMALE KUNG FU PUPILS ARE KICKING A FEW STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARNEY CHEEK, Marney Cheek is a senior at Sunny Hills High School, where she 
is co-managing editor of the Accolade, the student newspaper, a member of the 
Junior Statesmen of America and an International Baccalaureate diploma 
candidate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With steady black eyes to match the color of her belt, Becky Sun bows to her 
grand master. Her arms move across her body, and she begins her kicks -- 500 of 
them. The petite Sun moves with precision and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
A seriousness pervades the atmosphere of the martial arts studio, and there is 
a certain grace that Sun has mastered in her six years of kung fu. 
</P>
<P>
Sun enjoys the rigorous demands of studying kung fu, an ancient Chinese art 
form usually associated with men, and she has achieved first-degree black-belt 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see many girls doing it," said Sun, a senior at Sunny Hills High 
School in Fullerton, "but I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Sun was introduced to kung fu at her Saturday Chinese school in Cerritos, where 
she had to pick an ethnic activity as an elective class. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with Chinese folk dance," Sun said, "but it didn't really interest 
me. Kung fu is more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"Karate concentrates on punching and kicking techniques. Kung fu, which is the 
main Chinese martial art, is supposedly one of the most violent styles today," 
said Sun, explaining the difference between the two. 
</P>
<P>
"Kung fu consists of kicking, punching, striking, grappling, wrestling and 
throwing techniques. In kung fu, there is a preference for clawing and stabbing 
hand blows. These come from adapting animal movements to the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Kung fu sparked the interest not only of Sun, but also that of her friend, 
Sunny Hills junior Sandra Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to do, so I started kung fu for fun," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of lessons at the Chinese school, Sun and Lee began to study 
at a studio in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I would practice four times a week," Sun said. "Both 
Sandra and I were enthusiastic about going higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had this little dream that we would open our own studio by the time 
we were 16." 
</P>
<P>
Though they have yet to open a studio, the two do teach kung fu to youngsters 
at the Fullerton Chinese School at Sunny Hills High every Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to teach the lower belts," said Sun, who teaches 5- to 
8-year-olds. "It gives you a sense of seniority." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, on the other hand, finds it a challenge. "I teach mostly boys from 10 
years old to teens my age, and they can be very rowdy." 
</P>
<P>
Of her disciplinary method, Lee said: "I have the boys do push-ups until I tell 
them to stop. I guess I take on a different personality when I teach." 
</P>
<P>
Sun also used to spend some of her time helping the lower belts in her class at 
the studio but found that it left little time for her own practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting dull," she said. "I wasn't getting as much out of it, and I got 
lazy." 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Sun now participate in a class designed for black belts only. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really beneficial to practice with the higher-division black belts," Sun 
said. "Working with the black belts makes such a difference because I'm 
learning more." 
</P>
<P>
A typical class consists of 15 minutes of stretches and kicks, five minutes of 
punches, 20 to 30 minutes of forms and the rest of the time "sparring" against 
an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Achievements in kung fu are far from easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be really intimidating," Sun said. "You have to totally improve, and 
then the grand master has to tell you when to test for the next belt. Testing 
for belts is scary. I wouldn't want to do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
And Sun is lucky because she and Lee have been supportive of each other from 
the beginning. "You don't get as nervous when you have a friend," Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing is more than just an honor and a risk; it is also a financial 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to $55 a month for belonging to the studio and lessons, it costs 
$100 to test for a black belt," Sun said, "and you can only be invited to test 
twice a year." 
</P>
<P>
In kung fu, one begins with a white belt, then advances to yellow, orange, 
blue, green, brown, red and finally black belts, Sun said of the skill levels. 
Then there are nine degrees of black belt before one is considered a grand 
master. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a girl with a black belt is rare," Lee said. "It is an achievement and 
an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
"Not a lot of girls get involved with kung fu," Sun said. "There are usually 
three or four girls in a class of 15, but I think more girls are getting 
involved in martial arts because of the self-defense and influence of seeing 
other girls participate." 
</P>
<P>
Sun's parents have also supported her kung fu experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They've accepted it," said Sun with a flip of her curly black hair. "They know 
I'm a black belt, and I think they're proud." 
</P>
<P>
Her skills have allowed Lee a little more freedom. "My parents trust me more if 
I go out at night because they know I can take care of myself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all her practice, Sun has never seriously used kung fu in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
"One time, a friend came up and grabbed me, and I used a technique on him by 
instinct," she said. "I was real surprised at myself, and so was he. It is 
comforting to know you have it if you need it." 
</P>
<P>
Sun used to practice on her younger brother, "but he kept saying I was hurting 
him," she said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
And what of breaking wooden slabs with their bare hands? 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooo . . . it feels good!" Sun said. "You just find the center and . . . 
wham!" 
</P>
<P>
Although they don't go around breaking down doors or splitting tables, the 
girls do chop wood as well as demonstrate their kung fu form in public 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done performances at the Chinese school, at dinner exhibitions and at 
Disneyland," Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
And there are different types of competitions, each involving the display of 
particular techniques and forms corresponding to particular ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to compete, but our teacher doesn't believe in it," Lee said. "He feels 
kung fu is more for yourself. It isn't something to show off." 
</P>
<P>
Sun said her performing, as well as her teaching, has helped her beyond simply 
polishing her art: "I think it's helped me grow. I used to be timid and shy, 
and now I'm more confident and open." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of all that kung fu has provided Lee and Sun, the two are finding it 
more difficult to make time for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, I'm lucky if I can go more than once a week," Sun said. "It's been 
hard to go because of school work and other activities." 
</P>
<P>
Both girls are enrolled in honors classes and have other commitments: Lee is in 
dance production and Sun writes for the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Though there may be fewer of them, Sun said their practices are still intense. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so invigorating," she said. "I get this sudden burst of energy when I'm 
finished with a workout." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Sun nor Lee said she is finished studying kung fu. Both have eight 
degrees to go before becoming a grand master. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, Sun said she may begin studying tai chi chuan, a slower martial 
art for adults. "It helps you with your breathing and releases stress," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sun admitted that her pursuit of martial arts has little to do with her Asian 
culture. "I just hate quitting," she said, "and I'm not going to give up. 
</P>
<P>
"This sport and art not only provides a measure of self-defense and good 
physical exercise but also improves self-confidence, self-respect and better 
balance between physical and mental well-being." 
</P>
<P>
Kung fu can also weave a bond. "It's hard to have a friendship," Lee said, as 
she and Sun are in different grades, attend different classes and have 
different friends. "But kung fu keeps us together."

Channon Phipps acts like your "typical 15-year-old," in the words of his aunt 
and guardian. 
</P>
<P>
He is "always wanting something new, like new (audio) speakers," Deborah Phipps 
Franckewitz explained. "He's really into music. And he loves girls. Finding 
girlfriends has never been a problem for him. . . . He has tons of friends. 
People have been very understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Franckewitz said she is always very careful to inform the parents of Channon's 
friends about his condition. Like Ryan White, the Indiana youth whose death 
this week captured national attention, Channon is a hemophiliac who has been 
brushed by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Channon is presumed to have been exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
while receiving a blood medication for his hemophilia. Doctors say his blood 
carries antibodies of AIDS but is not yet infected with the incurable AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
Also like White, Channon was initially barred from public school when his 
infection became known. Then four years ago, as a courageous yet frightened 
11-year-old, Channon marched into an Orange County courtroom to fight for his 
right to return to class at an El Toro school. 
</P>
<P>
Channon eventually won the legal fight when an Orange County Superior Court 
judge ordered in February, 1986, that the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District admit him because he posed no health threat to his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting now to White's recent death, Channon said the Indianapolis teen-ager 
was always a tremendous inspiration to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He opened up the way so I could go to school," Channon said. "He made it 
easier for me to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Ryan," he said to his aunt, "my life would have been unbearable. If it 
wasn't for him I don't know if I could have gone on." 
</P>
<P>
White, who lost his battle with AIDS on Sunday, never met Channon. But the two 
shared a determination to live as ordinary a life as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hurt Channon when Ryan died," Franckewitz said. "He was crying and 
very upset. I think it's made him understand just how important it is for him 
to take his medication, especially the AZT." 
</P>
<P>
Although Channon won the right to go to school, he caught colds and flu so 
often from classmates that he has been staying home and receiving tutoring off 
and on since the fall of 1988. "Being around all the other kids made him sick," 
Franckewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Channon, who said he is healthy enough to "go swimming, biking, fishing and to 
the movies with friends," prefers not to risk becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worked out better for me," he said about staying out of school. "I'm much 
healthier than I was." 
</P>
<P>
There have been some anxious moments for Channon and his aunt. At one point 
last year, he fell very ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I recall once, when I was driving him to the doctor," his aunt said, "I 
started crying as I saw him lying in the back seat, wrapped in blankets and 
vomiting." 
</P>
<P>
As frightening as that period was, Franckewitz said, "we've always been 
positive. We tell him, 'You don't have AIDS. They will come up with a cure 
first. Since you don't have it right now, let's live our life to the fullest.' 
That's what has kept him going." 
</P>
<P>
What's the long-term prognosis? 
</P>
<P>
"They don't give us any guarantees," Franckewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Prendergast, former county health director of epidemiology and 
disease control, said that although Channon does not have acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, the "long-term prognosis for anyone with the AIDS 
antibodies can't be good, in the sense that there seems to be a slow but 
progressive effect of the virus damaging the immune system." 
</P>
<P>
Prendergast, who has examined Channon and was a consultant in his court case, 
noted that "the longer he goes without symptoms and the longer he stays well, 
the more certain we are that we will have new medication and treatments that 
can benefit him and alter the natural course of the infection. I think the 
long-term outlook for someone in Channon's condition is certainly better than 
it was just a couple of years ago."

<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE GROUP BEHIND THE COMPILATION OF STATISTICS HOPES SAN DIEGANS 
WILL USE THE INFORMATION TO FIGHT THE POLLUTION THAT MAY BE HIDDEN IN THEIR OWN 
BACK YARDS.

Millions of pounds of toxic chemicals and gases are used, stored and disposed 
of throughout San Diego county each year, some of them in crowded residential 
neighborhoods, according to a report released Thursday that urges communities 
to demand that their industrial neighbors help prevent pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition, states 
that 20 companies in the San Diego area generate 70% of the more than 214 
million pounds of hazardous waste made in the county each year. In addition, 
the report said, companies store more than 500 million pounds of toxic 
chemicals and more than 9 million cubic feet of toxic gases around the region, 
from Chula Vista and Oceanside to La Jolla and Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the report says, toxics are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"This report shatters any illusions that any of us might have had that toxics 
are somebody else's problem," Diane Takvorian, the coalition's executive 
director, said at a news conference in Barrio Logan, the San Diego neighborhood 
where the most hazardous waste is generated. "It is saying people have a right 
to know and a right to act." 
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Communities at Risk: Your Right to Know About Toxics in San 
Diego," is the first comprehensive compilation of local, state and federal 
statistics on hazardous materials. It is also the first-ever ranking of 
companies that generate and store toxics and of the communities where those 
companies reside. 
</P>
<P>
The information is intended, Takvorian said, to inspire San Diegans to find out 
about the often hidden dangers in their own back yards -- the toxic chlorine 
and arsine gases; the heavy metals, like lead, mercury and zinc; the 
carcinogens, like chromium and arsenic. Even if the companies deal responsibly 
with the materials, she said, the more toxics there are, the greater the chance 
that an accident could occur. 
</P>
<P>
Joy Williams, the primary author of the report, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a well-managed facility can have an accident," she said. "And, when 
they're located right on top of a community and there are workers involved, 
there's nothing to prevent them from being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The report documents 179 accidents involving hazardous chemicals that occurred 
between 1983 and 1989 -- a non-comprehensive sampling that Williams says is 
probably incomplete. Members of the public and workers were exposed to 
chemicals in 48 of those incidents, and in 31 others employees only were 
exposed, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to move these toxics away from people," Takvorian concluded, adding 
that, if companies are not able to reduce the volume and the toxicity of the 
materials they use, "they may need to move. We're not trying to put them out of 
business, but we want them to be good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Part of being a good corporate neighbor, the report said, is creating strong 
pollution prevention plans, reducing the use of hazardous chemicals by changing 
manufacturing processes or reformulating products and using good housekeeping 
measures to prevent the dissemination of toxics. In addition, the report calls 
for local industries to commit themselves to eliminate their discharge of 
toxics to the air, land and water by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top 20 waste generating companies, the report found four -- National 
Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., Rohr Industries, Southwest Marine and Pacific 
Steel -- generated more than the other 16 combined. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hallett, a vice president at Nassco, the top-ranked waste generator, said 
his company supports the coalition's goals. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a can of paint today, you can't just throw it in the trash. We in 
industry have to appreciate the same things," he said. "But to say that we 
handle the most (hazardous materials) doesn't mean that we are the most 
reckless or inappropriate in the manner we handle it. We have what we believe 
are very sound procedures to protect our employees, the community and the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Baliss, the district representative of the Iron Workers' Union who was in 
Barrio Logan Thursday to support the report, said that indeed, Nassco has 
developed tighter inventory controls to reduce the amount of paints and 
solvents stored at the shipyards and has developed good systems to protect its 
workers from exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Broening, a spokesman for Rohr Industries, the Chula Vista-based 
aerospace manufacturer, said his company has also made strides. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made great progress in the last few years," he said. "I don't 
think our feelings will be hurt at all by the report, because those are our 
objectives as well." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 communities where the most hazardous waste is generated, the report 
found three -- Barrio Logan, Chula Vista and National City -- have more waste 
than the other 12 combined. 
</P>
<P>
That came as no surprise to Al Ducheny, chairman of the Harborview Community 
Council, a group of Logan Heights/Barrio Logan residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has been a dump for many, many years," he said, adding that his 
group has actively opposed the expansion of Pacific Treatment Division, a 
hazardous waste handler in the area. "These industries are really incompatible 
with the community. They're too dangerous. We can't take chances with our 
families." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Riveroll, a member of the Mt. Hope-Helix Heights Residents Assn., said 
the most important thing about the report is that it will remind communities to 
get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"This report indeed will do its job by encouraging community members to stand 
up," she said. Not so long ago, she said, California Creative Dynamics, a 
metals-treatment firm near her home, was found to be dumping chemical wastes 
into a storm drain and allowing a caustic mist to waft off the property. 
</P>
<P>
The trees died on the street, Riveroll said, and some of her neighbors broke 
out in skin rashes. Some had respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes you just take that as a bad cold or allergy, not realizing that 
they could be caused by the industry right next to you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition has printed bulletins for the top 15 communities where hazardous 
waste is generated. Those brief reports are available for free for Barrio 
Logan, Chula Vista, National City, Downtown San Diego, Tierra Santa/Serra Mesa, 
Mira Mesa/Sorrento Valley, Linda Vista, Oceanside, Spring Valley, La 
Jolla/Pacific Beach, Santee, El Cajon, Escondido, Carlsbad and Southeast San 
Diego. A brief countywide report is also available for free and the complete 
report for the county is $10. 
</P>
<P>
The report was based primarily on data from the County Department of Health 
Services Hazardous Materials Management Division and from the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency. The county data base contains information that 
was compiled in 1987, 1988 and 1989 on 8,300 facilities. The EPA data was from 
1987 and 1988.

'MEALS FOR PEOPLE' IS REALIZING A DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A year ago, Richard Cholewa was lying in a hospital bed recuperating from 
quadruple-bypass open-heart surgery. As he recovered, he began to re-evaluate 
his life and wondered if, at 56, he had made any lasting contributions to 
society. 
</P>
<P>
It was during this time that the Orange resident decided to launch Meals for 
People, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supplying funds to soup kitchens 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that there was a reason why I was still here," said Cholewa, who 
suffered a heart attack just before the operation and a second one during 
surgery. "I feel just fantastic now and realize that the reason I'm still here 
is to help my fellow man." 
</P>
<P>
During its first three months, Meals for People has raised about $15,000 by 
collecting money in red, white and blue containers placed in about 1,500 stores 
throughout Orange County, including 19 Vons supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had tremendous cooperation from retailers, particularly the mom-and-pop 
type businesses," Cholewa said. 
</P>
<P>
The timing is right for organizations like Meals for People, which he said cuts 
through a lot of governmental red tape and gives money directly to soup 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
"Government funding for soup kitchens has not increased in five years and, in 
some cases, has decreased," Cholewa said. "As a result, the number of people 
who need assistance has doubled. That's why it's important for private 
organizations, like ours, to raise money and offset the decrease. Without 
groups like ours, soup kitchens would be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
John Lands, executive director of the Orange County Rescue Mission in Santa 
Ana, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The one commodity we're always short on is money, which we need to buy food," 
said Lands, whose soup kitchen serves about 300 people each day. "We don't get 
any government funding at all so we really appreciate Meals for People. We wish 
there were more groups like them." 
</P>
<P>
For Cholewa, getting Meals for People off the ground was the realization of a 
dream that originated in 1986. Back then, he attempted to start the 
organization, but legal problems prevented it from progressing. Until his 
illness, the plans remained in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always planned on trying to start it up again, but I'm not so sure I 
ever really would have if I hadn't gotten sick," Cholewa said. 
</P>
<P>
Grants given so far have ranged from $500 to $1,100. The Orange County kitchens 
that have received funds so far include: Someone Cares Soup Kitchen in Costa 
Mesa, Orange County Rescue Mission in Santa Ana and El Modena Soup Kitchen in 
Orange. Kitchens in Riverside and San Bernardino counties have also received 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Cholewa said distributing funds to Southern California soup kitchens is only 
the beginning. He would like to expand the organization's efforts across the 
state and, eventually, across the country. 
</P>
<P>

HERNANDEZ

Another company goes south: O'Connell Landscape Maintenance, in Santa Ana since 
1971, is moving to Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
More companies are following their employees into the relatively undeveloped 
southern portion of the county, where most of the new housing is being built. 
</P>
<P>
That trend has meant a boom for industrial parks south of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway too. 
</P>
<P>
The company bought a 1.3-acre site and will spend $1.3 million to build a 
12,600-square-foot building. In O'Connell's case, picking a new address in the 
big planned community was attractive because most of its customers are in South 
County. Still, development in South County has exceeded roads' capacities to 
handle the traffic. However, new roads are being planned or built.

PACT ENSURES SALE IN HUNGARY OF PARKER PRODUCTS 
</P>

Parker Automotive Corp. said Thursday said that it and TRW International have 
signed a distributorship agreement with a West German company that guarantees 
the sale of at least $2 million worth of Parker's products in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The pact names S&amp;B Enterprises of Reilengen, West Germany, as the exclusive 
distributor for Parker's CarbonClean products in Hungary. The distributor will 
market and service the products for five years, with the option to renew the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's product, a patented system, cleans harmful pollutants from auto fuel 
systems. The negotiations with Hungarian authorities started in November, 
continued in both Geneva and Budapest, and were concluded on March 23, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian authorities will pay Parker, through S&amp;B, in hard currency, 
said Michael E. Parker, the company's president and founder. He said that this 
is the company's first foray into the East European market. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this underscores the new (Hungarian) leadership's attachment to the 
importance of environmental issues," he said. "Through S&amp;B, we expect to be 
in a position to set up similar arrangements in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and 
Poland by year-end." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo Sipos, president of S&amp;B, said the Hungarian government has given the 
pact for the purchase of pollution control devices "priority status" for its 
scarce hard-currency allocation to buy imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line was I'm not interested in trading my goods for potatoes and 
Skoda," a car made in Czechoslovakia, Parker said. His comment refers to the 
recent pact between Pepsico Inc. and the Soviet Union to exchange American soft 
drinks for Russian vodka and ships.

Parker's association with TRW International, a subsidiary of Cleveland-based 
TRW Corp., began earlier this year when it signed a master distribution 
agreement with TRW. That pact gives TRW exclusive rights to import, store and 
export a line of CarbonClean products to their distributors throughout Europe, 
including the Eastern bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of this agreement, TRW will sell $20 million worth of 
CarbonClean products to its 500-strong European distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
TRW officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa-based Parker began operations in February, 1987, and became a public 
company in March last year with the sale of about 25% of the firm's stock. 
Parker and his family still own a majority of the company's stock.

O.C. MAN TEAMS UP WITH FRIEND TO BUY UPSCALE RESTAURANTS

A prominent Orange County businessman and a Southland restaurateur have bought 
a popular beachfront fish house in Los Angeles and an upscale barbecue 
restaurant in Beverly Hills from Restaurant Enterprises Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Former Balboa Bay Club President Richard S. Stevens has teamed with Robert J. 
Morris to buy the original Gladstone's 4 Fish and R.J.'s the Rib Joint, both 
originally founded by Morris, for $13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Morris sold the two restaurants to W.R. Grace Co. in 1983 for $6.5 million, 
which were then acquired by Restaurant Enterprises in a leveraged buyout. 
Morris continued to manage the restaurants despite the ownership changes. 
</P>
<P>
He built Gladstone's into a dinner restaurant that fed 1.1 million guests a 
year with gross receipts of $13 million, which Morris said makes it the top 
sales volume in California and eighth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The two Los Angeles area restaurants proved so popular that spinoffs of each 
were opened in Newport Beach. The Gladstone's and R.J.'s in Orange County were 
not part of the sale and will continue to operate under Restaurant Enterprises 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who grew up in Malibu, built the original Gladstone's in 1972 along 
Pacific Coast Highway. Its fresh fish menu and picturesque location gave the 
restaurant a distinctly California appeal that attracted locals and visitors 
alike. The restaurant features barrels of free peanuts for waiting customers 
and chocolate chips are served with after-dinner coffee. 
</P>
<P>
A Bel-Air resident who remains president of the Newport Club, Stevens described 
Gladstone's as "the eighth wonder of the world" and said the deal is the first 
of several restaurant ventures he is planning with Morris through their 
company, IHV Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said impetus for the sale came one day when his old friend Morris asked 
him, "Why don't you help me buy my company back?" He said that Gladstone's, on 
the beach at the foot of Sunset Boulevard near Pacific Palisades, is a high 
value restaurant that among other things, offers a large outdoor deck and is "a 
very healthy, safe place for a boy to meet girls." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens served for 22 years with Wrather Corp., rising to president of the 
hotels and real estate division with authority over the Disneyland Hotel in 
Anaheim and the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose attraction in Long Beach. He founded 
the Big I Boosters and the Chancellor's Club for UCI and is former president of 
the Newport Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Habermann, president of Restaurant Enterprises Group, said the sale of 
the two restaurants will allow his company to concentrate on its primary line 
of business, chain restaurants. The company operates such well-known restaurant 
chains as El Torito, Charley Brown's, Coco's and Carrows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll miss the cash flow, but we got a lot of money in our pocket" from the 
sale, he said.

A man shot and killed one of a group of young men who robbed him on a subway 
car, then he and the robber's companions all fled at the next subway station in 
the borough of Brooklyn, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery was committed late Thursday by three young men in their teens or 
early 20s who were among a group of about 18 traveling together, Transit 
Authority police spokesman Al O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against comparing the shooting to the 1984 case of Bernhard Goetz, 
the subway gunman who shot four teen-agers Goetz said were about to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said police believe the robbery victim, described as in his late 40s or 
early 50s, already had been robbed. "They had taken his wallet and gone through 
his pockets," he said. In addition, O'Leary said, "This group had a gun. They 
apparently were passing it around, examining it. We know we've got two guns 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
As in the Goetz case, the robbed man was white and the accosters were black, 
but police are not ascribing racial motives to the incident, O'Leary said.

Pope John Paul II donned a priest's simple black cassock and heard the 
confessions of 13 pilgrims in St. Peter's Basilica today in a Holy Week gesture 
he has practiced since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 pilgrims and tourists applauded from behind wooden barriers as 
the 69-year-old head of the world's 840 million Roman Catholics slipped into 
the world's largest church by a side door. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope donned the cassock over his white robes before starting to hear the 
confessions, which lasted a total of 70 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope has said he started the practice of hearing confessions each Good 
Friday in order to stress the importance of individual confession in an era 
when many Catholics, particularly in the United States, prefer to receive 
general indulgence of sins.

Foul play is not suspected at this time in the death of a 36-year-old woman 
whose body was found at the bottom of a back-yard swimming pool in El Toro 
Thursday night, the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard Olson said coroner's investigators have not found any suspicious 
circumstances so far in the death of Martha Munoz-Lemus of Santa Ana, a 
housekeeper at a home in the 25000 block Owens Lake Circle. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy is pending. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 p.m. Thursday, a neighbor spotted Munoz-Lemus in the pool behind the 
house and placed a 911 emergency call. Paramedics could not revive her and she 
was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Randi Newkirk, a 5-year-old girl who was found face down on the 
bottom of her grandparent's swimming pool in Fullerton on Wednesday, remains in 
critical condition at Childrens Hospital of Orange County in Orange. Her 
3-year-old sister, Robyn, who also was pulled from the pool, is reported in 
good condition and might be released to go home today.

One man was killed and six other people, including four children, were injured 
when a car ran a stop sign and hit another car broadside at an intersection 
near Palmdale, the California Highway Patrol reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said a 58-year-old Littlerock man died about 8:20 p.m. Thursday after 
the car he was driving northbound on 110th Street went through a stop sign at 
Palmdale Boulevard and crashed into the side of a westbound car carrying five 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the dead man was not released pending notification of his 
family. A passenger in his car, Michael Jackson, 35, of Littlerock, suffered 
major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In the other car, the driver, Steven Schroeder, 33, of Murrieta, Calif., also 
suffered major injuries. His passengers, Laura Schroeder, 31, Kimberly 
Schroeder, 1, Jamie Henderson, 10, and Kevin Henderson, 9, suffered minor to 
moderate injuries. All of the injured were treated at hospitals in the Antelope 
Valley, Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said it is unclear why the driver did not stop his car at the 
intersection. Alcohol did not appear to play a part in the accident, he said. 
Both Palmdale Boulevard and 110th Street are major thoroughfares in the area 
southeast of Palmdale, Siordia said.

BUSH INCLINED TO FORGIVE GERMANS FOR HOLOCAUST

President Bush said today that he was inclined to forgive the East Germans for 
their role in the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The East German legislature accepted responsibility Thursday for the Nazi 
atrocities during World War II and sought assurances of forgiveness from 
Israel, the Soviet Union and Jews around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he believed that the time has come to absolve Germany for the mass 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting in Bermuda 
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush was asked if the world 
should forgive Germany for the Holocaust, in which more than 6 million Jews 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one who believes in forgiveness," Bush said. "And this is a good day for 
forgiveness -- for those of us who have faith, most of the teachings have ample 
room for forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Good Friday, and noting the approach of Easter Sunday, Bush said 
the holiday was one that would be appropriate for forgiving the German state 
for the Nazi regime that sent Jews and other political dissidents to their 
deaths in gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time to take stock, and it's a time to be glad. So I'm inclined to 
think we ought to forgive -- not forget, necessarily, because I think you learn 
from history, learn what not to do wrong, how to conduct oneself." 
</P>
<P>
Bush started the Easter weekend by attending a sunrise Good Friday church 
service before leaving Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the service, Bush joked with reporters: "We prayed for you." 
</P>
<P>
He turned more solemn when asked about East Germany and the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"For our family, Easter is a very special time of year," Bush said. "I'm a 
Christian and I think that forgiveness is something that I feel very strongly 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said his feelings about forgiveness were a "personal observation. It's not 
a statement for our country." 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the East German Parliament said, "Nationalism and racial 
madness led to genocide, particularly of the Jews in all European countries, of 
the people of the Soviet Union, the Polish people and the Gypsy people. 
Parliament . . . admits joint responsibility on behalf of the people for the 
humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children."

A bomb exploded in a crowded city bus in New Delhi today, killing at least 10 
people and injuring 27, the United News of India news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but Muslim separatists in 
Kashmir claimed responsibility for three similar attacks this week. 
</P>
<P>
A senior police official said the bomb was so powerful that it ripped through 
the bus and badly damaged a jeep nearby. "It is the work of professionals," 
said the official. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a bomb exploded in a crowded train near Bombay, and 34 passengers 
were hurt. A Muslim militant group fighting for secession of the northern 
Kashmir valley claimed responsibility for that attack. The same group claimed 
responsibility for the bombings of two police stations in New Delhi on Tuesday. 
At least nine policemen were injured in Tuesday's blasts.

<P>
President Bush met today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, conferring 
about new pressures sparked by sweeping changes in Europe and helping the 
embattled British leader shore up her image at home. 
</P>
<P>
In more than six hours of talks at the storm-swept island resort, the two 
leaders sat down for their sixth meeting to discuss the rapid moves toward 
German reunification and the ramifications for continuing arms control 
negotiations and the future of superpower relations. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush, speaking to reporters en route to the conference, said 
he viewed "as positive" statements from Moscow predicting that a strategic 
nuclear arms reduction pact will be ready to approve by the time Bush meets 
next month with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"What (Gorbachev) said about instructing his people to go forward, I viewed 
that as a very positive statement, and we're sending the same signals to our 
negotiators," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the President said that despite Thatcher's plummeting popularity 
at home and her battles on a variety of domestic political fronts, he continued 
to appreciate her insight and he restated the importance of the U.S.-British 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very close together on our assessment on the changes that are taking 
place inside the Soviet Union. . . . She has a very clear view of the realities 
of the world," Bush said. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
described the first two hours of talks as "warm and productive." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush and Thatcher have "mutually supportive views" on a wide 
range of issues, including Eastern Europe, Gorbachev's confrontation with the 
breakaway republic of Lithuania and apparent attempts by Iraq to acquire parts 
for dangerous and powerful weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings were broken up by a good deal of pomp, circumstance and food. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Bush was greeted with military fanfare and a blustery wind 
and overcast skies. After a working lunch, he was to join Thatcher and a group 
of children in Bermuda's custom of marking Good Friday by flying colorful 
kites.

STOCK SPECIALIST FIRM FINED FOR SECURITIES FRAUD

A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was fined $480,350 for 
securities fraud by a judge who said he imposed the sentence as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"The trading while in possession of confidential material is a crime." U.S. 
District Judge Charles S. Haight said Thursday at the sentencing of Marcus 
Schloss &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes an affront to the fair operation of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be convicted of 
felony charges related to insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on inside 
information and of securities fraud in connection with its March 1986 purchase 
of stock in American Brands Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of $1 million -- $500,000 for 
each of two counts. 
</P>
<P>
Haight, however, said he considered only a fine of $500,000 because both 
charges stemmed from the American Brands deal. 
</P>
<P>
From that amount, the judge said he subtracted $19,650 which the company 
previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges 
stemming from the American Brands trade.

Higher crude oil prices and the introduction of a new consumption tax pushed 
Japan's wholesale prices for fiscal 1989 up 3.5%, the first hike in five years, 
the Bank of Japan said today. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices for fiscal 1989, which ended March 31, rose 3.5%, the first 
rise since 1984 when prices were up 2.8%, the Bank of Japan said. 
</P>
<P>
March wholesale prices climbed 3.9% over a year ago and 0.7% from February 
under pressure of the recent yen's weakness, the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price index for March was 90.4, compared with a base of 100 in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of export goods climbed 7.4% over a year ago while that for import goods 
posted a 14.0% hike. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of domestically produced goods were also up 2.5% over a year ago.

IACOCCA GOT $4 MILLION IN SALARY, STOCK, BONUSES, CHRYSLER SAYS

Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca was awarded nearly $4 million in 1989 
salary and stock and in bonuses earned the year before, the company's proxy 
statement said today. 
</P>
<P>
The amount Iacocca received topped the $2.5 million received by General Motors 
Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith, but fell behind the $6.6 million awarded to Ford 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Donald E. Petersen, who retired March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca was awarded $3.7 million in salary, bonuses and stock for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler executives received no cash bonuses for 1989 because of an agreement 
with the United Auto Workers union that when the auto maker doesn't make enough 
money in a year to grant profit-sharing checks to union members, executives get 
no cash bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's No. 3 auto maker reported 1989 earnings of $359 million, far below 
the $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion reported by GM and Ford, respectively. Last 
month, GM distributed profit-sharing checks of about $50 each to its eligible 
employees and Ford handed out checks of about $1,025 each. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW, which has called the GM and Ford executives' compensation levels for 
1989 a "disease," had no immediate comment on today's Chrysler proxy statement.

WHOLESALE PRICES OFF SCANT 0.2% IN MARCH;

ECONOMY: EXCLUDING VOLATILE FOOD AND ENERGY, OTHER SECTORS POST INCREASES IN

Falling gasoline and vegetable prices pushed wholesale prices down 0.2% in 
March, the first drop in seven months, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index followed no change 
in February and a huge 1.8% gain in January. 
</P>
<P>
A cold snap in December caused the January price spurt by killing Gulf Coast 
vegetable crops and producing a fuel oil shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices began their recovery in February and were joined by food prices 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, overall prices advanced at an annual rate of 6.7%, well 
above the 4.8% rise for all of last year. However, analysts expect wholesale 
inflation for 1990 will be a little below last year's rate. They anticipate 
continued declines for food and energy in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The March report was better than expected. Most economists had predicted a 
slight increase of 0.1% or 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices dropped 0.6% in March, the sharpest decline since June. Vegetables, 
particularly tomatoes, celery and cabbage, declined 25.5%, the biggest drop on 
record going back to 1967. However, that marked only a partial recovery from 
gains of 23.3% in February and 58% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also fell for beef and veal, dairy products and coffee. They rose for 
eggs, rice, pasta, pork, chickens, turkeys, fish, soft drinks and cooking oils. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices overall dropped 2.4% in March after a fall of 5% in February and 
an increase of 13.6% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline was down 2.8% and natural gas declined 2.5%. Fuel oil prices went up 
10.6% but they had fallen 30.2% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a moderate 0.3% in 
March after gains of 0.4% in February and 0.1% in January. Economists look to 
these so-called core prices as a better indication of underlying inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices for men and children fell, while the cost of women's clothing 
rose. Passenger car prices, in the face of weak auto sales, declined 0.3% in 
March after no change in February and a 0.7% fall in January. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the index for all finished goods, one stop short of 
retail, at 117.0 in March. That means a hypothetical selection of goods which 
cost $100 in 1982 cost $117 last month, up from $112.10 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also eased in 
March. Intermediate goods showed no change while crude goods fell 1.4%. An 
example of the three processing stages would be bread for finished goods, flour 
for intermediate and wheat for crude. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate inflation report should please the Federal Reserve Board which has 
been using relatively high interest rates to dampen demand and thus cool 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts cautioned against reading too much into recent months' numbers, 
which have been sent on a roller-coaster ride by the effect of the weather on 
food and energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers in the next few months could give us a false sense of euphoria 
just as the number in January gave us a false sense of gloom," said economist 
Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.

About 200 members of a stagehands' union local went on strike against CBS on 
Thursday after "last-ditch" contract talks ended in failure, a union 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by members of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical 
and Stage Employees is only against CBS' New York facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The network's Los Angeles studios have separate contracts with the union. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout, called after negotiations broke down Wednesday, is the first 
against CBS since about 300 Writers Guild members struck CBS News for seven 
weeks in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the union had been working without a contract since Dec. 31, said 
union spokeswoman Deborah Friedman. She said the strike also is against 
CBS-owned WCBS-TV here. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect that it's going to affect our day-to-day operations," said CBS 
spokeswoman Ann Morfogen.

'RED' AUTHOR'S NEXT BOOK WILL BE VERY GREEN 
</P>

By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writer Tom Clancy, whose best-selling thrillers have made him the author 
laureate of the defense community, reportedly has sold his next novel for more 
than $10 million, perhaps the most ever for a single book. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore-born author, reached at his home in Calvert County, Md., would 
not confirm the figure but referred to it alternately as "this absurd amount of 
money" and "really, really nice." 
</P>
<P>
His agent was less understated: "This is the deal of the century," said Robert 
Gottlieb of the William Morris agency. 
</P>
<P>
Recent published reports say that other houses have been wooing Clancy with 
offers of more than $10 million for the book, Clancy's sixth, leading insiders 
to speculate that Putnam-Berkley got him by agreeing to an amount in excess of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb hinted that the signing price was greater than other recent deals, 
such as the more than $30 million Stephen King reportedly received for his next 
four books and Jean Auel's rumored $25 million to $30 million for three books. 
</P>
<P>
With the big money, though, comes big expectations, Clancy said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to create a -- what is the figure they're saying -- $10-million 
book," Clancy said. "There is a certain degree of pressure that attaches 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
The book is due March 1, 1991, Clancy said. Putnam expects to have it on the 
shelves by that summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at the fiddling around stage," Clancy said. "I have my own way of working. 
I work into it gradually, then the last two, three months, I work frantically." 
</P>
<P>
The untitled book will continue the adventures of CIA operative Jack Ryan, 
doing "the usual, trying to keep the world safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly enough, Clancy published his first book, "The Hunt for Red 
October," a mere six years ago. And for a mere $5,000 paid by the tiny, 
Annapolis, Md.-based Naval Institute Press. 
</P>
<P>
That book, recently made into the current hit movie, is No. 1 on The New York 
Times paperback best-seller list. His most recent book, "Clear and Present 
Danger," was the top seller last year at 1.6 million copies.

TV'S 'WORKING GIRL' UNRUFFLED BY PART

Sandra Bullock could be taking a risk by starring in the television series 
"Working Girl," which premieres Monday night on NBC. After all, Melanie 
Griffith received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Tess McGill in the 
hit film of the same name. But Bullock seems as philosophical as any working 
girl about the possible pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, I knew as soon as I started in on this that I'd probably get some 
criticism because of people being judgmental about the movie," Bullock said in 
a telephone interview from Los Angeles. "People are going to have their 
opinions. But within half of the first show, they'll see it's an ensemble piece 
and they'll lighten up on me." 
</P>
<P>
Bullock has finished 13 episodes of "Working Girl," and she says she has gained 
a great deal of confidence as she has become comfortable in the role, sort of 
the way Tess McGill managed to go from secretary to junior executive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure (Melanie) had a lot of herself in the part. She's got one of 
those really soft demeanors," Bullock said of the inevitable comparison. "I'm a 
little harder on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Bullock got the role on short notice. The producers had looked at a lot of 
actresses when she got a call from her agent. Bullock happened to be in Los 
Angeles visiting her boyfriend and was about to return to her home in New York

Bullock went into "Working Girl" with a short but recognized list of credits.

An original manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was put back on 
public display today because tests determined the document has suffered no 
apparent damage from its years on exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency removed the document 
in August, 1989, to test it for decay and to evaluate the risk of theft. Gov. 
James R. Thompson protested the action and said the state would find a means to 
return the document to public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The historic manuscript is one of only five remaining original handwritten 
copies and has been valued at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation agency officials timed the re-display of the speech to coincide 
with special exhibits marking the 125th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination 
Saturday, Blanchette said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fine balance must be struck between the public's right to view that document 
and our duty to protect it for future generations," agency spokesman David 
Blanchette said.

Pennsylvania's honorary Highway Safety Month chairman is a man who routinely 
drives faster than 200 m.p.h. and has been in more than 100 car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
But when champion race car driver Richard Petty leaves the race track, he said, 
he obeys speed limits and drives smart. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-time Daytona 500 winner came to the Capitol on Thursday to endorse 
Pennsylvania's new highway safety campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody in the world who has wrecked more cars then me," Petty said. He 
added that he has "always been interested in the safety deal" and noted that he 
has six grandchildren to think about when speeding around the race track.

The words "lifelong resident of Vicksburg" mean a lot to Bessie W. Putman -- 
she reckons 111 years. 
</P>
<P>
Putman celebrated her birthday Wednesday at the Vicksburg Convalescent Home. An 
inscription in her family Bible shows that she was born in 1879 in a small 
house on the edge of Vicksburg. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of slaves, Putman said her mother and father died while she was a 
baby, and an aunt raised her and her brother. Born Bessie Wilson, she married 
Sam Putman in 1900 and had 12 children, most of whom have died.

A judge known as "Maximum Bob" is considering former PTL executive Richard 
Dortch's tearful plea to have his eight-year prison sentence reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch on Thursday asked U.S. District Judge Robert Potter to reduce his 
sentence because of his cooperation with the government in the trial of his 
former boss at the PTL television ministry, Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very sorry," Dortch, 58, told the judge. "Once again, I ask to be 
forgiven and for your mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Potter, known for his stiff sentences, said: "I'm cognizant of the fact that 
this is Rev. Dortch's last chance. I don't take it lightly, and I'm not going 
to rule on it today." He said it could be up to two weeks before he reports a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch was indicted in 1988 with Bakker on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
for soliciting $158 million from PTL supporters in exchange for free lodging at 
the ministry's Christian retreat near Charlotte.

Italian stadiums will be ready for the World Cup but several major public works 
projects will not be completed in time for the monthlong soccer competition 
starting June 8, the minister for urban affairs has reported. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to Parliament on Thursday, Carmelo Conte warned that work on 
several new roads, parking areas and subway lines will not meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The minister blamed red tape, fatal construction site accidents, lack of 
organization and even archeological findings for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
Conte also cited skyrocketing costs, noting that work on the Turin, Rome and 
Naples stadiums is costing from 86% to 126% more than the initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Modernization of Rome's Olympic stadium, which will host the Cup final on July 
8, will cost about $140 million, compared to an initial estimate of $66 
million.

A FAT CHANCE, SAYS SUMO TRADITION OF FEMALES INSIDE RING

<P>
A Japanese women's rights group is asking the question: Why are women excluded 
from the sumo ring? The answer they're getting: Because it's always been that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Saying sexism no longer has a place in Japan's national sport, the Women's 
Action Group has challenged the Japan Sumo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The group is not asking that women be able to wrestle sumo's giant grapplers, 
but it only wants to present a "Women Fans' Award" in ceremonies held in the 
ring for tournament winners, said member Michiyo Inobe. 
</P>
<P>
But even so much as stepping into the ring is strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why, it's just been that way since long, long ago," said an 
association official, who spoke on the condition he remain anonymous. "It's 
always been against the rules for women to get into the ring, simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Inobe said her group of 500 members, mostly women, decided against calling 
flatly for the rule's abolition because they were afraid public sentiment could 
go against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a kind of miniature of Japanese society in general, but many 
people in Japan accept sumo as a man's world, as a special society of its own," 
Inobe said. "In the end, though, I hope the rule will be abolished." 
</P>
<P>
The ban on women is believed to come from beliefs in Shinto, Japan's native 
religion, that treat women as impure. 
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, we are more pure than the dirt and straw ring," a statement 
from the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule became an issue last December when then Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi 
Moriyama informed the sumo association of her intent to present the Prime 
Minister's Cup to the winner of the New Year's Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama, a member of Parliament and the first woman ever to hold the important 
Cabinet post, said she would present the government award from within the ring, 
not from below. 
</P>
<P>
Sumo officials, however, refused to part with their males-only tradition, 
saying the sumo ring, a raised mound of clay about 15 feet across, is sacred. 
</P>
<P>
The association also pointed out that the award was generally presented to the 
winning wrestler not by the chief cabinet secretary but by a non-cabinet level 
vice minister. 
</P>
<P>
After a flurry of media coverage, Moriyama said she had made her point and 
dropped the request.

SWEDEN'S WALDEGAARD HOLDS KENYA RALLY LEAD

<P>
Bjorn Waldegaard of Sweden, driving a Toyota Celica GT4, held his lead after 
the second day of the Kenya Safari Rally today. 
</P>
<P>
Waldegaard was first on the ramp in downtown Nairobi after leading 25 cars in a 
387-mile race around Mount Kenya, Africa's second-highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical failures and atrocious road conditions knocked out 33 of the 58 cars 
that left Nairobi on Thursday on a 712-mile first sector loop in southeastern 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
Waldegaard collected two hours, 28 minutes and 11 seconds in penalty points, 
and had an average speed of 57.4 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Waldegaard took the lead at the midway point of the first sector after the 
engine of the Subaru Legacy driven by Markku Alen of Finland blew. 
</P>
<P>
Massimo Biasion of Italy, the world champion and the defending champion in this 
rally, was so close behind Waldegaard that he parked his Lancia mere inches 
behind the Toyota on the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Biasion had two hours, 34 minutes 17 seconds in penalty points and an average 
speed 57.1 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Biasion is seeking his third successive victory here for himself and the 
Lancia, while Waldegaard is after a fourth. He won in 1977, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian-made Lancia, also the world and Safari Rally champion, was under 
pressure from the Japanese-made Subarus and Toyotas. 
</P>
<P>
The four-wheel drive Toyotas and Subarus are making their debut in the Safari 
Rally, challenging the Lancia, winner in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the three-car Lancia team remained in the Top 10 spots, fending off three 
Toyotas, four Subarus, a Nissan 200 SX and a Mitsubishi Galant. 
</P>
<P>
The 386.8-mile second sector route takes the vehicles in a loop around the 
perpetually snow-covered Mt. Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
The route passes through slippery bends in banana, coffee and tea plantations 
and forests in one of the the East African nation's most heavily populated 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The 38th version of the Safari Rally is divided into six sectors, which in turn 
are split into 83 sections. Drivers are required to cover the sector in 
predetermined time and are awarded penalty points for every minute they are 
late. The seconds were accumulated in a special speed race Wednesday in a 
Nairobi suburb.

<P>
Redondo Beach Police Officer Leonard Knott was speeding to a call of an 
apparent suicide attempt. He quickly planned what route to take to the 
condominium on Francisca Avenue. He thought about how he would approach the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
When there was nothing left to think about, the 14-year police veteran felt the 
hair on his neck stand on end. He thought: "There is a strong possibility I 
might get hurt on this call. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never had that strong a feeling on a call before," Knott recalled this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow officers say that Knott's prescience has only been exceeded by his 
courage since that day last September, when he was shot in the face as he and 
fellow officers surprised a murder suspect in the middle of his getaway. 
</P>
<P>
Knott was one of 19 South Bay police officers honored Thursday in Torrance for 
bravery and outstanding service by the South Bay Police and Fire Medal of Valor 
Awards Committee. He and six other officers who "exemplified the finest 
standards of their profession" were presented with the Distinguished Service 
Award in ceremonies at the Torrance Marriott, and 12 others were awarded the 
Medal of Valor for bravery. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Knott's colleagues were among those who received commendations, for 
their outstanding conduct on the day of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
After seven months of painstaking recovery, Knott is prepared to return to work 
Monday. Many who saw the blood streaming from a wound below his lower lip on 
Sept. 19 of last year did not think he would even make it to county Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so sure he was dead, I didn't even say anything to him," said Officer 
Mark Rodina, one of Knott's best friends. "All this blood was coming out of his 
head. I didn't see any movement." 
</P>
<P>
Knott, 40, had switched to a squad car that day because rain-slick roads 
appeared to make it dangerous for his normal motorcycle patrol. It was about 
1:40 in the afternoon when he heard two other cars dispatched to the 
condominium, where a neighbor had reported shots fired. 
</P>
<P>
Knott decided his colleagues might need some backup. He joined three other 
officers at the condominium, where they heard a car running in the locked 
garage and suspected that the occupant might be committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The garage door would not open, so Officer David Tanemankicked down the front 
door and found a man just inside, dead of three gunshots to the head. Taneman 
and Rodina heard the car still running in the garage and rushed down an inside 
stairway, while Knott and Officer Roy Newton covered them. 
</P>
<P>
Taneman recalled this week that, as he pushed open the door to the garage, a 
man later identified as Roger Bollinger, 52, lowered a pistol and fired one 
shot. The bullet whistled just over Rodina's head, and the two officers 
responded with a volley of 18 shots, killing Bollinger. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger's shot traveled up the stairwell and hit Knott, who was standing at 
the top, throwing him out the front door and onto a landing in front of the 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet shattered his jaw, passed under his tongue, bounced off his spine 
and lodged -- bulging just beneath the skin -- at the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
As he spit up mouthfuls of blood, Knott said, he prayed and felt reassured that 
he would survive. He thought about his wife, Linda, and his three sons -- Mike, 
15, Matthew, 11, and Steven, just 5 months. "I all of a sudden just started 
grabbing on to a lot of things," Knott recalled this week. "Things that were 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
He also relied on many years of first-aid training. He moved his feet and hands 
and was relieved that he was not paralyzed. He asked Newton to pinch off the 
carotid artery, which carries blood to the head, but that did not seem to slow 
the bleeding. He lay on his side to keep his airway open. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Knott said, he tried to stay calm because "panic and shock kill a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
"It was real serious," said Sgt. John Skipper, who carried Knott off the porch. 
"But because of the way he handled it -- he was real cool about it -- I was 
convinced that he was going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center removed most of the bullet, although a 
few fragments remain near Knott's spine. 
</P>
<P>
His jaw was broken and had to be wired shut for six weeks. For three months, a 
metal "halo" brace was screwed into his skull to immobilize his neck. He drank 
plenty of milkshakes and used a note pad to communicate with visitors. Once the 
brace and wire were removed, he began slowly to recover strength and the 25 
pounds he had lost. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow officers lined up to donate blood, visited religiously and bought a VCR 
to keep their comrade entertained. 
</P>
<P>
Mentally, Knott said, he is ready to get back on his motorcycle and rejoin the 
department's SWAT team, on which he served before the shooting. But, he said, 
his stiff neck and occasional headaches tell him that a desk job might be more 
advisable for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Taneman and Rodina received the Medal of Valor for leading the police action 
that day and successfully stopping Bollinger, who police say had just killed 
his lifelong friend, Gary Taylor. Newton also won the Distinguished Service 
Award for providing cover and aiding Knott. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were presented for the 16th year by a committee of Chamber of 
Commerce and city officials from nine South Bay communities. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Redondo Beach officers -- Sgt. Mark Klempa and Officer Mike Clifton 
-- won the Medal of Valor for apprehending a suspected burglar last August. 
Clifton was grazed by a bullet but continued to fire his gun, along with 
Klempa, until the suspect surrendered. Clifton was treated for a scalp wound at 
South Bay Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Four Inglewood officers also won the Medal of Valor. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, Officers Ben Vargas and Thomas Baxter confronted reputed 
gang member Joseph Adams, who allegedly had just shot a man several times. The 
policemen killed Adams in a fierce gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
On March 27, 1989, Officers Steven Gentry and Edgar Johnson confronted a 
shooting suspect in an adult bookstore. Gentry was hit once during the ensuing 
shoot-out, and later lost his kidney during surgery, but he continued to fire 
and helped Johnson to capture the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry returned to full duty in January. The gunman is in prison for assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Three Hawthorne officers received Distinguished Service Awards and a sergeant 
from Gardena the Medal of Valor for preventing a disturbed man from taking his 
own life. Officers James Kerns, David Gregor and Patrick Lane and Sgt. Robert 
Michaelsen surrounded the man -- who alternately pointed the gun at himself and 
the officers -- and negotiated with him for two hours before he finally gave 
up. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was later charged with the murder of two women, whose bodies were 
found in his home. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne police officer John Austin also won the Medal of Valor for leading a 
man from a burning home. Smoke and flames were so intense that Austin was twice 
forced outside before he entered the building a third time and rescued the man. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Catherine (Cory) Brumbelow and Sgt. Walter Krumbach of the El Segundo 
Police Department also saved a life and were each awarded the Medal of Valor. 
</P>
<P>
They were pursuing a suspect who had sped off after being implicated in a 
barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-6, 240-pound suspect appeared to be drunk and belligerent after he 
crashed to a stop, the officers said. When the car burst into flames, the 
officers found that both doors were jammed shut, but Krumbach forced open one 
door, and Brumbelow helped drag the suspect to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Two Torrance police officers -- Ronald Ruby and Michael Browne -- won the 
Distinguished Service Award for preventing women, on separate occasions, from 
committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1989, Ruby responded to a call of a young woman sitting on the 
edge of the roof of the 14-story Golden West Towers. Ruby was able to sneak 
across the roof of the building without being detected and pull the woman off 
the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Browne was trying to talk a woman off the top of a five-story 
parking structure adjoining the CCH Computax building on Hawthorne Boulevard. 
When Brown was within a few feet of the woman, who was standing on a ledge just 
two inches wide, she said she could no longer hold on and would jump. 
</P>
<P>
Browne lunged, grabbed the woman in a bearhug and pulled her to safety.

Actors struggling to pay the rent between jobs often feel that they have taken 
a vow of poverty in order to pursue a show business career. 
</P>
<P>
Not Bob Lussier. 
</P>
<P>
He's ending his career as a successful Hollywood character actor in order to 
pursue a vow of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Lussier has turned his back on his lucrative career in feature films, 
television series and commercials to tackle his most challenging role: That of 
a Benedictine monk. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he emptied his rambling hilltop home overlooking the Hollywood 
sign and discarded souvenirs from 23 years of work. He gave away furniture to 
actor friends and packed up personal photos, videotapes and other mementos for 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for none of that in the 10-foot-square monastery room in which 
Lussier intends to live for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Lussier, 55, said he decided to join the Pecos Benedictine Monastery after 
visiting the Roman Catholic order's abbey in Pecos, N.M., two years ago. He had 
traveled to the 1930s mountain dude ranch near Santa Fe for a one-week retreat 
to meditate over his career, which, at the time, was one of considerable 
success. 
</P>
<P>
He had performed in 26 movies, scores of television series and more than 200 TV 
commercials -- including some of the most famous advertisements in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
His work ranged from dramatic roles in the films "Johnny Got His Gun" and "The 
Killing of Sister George" to comedy spots in such movies as "Mr. Mom" and "Pete 
and Tillie." 
</P>
<P>
One of his commercials, in which Lussier portrayed the driver of a Volkswagen 
loaded with three sweaty passengers, aired for more than 10 years for Dial 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
But while his face was familiar to millions, Lussier was troubled over the fare 
being produced in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was being called upon to do some pretty tacky stuff," he said. "The care 
that people used to take with their productions was missing. It all seemed to 
change the minute the non-artistic corporations started buying film companies." 
</P>
<P>
Lussier believes that gratuitous violence and sex were added to some movies to 
make certain the films paid off at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"There was five minutes of pornography in each one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lussier signed on as an apprentice monk, a novice, two years ago. Last fall he 
began four years of study at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, the Los Angeles 
archdiocese's training center for priests. Lussier plans to remain a monk 
within the Benedictine order, but his ordination will give him authorization to 
celebrate Mass and perform other sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that his new life was the ultimate curtain call, Lussier decided this 
month to sell his home in the Hollywood Hills and donate most of the $375,000 
profit to the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the profit will go to his family. 
</P>
<P>
The home's furnishings were earmarked for Lussier's actor friends. And on 
Thursday, he invited them to come by to take what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Mary Betten chose the kitchen table, where she and Lussier had often 
sat to discuss show business and rehearse their parts. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me cry to see him do this. It bothered me a lot, and it still does. 
The viewing audience will feel the loss," said Betten, a character actress who 
has worked in such films as "Lethal Weapon" and "Arthur on the Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought he'd last in the monastery. It's a damn miracle. But he'll be 
an excellent priest. He knows people. He knows the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Young, who performs regularly in such television shows as "McGyver," 
"Matlock" and "Quantum Leap," chose a glass lamp. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take something that he'll come by to visit when he's in town," Young 
said. "I'm going to miss not being able to call him up and invite him out to a 
movie or a drink." 
</P>
<P>
If Lussier's friends were surprised to learn he was becoming a monk, officials 
at the Pecos monastery say they were surprised to hear he had been an actor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very quiet and unassuming person. He kind of stays in the background," 
Sister Ann Cic, secretary to the 35-member monastery's abbot, said Thursday by 
telephone. "We don't watch a lot of TV here. We have a video on Sunday evenings 
for those who want. We've got some copies of the TV programs Bob had been in 
and watched them together. I'd say Bob Lussier is my favorite actor." 
</P>
<P>
Among the few mementos Lussier said he plans to save are printed photographic 
composites -- the picture layouts of themselves that actors use when looking 
for jobs. He plans to pass them out to the audience when he is ordained in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Brother Bob Lussier will say a prayer for Hollywood during the 
hours of praying that now make up much of his day. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask that they have a greater awareness of from where they've received all of 
their gifts," he said of the studio decision-makers. "Hopefully they can use 
those gifts in a way that will be respectable to God as they see him."
