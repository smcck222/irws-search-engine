BORDER DITCH WON'T HARM ENVIRONMENT, REPORT SAYS 
</P>

A federal environmental report Thursday strongly endorsed a planned ditch to 
thwart smuggling along a 4-mile stretch of the U. S.-Mexico border in San 
Diego, removing a potentially significant obstacle to the project and setting 
off a new round of protests against it. 
</P>
<P>
In its most detailed explanation of the plan to date, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service declared that the construction would not harm air, 
water, wildlife or vegetation in the Otay Mesa area. 
</P>
<P>
"All construction activity would be conducted to minimize destruction" of plant 
life as well as to minimize "degradation of air and water quality," the 
environmental impact assessment said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased that the environment will be safe for natural resources," said 
Arnoldo Torres, executive director of the League of United Latin American 
Citizens, "but the environment is not going to be made safe for human 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Expressed 
</P>
<P>
Torres predicted that the proposed ditch, 14 feet wide and 5 feet deep, would 
turn into a trap for children at play and ensnare automobiles attempting to 
cross illegally, dooming their occupants. "That's the history of the border," 
Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
But, the report stated, "the potential for human and wildlife drowning or 
entrapment is minimal." 
</P>
<P>
The INS proposed the controversial ditch -- known formally as the Border 
Security Enhancement Project -- in January as a way of combatting smugglers who 
drive across the border from Mexico carrying drugs and illegal immigrants, and 
as a means of solving drainage problems afflicting the area. 
</P>
<P>
Since the plan became known, the ditch has become a lightning rod of criticism 
from those who say it will likely fail to deter illegal immigration but will 
become a kind of Berlin Wall between north and south. 
</P>
<P>
"Symbolically, this is absolutely the wrong thing to do," said Jess D. Haro, 
chairman of the board of the Chicano Federation in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch would cut a swath through grassy flatlands on either side of the port 
of entry at Otay Mesa, an area that has been undergoing a transformation from 
an agricultural backwater to a booming center for international trade. 
</P>
<P>
The area is also an important path for undocumented border-crossers from 
neighboring Tijuana. The report said that U. S. border agents have counted "as 
many as 369 unauthorized vehicle entries" in the area in a single month. Many, 
the report said, "necessitated hot pursuits" that "resulted in accidents with 
multiple serious injuries to undocumented aliens and at least one accidental 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics had thought that the environmental impact assessment, conducted by 
INS in consultation with other federal agencies, would give the government a 
graceful way to abandon the project in the face of opposition, but the document 
expresses no significant objections to the ditch on environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Making a case for the ditch, the 28-page report said it "will curtail 
increasing unauthorized vehicle entries and increasing violence" at the border. 
"To take no action would aggravate the unauthorized vehicle crossings in the 
area" and leave drainage problems intact, the study asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating an outpouring of protests, however, the INS also plans to 
advertise the impact assessment in West Coast newspapers this weekend, advising 
the public on how to comment on the project during a 30-day period. 
</P>
<P>
INS will evaluate the comments and "make an assessment on how to go forward" 
with construction. INS officials do not envision any comments that could 
persuade them to halt the project, although some opponents have threatened to 
protest at the construction site and to file suit against the project. 
</P>
<P>
An INS spokesman said construction could start this spring. Officials have said 
that they expect the project to be completed by late summer. The International 
Boundary and Water Commission, a Texas-based agency composed of U. S. and 
Mexican representatives entrusted with resolving certain border issues, is 
scheduled to construct the ditch at a cost of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of area legislators have called for a public hearing in San 
Diego on the matter, it remains unclear whether federal officials intend to 
hold one. Such hearings are common for a range of development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Several immigrant-rights advocates assailed the plan Thursday, as did the 
Mexican government, which already has filed a formal protest to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's preposterous; it's ludicrous to think a ditch will stop people," said 
Mario Moreno, associate counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. "If the INS thinks the ditch will have a marked effect on the 
number of people coming across the border, it has another thought coming. 
People have endured more dangerous conditions than that to get to the border." 
</P>
<P>
Moreno and others characterized the ditch as a symbol of oppression and called 
on U. S. officials to work with governments in Mexico and Central America to 
help remove the causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and war. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mexican Embassy here, Press Secretary Enrique Berruga called the ditch 
"a bad symbol" to the people of Mexico, who, he said, have nicknamed it "the 
Berlin ditch." 
</P>
<P>
A drainage ditch to dispose of rainwater was what Mexico had expected, Berruga 
asserted, not "a triple-purpose project" to stop drugs, illegal immigrants and 
poor drainage. In February, his government made that point in a communique, 
saying that "in the spirit of cooperation and friendship that characterizes the 
relations between the two nations that option (the ditch) must be discarded." 
</P>
<P>
Before that protest, INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson had said: "We obviously 
don't ask Mexico's permission to build a ditch on our side to stop vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Berruga acknowledged that there is no legal restriction against 
construction of the ditch, which would begin 4 feet inside U. S. territory. 
"The United States can pave all of California if it wants," he said, "but it is 
a little puzzling because it is not something that was agreed upon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that only the swath of ditch to the east of the port of 
entry at Otay Mesa, about one-quarter of the total 4.1-mile length, would 
provide drainage assistance, channeling water to a natural drainage course that 
flows south into Mexico. The larger, 3-mile strip of ditch to be scooped out to 
the west of the port of entry at Otay Mesa will serve "mainly" as a vehicle 
barrier, the document stated, as that part of the channel will not lead to a 
natural drainage flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Options 
</P>
<P>
In its assessment, INS said it had considered several options before settling 
on the 4-mile, earthen ditch. 
</P>
<P>
The agency rejected partly concrete versions, as well as the installation of 
concrete "Jersey barriers" like those that divide highways. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred ditch -- trapezoidal, 14 feet wide at the top and 4 feet wide at 
the bottom -- would be scooped out of an area designated as "disturbed 
grassland" because of traffic and development, the report said. The area is 
home to assorted flora and fauna, including Russian thistle, yellow sweet 
clover, wild mustard, side-blotched lizards, gopher snakes, Western 
meadowlarks, red-winged blackbirds and black tailed jack rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
"Impacts to wildlife in the proposed project area are not expected to be 
significant," said the report. "Animals should quickly reinvade the area 
following construction."

NEWSMAKERS: WALESA HAS A STRIKING THOUGHT 
</P>

Lech Walesa, whose Solidarity trade union helped force the Polish government to 
adopt sweeping democratic reforms, said he is considering running for the newly 
created office of president of Poland. "I'm being strongly pressed. Different 
people are pressing me and I am thinking about being a candidate to the highest 
(post) that is going to be in Poland," Walesa said at a news conference in his 
home city of Gdansk. However, he ruled out running for the newly created 
100-member Senate, which will be the East Bloc's first freely elected 
legislative chamber, or the existing 460-member Sejm, where the opposition can 
run for 35% of the seats. The two bodies meet later this year to elect a new 
president, and the post is expected to go to Communist Party First Secretary 
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski due to the majority still guaranteed to the Community 
Party and its allies in the larger Sejm. If that happens, Walesa said he will 
probably run in the next presidential election six years from now. "I am a man 
of big interests," said Walesa, an electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize 
for founding the East Bloc's first independent trade union during a 1980 strike 
at the Gdansk shipyard. The opposition and communist authorities reached a 
historic agreement April 5 to restore the union's legal status and allow 
independent candidates to run for parliament in June.

 -- A feisty German shepherd proved conclusively to his young master that a dog 
is a boy's best friend. The pooch, aptly named Buddy, saved 5-year-old Brandon 
Rodriguez from a vicious pit bulldog that attacked him as the boy played in the 
front yard of his Fresno home. The pit bull bit Brandon's leg, and Brandon ran 
to the house with the dog hanging on. When he opened the door, Buddy rushed out 
and forced the pit bull away from Brandon. As the two dogs fought, Brandon's 
brother, Jerry Myers, 19, killed the pit bull with two shotgun blasts. Brandon 
was treated at a hospital for three puncture wounds, and Buddy was treated for 
bites to two paws and minor injuries from two shotgun pellets. Buddy's reward, 
in addition to Brandon's everlasting devotion: a steak breakfast.

 -- A 5-year-old Mt. Healthy, Ohio, girl who fell an estimated 25 feet from a 
Ferris wheel when it stopped abruptly was saved from serious injury or death 
when she fell into her father's arms. The ride operator had just unfastened the 
safety bar across the laps of Rachel McAdams and her sister Margot, 6, when the 
Ferris wheel inexplicably started up. When it abruptly stopped, Rachel lost her 
balance and fell. She glanced off another of the cars and then her father, 
Mack, caught her for an instant before she hit the ground. She suffered head 
bruises and a broken tooth. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

JUDGE SETS BACK ACLU'S PUSH FOR PROP. F POLICE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge dealt the ACLU a setback Thursday in its effort to force 
the city to implement a police review board with investigative powers. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Kevin M. Midlam issued a narrow ruling against the 
American Civil Liberties Union, which is trying to get one of two ballot 
measures on police review panels put into effect. Both measures were passed by 
voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge expressed concern that voters were confused by the competing 
ballot measures. One of the measures called for a review panel with 
investigative powers, the other for a panel without the powers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Method of Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Midlam ruled that state law requires, in matters involving changes in city 
charters such as the creation of the review board, that the legal challenge be 
brought by the state attorney general or with his approval. The ACLU had argued 
that such action is not necessary in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the route we've taken with the court is the proper one," said Betty 
Wheeler, legal director for the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties, after 
the decision. "We do not believe this is a case that requires the attorney 
general." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said the group is undecided about its next step. But she said that, 
rather than turn to the attorney general, it is more likely that the 
organization will appeal Midlam's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is a blow to the ACLU's attempt to force the city to implement 
Proposition F, which would set up a police review board with the power to 
subpoena officers to testify in closed hearings about allegations of 
misconduct. A competing measure, City Council-sponsored Proposition G, sets up 
a review panel that has no subpoena or other investigative powers. 
</P>
<P>
Both ballot proposals received majority "yes" votes in November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Killer Clause' 
</P>
<P>
Proposition F passed by a 179,102 to 155,341 vote, and Proposition G passed 
179,917 to 160,166. But the city attorney ruled that, because Proposition G 
received more "yes" votes and contained a "killer clause" calling for its 
implementation should both measures pass, its board was the one that should be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
Midlam ruled only on the narrow issue of whether the suit had to be brought by 
the attorney general or with his approval. He said he could not rule on the 
question of which or how many boards should be created unless the case is 
brought with the participation or approval of the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
But, in comments accompanying his ruling, he indicated that he is frustrated by 
the confusion voters faced in choos 
</P>
<P>
ing between the two propositions. Midlam rejected Wheeler's contention that the 
panels could exist simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
He called the proposals poorly drafted legislation, but said that to create a 
second panel would "add insult to injury." 
</P>
<P>
Midlam said that, although the wording of Proposition G appeared to mean that 
its passage took precedence over Proposition F, nothing in the ballot arguments 
that accompanied the propositions made that point clear to voters. He suggested 
that setting aside the results and holding another election might be one way to 
settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Eastus, general manager of the San Diego Police Officers Assn., said his 
organization welcomed the ruling, but he expects the legal challenges to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It is only Round 1, so to speak," said Eastus, whose group has joined the city 
in its defense of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit has not stopped the city from trying to implement the weaker board 
required by Proposition G. The city manager's office has narrowed a group of 
about 75 to 100 board applicants to fewer than 25 finalists, said George Penn, 
an assistant to the city manager. Penn said board members could be appointed 
next week and the panel could hold its first meeting in June.

BROAD COALITION FORGED TO FIGHT UTILITY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON and LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a highly unusual show of cooperation, a wide array of business, labor, 
government, environmental and consumer representatives Thursday announced the 
formation of a coalition to begin a "siege" of Southern California Edison that 
is designed to stop a proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co The 
newly formed Coalition for Local Control hopes to raise $200,000 to stage a 
two-year fight against the proposed merger, according to Great American First 
Savings Bank Chairman Gordon Luce, the coalition's chairman. San Diego's 
business community so far has pledged more than $30,000 to combat the proposed 
merger, which Luce described as "one of the most significant economic events of 
this century" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition includes several well-known business and government leaders, the 
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, the Utility Consumers Action Network, 
the Sierra Club's San Diego chapter, the San Diego Economic Development Corp. 
and Local 465 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Bedroom Community' 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego would become the only one of the top 10 cities in America serviced 
by a utility headquartered outside of the city," Luce said during a 
Thursday-morning press conference. "Our energy future is critical to our 
economic destiny. . . . We are not a bedroom community to be left at the mercy 
of a company whose first loyalty is to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger "means a significant loss of jobs, deterioration of our air 
quality, higher energy rates and the 'Los Angelesization' of our utility 
company," said Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce President Lee Grissom. 
</P>
<P>
Luce predicted that private sector participation -- and donations -- will grow 
as the business community learns "that rates for businesses, commercial 
enterprises, (and) industrial plants . . . will be going up if Edison is in 
charge of our utility," Luce said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides organizations, the coalition has attracted support from more than 70 
"private sector" members. The initial list unveiled on Thursday resembles a 
"Who's Who" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes San Diego State University President Thomas Day; General 
Atomics owner J. Neal Blue; Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Chairman Kim 
Fletcher; Dr. Fred Frye; businessman George Gildred; Chamber of Commerce 
Chairwoman Gail Stoorza Gill; developer Tawfiq Khoury, and builders Warner 
</P>
<P>
Lusardi and Mike Madigan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coalition Lacks Money 
</P>
<P>
Luce readily acknowledged that the coalition lacks the money to match the 
cash-rich utilities. For example, while the coalition hopes to raise $200,000, 
SDG&amp;E recently spent nearly $400,000 to produce and mail 
anti-government-takeover brochures to its residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people resources but we do not have the money resources," Luce 
acknowledged. "We'd like to do that kind of mailing, but we can't do it as 
broadly or as expensively . . . it's just not in the cards, and I don't think 
we should fool ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Grissom downplayed the significance of the utilities' cash reserves, arguing 
that the advertising campaigns run so far by SDG&amp;E and Edison "are an abuse 
of money . . . if we had the same amount of money to spend as SDG&amp;E (and 
Edison) I don't think I would spend it that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credibility at Issue 
</P>
<P>
Luce and Grissom also claimed that utility executives at both companies have 
lost their credibility among San Diegans, particularly on the sensitive subject 
of how many San Diegans would lose jobs because of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't quote the source, but one person said to me in a high executive office 
of (SDG&amp;E) that it could be a thousand or 2,000 jobs," Luce said. "That 
worries me." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for SDG&amp;E and Edison on Thursday repeated their previous 
statements that only 1,000 jobs would be lost at the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
Grissom and other coalition members complained that Edison and SDG&amp;E are 
conducting a "disinformation" campaign that is designed to take the proposed 
merger out of the media spotlight and refocus attention on a possible 
government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merger Targeted 
</P>
<P>
At present, there is little reason for discussion of a municipal takeover, 
according to coalition member Michael Shames, who serves as executive director 
of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "If the 
merger was defeated, then municipalization isn't really an issue," Shames said 
Thursday. "I think all (coalition members) agree that we have to beat the 
merger." 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed coalition opposes a merger of SDG&amp;E and Edison, but it has 
stopped short of embracing a government takeover, according to Luce. "We favor 
a privately owned, locally controlled utility," Luce said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which is housed in the Chamber of Commerce's office building, 
expects to hire an executive director within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Speaks Out 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Mayor Maureen O'Connor Thursday urged community 
leaders to aid the newly formed Coalition for Local Control with "money" and 
"talent." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, declaring that "the proposed Edison takeover of SDG&amp;E represents 
the single greatest threat to San Diego's autonomy in the 17 years that I have 
been in public life," asserted that the two utilities will spend $25 million 
between them "to force this takeover on us." 
</P>
<P>
"Collectively, this group can fight the bully boys," O'Connor told a Rotary 
Club of San Diego luncheon at the Sheraton Grand Hotel. "You can make your 
voices heard" by contacting congressmen, state legislators, the state Public 
Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, she added. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor spoke of her "fear of monopolization" and the evils it would bring to 
San Diego. "The new Los Angeles-area company would not just gobble up one more 
corporate headquarters from our city, but in so doing would become the largest 
utility in the country, a utility without competition, a monster utility, a 
monopoly!," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor hinted that the new utility, unfettered by competition, would be 
unaccountable to its customers, particularly after current Chief Executive 
Officer Howard Allen is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"What saint, as CEO of Edison, would not use an earthquake, a flood, a drought, 
a strike or an oil spill as an excuse to raise rates beyond honest levels?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps responded that "it is unfortunate that Mayor 
O'Connor has so little understanding of the regulatory process that she does 
not recognize that Edison's rates are regulated today by the Public Utilities 
Commission and they will continue to be fully regulated after the merger."

Everyone's a bit nervous about gunfire in Los Angeles these days. Hence, the 
bulletin from a Los Angeles Police Department dispatcher informing all units 
that the Police Academy's outdoor pistol range in Elysian Park would be closed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fusillades might have proven distracting to fans at the afternoon season 
opener in nearby Dodger Stadium -- especially during the long, quiet periods of 
inaction in the low-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
Some drivers conduct business via a car phone or car fax machine. Others are 
more old-fashioned. A motorist in a small pickup, stalled in Dodger traffic on 
Sunset Boulevard, spotted a ticket scalper on foot. Wishing to peruse the goods 
for a few moments, the driver beckoned for the scalper to jump into the bed of 
the truck. After they had inched forward about half a block, the driver 
signaled that he would take the tickets. He handed the money out the window to 
the salesman, who happily bounded back onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
It's a different kind of lottery. 
</P>
<P>
When fourteen abused pets are put up for adoption at noon today, potential 
owners will pick numbers -- from the proverbial hat -- to determine when 
they'll be allowed inside to view the animals. The lowest numbers get in first 
to bid on the creatures, including 12 dogs (six of them rare fawn-and-blue 
Doberman puppies), one kitten and one cockateel. (The bird's owner was jailed 
for making animal sacrifices.) 
</P>
<P>
The recovered pets will be on display at the Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals at 5026 W. Jefferson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual procedure of viewing them was adopted because 400 people showed up 
last year to claim 42 animals that had been taken from owners prosecuted for 
abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a personal statement," said Sgt. Cori Whetstone, an SPCA field 
supervisor, "like someone saying, 'I can't stop (animal abuse), but if I can 
take one into my home I have done something about it.' "

Drawings and a scale model of the futuristic structure, called "Clouds of

<P>
It's a bold move. No doubt the very idea of a freeway artwork will elicit 
special attention from such Los Angeles-baiters as columnist Herb Caen, the 
Bard of Baghdad-by-the-Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Caen, you may recall, paid tribute to Los Angeles' smoggy car culture by 
dubbing the city "Lozangeles" and once described its average inhabitant as "a 
well-preserved, middle-aged, middle-class, two-door Chevrolet." (That was 
before foreign cars became dominant.)

The modest number of votes drawn by Tom Bradley in Los Angeles' municipal 
election didn't escape the notice of neighboring Burbank's Johnny Carson. In 
his monologue the night after the election, Carson responded to the audience's 
applause with the quip: "I just got a bigger mandate than the mayor of Los 
Angeles." Noting that just 23% of the electorate voted, Carson added, "Chicago 
gets a bigger turnout from the dead."

Another reason to obey the law: Due to a reported absence of water pressure, 
the plumbing broke down on at least five floors of the Los Angeles County 
Criminal Courts Building on Thursday.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSMAN GUILTY IN MONEY LAUNDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A businessman has been convicted in federal court in Los Angeles of laundering 
$24 million through Santa Barbara-area banks for an organization prosecutors 
contended was run by a reputed Orange County drug kingpin. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk said he found Stefan von Metzger's 
explanation for the source of the money "poppycock" after the 65-year-old Santa 
Barbara businessman was found guilty on 36 counts. 
</P>
<P>
The defense had contended that the money in question came from a plastics 
manufacturing business owned by von Metzger's brother-in-law in Venezuela and 
brought into the United States legally to purchase supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such a bunch of baldfaced lies," Hauk said. "It's incredible. 
I feel sorry for Mr. von Metzger that he got mixed up in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for June 12. Von Metzger was allowed to remain free on 
$600,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon contended that von Metzger laundered money for 
an organization run by suspected drug kingpin Jose Miller, formerly of Mission 
Viejo and now a fugitive. Convicted cocaine trafficker Carlos Ortiz testified 
during the trial that he delivered boxes of money to von Metzger on three 
occasions.

REFUNDS FOR RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the letter from Jill Renton on raising the redemption value of 
bottles and cans (April 3): 
</P>
<P>
If the refunds were raised to 5 cents, rather than fearing more scavengers, an 
easy solution would be for residents to recycle bottles, cans, etc., and donate 
good reusable items to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Also, why not have a garage sale? Then trash would become just trash with 
nothing left to scavenge. 
</P>
<P>
Scavenging has always been a means of salvaging usable material from trash. 
</P>
<P>
In today's society with a shortage of landfills, a growing homeless population, 
and many people at the poverty level, scavenging provides a means of making 
money -- albeit a small amount. 
</P>
<P>
Either let the scavengers help themselves and the environment, or solve the 
noise problem by doing something positive.

A TIGHTER GUN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The carnage created by military-style assault weapons in city streets may yet 
shock California's state government into a rational regulation of firearms. One 
of the most welcome signs of this incipient sanity was the Assembly Public 
Safety Committee's recent unanimous approval of a measure, AB 497, that would 
help keep guns out of the hands of children, criminals and the deranged. 
</P>
<P>
That the endorsement of this self-evidently sensible goal by eight responsible 
adults can be termed historic is testimony to the effectiveness of the National 
Rifle Assn.'s well-financed campaign of vengeful bullying in the state capital. 
Were it not for the reign of terror the firearms fanatics traditionally have 
imposed on the Legislature, the ends pursued by AB 497's author, Assemblyman 
Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), would appear too reasonable to debate. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly's bill would amend the regulations already applied to concealable 
weapons, and extend them to all firearms. All sales of all guns, whether by a 
dealer or private party, would involve a 15-day wait between purchase and 
delivery. This brief interval would allow the state Department of Justice to 
determine that the prospective buyer is not a minor, a convicted felon or a 
person held to be mentally infirm under the law. The latter category would 
cover individuals who during the previous five years had been admitted to a 
mental health facility as a danger to self or others under the provisions of 
the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act. 
</P>
<P>
The necessity of this re-definition is demonstrated by the fact that out of the 
291,000 gun buyers whose backgrounds were checked by the state last year under 
the existing law, only 13 were found to be mentally infirm. 
</P>
<P>
The Connelly bill awaits a hearing by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. It 
deserves a quick trip through both legislative chambers and then on to Gov. 
George Deukmejian for signature.

L.A. SCHOOL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a question for the Los Angeles School Board and the Los Angeles teachers 
union: What is the priority in the school system? I used to think our kids were 
No. 1 . . . that their futures were of overall importance to everyone involved. 
That's not the picture I'm getting. 
</P>
<P>
My son is a fifth grader at Melvin Avenue School in Reseda. I am deeply 
disturbed by the fact that he might not get a graduation ceremony due to the 
strike, and that the grades he earned this year will mean nothing next year 
when it comes to placing him in junior high school because the administration 
will never see them. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the schooling time lost due to the strike itself? I don't think 
it is a matter of which side is right or wrong in this standoff between the 
board and the union. I care much too deeply about the education of my son to 
stand idly by and let him be hurt by someone else's argument. The teachers 
deserve better treatment than they have received; they're doing an 
extraordinarily important job. But their tactics only hurt the kids. It is time 
to end this bureaucratic tug-of-war and get on with the much more important job 
of educating our children!

CRACKDOWN IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrest of a man said to be Mexico's narcotics kingpin is one more 
indication that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is serious about 
eliminating corruption in the Mexican legal and political system. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who was arrested by Mexican federal agents this 
week in the Pacific Coast state of Sinaloa, is considered that nation's top 
trafficker in cocaine, heroin and marijuana, not just by Mexican officials but 
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. U.S. officials are so overjoyed at 
the seizure of a man they suspect ordered the brutal murder of DEA Agent 
Enrique Camarena in 1985 that a DEA spokesman called the arrest a "landmark" in 
the history of cooperation between Mexican and U.S. law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
But if Felix Gallardo is convicted of the myriad of charges filed against him, 
his downfall could be an even more important landmark for Mexico. For officials 
in Salinas' government have admitted that Felix Gallardo could not have been so 
successful in his illicit enterprises without protection from corrupt Mexican 
police, the first time high-level Mexican officials have publicly conceded the 
existence of police corruption. 
</P>
<P>
One indication of the scope of Felix Gallardo's influence is that six top 
Mexican lawmen were arrested in the wake of the suspected drug kingpin's 
detention and accused of providing him with weapons, radio equipment and 
information about drug investigations. Even more sobering is the fact that, 
when federal agents moved against Felix Gallardo, they used Mexican army troops 
to detain the entire police force in the city where he lived, Culiacan, until 
he was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
The pervasiveness of corruption linked to Felix Gallardo is breathtaking. Yet 
it jibes with the cynical feeling that many Mexicans have about their system -- 
that anyone with enough money and gall can have his way, no matter what the law 
says. One great challenge facing the new generation of young Mexican political 
leaders epitomized by Salinas is to find a way to restore the peoples' 
confidence in the nation's legal and political system. That is why the new 
president moved so forcefully in his first few months in office to arrest the 
man widely regarded as Mexico's most corrupt union leader, Joaquin Hernandez 
Gailicia, and to prosecute a leading businessman, Eduardo Lagoretta, for 
illegal activities on Mexico's stock market. Now, Salinas is out to prove that 
even the underworld is not beyond the reach of his reformist government. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, most Mexicans seem to approve of Salinas' actions and are 
impressed with their new president's resolve. Given the terrible effect illegal 
drugs have in this country and the fact that a third of the cocaine entering 
the United States is shipped through Mexico, people in this country should be 
pulling for Salinas to succeed, too.

L.A. SCHOOL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an occupational disorder among philosophers of education that they harp 
on one note in their criticisms/cures for their profession. The four notables 
in education who make the case for "choice" in The Times ("To Get Parents 
Involved, Put Choice Into L.A. Schools," Op-Ed Page, April 4) are no exception. 
For with "choice" comes the freedom of teachers to teach, the willingness of 
students to learn, etc. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there is truth in their contention. But education is an immense, 
varied and distressingly human activity. It operates on theory and is a fertile 
ground for further "theoryfication." He is a poor educator who does not have at 
least one pet theory. I have several. But I submit that the issue of student 
motivation is of a different order from questions of choice, magnet schools, 
class size, desegregation, etc. The differential between Asian-American and 
Mexican-American students in academic performance is consistent and striking, 
for instance. 
</P>
<P>
But I also submit that student motivation, like youthful drug addiction, is a 
direct reflection of the level of youthful hopelessness. It is another measure 
of national health, systematically related to the 51% turnout for the national 
election last Nov. 8, for this was the great quadrennial health-test: Only half 
of the eligible voters think the system works. 
</P>
<P>
If so, if the disaffection among school children is but a part of the national 
disaffection, then the problem is political and the indicated cure is 
political. We need to raise generations of children talking politics beginning 
with grade three. Sure, every child should be told that he or she can become 
President, but also told how terrible recent Presidents have been in the 
teacher's opinion. Never mind that this violates all the canons of what 
constitutes textbook "civics" for the kids. What we look for is a return to a 
healthy participation in government on the theory that if the parents are 
deeply concerned with government, education will awaken and take care of 
itself.

GETTING HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE LEFT-OUT MILLIONS; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS, NOT GOVERNMENT, SHOULD BE THE SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIE L. BROWN JR., Willie L. Brown Jr. is Speaker of the California 
Assembly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of America's oldest public-policy debates involves the question of how to 
provide access to health insurance. The debate on national health insurance has 
ebbed and flowed since President Harry Truman first proposed Medicare in 1948. 
In 1989 the issue is coming to flood tide again. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because 37 million Americans have no health insurance. They are eligible 
for neither Medicare nor Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California), and they 
have no private coverage. They go about their lives trying not to get sick, 
wondering what will happen to them if they do. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 37 million without insurance, 5.5 million live in California. Almost 3 
million of them have jobs, yet still have no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Something must be done for these people. Their circumstances are potentially 
disastrous, for there is no longer an adequate public "safety net" to care for 
them. County clinics and county hospitals are seriously overloaded and 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
To find reasonable solutions even for a part of this problem, we must examine 
the history of health insurance in America. Clearly, it always has been 
employment-based; health insurance is a benefit for 200 million Americans 
because family breadwinners have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds like good news. It is not. 
</P>
<P>
The number of those covered by health insurance is shrinking. Since 1984, the 
percentage of working Californians who have no health insurance through their 
jobs has risen from less than 15% to more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable to have an incomplete system that leaves people out, and 
steadily continues to leave more people out. The 60-year-old pact between 
business and government -- to provide health insurance in exchange for tax 
benefits -- must be reexamined to determine if it is still viable. 
</P>
<P>
There are two options: Restore the vitality of the employment-based system or 
abandon employment-based health insurance and replace it with government-based 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly prefer the first solution. To that end, I have introduced a bill in 
the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It will stimulate the employment-based system in California and re-start its 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what the bill does: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requires everyone who employs five or more persons more than half time to 
provide them health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requires only essential health benefits such as physician care, acute 
hospital care, laboratory and X-ray services, maternity care and limited mental 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The bill relies entirely on the private sector. It calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government cost. 
</P>
<P>
As is typical with important legislative endeavors, there are still problems to 
be worked out. The health-insurance market, especially for small businesses, 
has been so disrupted by high costs that coverage often is unobtainable. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry recognizes this, and is working to develop new 
underwriting rules for small employer pools that will improve both availability 
and affordability. When these are perfected, California law must provide 
protections that will make them work. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to contain health- care costs. Physicians and hospital 
managers acknowledge this and are prepared to accept further refinements of the 
changes made by the Legislature in 1982 that encourage competition among 
health-care providers. Those reforms have proved that competition works better 
than regulation to contain health-care inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The success of those reforms, confirmed by a RAND Corp./UCLA study in 1988, 
persuade me that a private solution is the better solution. It will be more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
It is simply a fact that California's government has no money with which to 
build a government-based system to improve the public "safety net." It is a 
more important fact that employers, insurers and health-care providers want a 
private solution and are ready to work to find it. 
</P>
<P>
I am convinced that the elusive political moment to solve this health insurance 
problem is at hand. Requiring employers to provide insurance is not 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of California's employers, large and small, already provide health 
protection for their employees. Asking all to participate only levels the 
playing field. It creates fair competition in every business and industry. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation I am proposing asks California's business community to decide 
finally whether it wants to renew its 60-year-long commitment to 
employment-based health insurance or to relinquish it. 
</P>
<P>
After that question is fully debated and fairly answered, those who must make 
public policy can move forward constructively. We cannot continue to leave 5.5 
million Californians out of the health system.

DEVELOPERS, HOMEOWNERS DIFFER OVER FREEWAY BYPASS ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Homeowners and developers in Calabasas are choosing up sides over where a 
Ventura Freeway emergency bypass road should be built at the rugged Calabasas 
Grade. 
</P>
<P>
The north side of the freeway is preferred by residents of exclusive Calabasas 
Park. But the south side is the choice of a company planning a 1,500-home 
subdivision in Calabasas Park that will pay for the multimillion-dollar link. 
</P>
<P>
The two-mile-wide grade is the last area between Los Angeles and Thousand Oaks 
without an alternative route that motorists can use in case of a freeway 
tie-up. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, steep hills at the southwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley have 
thwarted development that would be accompanied by road construction. 
</P>
<P>
New interest in a bypass has been sparked by a chain-reaction crash in the 
middle of the grade that closed the westbound freeway for five hours, however.

Twenty-four vehicles tangled in February when a tractor-trailer jackknifed and 
dumped 85 gallons of diesel fuel from its ruptured tanks. Traffic backed up to 
the junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways in Sherman Oaks while 
highway workers cleaned up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Land on the south side of the freeway is owned by the Irvine-based Baldwin Co., 
which closed escrow March 31 on Calabasas Park's last major undeveloped area -- 
a 1,300-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frontage Road Backed 
</P>
<P>
In a newsletter sent last month to Calabasas Park residents, Baldwin Co. 
planners urged that a partially built freeway frontage street, Calabasas Road, 
be extended about a mile and turned into the grade's bypass. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Vice President Bob Burns explained in the newsletter that his firm and 
"many of the residents of Calabasas" prefer to see Calabasas Road connected to 
Las Virgenes Road west of the grade. 
</P>
<P>
That alternative is better than a longstanding Los Angeles County plan to 
extend Parkway Calabasas to Las Virgenes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Company planners said they are opposed to making Parkway Calabasas the bypass 
because it would funnel traffic through the heart of Calabasas Park's 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree that better planning" can lead to "less inconvenience to those living 
here," Burns said. He said Baldwin officials are continuing to discuss the 
other route with homeowner representatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the influential Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn. is protesting the company's 
road proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter circulated last week to the community, association President Myra 
Turek complained that the firm is using the bypass issue as a way to gather 
support for a larger subdivision project. 
</P>
<P>
Turek said homeowners want Baldwin to pay for construction of a bypass road 
that would be about a mile north of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory Route Urged 
</P>
<P>
The preferred route, she said, would be a western extension of Victory 
Boulevard through the southeastern corner of Ventura County to the northern 
dead end of Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
Such a route would follow east Las Virgenes Canyon through the rugged hills. It 
would skirt the city of Hidden Hills, which has spurned suggestions that an 
east-west road be constructed through its limits. 
</P>
<P>
Turek said it would be foolish to construct an emergency bypass such as 
Calabasas Road that is adjacent to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unusable in case of a toxic spill like they had over in Simi 
Valley recently," she said Thursday. "The Victory Boulevard extension would 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents' Response 
</P>
<P>
According to Turek, more than 600 Calabasas Park residents have returned post 
cards to the association in the past few days expressing agreement. The cards 
will be used in road discussions with Baldwin officials and with Los Angeles 
County planners. 
</P>
<P>
County officials -- whose master plan still calls for the eventual westward 
extension of Parkway Calabasas south of the freeway -- said it is unclear 
whether Baldwin can be forced to pay for construction of a road that is a mile 
away from its property and in a different county. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine how we could require an improvement that far off-site," said 
Leeta Pistone, field deputy for County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. "It would be 
hard to justify. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we need an alternate route either north or south of the freeway, 
preferably both places. But it almost has to be on the south side. How do you 
cut through the mountains on the north when Hidden Hills won't let the road 
come through it?" 
</P>
<P>
Pistone said the county cannot build a bypass road by itself. 
</P>
<P>
So the sooner the dispute is settled, the better, she said. Another 
grade-choking crash will leave motorists begging for relief, she said.

$2-BILLION PORTER RANCH PLAN BACKED BY BERNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson announced his support Thursday for a 
large residential and commercial development proposed for the Porter Ranch area 
of Chatsworth but recommended a 20% cut in the project's commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson endorsed the $2-billion project, proposed by Porter Ranch Development 
Co., at a city Planning Commission hearing. The development plan calls for 
about 3,000 residences and 7.5 million square feet of commercial space to be 
built in the hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The commission delayed a decision on the project until May 10. Commission 
President William G. Luddy said the case is too complex to be decided in one 
day. The City Council, which ordinarily abides by the wishes of colleagues 
about development issues in their districts, is expected to make a final 
decision on the proposal later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson appointed a citizens committee in 1987 to draw up a plan for how the 
1,300-acre area should be developed. The committee, city planners and the 
developer then put together the proposal before the commission. Bernson noted 
that the proposal calls for less than the 8.6 million square feet originally 
sought by Porter Ranch Development, which is run by Beverly Hills builder 
Nathan Shapell. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernson recommended shrinking the commercial area even further to about 6 
million square feet. In the area of the project proposed for the most office 
space, Bernson recommended cutting maximum building heights from 15 to 10 
stories. He did not recommend reducing height limits in other areas designated 
for office buildings of 12, 10, 8 and 6 stories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agrees With Planners 
</P>
<P>
Bernson concurred with a city Planning Department suggestion that an area 
proposed for five-story office buildings be changed to allow 400 units of 
multifamily housing instead. He also agrees with planners who say the project's 
commercial portion should not exceed 1.5 million square feet until the state 
finances a one-lane expansion of the Simi Valley Freeway, Bernson's chief 
deputy, Greig Smith, said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Although many see this as a project to be built tomorrow, it is in fact only a 
plan," Bernson said. The plan "requires continuing citizen review as each phase 
is implemented" and "guarantees the ability to handle both traffic generated by 
the development and outside growth over which we have little control." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal "guarantees adequate streets, a fire station, library, parks, a 
day-care center and a future school site," Bernson said. "It also provides for 
the continued preservation of the rural flavor of the Chatsworth community by 
including a sizable horse-keeping area, horse trails, hiking trails and large 
areas of open space." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernson disagreed with a Planning Department recommendation that the 
number of single-family homes be reduced from 2,195 to 2,020 to allow for more 
horse trails and horse-keeping properties. "We are in a severe housing crisis," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson read from a prepared statement in his address to the commission. The 
public hearing that followed his remarks drew about 200 people for and against 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Birch, a spokesman for PRIDE, a neighborhood group opposed to the 
development, said his organization was not satisfied by Bernson's recommended 
cuts in the size of the commercial area. He said the group wants the area to be 
developed according to the existing community plan, enacted in 1974, which 
calls for only 1.3 million square feet of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Mahan, a Shapell spokesman, said of Bernson's position: "We feel 
there is no need for any cuts. This has been cut and cut again."

WASTE TREATMENT PROBLEM MAY COST AVALON $100,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board has recommended that a 
$100,000 fine be levied against the city of Avalon for violations of its sewage 
discharge permit. 
</P>
<P>
The fine, included in a complaint scheduled to be filed against the city next 
week, was recommended after inspectors found at least 50 violations at Avalon's 
waste treatment plant from November, 1988, through March, 1989, said Robert 
Ghirelli, the board's executive officer. Board officials said that on some days 
solid waste levels were as much as 100% above levels set in the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Avalon, however, said the plant has been in compliance with the 
permit except on three occasions, two of them involving mechanical breakdowns 
that were repaired within a day. The plant was also in noncompliance during the 
last two weeks of December, 1988, when a private firm took over operation of 
the plant from the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stunned by Penalty 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned by the board's reaction," said City Manager Chuck Prince. 
"We're in compliance and have been in compliance. If you look at the (city's) 
discharge records and take out finite instances, the plant's in compliance and 
it operates well." 
</P>
<P>
The city will appeal the fine at a hearing before the board scheduled for May 
22, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Ghirelli said violations were also discovered at the plant in 1985. The city 
was given a three-year schedule to upgrade and expand the plant and to bring it 
into compliance with the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion increased the plant's capacity from 500,000 gallons a day to about 
1.2 million gallons a day, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
After the expansion was completed in November, the board began monitoring the 
waste-water discharge using automated devices that were periodically read by 
board inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a history here of problems with the city," Ghirelli said. "If 
everything had gone well, the city should have been in compliance, but they 
weren't. We have the city working to correct the problem but they haven't 
really gotten the job done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Turnover Cited 
</P>
<P>
City officials say some of the violations occurred because of employee turnover 
after Operations Consultants Inc., a Gardena-based waste treatment firm, took 
over operation of the plant in December. 
</P>
<P>
The five city employees who worked at the plant were given the option of 
continuing the same work for the company or transferring to other city jobs, 
said Steve McLean, the firm's general manager. Three chose to leave the plant 
for other city jobs and had to be replaced, McLean said. The loss of 
experienced employees contributed to problems regulating sewage discharge, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
David Sherman, a spokesman for the company, said it is "extremely unusual for 
an expanded or new plant to comply with discharge standards within the first 
month of operations." 
</P>
<P>
McLean also noted that special conditions exist at the Avalon plant because it 
uses saltwater to process waste. In saltwater treatment plants, the reaction of 
bacteria to the biological waste treatment process requires more careful 
monitoring than in freshwater plants, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is radically different for bacteria in saltwater than it is in 
freshwater," McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said he knew of only three other saltwater waste treatment plants in the 
country, two in Florida and one in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the board separately monitor the oxygen level and the amount of 
solid wastes in sewage at the Avalon plant before it is discharged into the 
ocean from a pipe that extends 400 feet off the Santa Catalina shore, board 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discharge Measures 
</P>
<P>
The permit allows for sewage discharge with an average of 20 milligrams of 
"biochemical oxygen demand" per liter of water per month, said Winnie Deslate, 
a board senior engineer. Biochemical oxygen demand is a measure of the amount 
of oxygen needed to break down sewage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The permit also allows for 30 milligrams of suspended solid waste per liter of 
water each month, Deslate said. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's tests, biochemical oxygen demand levels averaged 17 milligrams 
and solid waste averaged about 21 milligrams per liter -- not counting periods 
when there were mechanical breakdowns and other problems at the plant, Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the board's measurements showed waste levels ranged from just over permit 
limits to as much as 100% over the limits on certain days, Deslate said. In 
February, 1989, for example, biochemical oxygen demand was 22.8 milligrams, 
just over the limit of 20, but solid waste averaged 59.5 milligrams per liter, 
nearly twice the 30-milligram limit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they're in compliance and sometimes they're off," Deslate said. 
"It's been going on for four months and we feel something has to be done about 
it. They're not really improving." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the fine not have been recommended if the city had worked more 
closely with the board during the plant expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The Avalon city attorney is working with city and company officials to prepare 
the appeal for the May 22 hearing, said Prince, adding that he is confident the 
city will persuade the board to reduce the amount of the fine or eliminate it 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic," Prince said. "We are in compliance, except we had 
mechanical failures and (employee) turnovers, and that hurt us."

CAT TO GO ON PROWL FOR SAN DIEGO AUTO THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with dramatic increases in San Diego auto thefts, anxious motorists have 
gone to great lengths to protect their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive alarms, identification numbers etched on car windows and hidden 
ignition kill switches are some of the anti-theft measures. 
</P>
<P>
Now, add one more method. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police unveiled a plan this week that may give vehicle owners an 
innovative and cheap way to thwart auto thieves: a highly visible yellow decal 
affixed to the auto's rear window and a promise by its owner not to drive 
during the hours of 1 and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary program, dubbed CAT -- for Combat Auto Theft -- officially begins 
Saturday, according to Deputy Police Chief Mike Rice, who unveiled it Wednesday 
during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in New York 
</P>
<P>
A duplicate of a program in New York that started in 1986, CAT was embraced by 
San Diego police officials after they heard of its success. The curfew between 
1 and 5 a.m. was chosen because most vehicles are stolen during that time, Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By enrolling in the program and signing a waiver, the owner consents to 
investigative stops by police during those hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of them (the decals) is police officers will be seeking these 
stickers out, and they will be vigorously stopping cars with them," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the New York Police Department, the program there 
has cut auto theft about 40%, Rice said. Although the program has been lauded 
as being ingeniously frugal, some civil libertarians have raised questions 
about a signed consent form that waives the Fourth Amendment right of illegal 
search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
The Automobile Club of Southern California is underwriting the program and has 
printed 10,000 decals and 20,000 brochures, said Daniel Beyer, assistant claims 
manager of the San Diego branch. Thus far, $2,200 has been spent on the 
program's materials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To participate, vehicle owners fill out a registration form -- kept by police 
-- stating that they do not drive between 1 and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inviting a Stop 
</P>
<P>
If they or anyone they lend the vehicle to drives at those hours, they 
understand that they will be subject to a stop if the police spot the decal, 
which bears a picture of a cat and the registered serial number on file with 
police. The form also keeps a record of the year and make of the vehicle, phone 
numbers to reach the owner and the vehicle's identification number. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment will be handled by the 10 community relations offices in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Charlie Grimm, of the department's auto theft detail unit, said on average 
there are about 60 vehicles stolen each day in San Diego. In 1988, auto thefts 
soared 32% from the 18,583 reported in 1987 to 24,470, although the unit has 
seen a drop in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Grimm said the department recently formed a strike unit to reduce auto thefts 
by zeroing in on chop shops (where stolen vehicles are altered and stripped) 
and series thefts by organized groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has been so great, I haven't concentrated on a certain area," 
Grimm said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides enrolling in the CAT program, Grimm recommended that vehicle owners 
install some type of alarm. He said owners should take as many precautions as 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how anyone can go out and buy a new car today without investing 
in some type of alarm. They've got to be crazy."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-CHAMBER CHIEF PLEADS INNOCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melvin Greenstein, a pawn shop owner and former president of the Lawndale 
Chamber of Commerce, has pleaded innocent to a felony charge of receiving 
stolen property. A preliminary hearing will be held May 12 in Culver City 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstein, 53, declined to comment on the case when contacted Thursday. He is 
free on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstein is charged with buying at his pawn shop a $10,000 diamond bracelet 
and a $300 Cartier watch that authorities said were stolen Feb. 16 at the 
Marina Beach Hotel in Marina del Rey. Lisa Ann Adamo, 26, has been charged with 
the burglary, according to Sheriff's Detective David Cowen. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies found the stolen watch and bracelet during searches of 
Greenstein's pawn shop and his West Los Angeles home, Cowen said. He declined 
to disclose the nature of evidence linking Greenstein to Adamo. 
</P>
<P>
In March, about a week before his arrest, Greenstein resigned as chamber 
president. Mayor Sarann Kruse said he left because of frustration over chamber 
problems. The chamber suffered a serious blow last summer when the City Council 
voted to withhold $70,000 the chamber expected to use for community and 
business-development activities. This represented nearly 65% of the chamber's 
$110,000 annual budget, according to chamber officials. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Enis, the chamber's paid director, also resigned in March. He became 
director of the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROFESSIONAL LICENSE FEES RAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Professionals and tradespeople working in Hermosa Beach, such as contractors, 
doctors and lawyers, will pay a higher fee when they renew their annual 
business licenses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the flat fees -- now $150, plus $12 for each of the professional's 
employees, in most categories -- will be tied to annual rises in the cost of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Retail businesses, which pay fees based on a percentage of gross income, will 
not be affected by the new measure, which voters approved in November. The City 
Council adopted a policy resolution Tuesday to increase the fees.

FLEEING SUSPECTS LEAVE MARIJUANA BEHIND AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A duffel bag containing more than 11 pounds of marijuana, with a street value 
of $5,840, was found at the bottom of a flood-control channel on the U. S. side 
of the Tijuana River Wednesday night, Border Patrol agents said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bag contained five "bricks" of marijuana weighing about 2 pounds each, plus 
two small packages of marijuana, said Norbert Gomez, public information officer 
for the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said Border Patrol agents observed a group of aliens in the river bottom, 
and agents on all-terrain motorcycles went to investigate. They found the 
duffel bag but no people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The group may have been trying to bring it north, and when they observed the 
agents approaching the area, probably dumped the drugs and ran back to the 
Mexican side of the border," Gomez said.

McCoy checked in Tuesday as James T. Wagner, then re-registered the next day as 
John Garner and moved into a new room, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
When Las Vegas police and hotel security personnel, arrested McCoy, they found 
a .38-caliber semi-automatic handgun and a pound of a white, powdery substance, 
Trevino said. McCoy was arrested on suspicion of possession of a concealed 
weapon, possession of a controlled substance and a felony child-abuse warrant. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known why Las Vegas police made the arrest or how they knew of 
McCoy's whereabouts. The mother of the battered 2-year-old twins was arrested 
March 27 on charges of felony child abuse when she tried to visit her sons at 
Children's Hospital in San Diego. Dorothy Denise DeSimone, 25, of Oceanside is 
being held in the County Jail at Las Colinas in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone has denied any role in the abuse of the children, who were found March 
25 in Del Mar. They suffered severe bruises and cigarette burns on their 
stomachs and sides, authorities said. Both children were sexually abused, but 
DeSimone claimed that the abuse was at the hands of her boyfriend, McCoy.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA REVISES LAW PROTECTING OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council has approved an ordinance, more than a year in 
the making, to preserve oak trees, long regarded as the symbol of the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The measure refines an emergency oak ordinance passed the day the city 
incorporated Dec. 15, 1987. The new ordinance, approved Tuesday night, spells 
out how and when residents may trim or remove the trees. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the new ordinance is more flexible than the emergency 
measure, which required residents to obtain $125 permits to trim or remove 
trees. Under the new ordinance, a permit will not be needed for routine 
maintenance or to remove deadwood under six inches in circumference. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, trimming permits will cost $25. Permits to remove oaks 
will remain $125. Oak trees may only be removed with city approval.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 TREATED AFTER FUMES FORCE STORE EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people were treated at a hospital Thursday after vapors from a spilled 
load of pesticides forced the evacuation of a Thousand Oaks discount store, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The five, all store employees, were treated at Westlake Community Hospital and 
released after they inhaled fumes from 15 broken containers of the pesticide 
malathion, said Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman Cece Grives. The 
containers were in five boxes accidentally dropped in a storeroom at a K mart 
store in the 300 block of Hampshire Road, Grives said. 
</P>
<P>
No other injuries were reported in the 11:14 a.m. accident, which forced the 
evacuation of 100 customers and 75 employees, Grives said. It was unknown why 
the boxes fell, she said.

PADRES LOSE TO ATLANTA AGAIN, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ball was high in the sky and the bat was hurtling through the air. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of all of this was moving down the baseline, but Tony Gwynn never 
reached first base. Instead, he exited stage right into the Padre dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts stood on third, helpless. He would exit toward the dugout one 
batter later. 
</P>
<P>
A lousy popup. It was the first one of the year for Gwynn. And it certainly 
won't be the last. But, oh, what a time to pop up. Third inning, one out, 
runner on third, Padres down a run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the little things Thursday that doomed the Padres to a 4-1 loss to the 
Atlanta Braves. The popup. The feeble hitting. Another error. 
</P>
<P>
That was the story from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, where 18,596 watched a 
couple of cloudy teams play on an overcast day. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta took care of the Padres for the second day in a row, dropping their 
record to 5-5. The game featured many guys who usually watch from the bench. 
Both managers rested some regulars because a day game followed a night game. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Roberts started in right field and was on third after his triple to 
center with the Padres trailing, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Gwynn, who went for the first pitch and popped it up. 
</P>
<P>
This was a day when Jack Clark was talking about bunting and Gwynn was talking 
about power hitting after the game. Weird. 
</P>
<P>
"Stupidity, that's all it was," Gwynn said of his popup to shortstop Andres 
Thomas. "I went up there and said, 'Be selective, get a pitch I can hit, and 
don't try to do too much.' Then the ball got there and I tried to hit it 55 
miles." 
</P>
<P>
If there had been no backstop, that's how far Gwynn's bat might have traveled. 
The bat zipped past plate umpire Terry Tata before hitting the fence behind 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost hit Terry Tata with the bat," Gwynn said. "That scared the crap out 
of me. It was just a stupid at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta left-hander Derek Lilliquist (1-0) survived a rocky first inning in his 
major league debut to become the second pitcher in two games to handcuff the 
Padres, holding them to one run and three hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lilliquist, 23, walked two in the first, but got out of it. He allowed Mark 
Parent's single in the second. And Roberts' triple in the third. Then he 
retired 15 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"(Catcher) Bruce (Benedict) did a good job behind the plate of moving me in and 
out," said Lilliquist, who was Baseball America's College Pitcher of the Year 
as a junior at the University of Georgia in 1987. "I used what got me here. 
Location and changing speeds." 
</P>
<P>
It was another rough day for Clark, who walked, grounded to the pitcher and 
struck out twice, dropping his average to .133. He was booed after each 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I'm hitting, I deserve to be booed," Clark said. "I'm booing myself. 
It's frustrating because you spend a lot of time taking extra hitting, you take 
extra hitting in spring training, and then the game comes and you're not doing 
what you're capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to drop a couple of bunts down to get things going, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lilliquist's day spoiled the home debut of Walt Terrell (0-2), who allowed two 
runs and six hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
One of those runs was unearned. Shortstop Gary Green booted his first fielding 
chance of the season when the game's first batter, Tommy Gregg, punched a ball 
up the middle. Green got to the grounder in plenty of time, but it skipped off 
his glove for the Padres' 15th error in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I just messed it up," Green said. "It really wasn't that tough of a play." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Murphy, batting second for the second game in a row, then struck out and 
Gerald Perry grounded to third, but Thomas singled to right to drive home 
Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell kept Atlanta quiet until the sixth when, with two outs, Murphy, Perry 
and Thomas each singled. Murphy scored, making it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"The three pitches were all right down the middle of the plate," Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Two runs were all Lilliquist needed. He sailed along until the seventh, 
spotting his pitches well enough to keep the Padres guessing. Then, with one 
out in the seventh, Luis Salazar pinch-hit for Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pitching everyone away," said Salazar, who spent the first few innings 
watching the game in the Padre clubhouse. "He was keeping the ball down." 
</P>
<P>
So Salazar, looking for an outside pitch, put Lilliquist's second delivery over 
the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
It pulled the Padres to within 2-1 and ended their scoreless-inning streak at 
19. It sent Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon to the mound to bring in right-hander 
Joe Boever. It also brought up Roberto Alomar, who was batting .000 (zero for 
10) against left-handers and .357 (10 for 28) against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar drilled a single to right, putting the tying run on base. But Marvell 
Wynne, batting for Roberts, struck out and Gwynn, after Alomar stole second, 
grounded to second. Gwynn's hitting streak ended at nine. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Leiper replaced Terrell in the ninth and was greeted by Perry, who sent a 
2-0 pitch into the right-field stands. A walk and Dion James' single produced 
another run to finish the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
All of which combined to put a screeching halt to the momentum the Padres had 
earlier this week. After taking the first two games of the series against 
Atlanta, San Diego winds up with a split. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pitching has been great," Gwynn said. "Our pitching has been good enough 
that we should have won more than five games so far. We've just got to cash in 
our opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so simple, really. A runner is on third with one out and the infield 
back, all you need is a ground ball. All you've got to do is put the ball in 
play somewhere to get the run in. But guys are just trying to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris is scheduled to pitch on the side before tonight's game. His side 
is feeling better and he said he's ready to pitch. . . . Walt Terrell faced 
former Detroit Tiger teammate Darrell Evans three times Thursday. Evans flied 
deep to right and then struck out twice. Terrell said the two didn't exchange 
words when Evans batted, just "smirks." But, said Terrell, "He was laughing 
after I batted at a couple of swings I took. I was laughing, too.". . . 
Saturday's game against Cincinnati will be broadcast nationally on CBS radio.

CHARGERS MIGHT DEAL FOR RYPIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers are still acknowledging the possibility of a three-team deal that 
could bring them Washington Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an idea," Steve Ortmayer said Thursday. "It's something we might 
consider. But I haven't talked to anybody about it today, and I don't expect 
anything to happen in the next 48 hours." Ortmayer is the Chargers' director of 
football operations. 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of the deal stemmed from talks between the Chargers, the Redskins 
and the Atlanta Falcons last month at the National Football League owners' 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution reported Thursday that former Pro Bowl running back 
Gerald Riggs wants to be traded amid speculation the Falcons have decided to 
make running back John Settle, a Pro Bowl selection as a rookie last year, the 
future of their running game. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution quoted sources close to Riggs and the Falcons saying the 
Chargers have offered their first-round pick (eighth overall) to the Falcons in 
exchange for Riggs. According to the report, the Chargers would then ship Riggs 
to Washington for Rypien or quarterback Stan Humphries (both are backups), an 
unnamed offensive lineman and a second-round pick in the NFL draft April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien and Humphries have worked closely with new Charger Coach Dan Henning, 
who was an offensive assistant with the Redskins last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought either quarterback plus an unnamed offensive lineman plus a 
second-rounder were worth giving up the No. 8 pick in the draft, Ortmayer said, 
"I don't want to comment on that." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are known to be looking for a quarterback. Their starter at the 
end of the 1988 season was Mark Malone, who finished with the lowest listed 
quarterback rating in the American Football Conference for the second 
consecutive year. The Chargers have hopes for the return of quarterback Mark 
Vlasic, who was 2-0 as a starter during the Chargers' 6-10 1988 season. But 
Vlasic is still recovering from reconstructive knee surgery. His status for 
1989 is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also have major draft needs at offensive line, linebacker and 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the current status of the Riggs-Charger-Redskin deal, Ortmayer 
said, "It was left nowhere. It was left as an idea." 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal would leave the Falcons with the Nos. 5 and 8 picks in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien started five games for the Redskins last year after spending the 1986 
and 1987 seasons on injured reserve because of knee injuries. Replacing Doug 
Williams, Rypien lost his first two starts and won his next two before 
suffering bruised ribs against Green Bay in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the year with a quarterback rating of 85.2, which would have placed 
him fifth in the NFC if he had the minimum of 224 completions necessary to 
qualify for the season-ending rating standings. He completed 114 of 208 passes 
for 18 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Humphries, a sixth-rounder from Northeast Louisiana, spent his rookie season 
(1988) on injured reserve with a blood disorder called thrombocytopenia. 
Meanwhile Humphries has reportedly ballooned to 240 pounds during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Washington say the hang-up on the deal could be the Chargers' 
insistence on getting Rypien rather than Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chargers continue their normal draft preparations. Today they 
will attend workouts in Los Angeles for about 25 players. Among those players 
will be UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman, who will probably be the first player 
selected in the draft. Dallas owns the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said he and a handful of other teams have contacted the Cowboys about 
trading up to get a shot at Aikman. He says the Cowboys have not yet decided 
whether they want Aikman for themselves or whether they want to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked them (the Cowboys) to tell us what they need," Ortmayer said. "And 
that's where it was left." Other teams believed to be interested in trading up 
for Aikman include Green Bay and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete also might be at the workout today. But Ortmayer 
said Peete might have a schedule conflict. This is the same workout that the 
Charger staff used last year to make a final determination on Tennessee wide 
receiver Anthony Miller, whom they selected with the 15th pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said the Chargers are getting an increasing number of phone calls from 
other teams interested in trading up for their No. 8 pick. "There's some 
anxiety on the part of other people," Ortmayer said. "I think they think the 
draft breaks right about where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have brought in LSU wide receiver Eric Hill and Pittsburgh 
defensive end Burt Grossman for physical tests, and they may do the same with 
Nebraska linebacker Broderick Thomas and Georgia running back Tim Worley. All 
four of those players are projected to go among the first 10 in the first round 
of the NFL draft. . . . Charger assistant Bobby Jackson attended a workout 
Wednesday for Oklahoma State running back Barry Sanders.

HAWTHORNE 'UNKNOWNS' WIN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS NEFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the early season surprises in the Bay League center around the Cougars 
of Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
It is only a mild surprise that first-year Coach Lester Sackurai has maneuvered 
his team into title contention. What surprises the opposition are the 
individuals who have put Hawthorne into that position. Sackurai and his unknown 
players were at it again Thursday as they handed visiting Santa Monica High a 
5-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who have been doing it all year did it again," Sackurai said. "My ace 
pitcher won the game, my stopper saved the game, my power hitter hit a homer, 
and my top hitter had three hits." 
</P>
<P>
Sackurai's ace, left-hander Steve Keith, raised his record to 6-0 by scattering 
six hits over 6 1/3 innings. Keith, who finished with seven strikeouts, is 
perhaps the biggest surprise on the Cougar team. Relying mainly on curve balls, 
the junior is in the midst of his first season as a high school pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
After spotting Santa Monica two unearned first-inning runs, Hawthorne struck 
for three runs in the third to take a 4-2 lead. Rich Peters, the Cougars' main 
power threat, had the big hit in the frame, a towering two-run home run to 
center, his fourth of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Colon Rice brought the Vikings within one run, 4-3, in the fourth by sending a 
Keith pitch over the left-field fence. A ground-rule double by Randy Davidson 
and a run-scoring single by Armando Fernandez in the fifth gave Hawthorne a 5-3 
lead. Keith set down nine of the next 10 after Rice's homer and took the 
two-run lead into the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Keith began the inning by giving up his first walk of the game. Following a 
ground out, the Vikings' Jose Avila singled in a run. Another walk moved Avila 
to second and Sackurai made the decision to go with his stopper, Francisco 
Cordova. That decision, coupled with his seventh-inning move of inserting Louie 
Lopez into right field, made Sackurai look like a genius. Despite inheriting a 
2-0 count, Cordova struck out Semian Sturges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bret Schafer lined a 0-2 pitch to right field for a single. Santa 
Monica Coach Ed Frierson chose to hold up the tying run at third as Lopez 
rifled a throw to the plate. Cordova took advantage of Frierson's respect for 
Lopez' arm by getting Ty Miller to ground out weakly to first base. to end the 
game with the bases loaded. The save was the senior's fourth in four save 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Hawthorne to split this week's two-game series with Santa 
Monica. The Vikings, 8-8 overall and 3-3 in the Bay League, defeated the 
Cougars on Tuesday, 5-3. With Thursday's win, Hawthorne, 9-6 overall, assured 
itself of remaining in second place in the league with a 4-2 record. Fernandez, 
a sophomore, raised his .442 average by going three for three with two stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger 4, Beverly Hills 3 -- Tom Gordon hit a two-out, inside-the-park home 
run in the eighth inning to snap a 3-3 tie and lift the Olympians to a Bay 
League victory at Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's homer to the gap in left-center field evened Leuzinger's league record 
at 3-3 and improved its overall mark to 11-6-1. Beverly Hills, which had beaten 
the Olympians 9-7 on Tuesday, fell to 3-3 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills took a 3-1 lead with two runs in the fourth, but Leuzinger 
battled back to tie with runs in the sixth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Rodriguez singled home a run in the sixth. In the seventh, Marvin 
Johnson reached first on an error by the shortstop and took third when pinch 
hitter Angel Andrade doubled. Johnson scored the tying run on a groundout by 
Francisco Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Tavo Lopez pitched a complete game for the Olympians, 
giving up four hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 8, Torrance 4 -- The Sea Kings, who lost a 6-3 decision to 
Torrance on Tuesday, gained revenge by leading the entire way at home. Palos 
Verdes improved to 9-6 overall and 3-3 in the Bay League while Torrance dropped 
to 3-11 and 2-4.

<P>
NEW-FOUND CONFIDENCE MAKES RANDY COOPER THE TOUGHEST OUT IN A POTENT CANYONS' 
LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Cooper wears such a broad, What, Me Worry? grin, it is difficult to 
believe he spent all of last season playing a scared second base for College of 
the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Barreling baserunners who slid, spikes high, to break up double plays did not 
faze Cooper, nor did high-and-tight offerings from pitchers intent on brushing 
the Hoover High graduate off the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's fear sprung from self doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The highly successful Canyons baseball program annually draws talented high 
school players from throughout the Valley area. Cooper himself opted to become 
a Cougar rather than attend Glendale College, which is located less than three 
minutes from his parents' house. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite performing at a level that produced a .333 batting average and 
second-team All-Western State Conference honors, Cooper felt his daily 
contributions were not up to par for himself or the powerful Cougars, who have 
won eight consecutive WSC titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was nervous," Cooper said. "Every game, I thought, 'Dang, am I 
going to be in there next game?" 
</P>
<P>
This season, Canyons Coach Len Mohney says he can't imagine filling out a 
lineup card without Cooper's name at second base or center field. 
</P>
<P>
And the only people worried this season are opposing coaches and pitchers who 
have tried unsuccessfully to stop Cooper from wreaking havoc. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyons has some other kids with more home runs," Valley Coach Chris Johnson 
said, "but as far as getting pitched to, Randy Cooper is their toughest out." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's fear apparently has struck out. 
</P>
<P>
He is relaxed and batting .434 overall and .473 in conference play for Canyons 
(17-12 overall, 10-4 in the WSC), which is embroiled in a legitimate race for 
the championship for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really on a roll now," Mohney said of Cooper. "I think he has to be a 
Division I guy." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's prowess has forced Mohney to tinker with what he hoped would be a 
batting order set in stone, or at least fiery aluminum. Originally, the middle 
of the Cougars' lineup was to feature a mini-Murderers' Row of sophomores Chris 
Joy, Peter Washington and Don Pedersen. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, however, killed that idea with his increased production. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Randy was one of the soldiers," Mohney said. "This year he's one of 
the guys the guys look for to carry the bulk a little." 
</P>
<P>
Handling responsibility for his team's success is easier than it might have 
been in the past for Cooper because, physically, he is much different player 
than he was a year ago when he weighed as little as 149 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the 5-foot-9 1/2 Cooper maintains 172 pounds, the result of a 
self-prescribed, year-long weightlifting program. 
</P>
<P>
"He took it on his own and went for it," said Mohney, who often opens the 
Canyons weight room for Cooper after games. "He said, 'Hey, I need to be a 
little stronger.' A lot of guys know that but they don't have the discipline to 
do it, which is a different thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said undertaking the regimen was a necessary step toward playing for a 
Division I program next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious that if I wanted to go someplace big I was going to have to 
change something," said Cooper, who has two home runs and 30 runs batted in. 
"Last year, to hit the ball far, I had to swing from my butt. Now I just have 
to jab at it and it goes. 
</P>
<P>
"People say you shouldn't lift weights if you're a baseball player because you 
get too tense. But I haven't seen anything bad happen in my arm or anything. I 
think it's made my arm stronger." 
</P>
<P>
It's also made Cooper into a part-time outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes he's not real excited about being out there," Mohney said. 
"But he's our best center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was reared as a shortstop at Hoover, where he played four years of 
varsity baseball under his father, Bob, batting .432 as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
He turned down a partial scholarship at Cal State Long Beach, where his 
brother, Robby, was a senior, and enrolled at Canyons, where Jeff Flesher, who 
would go on to become the WSC Player of the Year, established himself as the 
starting shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was a role player for the Cougars, who finished 32-6 overall and 22-3 in 
conference play with dominant players such as Flesher and pitcher Tim Nedin and 
dominant personalities like catcher Mike Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"Bible was the leader, one of those types that says, 'C'mon man, let's go pull 
their nostril hair out,' " said Cooper, who is a captain this season. "I'm not 
that vocal. I don't consider myself a big leader. Just someone who plays hard 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
As Canyons battles Ventura, Moorpark, Valley and Oxnard for the WSC 
championship, the Cougars find themselves in an unfamiliar setting -- a 
competitive race for the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising how people just get in your kitchen because you haven't put it 
away," Mohney said. "Who knows? We could still win this sucker." 
</P>
<P>
Should the Cougars rally for their ninth consecutive title, it will likely be 
on the bulky shoulders of Cooper, who traded his insecurity for the confidence 
that breeds success. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I stand up there like I did in high school," Cooper said. "I sort of look 
at the guy (pitcher) like, 'You're going to get hit. And you're going to get 
hit hard.' "

GATHERS STARS AS TOASTMASTER FOR LION CAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount All-American basketball player Hank Gathers hasn't made a 
decision yet on whether to declare for the National Basketball Assn. draft, but 
based on his performance Wednesday at the team's banquet, he has a future as a 
toastmaster -- or speaking at celebrity roasts. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers introduced his teammates while Coach Paul Westhead passed out 
wristwatches commemorating the team's appearance in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament. Few escaped unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
On freshman guard Terrell Lowery: "Terrell's gonna be a great player . . . once 
his game catches up with his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
On freshman forward Chris (Blade) Knight: "Blade played as hard as he possibly 
can . . . I guess." 
</P>
<P>
On shooting guard Jeff Fryer: "Nobody passes the ball to me like Fryer. And if 
you believe that I've got some insurance I want to sell you. I actually have to 
go up to him before games and tell him, 'Hey kid, I'm on your team.' " 
</P>
<P>
On graduating senior John Veargason: "John's kind of lazy. If John could get 
remote control to tie his shoes, he would." 
</P>
<P>
On Enoch Simmons, who sat out the NCAA playoff game against Arkansas with a 
broken hand: "I just got one thing to say to Enoch Simmons -- thanks for 
ruining our season." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers introduced himself as well: "Now the man you've all been waiting for . 
. . please rise." Gathers saved a few zingers for himself, referring to his 
sub-60% free throw shooting: "One thing -- I used to be a very good foul 
shooter before I got here. It's all that running. And the Santa Ana winds don't 
help." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a while since anyone thought of Loyola Marymount as the big bad bully 
of the West Coast Athletic Conference -- in any sport -- but that was the 
upshot last weekend after Loyola and the University of San Diego had a 
bench-clearing scuffle during Saturday's baseball doubleheader at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust cleared, San Diego Coach John Cunningham, the senior coach in the 
WCAC in his 26th season, seemed insulted by the incident. Cunningham, who 
perhaps yearns for a return to a more genteel conference, implied that Loyola 
started a fight to get his pitcher thrown out. The teams had a similar incident 
two years ago at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Chris Smith, one of two first-year coaches in the WCAC, thought his 
player had every reason to charge the mound. "I probably shouldn't say this, 
but if I were in his place, I would've gone too," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The events that triggered the fight started with the first batter in the bottom 
of the first inning of the second game. The Lions had hammered the frustrated 
Toreros in two straight games. Loyola's leadoff batter, Robert Cannon, was hit 
in the foot by San Diego's Tony Battilega. A dubious umpiring decision -- that 
Battle had not tried to get out of the way -- kept him at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola has developed a recent reputation of leaning into pitches when a rally 
is needed. However, Smith pointed out, nobody tries to get hit in the foot 
while hopping out of the batter's box. "That was ridiculous," Smith said. "I 
totally disagreed with that call." 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage. Battilega's next pitch hit Cannon in the back. "I think he 
was throwing at him," Smith said. "I think it was intentional." Cannon charged 
the mound and both benches cleared. Both combatants were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Observers at the game said it is doubtful Battilega was throwing at the first 
batter. Cunningham implied that an "unnecessary" Loyola player started a fight 
with the intention of getting the Torero pitcher ejected, also a dubious call. 
Cannon, the lineup's fastest player and best outfield arm, is hardly 
dispensable. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches termed the incident "unfortunate." However, Cunningham's reference 
to Loyola "turning the game into a goon squad" is at least a backhanded 
compliment. Only in recent seasons have the Lions been thought of as 
intimidating. Nobody wants to see baseball turn into hockey, but not very long 
ago, when the Lions were in San Diego's current position -- last -- nobody was 
calling them goons. 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Simmons has the splint off his hand and is beginning rehabilitation on 
the finger that was fractured and required surgery after Loyola Marymount's 
championship game in the West Coast Athletic Conference basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, the four-year letterman and team captain who missed Loyola's NCAA 
playoff game against Arkansas, will be in rehabilitation for several weeks 
before reporting to the Oakland A's training facility in Scottsdale, Ariz. At 
Loyola's basketball banquet Wednesday, Simmons looked fit, but the middle 
knuckle of his left third finger is still swollen and sore. Simmons hopes to 
report to Scottsdale in early May for "late spring training." Then he expects 
to be sent to Oakland's farm team at Modesto as an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola has won the last two West Coast Athletic Conference basketball 
tournament titles, but with the demise of the San Francisco program in the 
early 1980s, Pepperdine makes a strong case as the team of the decade in the 
WCAC. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jim Harrick and, this past season, Tom Asbury, the Waves won or shared 
five WCAC titles in the decade and made seven postseason appearances, including 
NCAA berths in 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986. In that period the Waves have 
averaged nearly 19 victories per season and achieved Top 20 ranking twice -- 
still a rarity in the WCAC with the exception of USF's dominance from the 1950s 
through the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Loyola has won 48 games over the last two seasons but averaged 
13.8 victories in the decade. The Lions' fortunes have changed favorably in 
Paul Westhead's four seasons, with Loyola averaging 19.8 wins with two NCAA 
appearances and three postseason berths. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves and Lions are the only WCAC teams to win NCAA Tournament games this 
decade -- Pepperdine beat Pittsburgh in the first round in 1982 while Loyola 
defeated Wyoming in the first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills pitcher Rick Davis leads all NCAA pitchers -- all divisions -- 
with 125 strikeouts in 104 innings. . . . Lady Toro sophomore Kim Park has 
thrown four shutouts in her last five starts for the softball team. She has a 
streak of 40 innings without allowing an earned run. . . . Palos Verdes 
Peninsula native Mike Schelgel was named Western Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Assn. Player of the Week. He led San Diego State to an upset of Pepperdine with 
24 kills, eight blocks, 11 digs and two aces. . . . With several key 
tournaments coming up next week, the Dominguez Hills golf team is rated 12th, 
ahead of rival Cal State Northridge. The Toros will play in the Pt. Loma 
Tournament on Monday. . . . Former Carson High three-sport standout Michael 
Helms was a starting guard for the Oregon basketball team as a sophomore this 
season and averaged six points, two rebounds and two assists. Helms, a reserve 
as a freshman, worked his way into the lineup in midseason and started 11 
games.

WEIL KEEPS ERA AT 0.00 WITH NO-HITTER FOR HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior Kym Weil pitched a no-hitter with 13 strikeouts Thursday to lead 
visiting Hart High to a 5-0 Foothill League softball victory over Schurr. 
</P>
<P>
Weil (13-1), who walked two and faced only 23 batters, has not allowed an 
earned run in 93 innings this season. She has faced 317 batters and stuck out 
163. It was Weil's second no-hitter this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She's had some better games and she's had some games, probably, not as good," 
said Coach Al Weil, Kym's father. 
</P>

Although Marianne Berglund has lived in the San Diego area just five years, she 
treats the Bud Light La Jolla Grand Prix as a heavyweight champion would treat 
a title fight in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my home race," said Berglund, who won the La Jolla Grand Prix in 1986 and 
'88, finished third in '87 and fourth in '85. "I don't want anyone invading my 
territory. If you have won the race the year before, you feel like you have to 
defend your title." 
</P>
<P>
Berglund moved to Cardiff by the Sea from Sweden, so she could join the U.S. 
women's cycling circuit at a time when the sport was beginning to take off. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is so advanced now -- the equipment, the technology," Berglund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During her five years in the United States, Berglund has won more than 100 
criterium (short course) races. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of U.S. cyclist Connie Carpenter, Berglund wrote to the 1984 Olympic 
gold medalist that year for help in securing sponsorship. Carpenter obliged and 
soon after Berglund was racing for Levi Strauss, Carpenter's racing team. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to move (to San Diego County) because this is where the racing is the 
best," she said. "I got lucky because I came over when the sport was really 
taking off." 
</P>
<P>
Only five years before, Berglund was doing her racing on the slopes instead of 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling was just something I did to train during the two-month off-season in 
skiing," said Berglund, who began skiing at age 6. 
</P>
<P>
But the riding bug stuck with Berglund, and at 17 she was offered a cycling 
scholarship by a Swedish college. Once she accepted the scholarship, her 
promising skiing career was history. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I couldn't imagine doing anything else," she said. "I love what I'm doing. 
It's fast, dangerous, colorful and noisy. I encourage everybody to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At last year's La Jolla Grand Prix, Berglund out-sprinted Sally Zack and 
Jeannie Golay for a 15-yard victory. It was vintage Berglund. 
</P>
<P>
Known for her sprinting, the 5-foot-3 Berglund is hoping Sunday's 20-mile 
women's Grand Prix, which begins at 1:15 p.m., unfolds the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern is to make sure I'm up in front to make sure nobody goes off, 
and then try to win the sprint," said Berglund, who won 13 criterium races last 
year. "Last year it was a breakaway with five of us about 30 seconds ahead of 
the rest of the field. It's very possible this year's race could be like that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Berglund said she will not be able to win the 33-lap race by herself. 
If she is to capture her third Grand Prix in the five-year history of the 
event, Berglund's Lycra teammates will have to provide drafting or "lead-outs" 
-- a racing maneuver commonly used to shield the premier rider from the wind. 
The strategic goal is to save the sprinter's energy for the finish of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to have help," said Berglund, who won the 1983 World 
Championship of road racing. "I would probably not have won last year without 
my teammates. I don't know of many people who have ever won a race by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla course, which covers 12 square blocks in the downtown area, has 
been a perfect match for Berglund's slim but muscular physique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's flat with really no hills," Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Longer stage races, like the Tour de France, cramp Berglund's style with their 
steep, winding hills. 
</P>
<P>
She has never won a stage race, though she did place seventh in last week's 
10-day Tour of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in the muscle makeup," Berglund said. "My size helps me out in the 
sprints, but the 5-10 girls are more suited to the stage races. They have more 
endurance than me and different muscles." 
</P>
<P>
But Berglund has the "explosive muscles." 
</P>
<P>
"I was born with the kind of muscles that are better for shorter distances," 
she said. "If I was a track and field athlete, I'd be a sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Berglund doesn't ignore distance work either. She rides more than 300 miles 
a week on her 16-pound, $2,000 precision-crafted cycle, lifts weights three 
times weekly and does hill work "in large gears" once a week. All training 
regimens are prescribed by her coach, Ron Smith, a local triathlete who she has 
worked with for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron's been very good for me," she said. "Much of my success last year was 
because of his weight training." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the only blemish on Berglund's season last year was another sub-par 
Olympics. Competing for Sweden, Berglund failed for the second time to made the 
top 20. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a disappointment," said Berglund, who had won two U.S. Olympic trial 
races in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But it did not crush happy-go-lucky Berglund, who in her six-month off-season 
takes classes at Mesa College. Next year Berglund is planning to attend 
MiraCosta College full-time. 
</P>
<P>
But for the next five months, she will be a full-time cycling student, 
averaging almost two races a week through October. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>

SOCKER LOSS TO BALTIMORE ENDS REGULAR-SEASON TITLE CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture an MISL game as a chess match, with San Diego Socker Coach Ron Newman 
and Baltimore Blast Coach Kenny Cooper as masters. 
</P>
<P>
And then imagine a game in which the difference between victory and defeat is a 
lowly pawn unwittingly assuming the role of a major player. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened Thursday when the Blast ended the Sockers' slim hopes of 
winning the Major Indoor Soccer League regular-season title with a 3-2 overtime 
victory, Baltimore's fifth in eight tries against the Sockers this season. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a bold move or a cunning defensive strategy that saddled the Sockers 
with their 10th loss in 12 overtime games. The game was ultimately decided by, 
of all things, a botched line change. 
</P>
<P>
Domenic Mobilio scored his 36th goal of the season 7:33 into sudden death 
overtime as the Blast (28-19) reduced the Sockers (25-21) from a would-be title 
contender to a team fighting to remain in second place. 
</P>
<P>
Mobilio sneaked behind Socker defender Kevin Crow at the right goal post and 
poked Carl Valentine's crossing pass past goalkeeper Victor Nogueira for the 
game-winner with three seconds remaining in a bench penalty assessed the 
Sockers for having too many men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stupid penalty," said Newman, who was deprived of his 200th career 
MISL victory. "They didn't win the game; we gave it to them. We gave the goal 
away and we gave the game away." 
</P>
<P>
With two games left in the season, San Diego is only a game-and-a-half ahead of 
the third-place Dallas Sidekicks (23-22). The Sockers play at Kansas City 
Saturday before returning to the Sports Arena Sunday for the regular season 
finale against Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
Zoran Karic caused the bench penalty 5:36 into overtime. He reached the bench 
at the end of his shift, but turned around and crossed the touch line on his 
way back onto the field when Blast midfielder Kai Haaskivi corralled a loose 
ball in front of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Sockers, Karic's replacement, Alan Willey, was already on 
the field. When Haaskivi heard a whistle for a foul and saw four blue shirts 
surrounding him, he instinctively threw up his hands pleading with referee Gino 
Dippolito for an illegal procedure call. 
</P>
<P>
"I raised my hand when I heard a whistle and started screaming 'six," Haaskivi 
said. "I didn't know whether they had six players (on the field) or not, but 
with four of their guys standing around me, it was worth a chance." 
</P>
<P>
"I was already on the field when I heard someone yell, 'Get off," Karic said. 
"But it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Karic, however, could have shared the blame for the loss with Crow, whose 
defensive lapses were just as costly and more evident. 
</P>
<P>
Besides not paying attention while Mobilio snuck behind him to score the 
game-winner, Crow's inability to trap a ball against his chest allowed the 
Blast to tie the game at 2-2 1:08 into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne intercepted and attempted back-pass to Crow when the ball bounced off 
Crow's chest. Byrne then split Crow and Gus Mokalis at the top of the penalty 
area and beat Nogueira to the right post with a 20-foot shot for his 25th goal 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wittman gave the Blast a 1-0 lead with a shorthanded goal 2:41 into the 
second period. It was Wittman's seventh shorthanded goal of the season, an MISL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sockers didn't retreat. Newman patiently moved the offense up a notch 
at a time and the offense finally clicked when Karic and Waad Hirmez scored 
just 2:27 apart in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Karic tied the game when his shot off the crossbar hit Blast goalkeeper Slobo 
Ilijevski in the back and bounced behind him and into the net 7:28 into the 
third period. It was Karic's 33rd goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers took their first lead of the game at 9:55 when Hirmez scored his 
26th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But Baltimore came back to score the final two goals for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Newman had a warning for Cooper, whom he brought to the United States from 
England 21 years ago to tend goal for the Dallas Tornado of the North American 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because they won the (regular season) championship doesn't mean a thing," 
Newman said. "It doesn't guarantee them a thing come the playoffs."

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SWEETWATER OUTLASTS SOUTHWEST, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every ounce of confidence Southwest High had built up before it played 
Sweetwater in a Metro Conference baseball game Thursday was reinforced after 
the first inning when the Raiders scored five runs to get the early jump. 
</P>
<P>
But after the second inning, that confidence was stripped away as the host Red 
Devils defeated Southwest, 6-5, scoring the winning run on a walk in the bottom 
of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost this because of a lack of confidence," Southwest Coach Tom Hernandez 
said. "They still don't know they can play. They got a big lead, then went to 
sleep and couldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who played their third consecutive eight-inning game, may have 
dozed a bit, but the hitting and pitching performance of Sweetwater pitcher 
Isaac Bruce (3-3) was enough to wake even the heaviest of sleepers. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce had a disastrous first inning in which he gave up three hits, walked 
three and gave up five runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Lorenzo (Ruelas) warming up," Bruce said, "and I thought that if I 
didn't get my act together, I'm going to get pulled." 
</P>
<P>
So, sandwiched between two Southwest doubles, one in the second inning and one 
in the eighth, Bruce got his act together by retiring 18 batters. His 13 
strikeouts are a career high and a school record. 
</P>
<P>
"After he got out of the second (inning), he was OK," Sweetwater Coach Jim Mann 
said. "I was ready to pull him, but it was early and we decided to force the 
mistakes and just let them play." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce was an additional menace at the plate, where he was two for five, 
including a triple, scored twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Southwest's five runs were scored on Enrique Gurrola's triple to the 
center-field fence. Southwest is 2-1, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (2-2, 7-8) scored three runs on three hits in the third inning and 
two runs on two hits in the fourth to tie it up. In the eighth, the Red Devils 
collected four hits before Southwest freshman pitcher Victor Caracoza (3-1) 
walked in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Coronado 8, Hilltop 1 -- Catcher Ted Forney went four for four with two doubles 
and three RBIs to lead Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Vista 2, Torrey Pines 1 -- Vista's John Land allowed three hits and struck out 
seven, and his counterpart John Finley allowed just two hits and struck out 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel 11, Orange Glen 7 -- Marcus Lee's three-run homer keyed an eight-run 
second inning for Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasquel 7, Carlsbad 3 -- Mike Escarcega (7-1) threw a complete game and 
helped himself by going two for three with two RBIs for San Pasquel (12-4, 
3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Ramona 9, Oceanside 6 -- Ramona pitcher Chris Gunnett (1-1) and Ty Wilson each 
hit three-run homers. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 13, El Camino 2 -- Jason Schmeiser went three for four, Jon 
Robirds hit a home run and Robert McLeod went three for three to lead Rancho 
Buena Vista (2-2, 9-7). 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park 15, Marian 4 -- Benji Gil went three for four with five RBIs and 
Joe Carrillo (6-0) struck out 11 in five innings to lead host Castle Park 
(18-2-1, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
Softball 
</P>
<P>
Vista 1, Torrey Pines 0 -- Vista senior Kelli Schott (10-2) threw a perfect 
game and struck out 13. Schott has allowed just two earned runs this season.

MEMOIR OF A DISTORTED ADOLESCENCE IN BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaving Brooklyn by Lynne Sharon Schwartz (Houghton Mifflin: $15.95; 146 pages) 
</P>
<P>
To the precocious 15-year-old narrator of this novelized memoir, Brooklyn is as 
much a burrow of the spirit as a borough of New York, and she has no intention 
of allowing herself to be trapped in its cozy depths. Insular, parochial and 
full of contented philistines, Brooklyn in the 1950s is clearly no place for a 
burgeoning writer like Audrey. To relive her parents' lives among the 
tree-lined streets of Flatbush is the most terrible fate she can imagine, and 
her every waking minute is devoted to avoiding the destiny her family most 
desires for her. To her mother, that means settling down and marrying a 
suitable young man from an identical background. Even the word settle chills 
her blood. 
</P>
<P>
An injury to her eye has given her a distorted view of the world, and she makes 
the most of it, turning a disability into a unique advantage. "The eye was of 
scant use in seeing what had to be seen in daily life in Brooklyn. It was made 
for another sort of vision. . . . Its world was a Seurat painting, with the 
bonds hooking the molecules all severed, so that no object really cohered; the 
separate atoms were lined up next to one another, their union voluntary, not 
fated." That's precisely the sort of union Audrey seeks in her own life, and 
her damaged eye becomes the inadvertent means of achieving it. 
</P>
<P>
From earliest childhood, Audrey possesses a special kind of double vision, "not 
simultaneous. Alternate." She can close her normal eye and see the world in a 
secret way, as unconnected components; a view not vouchsafed to anyone else. To 
her family and schoolmates, the world is all of a piece; to Audrey, it offers 
infinite possibilities for recombination. This flawed eye becomes the central 
symbol of the book, not only providing the author with metaphor, but with the 
pivotal incident that serves as plot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clumsy Lenses 
</P>
<P>
When Audrey is 15, contact lenses have just come into use -- not the delicate 
membranes we have now, but clumsy plastic bubbles covering the entire cornea. 
Her mother, eager to alleviate the one flaw in her otherwise perfect daughter, 
arranges an appointment with one of the few contact-lens specialists then 
practicing in Manhattan, and Audrey reluctantly cooperates. The lens is 
uncomfortable; difficult to insert and remove, but the ophthalmologist is 
uncommonly patient and gentle. Her initial trepidation quickly vanishes, and 
soon she's actually looking forward to her trips across the Brooklyn Bridge to 
the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Professional tenderness rapidly escalates into caresses and then into mutual 
seduction; a progression that Audrey does nothing to stop, accepting the sexual 
act as passively as she did the lens itself. Her peculiar vision allows her to 
see these passionate afternoons on the doctor's sofa as completely isolated 
from the rest of her daily life, just as she could see "a piece of face or the 
leg of a table or frame of a window . . . break off and drift away." Now as an 
adolescent, she toys with the ophthalmologist the way she used to play with her 
physical surroundings, an illusion to be summoned and dismissed at will. When 
she realizes that the man has actually become infatuated with her, she ends the 
relationship as casually as she let it begin. "He had no right to feel that way 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Skewed Perspective 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally still a child, she finds a child's solution by simply flushing the 
lens down the toilet, but the doctor refuses to be disposed of so summarily. He 
insists upon seeing her again, and only then does Audrey begin to understand 
how the world must look to everyone else. By then, of course, she has begun to 
leave the conventions of Brooklyn far behind, though it will be some time yet 
before she knows herself to be absolutely out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
Seen entirely from the author's skewed visual perspective, neither Brooklyn nor 
the other characters in the book quite come into focus. Schwartz's relentless 
use of the eye metaphor eventually deprives the book of the peripheral view 
necessary to a novel. In the end, "Brooklyn" is everywhere and anywhere; the 
writer's family is generic. With the crucial distinctions blurred, "Leaving 
Brooklyn" becomes solely a matter of losing one's innocence, something that 
happens even to adolescents with perfect binary vision.

CLOTHESLINES: SCARLETT'S DRESS: SEWN WITH THE WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYLOU LUTHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Now that I've been invited to a golden anniversary party for "Gone 
With the Wind," I'm interested in the pattern for the Scarlett O'Hara barbecue 
dress you wrote about some time ago. Is it still available? Where? I would 
really prefer the green velvet drapery dress, but if I remember correctly that 
famous gown is not available. Can you help? -- W.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The green velvet dress Scarlett made from the portieres at Tara -- 
arguably one of the most famous movie dresses of all time and the only one to 
figure in the plot -- is now available in pattern form. 
</P>
<P>
This screen gem comes to you from the folks who brought you Scarlett's barbecue 
dress, which is still available for $27. According to Janet Burgess of Amazon 
Drygoods, 2218 E. 11th St., Davenport, Iowa 52803, the dress follows the 
original Walter Plunkett design so faithfully it requires the same 31 yards of 
green velvet. The multisize pattern (Sizes 10-20) is priced at $29.75 plus $2 
for shipping, and it represents the 750th pattern in Burgess' "Patterns from 
Historie" collection. 
</P>
<P>
Ready-made hoops and hoop patterns also are available, and a kit for the hat is 
in the works. Burgess says that the kit, which is not yet priced, includes a 
buckram hat form and the same variety of feathers and fringe used in the 
original. About the only things that will not be authentic, says Burgess, are 
the chicken feet Plunkett used in the front and back of the original hat. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours are made of rubber," she reports, adding that her next "Gone With the 
Wind" pattern will be Rhett Butler's frock coat, which she hopes to have ready 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter gave me a very expensive sequin dress with lots of pearls and 
crystal beads. I want it to last for years as I can't afford to replace it 
myself, and would like to know how to care for it. I put it on a hanger, and my 
daughter said I should fold it and lay it in a plastic box. I followed her 
instructions, but the box made it sweat so I took it out and put it back on the 
hanger. What do I do now? -- I.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: Take it off the hanger immediately! This can cause stretching and sagging 
and will put undue stress on the fabric at the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
You were right to take your dress out of the plastic box, as the moisture would 
eventually have promoted mildew and fabric deterioration. Fabrics must breathe. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to receive a free brochure telling exactly how to preserve 
your gown, write to Jerry Goldstone, Museum Textile Cleaners Inc., 19343 
Londelius St., Northridge, Calif. 91324. Goldstone does work for the costume 
and textile curators at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His brochure is 
also valuable for brides-to-be interested in preserving their gowns after the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one tip: "Never seal the box in which the gown is placed. It should be 
checked after cleaning and then periodically inspected and refolded to prevent 
the accumulation of fold marks." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstone also recommends storage in acid-free boxes, using acid-free tissue 
paper. He sells such boxes (40-by-18-by-6 inches) for $25.

ANOTHER ROAD HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article on March 30 encouraging your readers not to ignore traffic 
citations was well intended, I am sure, but failed to address a problem that my 
experience suggests may be quite serious ("Avoiding Jam: Act Fast on Traffic 
Tickets" by Lynn Simross). A few months ago I received notification that I had 
illegally parked in San Francisco and was ordered to pay the appropriate fine. 
This notwithstanding the fact that I had not been to San Francisco for some 
years and on the day of the alleged offense my car was at least 500 miles away 
from the site. 
</P>
<P>
I called the court of jurisdiction and was informed that such errors were 
frequently made and that the record would be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
I still have not received such confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
My concern was triggered by the experience of my stepdaughter who by mail 
received a similar citation from the City of Oakland, a city she has never had 
the pleasure of visiting and on a day when she and her automobile were both 
here in Southern California. She attempted to correct the error by mail and 
after receiving no reply to numerous letters she assumed the matter was over. 
</P>
<P>
Much to her surprise when she attempted to register her automobile she was told 
she had outstanding warrants and would be unable to do so until the fines and 
additional penalties were paid. After pursuing it as far as she could without 
incurring further expense and inconvenience, she finally gave in and paid the 
total amount in order to register her vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of my phone calls to San Francisco, I was told that 5,000 to 
10,000 parking citations are issued daily and that approximately 1,000 to 1,500 
of them are manifest in error. No mention was made of efforts to correct these 
errors on the part of the authorities and my questions about that were left 
unanswered. One wonders how many thousands of dollars are being extracted from 
innocent motorists who lack the time or knowledge to seek justice. The lack of 
concern about my inquiries makes me wonder if these citations are truly errors 
or perhaps part of a scam perpetrated by people in the court offices or by the 
cities themselves who know that correction of these erroneous tickets will not 
be pursued.

STATION TO GIVE LISTENERS A FEELING FOR 'BIG ONE' AND ITS IMPACT ON SAN DIEGO 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is every Californian's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually the entire Pacific Beach area looks like it's been hit by a 
tornado," an excited KFMB-AM reporter tells listeners. "I can see damaged 
buildings everywhere. We flew over the harbor area a couple of minutes ago . . 
. . It looks like thousands of gallons of fuel is spilling into the bay . . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 10 a.m. today, KFMB-AM (760) listeners will hear a reporter say 
those words, part of a frightening game of "what if . . . ?" the station will 
play with San Diegans. It will present a half-hour, Orson Welles-type program 
depicting the effects of a major earthquake on San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale has never hit modern San 
Diego. If it does -- when it does, some experts say -- portable radios could be 
the public's only link to the world. The Emergency Broadcast System, with a 
shrill tone that annoys listeners when periodically tested by stations, will 
bring current information to listeners. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, KFMB will use the Emergency Broadcast System in much the way it 
would be used in a real emergency, warning listeners that important information 
is to follow. The broadcast will feature the recorded voices of San Diego 
schools Supt. Tom Payzant, county Supervisor Susan Golding and Sheriff John 
Duffy, as well as representatives of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, Pacific 
Bell, retail establishments and KFMB reporters. Each will play a role similar 
to those they would fill if a major earthquake did strike San Diego. Every two 
minutes a message 
</P>
<P>
will remind listeners that the broadcast is only a dramatization. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program might frighten some and entertain others, its primary 
purpose is to educate. The severity of the quake is based on worst-case 
estimates of movement along the Rose Canyon fault line, believed to be the most 
threatening to San Diego County, according to Steve Danon, operations officer 
with the San Diego County Office of Disaster Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the broadcast stems from a similar program produced by the Los 
Angeles-based KHJ-AM (now KRTH) a few years ago. Danon heard the broadcast when 
he was an employee of the city of San Fernando, and he wanted to try to 
recreate it when he moved to San Diego in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"It adds a sense of realism to emergency exercises," Danon said. A radio 
broadcast provides "the opportunity to get a lot of people to step back and 
think. The only thing with more impact is an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
However, Danon was unable at first to interest a local radio station in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I forgot about it," Danon said, after he had been turned down or ignored by 
three stations. "I figured it was never going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Danon's attitude changed when KFMB's Cliff Albert called him. A few years 
earlier, Albert and KFMB had produced "Bethlehem Report," a dramatization of 
the birth of Jesus Christ as covered by modern radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to do something like this," Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
Danon had the KRTH broadcast transcribed, then rewrote the script. However, 
when he asked KRTH for permission to use it, he was turned down. When Albert 
said KFMB would gladly give KRTH credit, they were told no again. 
</P>
<P>
KRTH's stubbornness forced a complete rewrite of the script, after it had 
already been sent out to the various agencies for revisions and final approval. 
It fell to Albert to write a new, final script. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a matter-of-fact look at an earthquake. Traffic reporter Steve 
Springer tells of collapsed roads. A SDG&amp;E spokeswoman explains the dangers 
of fallen power lines and gas leaks. With Scripps Hospital in La Jolla severely 
damaged, a County Emergency Medical Services spokeswoman tells listeners about 
plans to evacuate patients to Orange County. A representative of a department 
store assures listeners his store is still open for business. 
</P>
<P>
Albert said KRTH's script was geared more toward sensationalism than education, 
with screaming people and dead bodies spread around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our revision was more subdued," Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the script is to give people practical information should an 
earthquake strike, in addition to steps they can take to prepare for such a 
disaster. Danon's office sent letters about the program to the principals of 
local schools, hospital administrators, every city in the county and every 
county department head. The schools also received a brochure, "Almost 
Everything You Wanted to Know About Earthquakes . . . but Were Too Shook Up to 
Ask." County Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey has directed all county 
employees to tune in. 
</P>
<P>
At last Thursday's taping of the show, the mood was light. Participants, jammed 
into a small conference room, joked about the feigned hysteria called for in 
the script. Sound effects would be added later. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was an underlying seriousness to the event. The next day an 
earthquake centered in the Newport Beach area vividly reminded everyone 
involved of the immediacy of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"If an earthquake hits, people could be without electricity. It's important 
that people be prepared to deal with that," said SDG&amp;E spokeswoman Karen 
Duncan, a program participant. "When the real thing hits, there is not going to 
be time to go out and buy flashlights and batteries." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's broadcast won't signal the end of the project. Danon hopes to use the 
same script in a simulated earthquake exercise, complete with slide show, that 
his department is developing. 
</P>
<P>
"This has an opportunity to reach a lot of the public and generate a lot of 
interest," Danon said. 
</P>
<P>
The only real danger is that it might create too much interest Friday morning, 
that some listeners may mistake it for a real emergency in much the same way of 
Welles' infamous "War of the Worlds" broadcast. KFMB originally planned to run 
a disclaimer every 60 seconds, before finally settling on running it every two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought every 60 seconds would be too much of an intrusion," Albert said. 
"We can accomplish the same thing without sending anyone into the streets in 
fear."

PREVIEW: METAL OR PUNK? NOT EVEN HEADBANGERS KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To parents, the lines between punk and metal have always been blurred -- it 
always just sounded like noise. Lately, though, even kids are having trouble 
sorting out the labels. Hardcore fans turn up at speed metal shows, especially 
if Slayer or Metallica is playing, while bands with punk roots (DRI, 
Crumbsuckers) have converted lifelong metalheads. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Basically, metal guitarists discovered the joys of playing fast 
. . . real fast, and hardcore musicians started exploring metal riffs and liked 
what they found. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it was really weird seeing a bunch of metal bands playing faster," 
Excel's Dan Clements said by phone from the Venice skate shop where he works. 
Formerly a member of the hardcore band Chaotic Noise, Clements now is in a 
group that even he has trouble classifying. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Clements and fellow Chaotic Noise alumnus Adam Siegel, Excel is 
often associated with Suicidal Tendencies, the best-known group of the Venice 
skate metal/hardcore scene. Suicidal's Mike Muir is credited as executive 
producer on Excel's first album, "Split Image," and when he's not in the 
studio, Clements works in the Suicidal-owned skate shop in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to Excel, and you'll hear the influence of thrash producer Randy Burns 
(Megadeth, Nuclear Assault). He produced both "Split Image" and Excel's second 
album, "The Joke's on You," to be released April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Siegel's guitar riffs are heavier than the Suicidal sound, and, as if to 
emphasize the differences between the bands, Clements also works for skateboard 
star Tony Alva, who owns Alva Skates and is considered by many to be the 
arch-enemy of Suicidal Tendencies. It's all part of Clements' way of defying 
classification and staying neutral. "One thing I respect is seeing a band like 
Jane's Addiction -- they used to play to punk crowds, but they never took a 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Excel doesn't take sides either. Individuality and fighting hypocrisy are 
common themes in Clements' song lyrics. "People sing about politics, people 
sing about the devil, people sing about nuclear war -- they're always thinking 
they know more than everybody else about something," Clements said. "But when 
people read my lyrics they can't say they disagree with what I write." 
</P>
<P>
 Excel, Candlemass, Steel Prophet and Visual Discrimination appear at 7:45 
tonight at the Country Club, 18415 Sherman Way, Reseda. Tickets are $12. For 
information, call (818) 881-5601.

<P>
GERMANI HOPES CONCERT WILL END IDENTITY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although Al Germani Dance Company has made the rounds of low-tech venues over 
the past year, it has yet to make an official debut on the concert scene. That 
will change when the San Diego-based troupe performs its "Premiere Concert" at 
Westminster Church tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Germani, who described the company as a "postmodern contemporary jazz dance 
troupe," said he founded the group as a proving ground for his own 
choreographic voice. The transplanted Easterner, with seven years of experience 
teaching, dancing and choreographing in San Diego, said his approach to dance 
making emphasizes "the development of expressionistic choreography which 
reflects as well as affects the social conscience of its viewing audience." 
</P>
<P>
Sound pretentious? Perhaps, but, as Germani noted, his message is emotional, 
not political. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to make people experience feelings," he said. "The dances don't 
necessarily tell a literal story. I just want the audience to put their own 
meaning on what they see." 
</P>
<P>
This pair of concerts will feature five dances -- some still termed works in 
progress -- and an all-female cast, because, as its creator noted, "it's a 
tough town to get men." 
</P>
<P>
Germani hopes this coming-out concert will solve his "identity crisis" in San 
Diego. "Since I teach jazz, people expect my work to look like commercial 
jazz," he said. "But it's really semi-modern -- everything after the masters." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take eight ballets out of 50 and expect to see everything," Eliot 
Feld acknowledged by phone from his New York studio. "But on this visit to San 
Diego, we're bringing a sampling that is really representative of the body of 
my work." 
</P>
<P>
The dances will speak for themselves beginning tonight, when the Feld Ballet 
kicks off a two-weekend residency that includes four public concerts and as 
many lecture demonstrations for local schoolchildren, all at Symphony Hall. 
Feld fans will have a field day with repertory works culled from two decades of 
dance making by the internationally acclaimed choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
"All the pieces, with the exception of one (Feld's jaunty crowd pleaser, 'The 
Jig Is Up') are new to San Diego," he said. "Two are this year's." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have observed changes in Feld's oeuvre in recent years, most notably a 
more balletic slant, but the busy iconoclast dismisses questions about the 
evolutionary development of his dances. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at an overview of what I've done. I'm only concerned about what 
interests me now -- the next work. I feel my juices getting going to start 
something new as soon as I get back." 
</P>
<P>
Expect to see "The Consort," a dance of manners that harks back to 1970; 
"Petipa Notwithstanding," Feld's fusion of modern and Petipa-style classical 
ballet, and the recent "Love Song Waltzes," which traces the bumpy road of 
romantic love through complex motional patterns juxtaposed against a Brahms 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Feld's marathon 10-day sojourn in San Diego is unprecedented for an imported 
dance troupe. But Suzanne Townsend of San Diego Performances says it's only the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Our vision of a presenter goes beyond being an intermediary to book 
attractions," she said. "These artists are valuable resources to the community, 
and we want to facilitate their interaction with the public as much as possible 
-- with student performances and master classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do it with every company, but it's our intention to have a minimum of 
two companies a year for extended residencies," she said. "And we'd eventually 
like to commission works to be performed here, like Orange County did with 
(American Ballet Theatre's) 'Swan Lake.' It's all part of our artistic mission 
for this community." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Unlimited's return to Sherwood Auditorium in La Jolla this weekend will 
give dance enthusiasts another choice for its already-burgeoning dance card. 
The San Diego-based jazz ensemble will feature something old and something new 
on the program when it dances its two-concert series tonight and tomorrow 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing two premieres and one adaptation as part of our six-piece 
program," director Patricia Rincon said. "All of us (Jazz Unlimited veterans) 
are getting up there in age, so we have added a young man, Terry Lindley, to 
the ranks. He's never worked on a concert stage and his technique is not that 
developed, but he's a natural. Today, most of the jazz dancers think L.A. punk 
is all there is to jazz dance. They're only trained in the trendy styles, but 
our background is more general." 
</P>
<P>
That's why eclectic Kelley Grant, who chalked up a bevy of credits on Broadway 
and in the modern dance arena, is still a hot number at Jazz Unlimited after 
eight years in the fold. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so nice to have a mature dancer with savvy on stage," Rincon said. "And 
Kelley is so versatile." 
</P>
<P>
Local dance buffs will see this unique combination of old and new when Grant 
and Lindley team up for the debut of a duet by Margaret Marshall. Barry Bernal, 
fresh from his appearance at the Academy Awards show, will hog the limelight 
twice this weekend, once as lead dancer in "Za Za" and again for "Pictures 
Without Words." 
</P>
<P>
North County dancers will get into the act this weekend as well. The Palomar 
College Dance Ensemble is due to perform four concerts at the college between 
Friday and Sunday. As usual, Palomar will present a potpourri of styles for its 
spring concert, from ballet to tap and show dance. Featured on this program is 
an original modern dance based on the plight of the homeless.

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: A RICH VIEW THROUGH 'LIVING ROOM WINDOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LEWINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every now and then, an artist hits the bull's eye, or nearly does. Such is the 
case with Kathy Shiroki's "Living Room Window," a visually rich, gently 
feminist project at Installation in downtown San Diego. The artist worked with 
15 other women on the project. 
</P>
<P>
A Zen koan-like text wraps around the large central gallery and defines the 
work's theme in metaphor with words made of letters formed by forks, spoons, 
knives, carrot peelers, whisks, can openers, drain stoppers and measuring cups. 
"When she went on walks" the text reads, "all she took with her was the living 
room window. She carried it on her back and when she got tired she balanced it 
on top of her head. She walked for miles with her eyes tightly closed balancing 
the framed glass until her neck felt like it was sinking into her chest. Only 
then would she lower the window, prop it by her feet and stare through it to 
see where she was." 
</P>
<P>
In its way, this is a beautiful lament on the usual human condition, 
potentially both female and male, especially if office is substituted for 
living room and he for she. 
</P>
<P>
A second element of the piece consists of hundreds of small blue plastic slide 
viewers of the type suitable for hanging on a key chain. These dangle from the 
ceiling on monofilament, forming a cloud of blue rectangles waist high to 
shoulder high in front of the text on the walls. A pathway leads through the 
middle of the cloud, allowing easy access to the single image within each 
viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Here are photographs taken by fifteen women who are Shiroki's acquaintances and 
collaborators, and whose lives are her subject. The images are variously 
personal, domestic or work-oriented in character. Scenes of kitchens and their 
details abound, as do pictures of children and of offices. All the photographs, 
at the artist's request, were taken during a single day in these women's lives. 
What we see is human life as it's lived by most people: not all that great, not 
all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a group of framed, typewritten texts mounted near the entrance to the 
exhibit offers insight into who the 15 women involved in the project are. 
They're between the ages of 23 and 60; are married, single, or divorced; have 
or don't have children, and work as housewives or in various private or public 
sector jobs. Some of these women's comments about their experiences with the 
project also appear. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 26-year-old Megan, a bank teller who is divorced, wrote: "I'd like 
to believe that I lived each day relatively organized and simple. Taking 36 
slides was difficult to do because of that. It also showed me I wasn't as 
organized as I believed." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of the entire presentation, such a comment is filled with a 
poignancy that demonstrates the impact art can have on people not otherwise 
involved in its interests. It is this aspect of Shiroki's effort that 
constitutes its greatest strength. 
</P>
<P>
The one potential frustration with the project arises from the photographic 
naivete evident in the images in the little blue viewers. Even a bit of 
practice might have sufficiently developed the participants' awareness of how 
to use a camera to a point where these images might have been more expressive 
and communicative. As it was, however, Shiroki gave each woman a simple camera, 
a roll of film and said, "Go to it." Some people might consider this naive 
quality charming, even essential, but its cost to the impact of the work as a 
whole seems too high. 
</P>
<P>
Two other installations are on view concurrently with Shiroki's project. Mark 
Esquierdo and Kim Grady's "Sad Song for Piano and Ears" looks more like a sad 
song indeed for the eyes; a dark room encircled with dark shapes suggesting a 
burnt landscape or urban scene and smelling richly of linseed oil and 
turpentine. 
</P>
<P>
In Installation's bookstore, John Kannofsky replaces several of the shelves 
with new ones bearing a text that tells a story of life and death, symbiosis 
and conflict. On some of these shelves are wooden cubes, with photos on the 
front and assemblages of objects within, that further explore this theme as it 
relates to a large fig tree. The work is overwhelmed, however, by its bookstore 
context, in which business as usual is conducted. Work this sensitive deserves 
its own place. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibitions remain on view at Installation, 930 E St., through April 23, 
the last day of this year's ArtWalk. For additional information, call 232-9915.

CONGRESS VOTES CONTRA AID, SUPPORTING BUSH STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate and the House, seeking to end an era of bitter debate over 
Nicaragua, gave massive bipartisan endorsement Thursday to President Bush's 
plan for diplomatic pressure in Central America -- as well as $49.8 million in 
non-military aid for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-controlled House, which in earlier years blocked requests by the 
Reagan Administration for military aid to the Contras, approved Bush's 
compromise proposal by a lopsided vote of 309 to 110. The Democratic-led Senate 
approved the Administration's request by a vote of 89 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill tries to set in motion a united, single-voice policy," said House 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). "It ends military involvement and covert efforts 
to overthrow governments in our hemisphere . . . (and) it says to Nicaragua 
that we are very earnest about you fulfilling these commitments that you made 
to internal democratization." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a compromise, and not one that everybody believed was a good 
compromise," said a more skeptical Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the Senate minority 
leader. "We'll see how it works. If it doesn't work, we'll be back to revisit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"We have embarked upon a bipartisan approach with the Congress," White House 
spokesman Steve Hart said afterward. "We are very pleased with the vote and 
with this expeditious action by the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
The votes give President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III two 
tools that they had requested to get their new Central America policy off the 
ground: strong, bipartisan support in Congress and an assurance that the 
Contras will be kept alive for at least 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Baker, who devised their policy in an unusual round of negotiations 
with congressional leaders last month, have told Congress that their goal is to 
pressure Nicaragua's leftist government into holding "free and fair elections" 
next Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
If those elections are fair, and if the Sandinistas enact other democratic 
reforms, Bush and Baker have said that they would agree to disarming the Contra 
army, estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000 men, and resettling its members in 
Nicaragua or elsewhere in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Sandinistas refuse to reform their internal political system, Bush 
and Baker have told members of Congress that they may attempt to revive the 
Contras as a military force and seek aid for them to resume their war against 
the Managua regime. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in here that precludes the Administration from asking for 
military assistance for the resistance," Baker told a Senate subcommittee 
earlier this week. He added that he has little confidence that the Sandinistas 
will meet the U.S. demands for democratic reforms: 
</P>
<P>
"Their record is abysmal," he said. "They have not kept any of their promises. 
But we do have an opportunity here to focus public opinion, world opinion, on 
their failure to keep their promises." 
</P>
<P>
The compromise plan provides $49.8 million in U.S. aid for the Contras, to be 
used to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical assistance and non-military 
training. The Administration pledged that no aid would be granted to Contra 
forces that attempt offensive military operations or engage in human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The law also provides for $7.7 million to pay for transporting the goods, $5 
million to administer the program, and $4.2 million in medical aid to civilian 
victims of the eight-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
The aid for the Contras is intended to run for 10 months, until Nicaragua's 
scheduled Feb. 28 election day. But in an unusual feature that has caused 
controversy among legal scholars, Bush promised in a separate letter that he 
would halt the aid in November if any one of eight Democratic leaders in 
Congress objects to the way the policy is being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that was a key to the plan's adoption. "We probably could have 
gotten a six- or five-month deal (without Bush's promise). I think it's better 
to have a 10-month deal. . . . It strengthens our hand." 
</P>
<P>
Most members of Congress, both Republican and Democratic, praised the plan in 
tones ranging from grudging to positively lavish. 
</P>
<P>
But some conservative Republicans warned that it is a "sell-out" that will 
gradually lead to the Contras' disintegration and the consolidation of the 
Sandinistas' power in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicaragua is lost," mourned California Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-San Diego). "The 
hope of freedom is gone. The dark curtain of the Sandinista Gestapo has 
descended on Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Some liberal Democrats, on the other hand, condemned the plan as a way to keep 
the Contras alive and predicted that the Administration never would accept 
whatever reforms the Sandinistas enact. 
</P>
<P>
"This accord hinges on winks, nods and handshakes," said Rep. Thomas Foglietta 
(D-Pa.). "I'd really like to say I trust this new Administration, the Bush 
Administration, for reintegration of the Contras. But how can I when I read . . 
. that then-Vice President Bush played a role in supplying covert aid to the 
Contras?" 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to documents released in the trial of former White House aide 
Oliver L. North that showed Bush playing a part in an effort to persuade 
Honduras to help the rebels in 1985, when Congress had banned U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
More typical was the measured support of Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), one of 
the Contras' most flamboyant champions on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I support this bill on the theory that if you can't get dinner, take a 
sandwich and keep hope alive," Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY OF U.S. AID TO THE CONTRAS 
</P>
<P>
1981: Congress secretly approves $19 million in military aid for Nicaraguan 
Contras. Funds are managed by the CIA.

money cannot be used to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1983: Congress votes $24 million to aid the Contras through mid-1984. 
</P>

PLAN TO SELL JORDAN DOWNS PROJECT KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City housing officials said Thursday that they are abandoning controversial 
plans to sell the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts because there is no 
feasible way to do it. The Housing Authority's commission immediately voted to 
ask the federal government for at least $15 million in funds to renovate the 
aging, troubled facility. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Squier, acting director of the Housing Authority, said officials from the 
Housing and Urban Development Department have urged him to apply for the money 
as quickly as possible to begin a long-awaited modernization that was abandoned 
by Leila Gonzalez-Correa, the Housing Authority director who resigned last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that it would be very difficult to (sell) Jordan Downs," Squier 
said, given federal budget restrictions that preclude the Housing Authority 
from replacing the 700 apartments there with low-income housing elsewhere -- a 
requirement of federal law whenever a housing project is sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I have discussed Jordan Downs with HUD regional and local offices, and they 
have said, 'Come to us with what you need for (modernizing) Jordan Downs, and 
we will do everything we can to find the money,' " Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said he has been encouraged by HUD to ask for far more than the $15 
million needed to renovate the sagging, World War II-era buildings, and he said 
he intends to apply for several million dollars beyond that to create badly 
needed social programs and services over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Laundry Facilities 
</P>
<P>
The 3,150 people who live at Jordan Downs -- the vast majority of whom are 
single mothers and children -- have no laundry facilities or playgrounds. And 
residents have been forced to use hundreds of battered garbage cans scattered 
along the streets instead of being provided the large dumpsters that are 
required at apartment buildings elsewhere in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No on-site vocational training centers or other services to help residents 
break out of the cycle of poverty have ever been created by the city there 
despite years of discussion by top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only such program there now, a job-preparedness seminar to help 
people meet prospective employers, was conceived by state Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles). The program, known as Project BUILD, is funded by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just very, very, very happy about the new direction we see," said 
Claudia Moore, a tenant leader who for more than a year had butted heads with 
Gonzalez-Correa over her failure to upgrade Jordan Downs, Nickerson Gardens and 
other slum-like projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Fell Apart 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa resigned March 31 after her plan to sell Jordan Downs to a 
private developer fell apart. She had hoped to receive 700 federal rent subsidy 
certificates that could have been turned over to a private buyer to operate the 
dilapidated project, but Congress did not make the certificates available and, 
amid growing protests from tenants and others, her plan unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
Her closed-door decision last fall to pursue the sale idea -- which was backed 
by Mayor Tom Bradley but never revealed to the City Council -- prompted HUD 
last fall to withdraw $5 million in promised modernization funds that Jordan 
Downs residents had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, in a clear rebuke of the sale plan, the City Council voted 10 to 
0 to oppose the sale of Jordan Downs, and to urge HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to 
reinstate the $5 million lost by Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Covitz, Bradley's new appointee as chairman of the Housing Authority's 
commission, said Thursday that it is "certainly our feeling that this (decision 
to modernize Jordan Downs) is the best alternative at this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Goal 
</P>
<P>
Covitz noted that sometime down the line, there may be new discussion of 
selling the project to the tenants themselves -- a priority of officials in 
Washington who eventually want to transfer most public projects nationwide into 
the hands of the people who reside in them. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa's departure has given residents such as Moore new hope that the 
Housing Authority will work with tenants on ways to upgrade life in the 
projects. Gonzalez-Correa had been mired in an adversarial relationship with 
the tenants for well over a year, and tenants last spring demanded that Bradley 
seek her resignation.

WRIGHT TO MOUNT A FIGHT FOR HONOR; 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKER SAYS HE HAS 'CLEAR PROOF' OF INNOCENCE IN HOUSE ETHICS PROBE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A tearful Speaker Jim Wright, flanked by Democratic barons of the House, vowed 
Thursday to fight to preserve his reputation as "a person of honor" and to 
disprove the House Ethics Committee's findings that he had violated rules of 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Wright asked the House panel to allow him to appear personally as soon as 
possible to answer the charges against him. He declared that he would present 
"clear and convincing proof" that he is innocent of allegations that he 
improperly accepted gifts from a Texas business partner and evaded limits on 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from the committee, now in the final stages of 
deliberations on its 10-month investigation of Wright's financial affairs. It 
voted, 8 to 4, in closed session on Wednesday to file formal charges in the 
House based on the gifts and on income Wright earned from his 1984 book, 
"Reflections of a Public Man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Democrats Break Ranks 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Texas congressman's backers expressed anger and surprise that two 
Democrats on the 12-member panel -- Reps. Chester G. Atkins of Massachusetts 
and Bernard J. Dwyer of New Jersey -- joined the six Republicans to form a 
majority against the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats hinted privately that there would be a behind-the-scenes effort to 
persuade Atkins and Dwyer to reverse their positions on Wright's possible 
culpability before the committee issues its final report early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Even without any switches, however, leading Democrats said that the show of 
Democratic support for Wright demonstrated that his sometimes lonely battle has 
become a party cause, and that his chances for retaining his top House position 
are not lost. 
</P>
<P>
Crusty Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) echoed the fighting tone that Wright used at 
his press conference, telling reporters: "He's not wounded. He's not hurt. He's 
just cut a little. He's got some bruises. It doesn't mean you don't win the 
fight and stomp 'em to death." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.) took a more dispassionate approach, saying: "I 
think he becomes a liability, but I think he survives." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Wright made an emotional plea for support to a closed-door 
caucus of Democratic whips that one listener likened later to the famed 
courtroom orations of Clarence Darrow. "It was an incredible presentation, 
emotional and very skilled," the source said. "He was quite convincing." 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Wright delivered his public statement before reporters and 
television cameras in the Rayburn Room of the Capitol with more than 50 leading 
members of the House standing with him on the podium in a dramatic show of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Those who appeared with Wright included the entire House Democratic leadership, 
chairmen of powerful committees, leading conservatives and liberals and such 
well-known members as Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and veteran Rep. James 
H. Scheuer (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
They burst into prolonged applause when Wright, his voice breaking and his chin 
trembling with emotion, portrayed one of the charges against him as an attack 
on the integrity of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Betty, earned the $18,000 annual salary she received from an 
investment business owned by Wright and Ft. Worth developer George A. Mallick 
Jr., he insisted. It was not, as the panel concluded, a gift to him from an 
associate with an interest in federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional Defense of Wife 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is a good, decent, caring, thoroughly honorable person," Wright said 
as tears welled up in his eyes. "I'll damn well fight to protect her name from 
any challenge by any source, whatever the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Most of his 30-minute statement consisted of a lawyer-like rebuttal to the 
charges that his business partnership with Mallick was merely a sham designed 
to funnel money to the Wrights. He said it was a legitimate corporation that 
made small but "honorable" profits from 1979 until it was dissolved last year. 
</P>
<P>
House rules ban members from taking more than $100 from persons with an 
interest in congressional business. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker also disputed the committee's other charge that he evaded a House 
limit on outside income by channeling speaking fees into bulk sales of his book 
of speeches and essays. While there is a ceiling on speaking fees, royalty 
payments on books are exempt from any limits. 
</P>
<P>
Citing that exemption, Wright asserted that there was no violation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am 66 years of age -- 66 years of living and giving; striving and sometimes 
failing, and sometimes succeeding," Wright said. "I believe I have earned a 
reputation as a person of decency, and as a person of honor and as a person of 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that my wife deserves to be known in that way and that, to me, is the 
most important thing and the only really important thing. And for my good name, 
which is the legacy I intend to leave my children and my grandchildren, I will 
fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I possess," he said, his 
eyes moist from emotion as he concluded. Another burst of applause came from 
the Democratic supporters as Wright, refusing to answer any questions, shook 
hands with the throng as he left the room. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned after Wright's appearance, Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) predicted 
that Wright would survive a letter of criticism from the Ethics Committee in a 
House showdown, adding: "We're gonna win this. We're gonna circle the wagons 
and shoot the damn Indians." 
</P>
<P>
But other Democrats, who asked not to be identified, said that the crisis was 
far from over since the committee has said that it plans to release the full 
report made by Richard J. Phelan, the special counsel who shaped the charges 
considered by the panel. Details of Phelan's findings, expected to take a 
particularly critical view of Wright's conduct, could further inflame the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) said that the panel 
probably would make no public statement on the allegations "until early next 
week." He added: "Early next week could be Monday or Tuesday, I would think no 
later than Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Wright then would be given an opportunity to present his defense. Afterward, 
the panel, known officially as the House Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct, would vote on whether to convene a disciplinary hearing to decide what 
punishment to recommend to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, three Democrats circulated a letter to all members of the House 
asking the panel to release only supporting material relating to charges 
against Wright which it has decided to endorse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern on Due Process 
</P>
<P>
"To ask a member, any member, to respond in the court of public opinion to 
allegations, rumors and innuendo not deemed worthy of charge by the committee 
would be totally unfair and a perversion of due process," said the letter 
signed by Reps. Dave R. Nagle (D-Iowa), Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Jim 
Moody (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
In his public statement, Wright said that the allegations against him primarily 
involve rules technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not accused of any personal immorality, or any dishonesty or any misuse of 
tax dollars," he said. "I'm accused of three issues concerning my personal 
finances and the technical reporting requirements of the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
The allegation that Wright improperly accepted gifts is based on the income 
Mrs. Wright received from 1981 through 1984 from Mallightco, a Wright-Mallick 
investment partnership that has been dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, she received more than $72,000 in salary and other 
benefits, including the use of a condominium in Ft. Worth and a 1979 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lists Wife's Duties 
</P>
<P>
Wright has contended that his wife earned her salary by advising Mallick on 
real estate and stock investments but Phelan has alleged that she worked only 
12 days in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of that allegation is compounded by Phelan's contention that 
Mallick had a direct interest in legislation involving savings and loans, oil 
and gas development and an economic development grant for the Ft. Worth 
stockyards. 
</P>
<P>
The other charge alleges that Wright, to evade the House limits on honorariums 
that members can receive, encouraged sponsors of some of his speeches to buy 
bulk quantities of his book rather than pay him a speaking fee outright. 
</P>
<P>
Under House rules, a member cannot receive more than $2,000 for making a 
speech, and his total annual honorariums cannot exceed 30% of his government 
salary.

COURT HAS LAST WORD IN SPELLING BEE: BOY LOSES

<P>
"As for the judgment of the trial court," appellate Judge Arthur Gilbert ruled, 
"we'll spell it out: A-F-F-I-R-M-E-D." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, of the 2nd District state Court of Appeal, on Wednesday was upholding 
a lower court's decision against Leonard McDonald of Thousand Oaks, who 
contended that his son was robbed of a spelling bee championship. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald claimed that his son, Gavin, then 13, lost the 1987 Ventura County 
Spelling Bee because officials of the sponsoring Ventura Star Free Press 
allowed two students from Los Altos School in Camarillo to advance to the 
spell-off instead of just one. 
</P>
<P>
In the Camarillo contest, Los Altos student Victor Wang had spelled H-O-R-S-Y 
and Steven Chen had spelled it H-O-R-S-E-Y. 
</P>
<P>
Judges ruled that Steven won, but Star Free Press officials said an 
unacceptable dictionary had been used. Because Webster's Third New 
International Dictionary deemed both spellings correct, a tie was declared. 
Both Victor and Steven were allowed to go to the spell-off. 
</P>
<P>
Steven went on to compete against Gavin McDonald in the countywide competition, 
beating him in the 27th round. 
</P>
<P>
Young McDonald's father argued in his suit that Steven should not have been 
allowed to compete in the county finals. He asked for $2 million in damages, 
naming the newspaper, the paper's editor at the time and Scripps Howard 
Newspapers, which conducts the national spell-offs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the unfair treatment caused Gavin to lose his standing in 
the community and suffer "humiliation, indignity, grief, fright and mental 
anguish." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Yegan dismissed the case in 
November, 1987. The McDonalds appealed. 
</P>
<P>
In upholding Yegan's action, appellate Judge Gilbert had a few things to say 
about frivolous lawsuits. He pointed out that the reason Gavin lost was that he 
finally misspelled a word. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin, who placed first in the 1986 county competition, but came in second in 
1987, "has much to be proud of," Gilbert wrote. "He participated in a spelling 
bee that challenged the powers of memory and concentration . . . It is this 
lawsuit that is trivial." 
</P>
<P>
He said the case was "so lacking in merit" that he considered imposing 
sanctions against Gavin's attorney, J. N. Wiedman, of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
The latter declined comment, saying he had not yet seen the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Nor could officials at the Star Free Press be reached for comment Wednesday 
afternoon.

DRUG MONEY CASE SUSPECT REFUSED BAIL 
</P>

Chris Petti, a reputed organized crime figure who allegedly helped San Diego 
businessman Richard T. Silberman launder $300,000 offered by an undercover 
agent as Colombian cocaine proceeds, was ordered held without bail Thursday by 
a federal magistrate who called him a threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute hearing, U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee said prosecutors 
had persuaded him that Petti, 62, "is a danger to at least some portion of the 
community" and should remain in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
pending a preliminary hearing April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Petti's attorney, Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas, said he would appeal McKee's 
decision to a U.S. District Court judge on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jack Norman Myers of Los Angeles, the fourth individual charged in a 
money-laundering scheme allegedly directed by Silberman, surrendered and was 
arraigned before McKee on Thursday. Myers, 43, a man with a compact build, 
ruddy complexion and thick, graying hair, was allowed to remain free on a 
$100,000 personal surety bond to be secured by his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had asked that bail for Myers be set at $200,000. But McKee reduced 
the amount after Myers' attorney noted that his client has strong ties to Los 
Angeles -- including a 14-year-old son -- and continuing obligations at his 
Westwood business services firm, First Transnational Co. 
</P>
<P>
A federal affidavit says Myers and Darryl Nakatsuka acted as couriers for 
Silberman in two transactions involving a total of $300,000 -- money an 
undercover agent told them originated with Colombian drug traffickers. 
Nakatsuka, 42, of Pasadena, was arraigned Tuesday and is free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Myers, the former son-in-law of entertainment magnate Lew 
Wasserman, has known Silberman since the two raised funds for past campaigns of 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. His attorney, Barry Tarlow of Los Angeles, 
confirmed that relationship Thursday and said Myers and Silberman have "a long 
business history together" as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tarlow also said the 76-page affidavit "contains not a single word suggesting 
my client committed a crime. They have wiretaps. They have videotapes. If my 
client had done something wrong, wouldn't it be on there?" 
</P>
<P>
Tarlow said the government has shown no evidence that Myers believed the source 
of the funds to be drug trafficking: "It's not illegal to pick up and drop off 
money in this country. Not yet at least." 
</P>
<P>
Petti and Silberman, 59, were arrested a week ago and are charged with 
conspiring to launder money and failure to report a currency transaction to the 
government. FBI agents encountered Silberman, who is married to San Diego 
County Supervisor Susan Golding and is a former close adviser to Brown, during 
a 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti, who allegedly is an associate of a Mafia 
crime family in Chicago.

TALK IN OIL CLEANUP TURNS FROM SAVING SPILL AREA TO RESTORING WHAT'S BEEN LOST 
</P>

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incessant whir of helicopters and whine of small planes fill the air over 
Valdez these days, and a sign on the airport terminal door reminds people to 
remove oily boots before coming inside. 
</P>
<P>
In dingy motel rooms, scientists hunker over computers and squint at walls 
plastered with maps. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the water, shimmery ribbons and pudding glops of oil still taunt an 
ever-growing fleet of vessels and experts hired to clean up the worst oil spill 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez gushed millions of gallons of crude 
oil into Prince William Sound, the frantic battle has turned into a weary war. 
There is no longer talk of whether this fragile environment can be saved, but 
what can be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
"We're entering a new phase, and that's damage assessment," said Dr. William 
Evans, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus in the coming months and years will be to determine what will be 
necessary to restore or replace the fisheries and other natural resources that 
have been lost as a result of this spill," Evans told a news conference after 
arriving in Valdez on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new phase is one of painstaking detail and bungled bureaucracy, of manpower 
at its most tedious and machinery at its most sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
It is the phase where victories are measured by the number of oiled otters 
scrubbed clean with dish-washing detergent or by the number of feet of 
containment boom shielding a salmon hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severe Effects Expected 
</P>
<P>
Although long-term effects of the spill are expected to be severe, for now, at 
least, there is a feeling that the oil has taken its best shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not expecting further damage," said Ed Wieliczkiewicz, public affairs 
officer here for the U.S. Coast Guard, which is overseeing the spill response. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the armies of manpower and machinery, it is clear that nature so far 
has done more than man to heal the horrible wound. 
</P>
<P>
Wind and waves have churned the heavy black pool from the Good Friday spill 
into a thinner, far-flung spatter. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the state has identified more than 3,000 individual beaches or 
shorelines requiring cleanup, but has evaluated and given the go-ahead for work 
on only 44. 
</P>
<P>
Assessment of the soiled beaches includes archeological surveys and careful 
scheduling to avoid heavy activity during mating or reproductive seasons for 
any of the marine mammals or 30 species of birds in the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The rock-by-rock swabbing Exxon has undertaken at a few of the islands hit by 
the first thick wave of oil has proven inadequate, and tests involving 
high-pressure hoses were under way this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think beach cleanup will return Prince William Sound to its original 
condition," said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only mitigate the damage, not eliminate it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon agreed Thursday to put $15 million in escrow for damage assessment alone 
-- a sum Evans described as a mere "down payment" to the state and federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokeswoman Jan Cool said no figures were available for the overall cost 
of the cleanup so far. 
</P>
<P>
And while the company has set no target date to complete the monstrous task, 
nature has deadlines of her own in this frozen wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fairly short opportunity to work in the sound now before the weather 
changes in August or September," Kelso said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got this window between now and the end of summer and then, if the work 
is not completed, it will have to wait until next season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists say that the longer the delay, the tougher the job, since the 
oil is gradually solidifying onshore into hard, asphalt chunks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the toll of injured otters and birds is multiplying quickly enough 
to warrant a second rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game estimates that the 250 otters and 1,407 
birds reported dead represent only a "minuscule percentage of the animals being 
lost to this event." 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say they will never know the full extent of damage. Oiled birds may 
not die until they're inland, where their carcasses will provide poisoned 
picnics for bears and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
Some 11 million waterfowl and shore birds are expected to migrate through 
Prince William Sound in a few weeks, and the first humpback whales already have 
been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the birds will pass over the eastern edge of the sound without 
encountering the oil -- unless Alaska's fickle spring storms change the 
direction of the slick. 
</P>
<P>
Since the March 24 disaster, about 40% of the oil has evaporated or dispersed 
naturally. Barely 8% has been recovered by skimming or burning. The remaining 
oil appears to be split almost equally between Prince William Sound, the Gulf 
of Alaska and the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet super-skimmer is expected to arrive in about a week to help vacuum the 
water's surface, and Exxon continues to do trial applications of chemical 
dispersants on small patches of oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
110 Cleanup Vessels 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, according to Exxon, about 1,000 contractors are working on the 
cleanup effort. The arsenal also includes 110 vessels and dozens of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer scope of the task and the tangled string of state and federal 
agencies involved has resulted in snarls on virtually a daily basis: equipment 
being sent to the wrong site, workers idled for hours while waiting for 
instructions, precious time squandered on official forms or permits or 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you have a large operation with a number of agencies, there is going 
to be an opportunity for logistical problems," conceded Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Kelso puts it more bluntly: "There are lots of ways things can get screwed up."

13TH VICTIM OF DRUG, MURDER CULT UNEARTHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MATAMOROS, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the suspects in a cult of human sacrifice pointed out the grave of a 
13th body on Thursday and police ordered him to dig it up. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll do it with your hands if you have to," one officer told Sergio Martinez 
after the suspect was handed a pick and shovel. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 23, had been taken back to a ranch near Matamoros, where 12 bodies 
were unearthed Tuesday. He and other suspects have told authorities there were 
14 bodies buried on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic public confession Wednesday, some of the five suspects in custody 
said victims were put to death in rituals that were intended to provide a 
"magical shield" for members of a drug-smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
Under the gaze of police Thursday, Martinez dug up the grave and revealed the 
body of a man in his 30s. Martinez said the man had been buried about four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects have said they killed at the demand of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 
whom they called "godfather." They said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 
24, called the "witch," believed human sacrifices gave the members of the cult 
protection from harm. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito said that Constanzo, a Cuban who has 
contacts in Miami, was last seen Tuesday over the border in Brownsville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
A warning that Constanzo and Aldrete might be heading for Miami was read to 
police officers there at roll calls Thursday, but "at this time we're not 
taking any active stance on it," Detective Marie Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
New details continued to emerge about the cult leaders, who are said to have 
driven luxury cars and worn expensive clothes bought with drug profits. But 
while that description may fit the profile of a drug smuggler, details about 
Aldrete's life did not fit the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, Sara was leading a double life: as a witch in Mexico and as a 
dean's honor roll student at Texas Southmost College," sheriff's Deputy Carlos 
Tapia said. Texas Southmost College is a two-year college in Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete, a resident alien from Mexico, was a physical education major and was 
listed in the college's "Who's Who" directory in 1987-88.

The Illinois lottery jackpot jumped an additional $5 million on Thursday to $55 
million, approaching California's record U.S. lottery prize of $61.98 million 
with two days left before Saturday's drawing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois jackpot has risen $27 million since Saturday, when, for the third 
straight week, no one picked the six winning numbers from a field of 54. The 
payoff for last week's drawing would have been $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Lotto sales have broken records for four straight days, enabling us to boost 
the jackpot . . . and we hope to see more of the same, as Friday and Saturday 
are traditionally our strongest days," lottery director Sharon Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said lottery agents were handling more than 717,000 transactions an hour 
Thursday.

U.S. SATISFIED PLO WILL LIVE UP TO PROMISE ON ISRAEL, BAKER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, brushing aside statements attributed to 
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders calling for the destruction of 
Israel, said Thursday that the United States is satisfied the PLO will keep its 
promise to respect Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from a Senate subcommittee, Baker said that the United 
States will continue its dialogue with the PLO, despite Israel's assertion that 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's organization has not changed its determination to 
destroy Israel and create a Palestinian state in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks underlined continuing friction between the Bush Administration 
and the Israeli government about Washington's overture to the PLO. In a 
Thursday speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said that Arafat and his aides repeatedly have made 
clear that the PLO "intended not to coexist with Israel, but to achieve in 
stages what the Arab states had tried a number of times and failed to achieve 
all at once: the destruction of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
At the subcommittee hearing, Sen. Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) read Baker quotes from 
recent interviews with the PLO's "foreign minister," Farouk Kaddoumi, and 
Arafat's deputy, Abu Iyad, which implied that the PLO would not be satisfied 
with a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and would continue to 
fight for the eventual "liberation" of all of the former British mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the quotations, if accurate, are "not helpful. . . . We do look 
at statements such as that carefully because we want to make certain that our 
dialogue with the PLO is continued under the ground rules under which it was 
established, and that is recognition of Israel's right to exist and a 
repudiation of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, we are satisfied that the PLO is committed to what it has told us: 
that is, that it recognizes Israel's right to exist and has repudiated 
terrorism in all its forms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you can make that statement," Rudman said. "They (PLO leaders) 
say one thing in Arabic and something else in English, as if no one in the 
world could translate the two." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over PLO doctrine continued, although indirectly, at the ASNE 
meeting, where Shamir and PLO official Nabil Shaath were on the program. 
Shamir, who refused to follow Shaath on the program, spoke first. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir quoted from what he said was an interview that Shaath, the senior 
adviser to Arafat, gave March 28 to an Arabic language newspaper: "If we will 
gain independence on part of our land, we will not relinquish our dream of 
establishing a single, democratic state over all of Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
But Shaath insisted that the PLO no longer hopes to replace Israel and is 
prepared to accept a homeland limited to the West Bank and Gaza Strip although 
this is "a bitter pill for us." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said that Israel will never negotiate with the PLO. When a questioner 
reminded him that peace talks almost always involve parties that have been at 
war with each other, he said: "You know very well that we prefer always 
negotiations and we would like always to have negotiations instead of 
confrontations. But with these people, these people of the PLO, negotiations 
about peace are useless because you can see from these statements that they are 
not interested in peace. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want peace with us," he said. "Maybe they want peace, but without 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said that Israel will not go ahead with its plan for West Bank and Gaza 
Strip elections until the violence of the 16-month-old Palestinian uprising 
ends. He proposed the elections last week to select Palestinians to negotiate 
with Israel over conditions for limited self-rule in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Shaath called Shamir's proposal for West Bank and Gaza elections "an 
exhilarating idea." But he said that Palestinians will not participate unless 
Israel agrees to international supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said in testimony to the Senate subcommittee that the United States 
believes Israel should begin at once, before the end of the uprising, to 
discuss the conditions for the elections with Palestinian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also implied that there can be no elections without at least the tacit 
approval of the PLO. He said that U.S.-PLO dialogue "could be usefully 
utilized" to bring the PLO into the process in the face of Israel's refusal to 
negotiate with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a conciliatory gesture toward Israel, the State Department 
announced that it has begun a diplomatic effort to prevent the PLO from 
obtaining membership in the World Health Organization or other U.N.-affiliated 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is opposed to efforts to grant the PLO rights and privileges 
exceeding its status as an observer organization within the U.N. system," the 
department said in a written statement. "In our view, the self-declared 
Palestinian 'state,' which we do not recognize, does not meet the generally 
accepted international law criteria for statehood and thus does not qualify for 
membership in U.N. agencies."

TROOPS KILL 4 PALESTINIANS IN WEST BANK RAID

NAHHALIN, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli soldiers shot and killed at least four Palestinians in a pre-dawn raid 
on the hilltop village of Nahhalin on Thursday in the worst single clash of the 
Arab uprising this year. 
</P>
<P>
The incident highlighted the contrast between the almost daily violence inside 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the slow pace of peace moves in foreign 
capitals, where the United States is spearheading a step-by-step process aimed 
at setting up Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed at Nahhalin, a village of 2,000 residents not far from Bethlehem, 
came just after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ended a 10-day tour of 
the United States, during which he presented his own peace plans to the Bush 
Administration. Israeli officials, apparently reacting to a potential public 
relations problem, took the unprecedented step of convening domestic and 
foreign reporters to announce an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Villagers Say 6 Died 
</P>
<P>
Villagers said that six residents perished. Four dead could be confirmed at 
hospitals. Another victim, shot in the head, was brain-dead at Mokassed 
Hospital in Jerusalem and was expected to die at any time, doctors said. The 
estimates of the number wounded ranged from 11, the army's figure, up to 20. 
</P>
<P>
In Nahhalin, bloodstains were visible in a cemetery next to the village mosque, 
atop the roof of a house and in a field where the victims, mostly men in their 
20s, were hit. 
</P>
<P>
Fatma Shukarna, one of the wounded at Beit Jala Hospital, told reporters that 
she was shot in the back by a border policeman. After her uncle, Kamal, and a 
neighbor bundled her into a car to take her to a hospital, troops fired on 
them, too, wounding both Kamal and the neighbor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodiest incident of the 16-month-old Arab uprising occurred last 
December, when soldiers shot and killed eight Arabs during a violent funeral in 
the West Bank city of Nablus. In all, more than 400 Arabs have been killed in 
the uprising, known in Arabic as the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to get a complete account of Thursday's shootings. Villagers 
said that a unit from the army's border police entered Nahhalin, along the 
single road that runs through it, sometime after 3 a.m. The inhabitants had 
just finished a late-night breakfast that is common during the month of 
Ramadan, when Muslims fast during daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
From debris on the road, it appeared that the soldiers had to overcome numerous 
makeshift barricades to reach the town center. Often, such obstacles of 
boulders and trash slow the approach of soldiers so that townspeople can throw 
rocks and then retreat. 
</P>
<P>
When the troops reached the center of town, some took up positions in an 
unfinished house, witnesses said, and shot at villagers who were on the street 
or hidden in the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not like, for example, I hit him with a stone and he shoots back," said 
one excited local resident. "No! He just seeing and shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Omar Shukarna, who witnessed the shooting from his home nearby, added: "It was 
like a street war. There was no reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's version emphasized the danger in which the troops found themselves. 
Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the Israeli commander on the West Bank, said his men 
had gone to Nahhalin to arrest suspected stone-throwers who had harassed 
traffic on nearby roads. About 30 soldiers entered the town around 5 a.m., he 
said, and were met with "exceptional resistance." 
</P>
<P>
The border police, part of the army, were armed with tear gas, rubber bullets 
and regular metal rounds, he said. The shooting lasted for 45 minutes, Mitzna 
added, confirming that four Arabs died. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not in our interest to have casualties on the West Bank. On the 
contrary, casualties grease the wheels of the uprising," said Mitzna, who 
contended that leaders of the rebellion encourage Palestinians to get in harm's 
way in order to renew anti-Israeli fervor. 
</P>
<P>
The border police, who are trained in riot control, have been accused of 
brutality in trying to suppress the uprising. They were recently dispatched to 
several areas of the West Bank and Gaza to replace reserve army units, and 
there have been many recent Arab fatalities in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli commentators remarked that use of the border police served only 
to ease political pressure on the government, both from reservists who 
complained about serving in the occupied territories and from high-ranking army 
officers who warned that using the regular army as an occupation police force 
was eroding training and moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview last week, Meshulam Amit, the new head of the border 
police, responded to the accusations of brutality. He argued that his troops 
are "not trigger-happy," saying a border police officer opens fire only if "his 
life is in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, a Bethlehem stone-thrower shot in the back last week by a 
soldier died, setting off a small demonstration there.

The Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, who was once in line to succeed the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as Iran's supreme leader, is under house arrest in 
the holy city of Qom, a source in Tehran said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Montazeri's status came by telephone shortly after a Baghdad-based 
Iranian opposition group said Revolutionary Guards and security men had 
arrested relatives of Montazeri after his fall from grace.

TRADE DISPUTE WITH INDIA BRINGS ECONOMIC CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
NEPALESE BRACING FOR A 'GRIM YEAR' 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The menu was the simplest in more than two centuries at the royal banquet 
Thursday night as His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his deeply 
troubled Himalayan kingdom ushered in the Nepalese New Year. 
</P>
<P>
Few guests drove to the traditionally lavish function; most had to walk, 
because this year there has been no gasoline even for their limousines. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking it as a very grim year ahead of us -- not an auspicious one at 
all," said a senior official close to the king. "In fact, we were going to 
cancel all New Year's Day functions this year, but the astrologers felt it was 
very unlucky to make such total sacrifices on the first day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Astrology aside, the beginning of the year 2046 on the Nepalese calendar is not 
one of celebration for Nepal's 17 million citizens. A trade dispute with India 
that began March 23 has closed 13 of 15 land routes into the country and 
touched off critical shortages of gasoline, cooking oil, medicine, baby food 
and such staples as salt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Struggle for Survival 
</P>
<P>
For Nepal, a nation the size of North Carolina that ranks as the world's sixth 
poorest, the crisis has ballooned into a struggle for survival against what it 
pictures as an insensitive regional power that once was its closest ally. 
</P>
<P>
It has fueled a burgeoning nationalist movement here and provided propaganda 
material for some of India's other neighbors, whose media accuse South Asia's 
most powerful country of bullying. 
</P>
<P>
As the crisis deepens -- with peasants stoically waiting in lines for a few 
quarts of kerosene for cooking, and with heart and diabetes patients nearing 
death for lack of vital drugs -- independent economic analysts and many 
Nepalese are beginning to ask, "At what price?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Nepalese are saying, 'We're going into a period of intense discomfort. 
Yes, the economy will decline -- but we can emerge from that stronger both 
politically and economically at the end of the ride,' " said one independent 
economic expert here. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be stronger in the political sense," he added, "but in the economic 
sense, I am not so sure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Depression Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese are suffering severe shortages of many goods. But that is only the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the trade stoppage initially will thrust Nepal into a near-total 
economic depression. This year's growth rate, which had been expected to be as 
high as 5%, could now be as low as zero. Inflation will probably soar from a 
projected 8% to as high as 20%. And government revenues will drop sharply. All 
this in a nation where the average annual income is $160 a person. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Katmandu's banking community privately fear bank runs, and businessmen 
are worrying about bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term picture is even bleaker: Nepal, which is self-sufficient only in 
beer, cigarettes and a handful of food items, had hoped to earn its economic 
independence through hydroelectric power, its greatest national resource. 
</P>
<P>
But the projects that are planned to harness it for export will not be 
completed until early next century, and the only obvious market for the 
electricity is India. 
</P>
<P>
"Hydroelectric export to India is Nepal's only real way to achieve economic 
independence," one Western economist in Nepal said. "The potential earnings run 
into several hundred million dollars a year. But for that to materialize, there 
has to be a strong, close relationship with India. 
</P>
<P>
"A badly ruptured relationship could well be a short-term statement of 
sovereignty, but a long-term disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing that theme, officials in India have warned that Nepal has far more to 
lose than India, whose $200 million in annual exports here represents just 2% 
of its exports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Theater of the Absurd' 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell are they trying to prove?" demanded one senior Indian official. 
"If it's sovereignty you want . . . well, if you destroy yourself in the 
process, what kind of sovereignty is that? It's the theater of the absurd, if 
in the process of asserting your independence, you destroy your entire nation." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent that from happening, Nepal is rallying global support 
for its position. When the crisis began, King Birendra hired a Washington-based 
public relations firm as an adviser. Foreign journalists have been welcomed and 
senior Cabinet ministers have been made available for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the royal government announced a policy that reduces tariffs on 
essential imports from all nations to make them equal to the terms it offers 
India, which had been Nepal's largest and most favored trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
The background to the Indo-Nepalese dispute is complex: On the surface, it 
revolves around two recently expired treaties in which Nepal and India had, for 
decades, granted each other highly preferential trade terms, and India had 
agreed to provide transit access for goods going in and out of Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
But the trade issue is only the climax to the larger, long-simmering dispute, 
in which Nepal fears that it could be simply co-opted someday by India, in the 
same manner as nearby Sikkim, a former protectorate pressured by New Delhi into 
giving up its last vestiges of independence in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arms Purchase Worries India 
</P>
<P>
For its part, India's principal concern has been Nepal's purchase last year of 
troop trucks and anti-aircraft guns from China, with which India has fought one 
war and remains estranged despite recent attempts at normalization. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Himalayas were to the south of Nepal, rather than to the north, 
everything would be different," the Indian official said. "It is a fact of 
geography that India's security interests necessarily involve Nepal's security 
relationship with China." 
</P>
<P>
Nepal has insisted that the arms purchases were strictly for defensive 
purposes, that it had the right to acquire the arms "to guard against terrorist 
attacks from within" and that it never imagined the purchase would anger the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
But several Nepalese officials and diplomats privately conceded that it was 
meant as a signal to New Delhi that Nepal also must remain close with its huge 
northern neighbor, with which it has had a history of good relations. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal's position was perhaps best stated by its first king, Prithvinarayan 
Shah, when he founded the kingdom in 1762. 
</P>
<P>
"This kingdom," he declared, "is like a yam sandwiched between two stones. 
Maintain very friendly relations with the Chinese emperor. Also maintain 
friendly relations with the emperor of the sea of the south. But remember, he 
is very shrewd." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya 
indicated that Nepal is still walking a diplomatic high wire between the two 
big powers. 
</P>
<P>
But his comments on India were among the strongest ever for a high-ranking 
Nepalese official. "Nepal is not only a landlocked country, it is an 
India-locked country," he said. "And if there are some people in India who 
think the muscle-flexing will create a positive image for India, they are 
mistaken. Even a small country . . . will resist a policy based on 
muscle-flexing." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nepalese crisis has provided valuable fodder for India's enemies 
and a rallying point for King Birendra to build nationalist support, Nepalese 
concede that the price inevitably will be high -- far higher than simply 
cutting back on this week's New Year celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The public so far has been so forthcoming in their support, but the question 
is, how long will that last?" asked a palace aide. "There is no doubt the 
government must be careful about this. There is a lunatic fringe out there." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to radical Maoist student groups that rioted in Katmandu last week. 
As a precaution, the government closed all universities for two months and in 
some cases even supplied the students with bus fare back to their villages. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his nation's crisis, one Nepalese restaurant owner said, 
"Clearly, the nationalism and emotionalism are there. At the moment, they are 
all largely pro-government and anti-India. But whoever comes along to harness 
that -- including the student radicals -- wins all. 
</P>
<P>
"Are the risks worth it? I'm not so sure. If you live with reality, it means 
you have to live with India."

URBAN LEAGUE CHAPTER BACKS RIGHTS CHOICE

<TEXT>
<P>
William Lucas, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's candidate to head the Justice 
Department's civil rights division, has won a vote of support from the board of 
the Urban League's Detroit chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit board of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
had voted to oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of about 30 members of the Urban League's 45-member board attending 
a meeting Wednesday night voted to support Lucas' anticipated nomination, 
according to N. Charles Anderson, the chapter's president. The two abstained, 
but gave no reason, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that the league's leadership had no plans to promote Lucas' 
nomination otherwise. In its statement, the league's board noted that Lucas, 
former sheriff and county executive, had served as "an active and viable board 
member," assisting the organization in helping blacks and other minorities to 
realize their potential. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that the board has "utmost respect for the commitment and 
integrity of Mr. Lucas and believes he would serve well if nominated and 
confirmed." The NAACP Detroit unit, in opposing Lucas by a board vote of 68 to 
2 Monday night, cited concern over his "competence" and sensitivity to civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the criticism, Anderson said that Lucas "distinguished himself well 
when he served on our board, and that's civil rights in our mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Lucas ain't no Jesse Jackson when it comes to civil rights," Anderson 
said. "He's not known as a vociferous and forceful spokesperson on civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"But we believe he has more experience and sensitivity than (former Assistant 
Atty. Gen.) William Bradford Reynolds," a reference to the official who 
symbolized efforts to cut back on civil rights protections during the eight 
years of the Ronald Reagan Administration. "We did not feel in good conscience 
that we could oppose him." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 61, ran unsuccessfully in 1986 as the Republican candidate for governor 
of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, who repeatedly has declared his support for Lucas, has said that 
opposition to his appointment is largely partisan -- from those unhappy over 
his 1985 conversion from the Democratic to Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has drawn criticism for inflated job descriptions that have appeared on 
some of his resumes. He also was criticized in a jail overcrowding case and a 
police brutality decision and for his acceptance, while sheriff, of free air 
transportation and a Las Vegas hotel room in the mid-1970s from a Detroit man 
indicted but not convicted on federal gambling conspiracy charges.

Eddie Hatcher, a Tuscarora Indian fighting extradition to North Carolina where 
he is wanted for holding a newspaper staff hostage, said from his jail cell 
Thursday that he hopes California will not "throw me to the wolves." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, 31, lodged in the San Francisco City Jail, held a telephone news 
conference to announce the launching of a petition drive appealing to Gov. 
George Deukmejian to refuse extradition. The news conference was staged by the 
International Indian Treaty Council 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask that the justice system here not throw me to the wolves," Hatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his attempts to expose alleged corruption in North Carolina endangered 
his life and his mother's safety in the past to the extent that they both took 
to wearing bullet-proof vests. He said he would be in danger if forced to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what can happen. I've seen it happen, and that's my main worry," 
Hatcher told the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher stormed into The Robeson newspaper in Lumberton, N.C., Feb. 1, 1988, 
and seized 17 hostages at gunpoint, including editor Robert Horne. He said he 
committed the desperate act out of fear for his life after making allegations 
of local political corruption, including racism and law enforcement turning a 
blind eye to drug-trafficking in the rural county situated on Interstate 95, 
midway between Miami and New York. 
</P>
<P>
All of the hostages at the newspaper were released unharmed. But after Hatcher 
was acquitted of the federal charges, the state of North Carolina filed 
kidnaping charges against him and co-defendant Timothy Jacobs, 19, who is 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher hid on an Idaho Indian reservation before surfacing in San Francisco on 
March 10 at the Soviet Consulate, where FBI agents arrested him as a fugitive.

CONTINUED RESEARCH ON ARMENIAN GENOCIDE URGED BY DEUKMEJIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, frustrated at modern Turkey's refusal to admit 
responsibility for the massacre of Armenians in 1915, exhorted scholars 
Thursday to persevere in documenting research so no one can deny that the 
"genocide was anything but a stark reality." 
</P>
<P>
The son of immigrant parents and the nation's most prominent officeholder of 
Armenian ancestry, Deukmejian is passionate about the Armenian genocide issue 
and recognition of it by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at "present-day Turkish officials and certain revisionist 
historians" who he said have labeled as "forgeries" and "wartime propaganda" 
documentation of the mass slayings by Western observers. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, they deny that there ever was such a thing as an Armenian 
genocide," Deukmejian said in a speech to a symposium on the Armenian massacres 
at Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The conference attracted university professors from throughout the United 
States, Canada, Austria and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why competent, professional research is so important," he told the 
standing-room-only crowd. "The world community is entitled to thoroughly 
researched and overwhelmingly documented facts that no one can dispute that the 
Armenian genocide was anything but a stark reality." 
</P>
<P>
Under former President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. State Department repeatedly 
lobbied successfully against legislation that would declare a national day of 
remembrance for the approximately 1.5 million Armenians slain at the hands of 
the Ottoman Turks or deported to the deserts starting in April, 1915. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was strongly opposed by Turkey, a key NATO ally, which warned that 
approval could damage U.S.-Turkish relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Policy 
</P>
<P>
During the last presidential campaign, then-Vice President George Bush 
indicated that he was not bound by the Reagan policy and told the American 
Armenian Assembly that as President, "I would join Congress in commemorating 
the victims of that period." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian was asked after his speech what steps the Bush Administration had 
taken so far to recognize the genocide. He replied, "No official acts have been 
taken that I'm aware of." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the Bush Administration is still in the process of 
developing a foreign policy, but "we will make sure our view is heard" on the 
genocide issue when the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Deukmejian noted that in addition to American, British and 
French reports of a 1915 Turkish policy of genocide against Armenians, German 
diplomats made similar observations. At the time, Germany was an ally of 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said one piece of research disclosed that Baron von Wangenheim, 
German ambassador to Turkey in 1915, wrote that it was obvious "that the 
banishment of the Armenians is due not solely to military considerations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Internal Enemies' 
</P>
<P>
"Talaat Bey, the minister of the interior, has quite frankly said . . . the 
Turkish government intended to make use of the World War and deal thoroughly 
with its internal enemies, the (Armenian) Christians in Turkey, and that it 
meant not to be disturbed in this by diplomatic intervention from abroad," the 
ambassador wrote. 
</P>
<P>
His successor, Count Wolff Metternich, reported in a 1916 cable to his 
superiors that it was Turkey's objective to "resolve its Armenian question by 
the destruction of the Armenian race." He said the Turkish government "has 
refused to be deterred." 
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to all those who perished on the burning desert many years ago to 
ensure that the world always remembers what happened," Deukmejian told the 
conference. "Only by doing so will the world have a chance to prevent a 
repetition of a similar tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Hovannisian, a renowned scholar on Armenian and Near Eastern history 
at UCLA, said the purpose of the conference, in part, was to draw together new 
research into the Armenian genocide and make it available to school students, 
so that the so-called "forgotten genocide" would not be forgotten.

COUNCILMAN'S REMARK ANGERS VIETNAMESE 
</P>

A leader of Orange County's Vietnamese community announced plans Thursday to 
recall Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr., who voted to deny a parade permit 
sought by a group of South Vietnamese military veterans while telling them, "If 
you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese community will not sit still for this," said Arthur Suchesk, a 
spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee, who vowed to 
start a recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
Fry's statement, made at a Westminster City Council meeting earlier in the 
week, was racially insensitive, Suchesk and Vietnamese veterans have charged. 
The armed forces day committee sought a parade permit and approval to block 
traffic on busy Bolsa Avenue in the area of Westminster known as Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's My Opinion' 
</P>
<P>
Fry, who joined three other council members in voting against the request, told 
the group's representatives that they should commemorate their war dead on a 
U.S. holiday such as Memorial Day or Veteran's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be Americans. If 
you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam," Fry said. "That may 
be unfair, but that's my opinion and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of 
people around here." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Lam, a Vietnamese community and business leader, said Fry's statements 
were "uncalled for." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an insult," Lam said. "He's so naive to make that kind of a statement. 
We're trying to be in the mainstream of America (and) trying to maintain our 
cultural heritage. That's why we work in harmony. But that kind of a statement 
really breaks up the harmony." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 late Tuesday to reject the proposal that would have 
honored all soldiers who fought the Communists in Vietnam. Only Mayor Charles 
V. Smith, a Korean veteran, supported the parade. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans' group plans to mobilize the Vietnamese community and mount an 
"anti-Fry" campaign with demonstrations.

DODGER PARTY RUNS LATE, GETS UGLY; 
</P>
<P>
ASTROS SPOIL ALL THE FUN WITH 4-2 WIN IN 15 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What began as a swell little homecoming party for the Dodgers, one in which 
almost everyone in a blue uniform received at least one door prize -- a 1988 
World Series championship ring -- turned into one of those exhausting affairs 
where the Dodgers could hardly wait for the last guests to depart from a crowd 
of 47,136 paying customers at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Astros, however, paid no heed to how tired the Dodgers were 
Thursday afternoon for their home opener. The Astros took their sweet time -- 
in this case, 15 innings that stretched over 4 hours 16 minutes -- to squeeze 
out a 4-2 win that ultimately squelched whatever joy was left in the occasion 
for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but on the day the Dodgers were honored for finishing first in 
major league baseball last year, the Astros dumped them into last place in the 
National League West. That indignity was made possible after a throwing error 
by Dodger first baseman Eddie Murray, the Los Angeles native son who was making 
his regular-season Dodger Stadium debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they lost, in one way I would have liked to have been in their 
shoes today, with all those awards and their championship rings," said the 
Astros' sole slugger, Glenn Davis, whose two-out, game-tying home run in the 
eighth inning stopped the Dodgers in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"That was last year. But this year, I'd rather be in our shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, the Dodgers, who followed six weeks of spring training in 
Florida with a three-city, eight-game tour that didn't bring them home until 
the wee hours of the morning Thursday, would have preferred to be in bed. Their 
bats obviously fell asleep long before their owners, who were shut out over the 
last nine innings by four Houston pitchers on four hits, a performance that 
dropped the team batting average to .204. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the schedule hasn't helped us much," said third baseman Jeff Hamilton, 
whose .162 average is higher than two other Dodger regulars, Murray and Alfredo 
Griffin, who was dropped from second to eighth in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, like many of his teammates, didn't get to sleep until almost 3:30 
a.m., after the team's post-midnight flight from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make a good energy day, does it?" Hamilton said, "but the other 
team doesn't give a you-know-what. It's just a problem we've got to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can see it a lot in big situations where your concentration is 
drained. It affects you, whether you like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make excuses, but it's kind of a catch-22. You just have to go out 
and keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that simple for Kirk Gibson, who began this season here the way he 
did the last -- with a limp, only this time minus the electrifying home run 
that punctuated his sole World Series at-bat last October. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson took himself out of the game after striking out in the sixth inning, 
which left him hitless in three at-bats, including another strikeout. Trainer 
Bill Buhler said the Dodger left fielder, whose spring has been marred by knee, 
hamstring and shoulder problems, complained of being stiff and sore all over. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson was replaced in left field by Mariano Duncan, one of 19 players employed 
by Manager Tom Lasorda. The only non-pitcher left on the Dodger bench was 
catcher Rick Dempsey, who was being saved in case something happened to Mike 
Scioscia, who wound up catching 24 innings in a span of 22 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just against my better judgment to continue playing," said Gibson, who 
even with his injuries has been the Dodgers' most productive hitter with eight 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that admission, however, Gibson is reluctant to concede that he will, 
indeed, sit out a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that," he said. "I'm not really in the mood to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' mood, more upbeat after Mike Marshall's sixth-inning home run off 
Houston starter Jim Clancy, was decidedly blue after Davis connected off Tim 
Belcher, who retired 11 straight batters before the home run. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team looked like it ran out of gas after they tied it up," said 
Marshall, who began the day with three straight hits -- two singles and the 
home run -- before tapering off to two strikeouts and a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally hit empty when Murray -- who knocked in the Dodgers' first 
run with a sacrifice fly, hit two singles to add 41 points to the .094 average 
he brought into the game, and made a sprawling backhanded stop in the ninth to 
save a run -- threw Bob Forsch's bunt into center field on an attempted force 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Searage, fourth Dodger pitcher of the day, gave up a run-scoring single to 
Rafael Ramirez, and Tim Crews, pitcher No. 5 who was making his league-leading 
sixth appearance, was tagged for an RBI double down the left-field line by 
Billy Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The way this game was going, I knew it would take a walk or an unfortunate 
play to decide it," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're an aggressive team, and Eddie made an aggressive play. That's good. 
When you're aggressive, more good things happen than bad." 
</P>
<P>
Searage started the inning by walking Houston's No. 8 hitter, Ken Caminiti, who 
had doubled in Houston's first run in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to take back that pitch in the second inning," said Belcher, still 
looking for his first win after three starts, including nine strong innings 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was stupid pitching for me to give him anything at all to hit with first 
base open and the pitcher up next. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with Davis hitting the home run . . . he's capable of doing that, 
even though he one-handed it, but I should have pitched around (Caminiti)." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who sat in owner Peter O'Malley's private box, weren't 
around to witness the rival bullpens matching zero for zero. They left after 
the seventh inning, even though Mrs. Reagan -- who threw out the first ball 
after doing the same for Game 1 of the World Series -- was called a good-luck 
charm by Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Dodgers' loss Thursday, someone asked Lasorda if Mrs. 
Reagan's pitching career is over. 
</P>
<P>
"She had nothing to do with our run production," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
And while her early exit seemed to fit the prototype of Dodger fans, it could 
be that Mrs. Reagan was a little confused. Some of the players were. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost track about the 10th inning," Dave Anderson said. "It's been a long 48 
hours for us." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, like his players, was operating on about four hours' sleep. Asked if 
he was tired, he said: "You're damn right. When we don't win, I get awfully 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't bode well for the bags under his eyes.

KINGS STUN EDMONTON, 4-1; 
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY AND COMPANY'S 'BIGGEST VICTORY' TIES PLAYOFF SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trade of last August that took Wayne Gretzky away from the defending 
Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers and brought the Great One to the 
struggling Kings was bound to affect the balance of power in the National 
Hockey League sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
It's happening sooner. It's happening now. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned Oiler fans saw some of that power slip away Thursday night at the 
Northlands Coliseum as the Kings came from behind to beat the Oilers, 4-1, 
snapping Edmonton's playoff-game winning streak on their home ice at 14 and 
sending the series back to the Forum for the decisive seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called it "the biggest victory" in the history of the Kings' franchise. 
And owner Bruce McNall, the man who put up the millions of dollars to turn the 
Kings into a winner, was quick to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, the biggest," McNall said as he was knocked about in the crush 
outside the Kings' dressing room by people wanting to shake his hand and pat 
him on the back and tell him that Gretzky was worth all the millions. 
</P>
<P>
But McNall has been close enough to the coaches and players this season to add 
that the Oilers will "come out flying" Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, the Kings regained the home-ice advantage and took a giant step 
forward in their quest for the Stanley Cup. Their climactic matchup -- the 
first time the Kings and Oilers have met in a seventh game -- shapes up as a 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fans who have tickets will get their money's worth," McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
And all tickets have already been sold. Incredibly, the crowd at the Northlands 
Coliseum Thursday night was a less-than-capacity 17,351. 
</P>
<P>
Times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Game 6 started out looking like old times. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds into the game, Gretzky blocked a shot by Oiler right wing Glenn 
Anderson that ricocheted right back to defenseman Randy Gregg, who fired a shot 
that King goalie Kelly Hrudey said bounced about 10 feet in front of him. He 
couldn't stop the puck as it glanced off the ice. "I'm sure a lot of people 
thought that was the series right there," Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers led, 1-0, with just 33 seconds gone. And there the score stayed 
through almost two periods, until Mike Allison's goal tied the game at 16:22 of 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Allison fought for that goal. He got the puck in the right corner and then 
scrapped and clawed and elbowed and kicked his way along the boards behind the 
Edmonton net, trying to keep the puck and lose Gregg at the same time. Gregg 
even pulled off one of Allison's gloves as he sought to slow him down. But when 
Allison couldn't lose Gregg, he dragged him along, getting both the puck and 
the defenseman around the left side of the net. As Allison was falling to the 
ice, with Gregg on his back, he reached out with his stick and swept the puck 
in a wide arc between the legs of Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
It was a goal for the highlight films. The kind of goal that turns a game 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Taylor: "It was a great, great effort by Allison. Gregg was trying to 
pin him on the boards and Mike just kept fighting him off and just outmuscled 
him. That really gave our team a big lift." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had had a goal taken away just a few minutes earlier when referee 
Bill McCreary ruled that the puck had dropped in behind Fuhr as a result of a 
high stick by Taylor after Bernie Nicholls' shot was deflected into the air. 
But television replays clearly showed that the puck went in off Oiler Esa 
Tikkanen. It should have counted. 
</P>
<P>
In that second period, the Kings outshot the Oilers, 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Weimer scored the tie-breaker at 4:15 of the third period, teamming up with 
Dave Taylor on a break toward the Oiler goal. Taylor took the puck up the right 
side, passed it to Weimer on the left and kept driving toward the right side of 
the net. Fuhr tried to keep an eye on both of them. But he wasn't quite quick 
enough when Weimer decided to take the shot on the sharp angle from the bottom 
of the left circle instead of making the pass to Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Weimer, too, is a former Oiler. He had played with Edmonton's Cape Breton team 
all season before being traded to the Kings in a deal for some other minor 
leaguers at the trading deadline, March 7. 
</P>
<P>
When Weimer was recalled from New Haven just in time to score the game-winner 
against the Oilers here March 21, Oiler Coach Glen Sather expressed no regret 
at letting him go. In fact, Sather said at the time that Weimer was "old," that 
he was "slow" and that he was, in fact, "a minor leaguer." 
</P>
<P>
But that slow, old minor leaguer came home and scored another game-winner when 
it counted most. 
</P>
<P>
And then Chris Kontos, another player written off by the rest of the league but 
signed by the Kings on March 7, scored the insurance goal. Gretzky had pulled 
up at the top of the right circle, made one of his little swirls and then fired 
the puck across the slot to Kontos, who was waiting at the left post to shovel 
the puck over Fuhr's right skate. 
</P>
<P>
For Kontos, it was playoff goal No. 7, setting a club record for goals in a 
seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings were not finished. Defenseman Dale DeGray tipped away a pass from 
Oiler wing Jari Kurri, putting it right on Nicholls' stick. Nicholls made the 
quick pass to Luc Robitaille, who fired the 15-foot scoring shot off the pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings won with a solid defensive effort and a diversified offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't rely on Wayne Gretzky to get all of our goals," Taylor said. "We had 
some guys come through for us. Jim Weimer had a big goal. Chris Kontos, another 
guy who wasn't even with us all season, came through with another big goal. The 
Oilers like to key on Gretzky and Nicholls and Robitaille, but we have others 
who can score." 
</P>
<P>
Allison isn't one of the Kings' big guns, either, but even couldn't believe the 
goal he scored. Allison said he was merely trying to stay in control of the 
puck and get it out in front of the net, where other Kings were in scoring 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"As I came around, and I think I was already going down, I heard somebody, 
maybe Stevie (Kasper) yelling that he was going to the net," Allison said. "I 
reached out with one hand and pushed the puck around there. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I think it had a chance of going in? Well, they say any time you shoot at 
the net it has a chance of going in. But I was thinking that at least there 
would be a rebound and a loose puck." 
</P>
<P>
When the red light came on, the Kings on the bench erupted. 
</P>
<P>
But it was still a 1-1 game when Kurri took a shot at the Kings' net that might 
have changed the course of the game. Hrudey made one of his best stops. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gretzky: "From our point of view, that goal by Allison was the kind of 
goal that turns a game around. From (the Oilers') point of view, the turning 
point might have been the stop on Kurri." 
</P>
<P>
Both of those plays turned the tide in favor of the Kings, who are on a 
two-game roll going into Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Gretzky said. "They're buzzing about hockey in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there might be a little magic taking place at the Forum Saturday, 
Gretzky, the ultimate sports fan, responded: "Magic (Johnson, of the Lakers) is 
playing the Clippers that night (at the Sports Arena). Hopefully, we'll make 
some magic of our own."

MORNING BRIEFING: WHO'S HE THINK HE IS, MANOS DE HUEVOS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be a long time before boxer Roberto Duran is invited back to Corpus 
Christi, Tex., where he spoke at a recent luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
According to Newsday's Wallace Matthews, Duran arrived in ragged jeans and a 
T-shirt that barely covered his burgeoning belly, which has expanded by about 
20 pounds since he defeated Iran Barkley for the World Boxing Council 
middleweight title last month. 
</P>
<P>
When the luncheon was delayed, Duran took a side trip to the hotel coffee shop. 
He ignored the line of people waiting to be seated and brushed past the hostess 
at the door. With a spring rarely seen in his legs nowadays, he headed straight 
for the buffet table, where lunch was being served out of aluminum steam 
tables. There, he dug his legendary "Hands of Stone" into the food, even into 
the scrambled eggs, rarely considered finger-food. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Lou Duva, a witness to it all, stood back and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"That Duran," he said. "The guy hasn't changed a bit in the 20 years I know 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Jumping the gun: With the New York Yankees losing seven of their first nine 
games, a radio station in Geneva, N.Y., has started a contest to guess the date 
when Manager Dallas Green will be fired. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will receive two season tickets to watch the Geneva Cubs, a minor 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
The Adams family: The first time Margo Adams accompanied Wade Boggs on a Boston 
Red Sox trip, the team went to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
When Boggs returned there recently, he saw Margo Adams every time he looked 
into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
A local radio station distributed Margo Adams masks to fans as they drove into 
the parking lot at Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The fans held them up and chanted, "Mar-go, Mar-go," whenever Boggs batted. 
</P>
<P>
A novel idea, for sure, but not the best shot yet taken at Boggs. Last season 
at Anaheim Stadium, home park for Adams, who is from Costa Mesa, the organist 
played the theme from "The Addams Family" when Boggs batted. Boggs later 
complained loudly enough that the organist ceased. 
</P>
<P>
Hail to the victors: President George Bush, who played baseball at Yale, isn't 
a bad basketball player, either. 
</P>
<P>
When Michigan visited the White House after winning the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. basketball title, Bush shot free throws with Rumeal Robinson, 
who made the game-winning free throws in the championship game against Seton 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After Robinson sank a free throw on a portable hoop set up in the Rose Garden, 
Bush made his free throw on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces of a puzzle: The Utah Jazz has come up with a unique way to promote its 
candidates for National Basketball Assn. postseason awards. 
</P>
<P>
A box arrived in the mail with the following label: "Are You Puzzled About Who 
to Vote for for the NBA Postseason Awards?" 
</P>
<P>
Inside was a jigsaw puzzle picturing the Jazz candidates: Karl Malone and John 
Stockton for most valuable player, Mark Eaton for defensive player of the year 
and Thurl Bailey for best sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Scott Norton, U.S. Olympic trials freestyle wrestling champion in 
1980, explaining that he is several years past his prime: "Wrestling is what I 
did when I was skinny and athletic and could see my feet."

NHL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;

<P>
CANUCKS BEAT FLAMES, 6-3, AND FORCE A SEVENTH GAME

<P>
If one had been asked to predict which series wouldn't go seven games, it would 
probably have been the Smythe Division semifinal between the Calgary Flames and 
the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Canucks continued to make believers out of the National Hockey League 
experts Thursday night at Vancouver, Canada, as Jim Sandlak, Rich Sutter and 
Garth Butcher scored in a span of 2:18 late in the second period to help the 
upstart Canucks defeat the Flames, 6-3, and tie their Stanley Cup series at 
three games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh and deciding game will be played Saturday at Calgary. The Flames 
finished first in the Smythe Division and the Canucks fourth, 43 points behind. 
</P>
<P>
Sandlak tied the score at 17:26 of the second period at 2-2, and Sutter put the 
Canucks ahead at 19:29. Just 15 seconds later, Butcher scored his first goal of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bradley and Sutter added insurance goals in the third period, with Sutter 
getting his second into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
Canuck goaltender Kirk McLean faced 32 shots, while Vancouver fired 25 times at 
Mike Vernon of the Flames. Vernon had blanked Vancouver, 4-0, in Game 5 for his 
second shutout of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Washington 3 -- Rich Tocchet's second goal of the game with 
3:19 left at Philadelphia carried the Flyers past the Capitals and into the 
Patrick Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh straight season that the Capitals, who finished the regular 
season in first place, had failed to get past their division in the playoffs. 
The Flyers finished the regular season in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers will meet the Pittsburgh Penguins in a best-of-seven division final 
starting Monday night at Pittsburgh. The Penguins reached the final with a 
four-game sweep of the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Tocchet, who had an earlier goal and an assist, shot from the right corner, the 
puck glancing off Washington goalie Pete Peeters' left skate into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Detroit 1 -- Wayne Presley scored three times, including a record 
third short-handed goal, and Steve Larmer added two goals, leading the 
Blackhawks to a series-clinching victory over the Red Wings at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Presley scored a goal in the second period 26 seconds after Larmer had broken a 
1-1 tie. He added a power-play goal at 7:29 of the third period and completed 
his hat trick with a short-handed goal at 11:05. 
</P>
<P>
The three short-handed goals by Presley tied an NHL playoff record set by Bill 
Barber of Philadelphia against Minnesota in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who finished fourth in their division, advanced to the 
divisional finals starting next Tuesday at St. Louis.

Payne Stewart shot a bogey-free, six-under-par 65 Thursday for a share of the 
first-round lead in the $800,000 Heritage golf tournament at Hilton Head 
Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was tied with Kenny Perry, who got his share of the lead with a 12-foot 
birdie putt on the 18th hole. Stewart and Perry are two strokes ahead of Bob 
Eastwood and Rocco Mediate. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo of England, in his first round since winning the Masters, shot a 68 
with only 23 putts. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, was five more than the record-matching 18 putts needed by Kenny 
Knox in a round of 69. Knox chipped in three times and had 12 one-putt greens 
as he tied the PGA Tour record for fewest putts in a round. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Littler shot a six-under-par 66 for a one-shot lead in the first round of 
The Tradition, a new $600,000 tournament on the Senior PGA Tour at Scottsdale, 
Ariz.

Red foxes are fair game for government trappers at a national wildlife refuge 
in Orange County, a Los Angeles federal judge declared in finding that the 
foxes can be killed because they pose a significant threat to two endangered 
bird species. U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher refused an animal rights' 
group's request for an injunction, pending a trial on the trapping program at 
the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. The Navy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service had ordered the trapping and killing of several hundred of the 
non-native foxes since 1986 in an effort they say is essential to preserve two 
species of birds that nest in the 1,100-acre refuge on the naval base. The 
foxes are believed to prey on the eggs and hatchlings of the light-footed 
clapper rail and the California least tern.

A federal grand jury indicted Charles Lewis, the central figure in an 
investigation of alleged drug activity at a downtown hotel room frequented by 
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, on charges of cocaine possession and perjury. 
Lewis, also a key player in a controversial joint Washington, D.C.-Virgin 
Islands personnel project, was indicted on three counts of cocaine possession 
and seven counts of lying to the grand jury. Barry became the focus of intense 
media interest when police, on their way to question Lewis in his Ramada Inn 
motel room Dec. 22, were inexplicably diverted when it was learned the mayor 
was in the room with Lewis. The mayor has denied any knowledge of drugs in the 
room and was not named in the indictment. The mayor has offered little 
explanation of the visits, referring to Lewis only as "someone I know."

The Irish Republican Army apologized for a bombing that killed a Roman Catholic 
woman and wounded more than 30 other people in an attack minutes before the 
outlawed group tried to telephone a warning to the Northern Ireland town of 
Warren Point. A statement by the IRA, which is fighting to unite the province 
with the Irish Republic, admitted that one of its men may have prematurely 
detonated the 1,500-pound bomb. Police said some buildings were leveled and 
more than 200 homes and 13 small businesses were badly damaged. The IRA 
admission made the victim, 20-year-old Joanne Reilly, the 29th civilian killed 
by mistake by the outlawed group since late 1987.

Actress Audrey Hepburn joined U.N. officials in Khartoum to see a Nile River 
barge depart for famine-threatened southern Sudan with 100 tons of food and 
medicine -- the first of more than 100,000 tons the United Nations hopes to 
ship to the war-torn region by month's end. The barge is expected to join 
several other river craft in Kosti, about 175 miles to the south, before 
continuing to the besieged garrison city of Malakal. Hepburn, a good-will 
ambassador for the U.N. Children's Fund, next plans to visit Nairobi to observe 
efforts to move food northward into Sudan from Kenya and Uganda.

A rationing plan aimed at a 25% reduction in water use by more than 200,000 
customers of the San Jose Water Co. was approved by the state Public Utilities 
Commission. Effective immediately, residential customers will be allocated 75% 
of the amount of water they used in 1987. Industrial customers are to get 90% 
of their 1987 amounts. Initially, the need for water savings was estimated at 
45%, but last month's rainfall eased the problem. The San Jose Water Co. serves 
San Jose, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Monte Sereno and parts of Cupertino as well as 
unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County.

Three senators introduced a package of anti-smoking bills to make cigarettes 
more expensive, less addictive and less available, and received support from a 
former "Winston Man," who said tobacco ads lie. The government should speak 
with one voice in telling the public: "Tobacco use will harm you," said Sen. 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who joined Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and John H. 
Chafee (R-R.I.) in proposing measures to discourage tobacco use. David Goerlitz 
of Cherry Hill, N.J., was an R. J. Reynolds "Winston Man" model from 1981 to 
1986. His ad campaign, depicting smokers as young, robust and virile, "was a 
big lie," he said, and urged Congress "to battle the greed and deception" of 
the tobacco companies.

SOCIAL SECURITY FILES BARRED IN CREDIT CHECKS

Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy moved Thursday to bar credit bureaus and banks 
from using Social Security's massive data files to verify Social Security 
numbers for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided after consulting with the policy council and office of general 
counsel to halt providing negative verifications of Social Security numbers to 
financial and credit institutions," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her order would bar the Social Security Administration from processing 
magnetic tapes containing 140 million names and Social Security numbers 
submitted by TRW Credit Data, whose operations include gathering information 
for credit purposes, to determine which names have incorrect Social Security 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), who raised the issue with Hardy on Monday at a 
hearing of the Senate Committee on Aging, said: "I am glad that Commissioner 
Hardy has taken this path and has seen fit to preserve the confidentiality of 
the Social Security files. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this action comes too late to protect some 150,000 people whose 
files were violated during a test run conducted for TRW (in 1987) and for more 
than 3 million people on whom verifications were conducted for Citibank and 
other firms in past years." Pryor said he had been "appalled that officials had 
been so cavalier about the privacy of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, Pryor 
asked for an investigation by the agency inspector general. Pryor called the 
TRW and Citicorp verifications "the largest breach of privacy in the history of 
the program." He called the verifications violations of the Privacy Act of 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
After Hardy learned about the practice, she said, she decided in December to 
delay approving the TRW request for verification of 140 million names and 
Social Security numbers. She said she asked the policy council to review the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said it was clear that verifying Social Security numbers for credit 
bureaus and financial institutions is impermissible. However, she said the 
agency will continue to verify numbers for employers who need the information 
to be sure that Social Security deductions for their employees are properly 
recorded and to be certain that a job applicant is using a valid Social 
Security card.

Technicians replaced a faulty engine part Thursday aboard the shuttle Atlantis, 
as NASA managers reviewed plans to launch the spacecraft at the end of the 
month on a crucial flight to deploy a probe to Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day "flight readiness review," an exhaustive assessment of shuttle 
launch processing, began at 8 a.m. at the space center and ran late into the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present was Navy Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, a former astronaut and 
associate administrator for space flight whom President Bush said Wednesday he 
would nominate to serve as NASA's next administrator.

Probe to Map Venus

Atlantis is scheduled to blast off April 28 with a crew of five to launch the 
Magellan probe, which will continue on a 15-month voyage to Venus. Magellan is 
scheduled to map at least 90% of the planet's surface, which would increase 
knowledge about the evolution of Earth's solar system.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle processing schedule 
does not include additional time to resolve problems, which is what engineers 
encountered Wednesday night.

Two trains collided head-on Thursday at a station in central Japan, injuring 
118 people, most of them schoolchildren, Kyodo News Agency reported.

<P>
The agency said a two-car train with 220 passengers rammed into the front of a 
stationary three-car train carrying 330 people at Minami Minowa, about 100 
miles west of Tokyo. It quoted police as saying the accident was caused either 
by a fault in automatic switching or driver error.

2,550 EVACUATED AS YOUNG PLAYERS FALL ILL AT CONCERT

Some 2,550 persons were evacuated from Santa Monica Civic Auditorium Thursday 
night after performers in a student concert started fainting or complaining of 
illness, but Santa Monica firefighters said they were unable to find any trace 
of toxic fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen students, most of them girls, were taken to five area hospitals where 
doctors said none appeared to be in serious condition, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 40th annual Stairway of The Stars, produced by the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District. The concert featured 1,100 members of 
the district's bands, choruses and orchestras from the 4th through 12th grades. 
Another 1,450 spectators were in the audience, district president Bob Holbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone left in an orderly manner," Holbrook said, "but some of the children 
were pretty frightened." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the fire department, Cathy Weinstein, said, "Firefighters 
made two sweeeps of the auditorium with meters to measure toxic substances and 
found no evidence of physical cause." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day at rehearsals,"about 12 girls fainted, but we just thought 
it was stress and hunger although some students complained of dizziness or 
nausea" and the students were released to go home until the performance, an 
unidentified school official said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students complained that there had just "been a bad odor," others 
complained of paint odors and other compared it with the smell of pesticides on 
the outside lawn. Some students complained of nausea, lightheadness or upset 
stomachs, paramedics said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those who fainted were out cold," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee McNett, chief fire department paramedic, said, "There are several things 
that could have caused it. One of the things we have speculated on is mass 
hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Farmer, a photographer at the scene, said, "When I got there, there were 
just rows and rows of kids lying on stretchers. Some of them had their 
instruments beside them, but everyone seemed pretty calm. There were little 
girls in formals crying."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 CHILDREN DIE AFTER FALLING INTO POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A toddler and his 3-year-old sister died Thursday after they fell into the 
rooftop swimming pool of a Westlake apartment building when they were left 
unsupervised for a few minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Deiongh, 1 1/2, was pronounced dead at Childrens Hospital, where his 
sister, Christine, died several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Sam Layton called the drownings accidental. He said the 
children's mother, Song Deiongh, had taken them to a recreation area atop the 
seven-story building west of downtown and left them alone while she used a 
nearby restroom. When she returned, the children were at the bottom of the 
seven-foot-deep pool.

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution in the area. It has the power to seek court-imposed fines against 
polluters of from $25 to $25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that 
emissions exceed legal limits, the potential danger to the public, whether the 
violation was intentional, accidental or due to negligence and the company's 
history of violations. These are the 10 highest penalties paid in January:

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORMER MCMARTIN DEFENDANT TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former defendant in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case testified 
Thursday that she never saw either of the remaining defendants "touch any child 
in the genital area for what appeared to be for purposes of sexual 
gratification." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a defense attorney whether she ever had the slightest suspicion that 
molestation might be going on, Babette Spitler replied, "No, I would have 
reported it." 
</P>
<P>
Spitler, 41, who has two children who attended McMartin and recently adopted a 
third, taught at the Manhattan Beach nursery school on and off from 1973 until 
it closed in January, 1984. After her arrest and preliminary hearing, she was 
ordered to stand trial on four counts involving two children, but charges 
against her were dropped in early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She said she never saw either Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, who are charged with 65 counts of molestation and conspiracy, take 
children off the school grounds except for routine field trips. Nor did she 
observe naked games, picture-taking, animal mutilation, or any other 
inappropriate activity during her tenure there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Spitler, who was called as a witness by the defense, told the jury she watched 
Ray Buckey dig a grave for a dead turtle but did not know how it met its end. 
She will resume testifying on Monday.

people indicted in the alleged smuggling of at least 26 tons of marijuana to 
the West Coast from Southeast Asia, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents said the ring transported the drug in several shiploads between 
1984 and 1987, usually transferring their illicit cargo to smaller vessels 
before landing in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-count indictment, which also alleges several conspiracies to defraud the 
Internal Revenue Service and violate federal tax laws, was unsealed late 
Wednesday after the arrests of five of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth, Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50, surrendered to federal 
authorities Thursday morning. All were arraigned Thursday afternoon before U.S. 
Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Assistant U.S. Attys. Steven D. Clymer and Russell Hayman, 
Tassopulos set bail for Pearson at $1 million. Pearson's attorney, James 
Riddet, called the amount an "absolute outrage" and said his client had made 
himself available to federal prosecutors almost from the beginning of the 
18-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, former Maui resident William Uhler, 39, who in 
1986 reportedly gave a Cypress address, and Eugene LaForce, 53, of Cave 
Junction, Ore., organized and directed at least four major marijuana shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler, LaForce, longtime Maui resident Walter M. Hillinger, 56, and others 
allegedly brought eight tons from Thailand aboard a ship named the Lloyd B. 
George in September, 1984, transferring it off the coast of Mendocino County to 
two smaller vessels that carried it to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Another seven tons of marijuana allegedly was brought to California in 1985 
aboard the Lady Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel whose ownership reportedly 
was traced to a partnership that included several names from the obituary 
columns of the Orange County Register. Federal authorities said the ring went 
to great lengths to cover up ownership of the vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the prosecutors said, Uhler, LaForce and the others smuggled 11 more 
tons of marijuana from Thailand to a point between Hawaii and Tahiti, where it 
was put aboard another vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drug charges, Uhler, Pearson, Dovie M. Briggs, 56, a Cypress 
income tax preparer who is Uhler's mother-in-law, and Terry P. Dee, 47, of Seal 
Beach, former owner of Faber Laboratories, a Fullerton business that tested 
crankcase oil, were indicted on federal income tax charges. 
</P>
<P>
Others indicted were Larry A. Doyle, 49, of Newport Beach; Charles E. Larsen, 
45, of Costa Mesa; Martin E. Levine, 49, of New York City and San Francisco; 
Michael A. Tzouanakis, 35, of Costa Mesa; Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset 
Beach, and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay.

DEFENSE IS GIVEN 2 WEEKS TO READY NIGHT STALKER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 31 court days, 137 witnesses and 521 exhibits, the prosecution in the 
Night Stalker trial rested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan then gave the three attorneys 
for defendant Richard Ramirez a two-week break to prepare their case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Ray G. Clark said it will take two to four weeks to present 
Ramirez's case. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview outside court, Clark jocularly reiterated that the defense tack 
will be "S.O.D.D.I" -- "some other dude did it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed at Scenes of Crimes 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the prosecution case, which began unfolding Jan. 30, eight 
witnesses, including six surviving female victims, placed Ramirez at the scenes 
of Night Stalker crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark said many of the women's initial descriptions of their assailant were 
"not really that consistent." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer noted that those earlier descriptions given to police included 
different colors of hair as well as the race of the attacker. He also pointed 
out that there were discrepancies among the witnesses' description of the 
condition of the assailant's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the defense intends to call at least one psychologist as an expert 
witness to discuss the pitfalls of eyewitness identifications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unresolved Issue 
</P>
<P>
One still-unresolved issue is a notion advanced by the co-prosecutors, Deputy 
Dist. Attys. Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson, that the 24 jurors and alternates 
be taken on a tour of the 15 Night Stalker crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Clark further raised the possibility that such a tour be undertaken at night, 
since all the attacks took place in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a 
spree of night-time residential attacks throughout Los Angeles County, mostly 
in the spring and summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, which once estimated its case would take four months, managed 
to present all of its evidence in 31 days of testimony over two months. Just 
before resting the case, Halpin called a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy to 
testify about a previously unknown incident involving Ramirez, a 
self-proclaimed devil worshiper. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Gerald Newbold said he was on the Ramirez "suicide watch" Sept. 2, 1985 
-- two days after his arrest -- when he observed Ramirez sitting on the toilet 
of his cell in the Central Jail drawing a pentagram on the floor in his own 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pentagram on Victim 
</P>
<P>
In one of the Night Stalker attacks, pentagrams were found on the wall of one 
elderly woman victim's bedroom and on the thigh of her sister. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Ramirez had a pentagram drawn on his left arm. 
Additionally, at the end of his arraignment on Oct. 24, 1985, in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, Ramirez flashed a pentagram that had been drawn on his palm, 
and yelled: "Hail, Satan!" 
</P>
<P>
The final prosecution witness was David Law, another sheriff's deputy, who was 
assigned to guard Ramirez's cell. Law testified that on Oct. 30, 1986, Ramirez 
showed him two photographs of a dead woman, a Night Stalker victim, and said: 
</P>
<P>
" 'People come up here and call me a punk. And I show them the pictures, and 
they go away all pale. There is blood behind the Night Stalker.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thank God' 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment after resting the case, Halpin said only, "Thank God." 
</P>
<P>
Both prosecutors noted that the case is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like only the first half" of a ballgame, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will resume May 1.

INDICTMENT CITES 13 AS SMUGGLERS OF 26 TONS OF POT 
</P>

Nine Orange County residents, including a Tustin attorney, are among 13 people 
indicted in the alleged smuggling of at least 26 tons of marijuana to the West 
Coast from Southeast Asia, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents said the ring transported the drug in several shiploads between 
1984 and 1987, usually transferring their illicit cargo to smaller vessels 
before landing in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-count indictment, which also alleges several conspiracies to defraud the 
Internal Revenue Service and violate federal tax laws, was unsealed late 
Wednesday after the arrests of five of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth, Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50, surrendered to federal 
authorities Thursday morning. All were arraigned Thursday afternoon before U.S. 
Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Assistant U.S. Attys. Steven D. Clymer and Russell Hayman, 
Tassopulos set bail for Pearson at $1 million. Pearson's attorney, James 
Riddet, called the amount an "absolute outrage" and said his client had made 
himself available to federal prosecutors almost from the beginning of the 
18-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson could not raise the $1-million bail, Riddet said, and was being held in 
the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, former Maui resident William Uhler, 39, now a 
resident of the Orange County, community of Sunset Beach, and Eugene LaForce, 
53, of Cave Junction, Ore., organized and directed at least four major 
marijuana shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler, LaForce, longtime Maui resident Walter M. Hillinger, 56, and others 
allegedly brought eight tons from Thailand aboard a ship named the Lloyd B. 
George in September of 1984, transferring it off the coast of Mendocino County 
to two smaller vessels that carried it to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in Hawaii 
</P>
<P>
Hillinger was arrested Thursday morning in Hawaii, the U.S. attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another seven tons of marijuana allegedly was brought to California in 1985 
aboard the Lady Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel whose ownership reportedly 
was traced to a partnership that included several names from the obituary 
columns of the Orange County Register. Federal authorities said the ring went 
to great lengths to cover up ownership of the vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the prosecutors said, Uhler, LaForce and the others smuggled 11 more 
tons of marijuana from Thailand to a point between Hawaii and Tahiti, where it 
was put aboard another vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drug charges, Uhler, Pearson, Cypress income tax preparer 
Dovie M. Briggs, 56, who is Uhler's mother-in-law, and Terry P. Dee, 47, of 
Seal Beach, former owner of Faber Laboratories, a Fullerton business that 
tested crankcase oil, were indicted on federal income tax charges. 
</P>
<P>
Uher and Dee are accused of knowingly signing false returns for 1984 through 
1987. Dee allegedly arranged to have Faber send regular payments to Uhler so 
that he would appear to have a legitimate income. Uhler then repaid Dee and his 
wife, Jeanne, 34, in cash, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Millions in Drug Money 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also charges Pearson, Dee and Briggs with conspiring with Uhler 
to help him conceal millions of dollars of drug income. Pearson is alleged to 
have held title to a Maui house that Uhler purchased in 1984 for $375,000. The 
federal government seized proceeds from the house when it was sold in June of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs' husband, Clyde, said he had not seen his wife for two days and learned 
from a friend that she had been arrested. "She's innocent as hell," he 
insisted. "She hasn't even smoked a Camel cigarette in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Others indicted were Larry A. Doyle, 49, of Newport Beach; Charles E. Larsen, 
45, of Costa Mesa; Martin E. Levine, 49, of New York City and San Francisco; 
Michael A. Tzouanakis, 35, of Costa Mesa; Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset 
Beach, and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ferried Cash 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said Levine helped organize the smuggling trips and that 
Doyle oversaw loading of one of the ships. Tzouanakis purportedly ferried cash 
to Southeast Asia to pay expenses. Larsen was accused of skippering two of the 
vessels and Tobin reportedly was a crew member. 
</P>
<P>
Ulrich is already serving a 15-year sentence in Thailand for marijuana 
smuggling, Clymer said. The five others still are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler, LaForce, Pearson and Ulrich face possible life in prison if convicted, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Tassopulos ordered Tzouanakis held without bail. She set 
bail for Terry Dee at $750,000, for his wife at $50,000 and for Briggs at 
$100,000. Uhler was to remain in jail overnight and have a bail hearing today.

2 ARRESTED OVER POINTING GUNS AT DRAG-RACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty U.S. Immigration and Naturalization officer and another man were 
arrested early Thursday after allegedly posing as police officers and holding 
guns on a group of youths who had gathered in Chatsworth for a drag-race, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Wilson, 26, an INS special agent, and Anthony Sabino, 26, a real estate 
agent, both of Chatsworth, were arrested about 2:30 a.m. in the parking lot of 
a Carl's Jr. at Lassen Street and De Soto Avenue, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
L. A. Durrer. Both men, who officers said appeared to be intoxicated, were 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and later released on 
$12,000 bail, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of people had gathered at Canoga Avenue and Lassen Street for a 
drag-race when the two suspects pulled up in a car, Durrer said. "They both 
pointed weapons at the persons who were apparently involved in drag-racing," 
Durrer said. "The two suspects identified themselves as police officers but did 
not show any identification." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search at Gunpoint 
</P>
<P>
After searching several members of the group at gunpoint, the two men got back 
in their car and followed some of them to the parking lot at Lassen and De 
Soto, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
There, the pair again drew their guns and began conducting another search when 
police officers on routine patrol arrested them, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 13 people who say they had weapons pointed at them" and who were 
physically searched by the men, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Durrer said it had not yet been determined whether the men were legally drunk 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
John Brechtel, an assistant district director with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said INS officers are allowed to carry guns. Brechtel 
said the internal affairs division of the INS was looking into the matter but 
would not comment any further. 
</P>
<P>
Police said several victims were driving high-performance cars and were getting 
ready to race when the incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently drag-racing occurs periodically" where the victims were accosted, 
Durrer said.

NEWSWIRE: ROSE CHECK DISCOVERED IN GAMBLING RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bank check from Pete Rose to a man later convicted of bookmaking was found 
during a 1984 gambling raid, the Boston Herald and the Providence (R.I.) 
Journal-Bulletin reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers, quoting unidentified sources, said Rose bet with Joseph Cambra 
of Somerset, Mass., and gave him his 1975 World Series championship ring as 
payment for a gambling debt. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators reportedly examined the alleged check from Rose to Cambra but 
returned it because it could not be linked directly to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald also reported that the alleged bookmaker stayed with the Cincinnati 
Reds at a Florida hotel during spring training this year and received the team 
rate.

LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE SETTLES SUIT ON FUNDING WOMEN'S SPORTS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a court settlement ending a 4 1/2-year-old challenge to sports funding at 
Long Beach City College, the school has agreed to expand its women's athletic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced Thursday, settles a Superior Court suit filed by six 
LBCC coaches and a group of students who claimed that the college was violating 
state anti-sex discrimination laws by underfunding and understaffing women's 
athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the settlement calls for LBCC to hire a full-time women's 
athletic director, create a separate women's training facility and hire three 
new full-time women's coaches, a separate women's athletic trainer and a sports 
information director. In addition, the school will pay the plaintiffs and their 
attorneys $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Sloniger, the college's vice president of student services, said school 
officials do not believe that they discriminated against women athletes. 
Although some men's sports, such as football, receive more money than teams for 
women, the school funded teams in "every sport women were allowed to compete 
in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree that the athletic program has not been a good one," Sloniger 
said, adding that the college agreed to the settlement to avoid the expense of 
a lengthy trial.

In six years of motorcycle racing at its highest level -- the world 500cc road 
racing series -- Eddie Lawson of Upland won championships in 1984, 1986 and 
1988 riding a Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, in one of the most startling switches in cycling 
history, Lawson took his No. 1 plate and moved to Yamaha's bitter rival, Honda. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in the Dunlop United States International Grand Prix at Laguna Seca, 
Lawson will be trying to win his first trophy in three races on the Honda to go 
alongside the one he won in the same race last year on a Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>
The cycling press, shocked at the development, was quick to claim that Lawson's 
move was a buyout by the larger Japanese bike manufacturer. Lawson says, 
however, that the reason was not money, that he took a cut to make the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of a lot of things, but mostly it was a feeling I had 
that Yamaha was not really behind me the way I felt they should be," Lawson 
said after flying home from a race last Sunday at Phillip Island, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"After six years, maybe the team got too relaxed. I don't really know what 
happened, but it didn't seem as though the team was working together with the 
same purpose, so about halfway through the season I contacted Erv Kanemoto 
about riding for him on a Honda. I had heard that he was putting together a new 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Kanemoto, a longtime Grand Prix team manager from San Jose, handled the 
wrenches for Freddie Spencer when the Louisiana rider was a three-time world 
champion. Curiously, Spencer came out of an injury-induced year's retirement 
last month to take Lawson's former Yamaha ride. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, in the seven races remaining in 1988 after Lawson, Kanemoto and 
Honda began their hush-hush negotiations, the soft-spoken Southern Californian 
won three of them, including the season finale in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson will not say so himself, but his manager, Gary Howard of Anaheim, says 
the lack of confidence on Lawson's part came from the way that team manager Kel 
Carruthers and owner Giacomo Agostini romanced Kevin Schwantz, the young Suzuki 
rider from Texas, who won the opening race in Japan. Schwantz elected to remain 
with Suzuki, but Lawson apparently saw it as a breach of faith. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, I have been pleased with the move," Lawson said. "Erv is very 
professional, an easy guy to work with, and we seem to think along the same 
lines. We're both geared to the same thing, and that's to win another world 
championship. We both know what it takes to win, because we've both been 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson finished third, back of fellow Americans Schwantz and Wayne Rainey of 
Downey, in the opening race at Suzuka, Japan, and fifth in Australia. He trails 
Rainey and 1987 world champion Wayne Gardner of Australia in the points after 
two of the series' 15 races. 
</P>
<P>
The switch also brought together the two riders who fought one another so 
bitterly through the past several seasons -- Lawson and Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, they are not teammates. Lawson rides for Team Rothmans Kanemoto 
Honda, and Gardner, who has been the No. 1 factory rider since 1986, rides for 
Team Rothmans Honda. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the same bikes from the factory, and we have the same sponsor, but Erv 
prepares my bike and has nothing to do with Gardner's," Lawson explained. "And 
unlike factory rider teammates, we don't share any tricks or ideas we come up 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as Lawson was dethroning Gardner as world champion, stories 
persisted that there was bad blood between them. Lawson says it was overblown 
by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never close friends, but it wasn't as bad as it was made out," he 
said. "We had no problems. We would say hello to one another and keep on going. 
We were not friends, but we were not unfriendly, is how I'd put it. It's hard 
to be friends with someone you're riding hard against every week for the world 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
The world champion came home hurting, however. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, although looking as lean and whippet-like as the day he graduated from 
Chaffey High School in 1976, arrived here with a right wrist -- the throttle 
wrist -- still tender from a cracked bone, a sore left leg, a pulled back 
muscle, a stiff neck, an aching collarbone and a bruised left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of a mess, but I hope to be healed up by Sunday," Lawson said with 
the trace of a smile. "It's just been bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
The cracked right wrist came from a fall March 13 while testing the new bike in 
the rain in Japan. The pulled back muscle came from stretching exercises and 
was so painful that Lawson said it was several days before he could sit back in 
a chair. 
</P>
<P>
All the other hurts came from a 150-m.p.h. spill, two days before the Australia 
Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just beginning to feel better when I came up on Kevin Magee, one of 
Kenny Roberts' Yamaha guys, going through a high-speed corner. When he 
straightened up, I was in the wrong place with nowhere to go. I got out in the 
grass, the bike started wobbling and sent me over the handlebars. The bar 
caught my leg when we came down and I couldn't move the leg for a couple of 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a freak deal, but it kind of messed me up. I was glad to get fifth 
(in Australia) with all that was hurting. It was awful frustrating, and 
embarrassing, to know I had such a fast bike and couldn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he won there last year, Laguna Seca may prove frustrating, too. It 
is the most physically demanding course on the Grand Prix circuit with its 11 
turns (four right, seven left) over a hilly 2.196 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"You're continually leaning, braking, shifting and accelerating. It's the 
slowest track we race on all year and I just hope I'm well enough to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson has won five times at Laguna Seca, twice on Superbikes and twice on 
250cc bikes in national championship races in addition to last year's world 
500cc event. 
</P>
<P>
"One nice thing about Laguna Seca, this year at least, is that we get a week 
off after the race before heading for Spain," Lawson said. "I need a few days 
to enjoy my new place." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson has been home only two weeks, mostly a day or two at a time, since last 
January, when he moved into the $1-million mansion he had built in the hills 
above Upland. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been in it for more than a couple of days when we went to Japan to 
test," he said. "Then we came home for a few days before we went to Brazil for 
some tire testing. From there we went to Australia to check out the new course 
in Phillip Island. 
</P>
<P>
"We came home for a few more days until we left March 10 for Japan, and I 
didn't get home until April 10. I got in Monday night, stayed through Tuesday 
and left for Laguna Seca the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
On April 30 he will be in Jerez, Spain, to start a string of 11 races in Europe 
that will include Misano, Italy; Hockenheim, West Germany; Salzburg, Austria; 
Rijeka, Yugoslavia; Assen, Holland; Francorchamps, Belgium; Le Mans, France; 
Donington, England; Anderstorp, Sweden, and Brno, Czechoslovakia. The season 
will end Sept. 17 in Goiania, Brazil.

NEW JONES ON TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG P.J. IS TRYING TO FOLLOW IN DAD PARNELLI'S FOOTSTEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Auto racing people always thought that Parnelli Jones quit too soon -- only 34 
when he ran his last Indianapolis 500 in 1967, retiring to build a string of 
tire stores and compete in the occasional, casual celebrity event. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time for a comeback. Former peers such as Mario Andretti and A.J. 
Foyt can still make a living driving Indy cars, but the celebrities are getting 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has finished down the track or against the wall in the last six 
Pro/Celebrity Races he has run at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach since 
posting his only victory in 1980, when he was only 47. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been second every year -- you notice that?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look now, but here comes P.J. Jones, Parnelli's eldest son and heir, 
filling up his father's rear-view mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Both will be competing in the celebrity event at Long Beach Saturday, a warm-up 
for P.J. to the HFC American Racing Series event Sunday morning that he hopes 
will eventually lead him to Indy, where his father won in '63, six years before 
P.J. was born. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe P.J. will be able to help Saturday. The Joneses and the other pros, Dan 
Gurney and Jeff Andretti, must give the celebrities a 30-second head start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather see him win than another one of the pros," P.J. said. "It might be 
a team thing for the first few laps. We'll have to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parnelli: "I told him that, but he's a businessman. He said, 'Maybe 
Gurney'll pay me more.' " 
</P>
<P>
More seriously, they will be talking about P.J.'s plan for the ARS race, one of 
a series of 12 races for identical open-wheel cars that parallel the CART 
Indy-car circuit as supporting events. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm aiming toward Indy cars," Jones said. "That's been my goal since I 
was a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
In those days, when his retired father was running Indy-car teams, racing was 
already P.J.'s world. 
</P>
<P>
"A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Mario (Andretti) -- I grew up around them, with their 
sons around," P.J. said 
</P>
<P>
But when P.J. and Parnelli's younger son Page, now 16, were ready to start 
racing Go Karts, their parents struck a deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go to college," P.J. said. "It's always been a deal that as long as 
I'm in school they'll continue to help me. They want me to go to school as long 
as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli, a high school dropout, said: "Both my sons, I've cut their racing off 
once each and told 'em they couldn't race until they got their grades up. 
That's worked well, and for that I've been rewarded with a couple of boys that 
haven't been in any kind of trouble (and) have a great interest in a direction 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
P.J. grew up as a Go Kart hotshot, then broke into the local big-time at Ascot 
Park where Parnelli once raced. The year before P.J. graduated from Miraleste 
High School in '87, he was already the USAC West Coast Midget circuit's rookie 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He now attends El Camino College in Torrance and is taking classes in business, 
small business management and marketing -- lessons his father learned from his 
late mentor, J.C. Agajanian, and longtime business partner Vel Miletich. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets harder and harder to make classes every day, with all the things you 
have to do along with racing, especially when I'm traveling back East," P.J. 
said. "But I feel I'm learning something just being there when I can." 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli would prefer his son succeed on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries not to help me out of his own pocket," P.J. said. "That's always been 
the basic agreement. He told me flat out when I started racing that he wasn't 
gonna pay for my racing. I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
P.J.'s full name is Parnell Velko Jones, the middle name borrowed from 
Miletich. He'll turn 20 on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli has said the last few years that racing was never nearly as hard on 
him as watching his son race. His heart was in his mouth again during last 
weekend's ARS race at Phoenix when P.J. became involved in a five-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when you're at the control of an automobile, you feel more secure 
than riding with somebody," Parnelli said. "That's your own flesh and blood out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up on a motor home and it happened right in front of me. I could see he 
wasn't taking any jolts, so I didn't feel too concerned -- other than it might 
catch on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Among race drivers of his era, the smooth and skillful Parnelli was known for 
not crashing. Some experts felt nobody else could have handled the tricky new 
four-wheel drive turbine car as well as he did when he ran away with the Indy 
race in '67 before a bearing failed with four laps to go, leaving him sitting 
by the side of the track. 
</P>
<P>
It may be too early to tell whether the genes and advice have been passed on 
successfully to P.J. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm conservative, yet I'll hang it out," P.J. says. "If you're leading the 
race there's no reason to hang it out. I don't want to be rubbing the fence, 
for my own personal interest. I like walking. I don't like crashing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tested at Phoenix (last week), he said, 'Just run some laps. You don't 
have to be the quickest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Parnelli: "P.J.'s going through a different learning curve. Today's racing 
is a lot tougher because they have all these driving schools and more types of 
racing. Then, you just had to be very aggressive. It's tougher today for young 
guys to get a break because it's a financial battle, but there are a lot of 
talented drivers out there." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's race will be their first race as rivals. "We've run together on 
motorcycles and snowmobiles but nothing organized," P.J. said. "I keep thinking 
that I know all his tricks, so I may have a little bit of an advantage."

<P>
OILERS HAD EVERYTHING GOING THEIR WAY BEFORE LETTING THE KINGS GET AWAY 
</P>

</DATELINE>

<P>
The Edmonton Oilers had it in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
Their Smythe Division semifinal series against the Kings was waiting to be 
wrapped up Thursday night at the Northlands Coliseum, where the defending 
Stanley Cup champions had won 14 consecutive playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, though, were shut out in the last 59 minutes 27 seconds and were 
beaten at home in the playoffs for the first time since May 26, 1987, when the 
Philadelphia Flyers outscored them, 4-3, in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
How did they feel? 
</P>
<P>
Most didn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' leader, Mark Messier, was dressed and out the door before reporters 
were allowed into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates hid in areas off-limits to the media. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' 4-1 victory evened the best-of-seven series at 3-3 and forced a 
deciding game Saturday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating for us," the Oilers' Jimmy Carson said. "We're 
disappointed. We wanted to finish it off here. We had a great opportunity. Now 
we've got to do it the hard way." 
</P>
<P>
Or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 3-1 lead in the series, the Oilers are on the verge of being 
eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They've lost two straight games. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the Stanley Cup for the fourth time in five years last season, they 
lost only twice in 18 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
What will it take for them to win Game 7 in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm the wrong guy to ask," said Carson, formerly a member of the Kings, 
who had lost seven straight postseason road games before rallying from a 1-0 
deficit Thursday night. "I've never been in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Oilers have. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. came in here and had to win and they did," Oiler Coach Glen Sather said. 
"We'll just have to go down there and do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew going into this series that it wasn't going to be easy. But if we've 
got any mettle, we'll go down there and win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Sather is concerned about the Oilers' lack of productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton has scored only three goals in two games and in the first two periods 
of Game 6 had only nine shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't score on any of the shots that you don't take," Sather said. "We 
haven't taken enough shots. We threw the puck around a lot tonight, and when we 
had opportunities to shoot, we didn't shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"For a team that usually takes a lot of shots and scores a lot of goals . . . 
we've stopped scoring." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, though, didn't lack opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a point-blank shot by Jari Kurri that ricocheted off the left post 
early in the second period would have put the Oilers ahead, 2-0, and might have 
finished off the Kings, Sather suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been the series," he said. "They would have folded the tents, 
more than likely, and we would have gotten better." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Kings got stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"We seemed to get tired, especially in the second period," Sather said. "That 
really surprised me. We've been going with four lines most of the series and 
they've mostly been using three." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Allison, who had played in only two previous games because of knee and 
back injuries, finally pulled the Kings even at 16:22 of the second period, 
dragging Oiler defenseman Randy Gregg around the back of the net before 
slipping a shot past Oiler goaltender Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
"He could probably do that 100 times and he wouldn't score again," Sather said 
of Allison. 
</P>
<P>
This, though, was not to be the Oilers' night. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were impressed by the capacity crowd of 16,005 at the Forum for the 
Kings' 4-2 victory Tuesday night in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see a building that doesn't need a noise meter," Oiler farmhand 
Daryl Reaugh told the Edmonton Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of the Oilers, who have won four Stanley Cups in five 
years, crowds at the Northlands Coliseum are mostly subdued. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings last reached the seventh game of a playoff series in 1976, losing the 
deciding game of a quarterfinal series to the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers have never played a seventh game on the road.

TOKYO FIRM NOW RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB'S SOLE OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese real estate company that emerged last summer as the mystery investor 
in the Riviera Country Club completed purchase Thursday of the landmark 
168-acre golf and tennis resort in Pacific Palisades amid reports that club 
members' uneasiness over the firm's secretiveness has abated. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin Shoji Ltd. of Tokyo said it will pay slightly more than $55 million in 
cash for the remaining 51% interest in the country club. Last August, Marukin 
paid $52.9 million for a 49% interest in the country club partnership -- which 
consists of Laaco Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Riviera Country Club 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"We value and respect the current club members and have assured them of our 
intention to operate these clubs as first-class facilities," Kaneo Watanabe, 
the 70-year-old president of Marukin, said in a statement released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Public Comment 
</P>
<P>
Kaneo Watanabe and his son, Noburo Watanabe, 44, established Marukin in 1969. 
The family originally operated a textile business in the Yamanashi area near 
Mt. Fuji before developing its Tokyo-based real estate, construction and 
engineering company, which has assets of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The country club purchase is the first American business venture for the 
Watanabes, who are avid golfers. But, according to sources close to the talks, 
the transaction was handled in the more formal business style of Tokyo rather 
than in the more laid-back style of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin officials, for example, allegedly spent weeks searching stores for just 
the right items to fulfill the Japanese business tradition of giving small 
gifts to thank business associates. They huddled for weeks over the precise 
wording of the public statement they would make about the sale and then closely 
supervised the Japanese-to-English translation when they sent the statement to 
Los Angeles. And Marukin and Laaco agreed that officials from neither company 
would talk publicly about the sale after it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of business approach initially ignited concern among club members a 
year ago when Laaco announced that it sold the entire 62-year-old club for $108 
million to an unidentified Japanese firm. Laaco refused to give any details, 
causing an uproar among the club's 635 members, which include some of Southern 
California's prominent business executives. 
</P>
<P>
Club members, who pay a $25,000 initiation fee and at least $3,870 in annual 
dues, said they feared that the club would be made into a commercial 
development, that some members would be forced out or that dues would be 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Have Eased 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph R. Rosenberg, chairman of Riviera's Board of Governors, said 
members' concerns have since subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had conversations and private meetings with (club) officials and there is 
every indication that (the sale) will sit well with the membership," said 
Rosenberg, noting that Marukin has indicated that it plans to upgrade 
facilities and restrict membership because of concerns that there was too much 
wear and tear on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"The members support those types of moves," Rosenberg said. "I'd be very 
surprised if the members of the club did not hold them (Marukin) in high 
regard." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hathaway, general partner of Laaco, declined to comment on the sale. But 
in an interview with The Times in December he said members had become more 
comfortable with the club's new owner. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that the members who have had an opportunity to meet with them 
(Marukin) are quite pleased," Hathaway said. "They've discovered that these 
people love golf. What is happening is that when people get to know these 
folks, they're becoming quite friendly to them." 
</P>
<P>
Laaco Ltd. is a limited partnership that owns the Los Angeles Athletic Club and 
the California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
An article in the April 14 Business section incorrectly reported that Marukin 
Shoji Ltd. of Japan has completed the purchase of the Riviera Country Club. 
Marukin Shoji, which holds a 49% stake in a partnership that owns the Riviera 
Country Club and Riviera Tennis Club, intends to exercise an option to purchase 
the remaining 51% from Los Angeles-based LAACO Ltd. Completion of the deal is 
expected by Aug. 31.

THE DREXEL SETTLEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DREXEL DOESN'T EXPECT DEAL TO HURT ITS 'JUNK BOND' UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Drexel Burnham Lambert's lucrative high-yield "junk bond" department in Beverly 
Hills must undergo several notable managerial and policy changes -- including 
the firing of junk bond impresario Michael Milken -- following the firm's 
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But the unit that generates as much as half of Drexel's profit and made the 
firm a Wall Street giant will be allowed to stay in Beverly Hills. And its 
basic ability to conduct trading and other activities are not expected to be 
significantly hindered, company officials and industry observers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This should have no material effect on their ability to distribute high-yield 
securities," said Marshall V. Davidson, a former managing director at Drexel 
who now holds a similar title at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We've structured the settlement in such a way to enable us to continue to 
function efficiently and close to normal, if not better than that," Drexel 
spokesman Steven Anreder said. 
</P>
<P>
The key victory for Drexel was winning the SEC's consent to let the junk bond 
department stay in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no reason the firm couldn't trade junk bonds out of New York, 
the firm was concerned that many of its key people in Beverly Hills -- with 
their families and lives settled in Southern California -- would not have 
wanted to move east. Milken moved the department to Southern California in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Drexel mounted a lobbying effort, including pleas from key 
California legislators and clients, to persuade the SEC to allow the junk bond 
unit to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills operation must, however, undertake several key measures to 
tighten oversight and separate certain functions to reduce potential for abuse. 
Among the changes: 
</P>
<P>
* Drexel can no longer employ or do business with Milken, its longtime junk 
bond chief, who is singularly responsible for transforming Drexel from a Wall 
Street doormat in the 1970s to a powerhouse in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Industry opinion is mixed on how well Drexel can retain its market share in 
junk bonds in the post-Milken era. But without Milken, the firm earlier this 
year pulled off the major part of the biggest junk bond financing in history 
for the takeover of RJR Nabisco. And one thing is agreed: The firm is loaded 
with highly talented traders and investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
* A new Capital Markets Services Department will be created, separate from the 
junk bond unit, to minimize potential insider trading, market manipulation or 
other abuses. That department will be headed by Peter Ackerman, a skilled deal 
maker and Milken's former right-hand man. 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman's department, however, will still work closely with the junk bond 
unit, designing, pricing and marketing new junk bond issues and developing and 
maintaining relationships with investment banking clients. 
</P>
<P>
* Drexel will transfer equity and convertible securities trading activities in 
Beverly Hills to New York. Previously part of the high-yield department, those 
functions are not seen as critical to junk bond trading. The bulk of Drexel's 
equity trading was already based in New York anyway. Only about 20 employees 
will be affected and many, if not all, may remain in Beverly Hills and join the 
junk bond department, Drexel spokesman Anreder said. 
</P>
<P>
* An unnamed member of Drexel's executive committee, acceptable to the SEC, 
will reside in the Los Angeles area and supervise the Beverly Hills operation 
-- including junk bonds, capital markets services and corporate finance. 
Previously no individual held that role, although John H. Kissick, acting chief 
of the junk bond department since March and highest ranking official in Beverly 
Hills, is a member of Drexel's board. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also must take other steps to boost oversight, including the posting of 
at least three compliance officers in the junk bond unit, reporting to Drexel's 
compliance director in New York.

THE ANNUAL H&amp;R BLOCK PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
VETERAN TAX PREPARER STAYS NO. 1 BY STICKING TO ITS CORE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Any business would love to have loyal customers like Ginny Wetzel. The La 
Canada housewife and former insurance agent has used the same tax preparer for 
about seven years, and she doesn't plan to change. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a good reputation," she says of her preparation firm. "And they 
save me money," she adds, noting that she received a refund of $1,000 last year 
after not expecting any money back. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel's tax preparer is not a high-powered accounting firm or hotshot tax 
attorney. It's H&amp;R Block. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its reputation as the low-priced plain vanilla of tax preparation, 
H&amp;R Block continues to dominate that otherwise fragmented business, thanks 
in part to loyal clients like Wetzel. 
</P>
<P>
H&amp;R Block's name is synonymous with tax preparation. As this year's 
tax-filing season winds to a close, Block will prepare one of every 10 
individual tax returns, and two of every 10 who use professional preparers. No 
other firm comes close to Block's market share. Three of every four clients 
each year are repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of many industries where one firm dominates so greatly," says 
David W. Lieberman, president of Triple Check Income Tax Service in Burbank, a 
distant second behind Block among tax preparation franchise chains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dominance Pays Off 
</P>
<P>
That dominance had paid off at the bottom line. Block's earnings have risen 
steadily for more than a decade, and cash dividends have been raised in each 
calendar year since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Kansas City-based Block is not without its problems or challenges. 
The firm's moves in recent years to reduce its dependence on the cyclical tax 
preparation field -- while generally regarded as successful -- lately have run 
into snags. 
</P>
<P>
And continuing to wring more and more growth out of its bread-and-butter 
business is a difficult feat because of its already large market share. 
Although the firm gained market share last year as tax reform prompted more 
taxpayers to seek professional assistance, the firm cannot expect Congress to 
tinker with the tax laws every year. The firm's growth in new clients so far 
this year has fallen below some analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
But Block appears in virtually no danger of losing dominance in its core 
business -- a status earned and maintained in part because it was the first 
with the most, analysts and competitors say. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, founded in 1955 in Kansas City by brothers Richard and Henry Bloch, 
was really the first to franchise tax preparation services nationally under a 
single name, Triple Check's Lieberman says. It now operates about 7,500 offices 
nationwide, targeting low- to middle-income taxpayers who don't want to do 
their own returns yet also don't want to pay the higher prices charged by 
accountants, enrolled agents and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fee Went Down 
</P>
<P>
Block's average fee actually went down last year, to just under $50, largely 
because tax reform made completing returns simpler and quicker for many 
taxpayers who do not itemize. This year, however, the average fee is expected 
to increase slightly but still stay around $50, says Thomas M. Bloch, H&amp;R 
Block's president of tax operations. 
</P>
<P>
Others have tried to emulate Block's formula, but with little success. Often 
it's been a story of too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
"They have such an extensive advertising budget and so many offices," Lieberman 
says. "Their physical presense is hard to overcome. They've made themselves 
available to such a wide group, it's become an institution that is somewhat 
hard to combat." 
</P>
<P>
Company co-founder Henry Bloch's name has become such a household word through 
the firm's own advertising that he is currently featured in radio and 
television ads promoting a rebate program offered by Subaru, the Japanese auto 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
The Block firm has also maintained its market share by stressing quality -- and 
achieving it. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, Bloch says, stands behind its work, offering such services as 
accompanying clients in audits at no additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep coming back because they're satisfied," says Hannah Bruce, an 
analyst who follows Block for the investment firm of Tucker, Anthony &amp; R. 
L. Day in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The high rate of repeat business is remarkable when one considers that Block's 
force of tax preparers is seasonal by nature. Many carry other jobs the rest of 
the year or are retirees who want to keep active and earn a few bucks on the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
But about three-fourths of its preparers come back every year, keeping 
satisfied customers coming back as well, analyst Bruce says. 
</P>
<P>
The low rate of preparer turnover stems in part from the firm's incentive pay 
and commission structure, which includes giving preparers a percentage of the 
revenue they produce each tax season. That percentage starts at 20% for 
first-year preparers and rises one point each year until it tops out at 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"The more hours you work and the more returns you prepare, the more you make," 
Thomas Bloch says. 
</P>
<P>
Block also resists the temptation to offer a broader range of accounting 
services, or financial planning. "We do not want to become the supermarket of 
financial services," Bloch says. "We know what we do well and want to stick 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "We believe in specialization. If you want advice on stocks or 
municipal bonds, that is not our forte." 
</P>
<P>
But to provide more stability to its highly seasonal earnings stream -- it 
loses money in all quarters but the one during tax preparation season -- the 
firm began to diversify several years ago. It now owns CompuServe, a major 
computer services business; Personnel Pool of America, a leading supplemental 
personnel agency, and Path Industries, a business seminar and training concern. 
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts following H&amp;R Block have lowered their earnings 
estimates for it this year, in part because of difficulties facing the non-tax 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel Pool is facing stiff competition and a slowdown in demand for 
temporary workers, says Emma W. Hill, an analyst at the New York investment 
house of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. In addition, Path Industries is suffering 
from slowing growth in revenue and higher costs, squeezing profits, Hill says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fallen Short 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, growth in the tax business has fallen short of some analysts' 
expectations for this year, perhaps because Congress did not significantly 
alter the tax laws for 1988. Thus, some taxpayers may have gone back to 
preparing their own returns. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the firm's Rapid Refund program may not be growing as rapidly as hoped, 
analyst Hill says. Under Rapid Refund, Block offers customers quicker refunds 
by filing returns directly with the IRS electronically through computers. Block 
has about 80% of the electronic filing business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these snags, analysts still expect earnings to rise in the current 
fiscal year from the $87.9 million that H&amp;R Block earned on revenue of 
$794.1 million in the year ended April 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Just over half of that revenue and nearly three-fourths of operating profits 
derived from tax preparation, analyst Bruce says. Thus, the biggest challenge 
facing the company, she says, continues to be how well it can continue to 
expand that core business. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bloch agrees. The firm's biggest task is to gain as customers some of 
the 55% of taxpayers -- more than 50 million households -- that don't use any 
tax preparer. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider them to be our biggest competitor," Bloch says.

3 CONSUMER GROUPS URGE BOYCOTT OF EXXON GASOLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three national consumer organizations are urging motorists to boycott Exxon 
gasoline to protest higher prices and the quality of the company's efforts to 
clean up its massive Alaskan oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition and the Chicago-based 
Citizen Action have joined forces to launch "Make Exxon Pay," a boycott 
campaign designed to protest the March 24 oil spill in Prince William Sound and 
the subsequent rise in gasoline prices. The two organizations are asking 
holders of Exxon Corp. credit cards to cut their cards into two pieces and send 
one half to the Citizen Action office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen Action, which has 2 million members and affiliate associations in 
California and 24 other states, began to accept credit cards Thursday. The 
organizations plan to deliver the card pieces to Exxon at the company's annual 
meeting May 18, according to Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of Citizen 
Action. Rothschild said Exxon is passing the cost of the spill cleanup to 
consumers by raising gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is pure and simple," Rothschild said. "We want to send Exxon 
management a message by getting as many people as possible to stop buying Exxon 
products. . . . Exxon was negligent in Alaska, and then the company asks 
consumers to shoulder the costs. We want to hit them where it hurts -- in the 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has been charging 6 to 11 cents more per gallon for its gasoline since 
the oil spill, but other oil companies have been charging an average of 7 to 12 
cents more per gallon during the same period, according to Leo McLean, an Exxon 
spokesman. McLean said some of the increase is because of increasing crude oil 
prices. Exxon had no immediate comment on claims that part of the price rise is 
related to the cleanup, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the boycott calls, Exxon has issued a statement reiterating 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that our effort in 
Alaska will convince them that we continue to be a responsible company," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a new group -- Citizens for Environmental Responsibility, Inc. -- 
contended that Exxon has bungled the cleanup and has also called for a boycott. 
The organization, based in Erie, Pa., is asking Exxon customers to split their 
Exxon cards and mail them to Exxon headquarters. Stephen Nissen, a Los 
Angeles-based spokesman, said his organization is made up of 12 organizers and 
100 volunteers. Nissen, a marketing consultant, said the organizers are 
professionals and entrepreneurs who want to prompt companies to change their 
attitudes about the environment.

LOCKHEED VOWS TO FIGHT ALL 440 OSHA CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM WILL ALSO CHALLENGE $1.5 MILLION IN FINES LEVIED AGAINST BURBANK PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed said Thursday that it will fight all 440 allegations of worker-safety 
violations that federal officials have lodged against the aerospace giant's 
Burbank plant, whose projects include the top-secret stealth fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed also plans to contest $1.5 million in fines that the U.S. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration said the company should pay because of the 
alleged violations, which OSHA announced March 24. The proposed fines were the 
largest since OSHA took over enforcement of job safety and health laws in 
California from state officials in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA alleged that Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., the division that runs the 
Burbank operations, mislabeled or failed to label chemical containers, failed 
to post mandatory health warnings to workers and kept poor records of which 
workers became sick or injured at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Willful' 
</P>
<P>
OSHA also asserted that 341 of the 440 alleged violations were "willful," 
which, under OSHA's rules, means that Lockheed either knew that a work site 
condition was a violation or was aware that an unsafe condition existed and 
made "no reasonable effort" to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lockheed Aeronautical President Kenneth Cannestra, in a letter sent to 
employees Thursday, said "we at LASC object strongly to the characterization of 
any of the alleged violations as being 'willful.' 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been Lockheed's intent to comply with all safety and health 
regulations," Cannestra said. "We will continue to cooperate fully with OSHA 
and other regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and health of our 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
The company had 15 working days to respond to the findings. During that period, 
Lockheed and OSHA held informal talks that might have led to a settlement of 
the allegations, but "we weren't able to resolve the matter in that time," said 
Frank Gravitt, OSHA's regional director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, which is based in Calabasas, will now formally contest the 
allegations before an administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Review Commission in Washington. If either side appeals the judge's 
ruling, the case will be decided by the three-member commission, Gravitt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Triggered Probe 
</P>
<P>
Gravitt said he did not know exactly when the case will be heard but said it is 
likely to be between two months and a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA cited Lockheed after a four-month investigation of some of its 200 
buildings in Burbank. The probe was triggered by workers' complaints that they 
became ill from working with chemicals and other hazardous materials at the 
plant and that they were not adequately protected from the materials or told of 
the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the materials are believed to be involved in making "composites" -- 
lightweight yet strong fibrous materials that are increasingly used in aircraft 
construction. Composites are particularly useful for radar-evading stealth 
airplanes because the materials do not reflect radar waves as easily as 
metal-bodied jets, making them more difficult to detect. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA is continuing to investigate Lockheed. In announcing the citations three 
weeks ago, OSHA said it also sent inspectors back for a "wall-to-wall" 
inspection of Lockheed's entire Burbank operations, which employ 14,000 people 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is also defending itself against several civil suits that have been 
filed since 1986 by about 90 current and former employees, who also alleged 
that they became ill while working at the Burbank plant. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the employees have contended that the OSHA citations, if upheld, would 
buttress their lawsuits. Lockheed spokesman James Ragsdale said last week that 
"it seems possible" that OSHA's report could be introduced into court, but he 
declined to speculate on how it might affect the outcome of the suits.

Trading Cola for Ships: Norwegian ship brokers have cooked up a deal in which 
Soviet shipyards may build up to 85 new vessels worth nearly $2.6 billion that 
will be partly paid for in Pepsi, pizza and fried chicken. Ole-Jacob Libaek, 
who helped broker the deal, said the U.S. soft-drink giant Pepsi-Cola Co. wants 
to replace vodka as the medium of payment for millions of dollars in products 
it exports annually to the Soviet Union. Libaek said, "Pepsi Cola is very big 
in the Soviet Union and the Russians also want Pizza Huts and Kentucky Fried 
Chicken," both owned by Pepsi. The Soviets "prefer to trade goods for goods 
because of their deficit of foreign currency," he said.

EDS Wins Round in Court: Electronic Data Systems Corp., a unit of General 
Motors, said it won a permanent injunction preventing H. Ross Perot, its 
founder and former chairman, from even thinking of going into business to make 
a profit until the end of the year. The injunction, issued in Virginia by 
Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge William Plummer, prevents Perot from 
engaging in, or even "contemplating," any for-profit business before Dec. 1. 
EDS said the court also ruled that Perot did not have special rights to hire 
EDS employees indefinitely as Perot had claimed. The judge ruled instead that 
such hiring rights will terminate Dec. 1, 1991, and the pool of EDS employees 
involved to those employed on Dec. 1, 1986. GM acquired EDS, a data processing 
company, from Perot for $2.5 billion in 1984.

Retail Sales Up 0.1%: Retail sales edged up a meager 0.1% last month after 
dropping sharply in February, the Commerce Department said in a report analysts 
cited as evidence that cautious consumer spending is moderating economic 
growth. Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $139.42 billion last month, held 
back by sluggish business at department stores and auto dealerships, the 
Commerce Department reported. Sales had plunged 0.6% in February. The weak 
figures for the past two months are consistent with a series of recent 
government reports that suggest slower economic growth lies ahead as the record 
peacetime expansion stretches in to its seventh year. "I don't think we are 
going to see a big slowdown or a caving in, but there is definitely a softer 
tone to growth and it is being driven by softer consumer spending," said 
economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. For the third straight month, overall 
sales in March were held down by a decline in spending on autos, which account 
for almost one-fourth of the retail total.

Oil Futures Fall: Energy futures prices retreated as some traders decided to 
cash in their holdings to take advantage of recent price rises. On the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 35 cents to close the day at $20.29 a 
barrel. Other contract months also fell. Among refined products, unleaded 
gasoline for May delivery fell 1.30 cents to 68.81 cents a gallon and heating 
oil for May delivery lost 1.06 cents to 52.14 cents a gallon.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: LOOKING FOR PENNIES FROM HEAVEN? SEARCH FOR AN 
'ANGEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many entrepreneurs still believe that professional venture capitalists provide 
seed money for most new businesses in America. But that is a myth, according to 
Robert J. Gaston, author of "Finding Private Venture Capital for Your Firm." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gaston contends that professional venture capitalists -- who reject 
about 99% of the deals they consider -- invest in only 2,100 of the 600,000 new 
businesses opening every year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That means that most entrepreneurs are getting money from private investors or 
"business angels," as Gaston calls them. 
</P>
<P>
"Angels put almost six of every 10 dollars in very small firms with less than 
four employees and sales of under $150,000 per year," Gaston said. He added 
that these business angels are scattered across the country and eager to invest 
in all kinds of businesses, not just those involved in high technology. Gaston 
bases his book on a five-year study of the actual experience of 435 such 
investors who invested $60 million between 1982 and 1987. The study was funded 
in part by the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, a banker and economist, estimates that each year 720,000 angels make 
490,000 investments in 87,000 entrepreneurial ventures. That translates into 
$56 billion in risk capital. 
</P>
<P>
And just who are Gaston's angels? His composite angel is a 47-year-old white 
male with a college degree in business or engineering. He is a business owner 
with entrepreneurial experience and income of $90,000 a year. A typical angel 
has a median net worth of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike professional venture capitalists who seek a rate of return of at least 
30%, Gaston's angels generally sought a 22% return on their investment. 
Preferring to keep an eye on their money, they usually invested in companies 
within 50 miles of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
On the receiving end is an entrepreneur who is typically a white male between 
25 and 35 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to another financial myth, Gaston says, angels do not limit their 
investments to high technology. 
</P>
<P>
Now that you know where the money really comes from, how does an eager 
entrepreneur find his or her angels? 
</P>
<P>
Word of mouth, happenstance and luck, says Frank Kilpatrick, a Manhattan Beach 
investment banker and financial consultant who specializes in helping companies 
write business plans and develop strategies to find money. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel investors will usually have some degree of familiarity with the business 
or industry," Kilpatrick said. "They feel they can contribute something 
tangible to the enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
To help entrepreneurs meet their angels, Kilpatrick co-founded the Stanford 
Entrepreneurial Forum -- a group of Stanford Business School alumni who review 
business plans and invite new business owners to make presentations to 
potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
He recommends that new business owners seek law and accounting firms that 
specialize in helping entrepreneurs, because the partners in such firms often 
have contacts in the business community. 
</P>
<P>
One 32-year-old Southern California entrepreneur agreed to discuss his 
frustrating search for venture capital if his company's name were not revealed. 
He said he is close to completing a financing arrangement and did not want to 
jeopardize its success. 
</P>
<P>
The man perfectly fits Gaston's definition of a hungry entrepreneur. For 10 
years he worked at a major Southern California aerospace firm in a mid-level, 
high-technology job. Eager to start his own business, he began developing a 
computer-based product designed to perform a task now done by antiquated 
equipment. His product is aimed at a specific industry, and he believes that it 
provides a breakthrough solution to a problem. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, he quit his job and moved into a tiny office behind his home. 
He wrote and rewrote a business plan before convincing one company that his new 
system would dramatically improve its operations. After several presentations 
and meetings, the company agreed to provide seed money in exchange for the 
privilege of buying the first system. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for $1.1 million and we have been criticized because our needs 
are too small," he said. "It might be easier to raise $30 million." 
</P>
<P>
After repeated rejections from professional venture capitalists, he began 
focusing his efforts on attracting business angels, mostly through personal 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he has raised an undisclosed amount from two such investors and one 
institution. And today, the fledgling company has a new office with five 
full-time and three part-time employees. He says the first prototype machine 
should be ready for demonstration by summer. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his experience, he suggests first looking for money from 
friends and relatives. "Spend two days with your address book, writing down the 
name of everyone who may have money. Then contact them," he advises. 
</P>
<P>
And he cautions against paying people who promise to help you raise money. "I'd 
say, do not spend money to get money unless you are completely lost." 
</P>
<P>
While he is not interested in borrowing money from anyone who wants to take 
over his company, he says he is willing to take on an experienced investor who 
wants to help him run things: "It's not how much money you get, but it's who 
you get it from." 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs interested in making presentations to the Stanford 
Entrepreneurial Forum should send two copies of their business plan to the 
Forum, P.O. Box 7861, Burbank, Calif., 91510. 
</P>
<P>
Two good books about finding venture capital are "Finding Private Venture 
Capital for Your Firm," by Robert J. Gaston and "The Arthur Young Guide to 
Raising Venture Capital," by G. Steven Burrill and Craig T. Norback. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston's book is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Business/Law/General Books 
division, 605 Third Ave., New York, N.Y. 10158-0012. 
</P>
<P>
The Arthur Young book includes a list of venture capital firms and is published 
by Liberty House, a division of TAB Books Inc., Blue Ridge Summit, Pa. 
17294-0214. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Climate 
</P>
<P>
The economic climate for small businesses declined slightly in the fourth 
quarter of 1988, despite a sharp increase in demand for goods and services, 
according to the American Express small business climate index. 
</P>
<P>
The index is a quarterly measure of four factors affecting businesses with 
fewer than 100 employees: financing costs, demand for goods and services, 
operating costs and optimism. The optimism factor is based on a survey taken by 
a national association of independent business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"The small business market is concerned about the prospect of inflation at this 
stage of the seven yearlong economic expansion," said David Birch, co-chairman 
of the American Express Small Business Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
He said operating costs rose 4.3% over the same period last year. Interest 
rates for commercial and industrial loans rose to 11.78% from 11.1%. But demand 
for small business products and services rose to an annualized rate of 7.8%, 
almost double the third quarter's 4% increase.

MAXICARE UNIT IN DALLAS WILL CLOSE APRIL 30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maxicare Health Plans, which has filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, said 
Thursday that it will close its 32,000-member Dallas health maintenance 
organization April 30. It will be the third such program Maxicare has 
dismantled in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Before its Chapter 11 filing for protection from creditors March 16, Los 
Angeles-based Maxicare had said Maxicare North Texas was among a core group of 
plans in 10 states -- out of 33 where it had operated -- that it intended to 
keep. 
</P>
<P>
However, "we were concerned that the current instability of the Dallas provider 
network could affect our ability to ensure continued health care to our 
members," Peter J. Ratican, Maxicare's chairman and chief executive, said in a 
prepared statement. The company was unable to find a qualified buyer for the 
plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare spokeswoman Tobi Nyberg explained that some health-care providers 
serving the Dallas members were experiencing financial difficulty. "We felt 
that because of those difficulties, we couldn't rely on them. There was no 
strong commitment," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said the financial problems of the Dallas providers were not related to 
debts owed by Maxicare. Maxicare North Texas owes at least $3 million to Texas 
health-care providers -- mostly hospitals -- according to a U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court filing describing unsecured claims by the Texas unit's 20 largest 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the planned closure, the Texas Department of Insurance said it will 
pursue its motion pending before the bankruptcy court in Santa Ana to withdraw 
Maxicare North Texas from the bankruptcy proceedings. The department wants to 
ensure that pending claims will be paid according to Texas law, department 
spokeswoman Dixie Evatt said.

Potlatch Corp.: The San Francisco-based manufacturer of forest products 
reported first-quarter earnings of $36 million, a gain of 35% over a year ago. 
Sales grew 15% to $297 million. The firm attributed the results to continuing 
strong market for pulp-based products. However, it did note that second-quarter 
results will be adversely affected by scheduled major maintenance shutdowns at 
its Lewiston, Ida. and Cypress Bend, Ark., mills.

ABBIE HOFFMAN: THE YIPPIE WHO STAYED IN TUNE WITH '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Froines hadn't seen much of Abbie Hoffman over the last few years. But 
they were thrown together nearly 20 years ago as members of the famous Chicago 
Seven who underwent a raucous 4 1/2-month trial stemming from street protests 
at the 1968 Democratic convention. And that often hard and bitter courtroom 
drama left Froines with an enduring fondness for the wild-haired counterculture 
guerrilla and Yippie leader who died Wednesday at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about great people and you think of John Kennedy or Winston 
Churchill," Froines, now a member of the public health faculty at UCLA, said 
Thursday. "But I think that with Abbie we've lost somebody who's very 
precious." 
</P>
<P>
Froines feelings were echoed by other Hoffman friends as they reminisced about 
the life of a man who delighted in questioning authority -- and making fun of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Krassner, who now lives in Venice but helped Hoffman found the Youth 
International Party in New York in late 1967, said he hoped that Hoffman will 
be remembered for his commitment to justice and reform. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for young people to know that there are creative ways 
of fighting city hall, which is what Abbie stood for," said Krassner, perhaps 
best known for the alternative magazine and newsletter -- The Realist -- that 
he has published since 1958. Krassner was not arrested or tried following the 
1968 demonstrations in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Krassner said the enduring lesson he learned from Hoffman was about the 
pervasive nature of politics. "Politics and culture are the same," he 
explained. "Our culture was our politics; you couldn't separate them." 
</P>
<P>
California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, another of the defendants in the Chicago 
Seven case, issued a statement through his office about Hoffman's passing. 
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and profoundly saddened by Abbie Hoffman's death. He was an 
important person of my generation and he will be dearly missed," Hayden's 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone was so effusive about Hoffman's often controversial political 
activism, especially those who were in positions to put his career in 
perspective. Said Mark Kann, a professor of political science at USC who was 
active in the anti-war movement but not a member of the Chicago Seven, "I think 
the '60s had some real impact on our society. Whether Abbie Hoffman had much 
impact I think is questionable. To me he represented this relatively small 
group that was terrific at getting publicity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Doubts' 
</P>
<P>
By doing "outrageous things," Kann said, Hoffman was "effective for a short 
while" at raising questions that needed to be raised. Did Hoffman and the 
Yippies provide answers to those questions? "I have serious doubts about that." 
</P>
<P>
Others who were on trial with Hoffman could not be reached for comment. At last 
report, former Yippie leader Jerry Rubin was running a New York company that 
produces parties for yuppies at Manhattan nightclubs. Lee Weiner is a 
consultant who operates a direct mail firm for nonprofit organizations and 
political clients from Washington, D.C. Rennie Davis reportedly still lives in 
the Denver area where he once sold life insurance. David Dellinger, a lifelong 
peace activist, is in his early 70s and lives in Peacham, Vt. Black Panther 
Bobby Seale, whose case was severed from the others and tried separately, works 
at Temple University in Philadelphia where he is doing graduate study in 
political science and African-American studies. 
</P>
<P>
Psychedelic drug guru Timothy Leary, who helped set the tone for the 1960s, 
offered a comment that placed Hoffman in a pantheon of heroes and anti-heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbie Hoffman was an American legend. He was up there in the hall of fame with 
rebel Huck Finn, rowdy Babe Ruth, crazy Lenny Bruce," Leary told the Associated 
Press. "He was the Pete Rose of the '60s counterculture, a hustler, a base 
stealer, a wild free spirit and a gambler. He is a historic figure and a great 
American and I loved the guy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Serious Social Critic' 
</P>
<P>
Paul Von Blum, a lecturer at UCLA since 1980 and a friend of Krassner who was 
involved early on in the nonviolent civil rights movement, said, "For all his 
image as a kind of buffoon and clown, I think Abbie Hoffman was a very serious 
social critic in the historical grain of American social critics. There is an 
entire generation of academics and others who are his moral legacy." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman gained national attention as a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of 
radicals who led hundreds of protesters at the 1968 Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago. They were later charged with conspiracy to incite 
violence at the convention. The defendants, particularly Hoffman and Rubin, 
turned the court into a theater with antics that included wearing judicial 
robes to court, taking them off and stomping on them. 
</P>
<P>
Krassner said that though Hoffman's fortunes waxed and waned he remained 
committed to his brand of politics, which mixed activism with humor. "Abbie, if 
he had chose to, could have been a very successful political satirist," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was reported to be suffering lingering pain from an automobile accident 
and to have been depressed just before he was found dead by his landlord in his 
Pennsylvania apartment. One report described Hoffman's residence as a converted 
chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Krassner said, Hoffman was working with a co-author 
on a book about political campaigns as well as continuing to speak on the 
lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, Hoffman traveled to Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn., where he participated in a panel discussion with other '60s 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
There Hoffman criticized today's campuses as "bastions of rest," and said the 
interest young people have in the '60s disturbed him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nostalgia is a sign of middle-age," he said before his Vanderbilt appearance. 
"We're reminiscing about our youth. When you see young people nostalgic for a 
youth they didn't even experience, it's a little sad. They're supposed to be 
out making one for themselves."

THERE'S STILL A ROAR COMING FROM KNIEVEL CLAN, BUT IT'S NO LONGER THE OLD MAN'S 
CYCLE 
</P>

<P>
Wouldn't you like to be Evel Knievel's son? 
</P>
<P>
 -- One pudgy adolescent to another, poolside at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
For the better part of a decade, he was America's human Rorschach test. 
</P>
<P>
Each time Evel Knievel launched his motorcycle and splattered, folks ogled the 
splotch of broken bones and pondered its meaning. Some saw courage and 
determination, or at least old-fashioned hucksterism at its finest. Others saw 
stupidity personified. 
</P>
<P>
A calm of sorts fell over the country when Evel finally abandoned the daredevil 
circuit almost 10 years ago. But this evening, Knievel's 26-year-old son Robbie 
is scheduled to race a motorcycle up a ramp and fly over the same Caesars 
Palace fountain that put his father into a coma in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Now anyone who's conscious can hear the roar of a seemingly distant era, as the 
massive engines of the Knievel hype machine once again rev up past the red 
line. What isn't clear, though, is whether the silver-haired man is still at 
the throttle or just going along for the ride behind the people who hope to use 
his publicity value as a ramp for launching Robbie into big-time celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Living Legend 
</P>
<P>
Evel the Elder was revved pretty high himself this week as he limped through 
the kitschy opulence of the Caesars casino, fielding phone calls, snapping out 
orders, schmoozing with well-wishers and barking playful insults at the 
hangers-on and friends swarming around the man being billed as a living legend. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Knievel's hard, no-remorse stare, though, there's a hint that perhaps 
the legend was too hard won. When he says he wishes his son would find another 
line of work, it sounds like more than Knievel melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
Knievel's rise from Butte, Mont., hubcap thief to folk hero can be charted 
through his X-rays as easily as through the photographs of his gaudy stunts. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime Event Television, which will broadcast Robbie's jump to pay-per-view 
customers tonight, provided a publicity kit listing the elder daredevil's 
"career highlights." Leading off with this highlight -- "April, 1967: Suffered 
severe groin and other injuries trying to jump over a motorcycle heading 
straight for him at 60 miles per hour in Barstow, Calif., hospitalized for 
weeks" -- it reads more like a trauma center log than a resume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broken Bones 
</P>
<P>
By 1971, the media were braying that Knievel had broken more than 100 bones. A 
decade later, the Guinness Book of Records put the figure at 433. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Knievel says he only broke about 35 bones in 14 or so major accidents. 
</P>
<P>
But no one doubts that morbid fascination had much to do with his spiraling 
fame, as Knievel went from jumping a pit of rattlesnakes in Butte to leaping 
over cars, then heaps of cars, then Mack trucks, double-decker buses and a tank 
full of sharks. 
</P>
<P>
"Knievelmania" hit its apex in 1974, when the Evel One tried to ride a 
rocket-powered "sky cycle" over the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
"The witless Knievel is titillating a barbaric appetite for treating violent 
death as a spectator sport," columnist George Will wrote at the time. "Like 
pornography, the event is brutalizing, anti-life." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments, though, didn't keep folks from flocking to the site, where a 
full-fledged '60s style "happening" developed. 
</P>
<P>
The jump itself was a fiasco. Knievel's parachute went off prematurely and the 
daredevil floated back to the side of the canyon from which he took off. But 
the fizzle did nothing to slow his skyrocketing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1974 Christmas season, sales of the Evel Knievel toy "action figure" 
blew away G.I. Joe; over the next few years, Knievel stunt cycles, flags and 
radios grossed between $100 million and $200 million. In the manner of a true 
cultural phenomenon, Knievel even had his own "Evel Knievel syndrome" bestowed 
upon him by a London dentist, who warned that impressionable British teen-agers 
were knocking their teeth out in attempts to jump bicycles over obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Just as broken bones made his career, they also effectively ended it. In 1977, 
Knievel took offense at what he saw as an unflattering account written by a 
former business partner. Armed with a baseball bat from Sear's, he and an 
accomplice broke the man's wrist and fractured his arm, because, Knievel later 
explained: "You write with your hands." 
</P>
<P>
Knievel was sentenced to 180 days in a Los Angeles County work-furlough 
program. Like everything he did, he turned it into a publicity stunt. When 
people complained he was going to his daily job in a chauffeured Stutz di 
Italia, Knievel sent a dozen Cadillac limos to the Los Angeles jail to pick up 
other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
He never could kick-start his career again, though, and in 1980, he finally 
resigned himself to making goofy golf bets and peddling the Western-style 
paintings he produced. 
</P>
<P>
And, from time to time, he has tried to fire up some publicity for his handsome 
son, who so far keeps plunging into the chasm of facelessness, in spite of -- 
or perhaps because of -- the fact that he's a much better motorcycle stunt 
jumper than his father ever was. 
</P>
<P>
So it is that Showtime and Caesars latched onto Knievel -- or vice versa -- and 
sent the two scurrying across the country on a publicity blitz. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that the father and son landed in Vegas, where they got things 
rolling with a press conference, then swaggered into a barrage of live radio 
and television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Advice 
</P>
<P>
"We went into this with a 96% awareness level of who Evel is," said Suzan 
Couch, a marketing consultant for Showtime. "More people were aware of him than 
George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Get that woman away from me," Knievel would bellow when she was out of 
earshot, tossing in one of the many expletives that riddle his often uproarious 
tough-guy patter. "I need her baby-sitting me like I need a hole in the head." 
</P>
<P>
On the air, his personality mellowed only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"When Robbie was a little boy, he used to hold me in his arms and promise me he 
wouldn't do what I did for a living. He broke his promise," Evel repeated as he 
and his son sat side by side on a lawn near the Caesars fountain, doing live, 
hit-and-run satellite feeds to television stations in Norfolk, Va.; Dallas; 
Cincinnati; Sacramento, and eight other cities. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbie's his own man now, and his father is resigned. As he told anchormen 
and women across the country, "I don't want to be known as the best daredevil 
who ever lived. I want to be known as the father of the best daredevil who ever 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pitch for Profits 
</P>
<P>
With their helmets on their laps -- Robbie's shiny new one, Evel's battered old 
savior -- the two made a strong pitch for motorcycle safety. And without fail, 
they also made a pitch for profits. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie: "It's pay-per-view on Showtime. $14.95." 
</P>
<P>
Evel: "Call your cable operator today." 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's final TV interview, Robbie retreated to his rented motor home 
to prepare for the jump. 
</P>
<P>
Evel set up shop in a dark bar overlooking the casino's "Riot di Roulette," and 
began talking business and hustling up rooms and tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got 1,100 seats in the bleachers and they've had 9,000 requests for 
tickets," he told business acquaintances from California or New York and the 
old buddies from Butte who kept the name "Evel Knievel" booming over the 
Caesars page system night and day as they called to say they'd be there, 
joining the tens of thousands of people Evel figures will fill the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sound of Coins 
</P>
<P>
Between phone calls, Knievel's conversation careened from story to story, 
celebrity to celebrity, always landing back on a Knievel -- either father or 
son. 
</P>
<P>
His voice a deep growl over the sound of coins clattering out of slot machines 
in the background, he described meeting Salvador Dali -- who happened to like 
his paintings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time he and Richard Burton chatted about the charms of 
Elizabeth Taylor, whom Knievel lists as one of his three unfulfilled conquests 
-- along with racing at Indianapolis and free-falling from an airplane into a 
haystack. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I think Liz wanted a date with me," Knievel said with a grin. "I 
really think she did. But the best she could do was George Hamilton, who played 
me in a movie. She ended up with George Hamilton and Malcolm Forbes, two guys 
who want to be Evel Knievel. . . . Can you believe it? Malcolm Forbes has all 
the money in the world and he wants to be like Evel Knievel." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Wagon 
</P>
<P>
For a while, a few years back, Knievel went on the wagon, railing against 
boozers as "pimples on the (rear end) of progress." This week, though, he was 
knocking back one Canadian Club after another, chasing them with lite beer. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends say they're worried about me drinking. I tell them, if you had kids 
like mine, you'd drink, too." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's got a 9-year-old daughter, Alicia, and he's spoiling her rotten, he 
said. But Knievel concedes that he had faults as a father, and that it was his 
wife, Linda, who raised the couple's three oldest children -- a 28-year-old 
son, Kelly; Robbie, and daughter Tracey Lynn, 25, a missionary. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out trying to conquer the world when my children were growing up," he 
said. "They loved me, but they were glad to see me leave home. They all told me 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Linda was glad to see him go sometimes, too, she said. For a time, the only 
reason she didn't leave him was because she was afraid "he'd hurt me or kill 
me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad, Bad Attitude' 
</P>
<P>
There were even moments, she admitted, when she caught herself not caring when 
she saw him cartwheeling down a ramp. "Maybe I thought he deserved it," she 
said. ". . . I had a bad, bad attitude. I was very rebellious towards him." 
</P>
<P>
Then she found Jesus and was "born again." 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned to trust in God and be content in my circumstances," she said. "I 
believe God is holding on to him for a reason. . . . I believe God wants him 
with me for a reason. Thank God, I've learned to accept him for what he is." 
</P>
<P>
Knievel and Robbie, who first rode in his father's show at age 8, had a 
particularly problematic relationship. When Robbie was born, his father was in 
jail in Twin Falls, Idaho -- arrested for speeding to the hospital with a 
revoked driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
More than once as he got older, Robbie sped to hospitals in ambulances with his 
father after a spill. He was frightened by his dad's seemingly lunatic stunts. 
He cried as he waited at the Snake River jump, thinking, "Jesus, what are you 
trying to prove?" 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Robbie was rebellious, and several times the two came to 
blows. One night, when the boy came home drunk after breaking into a music 
store, Evel kicked him in the face, breaking his nose. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks a lot better with the new nose," Knievel jokes. "I did it for no 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
Robbie smiles at that line, now. A solid, tough-featured athlete, he said the 
father-son relationship finally improved when he first whipped his old man in a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
As he sat in his rented motor home eating Fritos, Robbie said he 
</P>
<P>
learned a lot by watching his father. But while he loves and respects him, he 
doesn't want to become a clone of the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad's eating this up," he said of the accelerating media blitz. But Robbie 
spurns the term "daredevil" -- which Evel Sr. consistently applies to him -- 
and has no interest in persuading the media to swarm around his ego like moths 
around a glaring bulb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Recognition 
</P>
<P>
He knows that his father is proud of him and he knows that his name recognition 
is valuable, but said, "If he loves me and wants to help me, he should stay out 
of the way now." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Evel Knievel is happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being a gunfighter. I couldn't pull the trigger anymore," Evel 
said, the elusive quality in his face suddenly looking a lot like sadness. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who says that old age makes them smarter is full of it," he snarled. 
"They run out of nerve . . . I don't have the guts, I don't have the 
recuperative power, I don't have the desire." 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of his publicity binges, Knievel flew in his own Lear jet 
emblazoned with his name, or toured the country in lavish motor homes fitted 
with Jacuzzis and other accouterments. He wore thousands of dollars in jewelry, 
$700 cowboy boots and the finest Italian suits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Orders 
</P>
<P>
But in the early '80s, a Santa Monica court ordered Knievel to pay the man 
whose arm he broke $12.7 million; the IRS sued him for $1.6 million in back 
taxes. Knievel continues to deride the victim of his 1977 assault and boasts 
that the man "I hit with a baseball bat . . . never got a dime." He added, "I'd 
rather die than pay the IRS what it says I owe them." 
</P>
<P>
He works, he contends, as an unpaid consultant to the corporation promoting 
Robbie's jump. He "had to fight" with his lawyer of 20 years, who heads the 
corporation, "to give me $1,000 in expenses," he said, pulling a wad of $100 
bills from his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Knievel's wife and youngest daughter now live in a home in Butte given to them 
by the oldest son, who like Robbie, lives in Las Vegas. Knievel himself says he 
owns no real estate and has no permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
As for the other trappings of the high roller, "I don't want 'em," he said. 
"Robbie bought me an Aston Martin Lagonda, a $200,000 car. I've got a 12-gauge 
shotgun, a set of golf clubs, some clothes and shoes and a rabbit's foot. I 
travel around, have a good time. What more do I need? If it flies, floats or 
goes to bed with you, lease it. That's my new motto." 
</P>
<P>
Robbie has said that with the bike he's riding, the padding he'll wear, and the 
skill he possesses, the chances of his getting seriously hurt in the jump are 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait and See 
</P>
<P>
His father isn't so sure. As Knievel sees it, there are three things that can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
If he makes the jump, Knievel will be a proud father cheering in the bleachers; 
if Robbie hurts himself, "I hope he'll be man enough to face it." 
</P>
<P>
And if he dies? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bury him," Knievel snaps. "On his tombstone I'll put, 'Here lies my son. 
I loved him.' " 
</P>
<P>
His own epitaph, he said, will read: "What the hell are you looking at?"

'FIRST WOMEN' STEP INTO SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA CELEBRATES BREAKTHROUGH EFFORTS OF FACULTY, STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party at the UCLA Faculty Center last Tuesday night had the look and feel 
of a family gathering. It was -- a female family gathering. The Friends of the 
UCLA Center for the Study of Women had come out to honor about 40 UCLA women 
who were first -- the first woman to hold a particular faculty, staff, 
administrative or volunteer position at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Friends founder Bea Mandel said she thought sufficient hurdles had been cleared 
already to identify the women and celebrate. Mandel herself is the first woman 
to serve as president of the Alumni Assn., and as Alumni UC regent, from 
1986-1988. She said it was particularly fitting that the center, founded in 
1984 as the UC system's first research institute to focus on the study of women 
and gender-related issues, take an in-house look at the impact of women and the 
women's movement on UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College President 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Park Anastos, who became vice chancellor for educational plans and 
programs in 1967, was there. Before coming to UCLA, Anastos said, she had been 
president of two colleges: New York City's Barnard College from 1962-67, and 
Connecticut College for Women from 1947 to 1962. She had started at Connecticut 
College in 1935, she said. 
</P>
<P>
How old did that make her? 
</P>
<P>
"About 1,000," she laughed, indicating that was her best and final estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Others honored included Dean Susan Westerberg Prager who became dean of the Law 
School in 1983; M. E. Davis, editor-in-chief of the Daily Bruin in 1954; Page 
Ackerman, university librarian from 1973-77; Ruth Boak, first to join the 
Medical School faculty in 1947; Helen Astin, first associate provost of the 
College of Letters and Science from 1983-87. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those firsts were hard won and the victories often felt more lonely 
than triumphant. Although affection, loyalty and pride in UCLA were all 
abundantly palpable Tuesday night, the event raised a few unpleasant memories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Incensed 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Kuehl offered her own first as an example. Now a lawyer and a managing 
attorney for the new Southern California Women's Law Center (not connected with 
UCLA), in 1972 she was associate dean of students in UCLA's student 
organizations office and helped found the Women's Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost lost my job," she said. "We were located in the library and at the 
last minute the chancellor wouldn't let us open. . . . We broke in, painted it, 
took out a full page ad in the Bruin. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Although she described the chancellor's reaction as "incensed" and said they 
had received a stern warning, things went no further. "If they had fired us, 
they would have had no non-academic student services," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In her remarks to the group, UCLA's highest-ranking woman on campus, Andrea 
Rich, vice chancellor for academic administration, herself a first in this 
current job, put the evening in comic perspective. There was a time, she said, 
when the faculty of UCLA was composed of 76% women. Today women make up about 
22% of the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birth of UCLA 
</P>
<P>
In 1919, she explained, the properties of the Los Angeles State Normal School, 
which offered mostly teacher courses, were transferred to the UC regents, thus 
forming UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, she said, there were 1,232 faculty members and 76% were women. By 
the 1920-21 academic year, women made up 61% of the faculty, and a decline 
began. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you make of that, Jeanne Giovannoni?" Rich called out across the 
dining room, abandoning her prepared text to laughing calls of "downhill ever 
since." Giovannoni, a first as associate vice chancellor for faculty relations, 
is responsible for affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to remember about the 22%," Giovannoni said later, 
"is that the proportion of women faculty has doubled in the past 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home-Ec Days 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of UCLA, predominantly women's departments such as home 
economics were phased out and women faculty virtually disappeared, then 
gradually made their reappearance one by one in all-male bastions. 
</P>
<P>
The evening seemed to help compensate many women who came. It was a simple 
rather than fancy or gala affair, yet those being honored took such pleasure in 
it that it was clearly apparent they had received little recognition for their 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Rich ended the evening by saying they would all be remiss not to remember 
another group of women: "Those women who were qualified and didn't get the 
job."

RAGS TO RICHES FOR THE LOWLY SCARF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRETA BEIGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent cold afternoon at a cozy boutique in San Francisco, a silver-haired 
Elton John look-alike in zebra hat, coat and boots, demonstrates the art of 
tying scarfs. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Hill -- known to cognoscenti as the Scarf Wizard -- weaves his magic on 
a stream of Saturday shoppers. A giant silk square in red-and-black polka dots 
became a blouse, a halter and finally a colorful cocoon wrap. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who appeared recently on KABC-TV's "A.M. Los Angeles" -- "he's great TV; 
he gets people excited about scarfs," says supervising producer Steve Ober -- 
is one of a growing number of fashion consultants around the country giving 
scarf seminars at department stores, boutiques, adult-education and health-care 
facilities to "educate" women on the virtues of colorizing and expanding their 
wardrobes with scarfs. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly frustrated by the rising cost of ready-to-wear, women are 
investing in chiffons and challises of all shapes and sizes. (The bulk of sales 
remain in the $20-$35 range.) 
</P>
<P>
The once-lowly scarf -- which used to rank behind bags and belts -- has in the 
last two years emerged as a strong contender in the estimated $12-billion 
accessories stakes. Sales have mushroomed from an estimated $100 million in 
1987 to a projected $350 million for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Parisian house of Hermes, which annually adds 12 designs to its 
catalogue, last January in New York organized "A Scarf is Born," a 
retrospective of 100 Hermes scarfs. 
</P>
<P>
With projected sales this year at $50 million, family-owned Echo Design Group, 
a New York scarf-and-belt business also licensed to sell Ralph Lauren scarfs, 
is adding a new line to its fall scarf collection aimed at the moderate-priced 
consumer. Dubbed Runway, the polyester product sells for 30% less than regular 
Echo scarfs, priced from $20 up to more than $100 for better silks. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany &amp; Co., which launched its scarf line in 1987 with six silk designs, 
plans to carry 50 styles -- priced from $130 to $225 -- at its nine United 
States outlets by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Although new designers are attracted to the lucrative accessories market, many 
remain perplexed by the potential of the scarf. 
</P>
<P>
New York newcomers Aude Bronson-Howard and Elizabeth Kramer were unprepared for 
the success of their first season. They are still personally filling orders, 
transporting their luxurious silk and velvet creations, priced from $350 up to 
$1,300, in suitcases from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off in March last year with two scarfs in a suitcase. Now we have 
800," said Howard-Bronson, 37, also a costume designer whose recent credit was 
on "Mississippi Burning." "Many of our clients are in the movie industry, and 
this has helped." 
</P>
<P>
Paloma Picasso, in Beverly Hills recently with her husband and business 
partner, Rafael Lopez-Cambil, to promote her spring accessories collection at 
I. Magnin, advocates yet another role for the big pieces: "letting them lie 
around the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Scarfs used to be draped along pianos and furniture and this is going to come 
back in a big way," Picasso said. "If you don't wear them, at least put them 
where you can see them." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Patiky Stein, artistic designer, accessories for Chanel in Paris, who 
in the fall of 1987 launched her own line of accessories, calls herself "a 
major scarf person. 
</P>
<P>
"I collect them. It's like buying dishes in an antique store," said Stein by 
phone from her Madison Avenue office. "On my travels, I always include a 
knitted cashmere that I can use as a bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"But women are just beginning to learn how to handle pieces of fabric. Large 
scarfs are intimidating and not the easiest things to handle. That's why my big 
pieces are in taffeta -- you can beat it up and it doesn't slither and fly away 
like crepe de Chine." 
</P>
<P>
Both Picasso, who anticipates doing more than $7 million in her first year of 
business, and Stein, who projects sales at $3.4 million for 1989, mandate that 
stores house their collections in a boutique environment. 
</P>
<P>
But educating retailers on the importance of display -- and of the potential of 
the scarf business in general -- has taken concerted efforts on the part of the 
neckwear industry. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Pizzo, president of Accessory Street in Manhattan, (licensees for Oscar 
de la Renta and Adrienne Vittadini), and Sol Schulman, executive vice president 
of Vera (licensees for Anne Klein and Perry Ellis), point out that pressure 
from scarf producers led to the introduction of open-selling, where customers 
could finger the merchandise and pay for it without consulting a salesperson. 
</P>
<P>
The industry also pushed for store seminars and the production of how-to videos 
and guides to promote sales. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Larkin, 28, a former TV account executive who lives near Chicago, 
co-created the video, "Scarves Tie Into a Great Look" (Larkin Enterprises Ltd: 
$19.95). Since its September release, the video has sold more than 15,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom offers a pamphlet on 40 scarf-tying techniques. Designer Ginnie 
Johansen, whose Dallas-based accessories concern did $20-million business in 
1988, publishes an instructional leaflet. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara-based Flamingo Design Group has a guide of its hand-painted 
Indonesian scarfs that at first glance resembles a wedding album. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Jackie Bartolini, who served as fashion consultant on the Larkin 
video, gave a scarf-tying demonstration at Bullock's in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolini, who owns the Bellissimo boutique in Chicago, gives 20 to 30 seminars 
each year at stores, banks and large corporations. Believing that fashion is 
therapeutic, she is particularly proud of her work at several hospitals doing 
headwraps for cancer patients.

"The basic philosophy behind any fashion is feeling good," Bartolini said. 
"Looking good, is feeling good. People's attitudes change by the way they 
dress. We are what we wear. And accessories, I believe, can add the finishing 
touches to everything."

SOUL TRAIN AWARDS HONOR BLACK STARS

<P>
The third annual Soul Train Music Awards on Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium 
featured virtually all the top stars in contemporary black music, as well as 
presenters such as Mike Tyson and Eddie Murphy -- who bestowed yet another 
lifetime achievement award on Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Grammys, the show came in on time. Unlike the American Music Awards, 
there weren't any victories by white pop star George Michael for the producers 
to explain, and Murphy behaved himself while sharing the mike with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
So why was Don Cornelius, the show's co-executive producer, so low-key after 
the ceremonies? 
</P>
<P>
Because he thinks that the show still isn't getting a fair shake from the 
television industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that everything in television is viewed as black or white," Cornelius 
said in an upstairs production office after the taping of the show, which was 
syndicated to 89 stations around the country, including Los Angeles' KTTV 
Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
"And if a program seems black it doesn't get honest and equal consideration on 
any level, whether you are talking about networks or syndication," added the 
founder of the long-running "Soul Train" dance show. 
</P>
<P>
"Just on the strength of Michael Jackson's name, we should have had 30% more 
stations than we did last year, and we have 17 fewer stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an explanation for it. But it's frustrating to bring in this kind 
of talent package and have it treated like it's just another show that 
independent stations could get any day of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius acknowledged that having more white artists and presenters on the 
show might make it more "palatable" to a general audience, but he said that he 
doesn't want to go that route. (The only non-black celebrities on the bill were 
Sheena Easton, who performed her pop/R&amp;B hit "The Lover in Me," and 
presenters Elizabeth Taylor, Heather Locklear, Melissa Manchester, Paul 
Rodriguez and the members of the group Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to do a gerrymandered black show that appeals to white people 
or compete with the so-called general market efforts," he said, referring to 
the American Music Awards and the Grammys. "We've had to make a decision as to 
what we want to be in character, in style. And we want to be a show about black 
music. We don't want to duplicate something that's already being done. If you 
do that, who needs you?" 
</P>
<P>
If the show, hosted by Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle and sportscaster Ahmad 
Rashad, still doesn't get the respect it deserves from the TV industry, it does 
have the support of the black music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Baker, the top winner with three awards including song of the year for 
"Giving You the Best That I Got," told the reporters in the backstage press 
area that she received her first television exposure on "Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
"Were it not for that show, I wouldn't have been seen on national TV until much 
later in my career," said the singer, who has also won numerous Grammys and 
American Music Awards. "A lot of times inner-city or black talent is overlooked 
or pushed over to the side." 
</P>
<P>
Even Jackson, a no-show at this year's Grammy Awards, was on hand to accept two 
honorary prizes -- the Heritage lifetime achievement award and the new Sammy 
Davis Jr. Award, which honors the year's top live performer. Davis and 
Elizabeth Taylor spoke affectionately of the pop star in their presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also won two awards in the regular competition -- for music video and 
single by a male artist, both for "Man in the Mirror." The singer, who was shut 
out at this year's Grammys and American Music Awards, later made his way 
backstage to pose for the photographers -- but sidestepped the print and 
television reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Al B. Sure!, who was named best new artist, said that he, too, got his start on 
"Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see that a black man has taken charge here," said the singer, 
whose "Nite and Day" single was a major pop/R&amp;B hit. "The other shows -- 
the Grammys and the American Music Awards -- are nice, but this is from the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
The show featured several rap and street-oriented R&amp;B performances. It has 
had a rap category since its inception in 1987, whereas rap was added only this 
year at the Grammys and the American Music Awards. (D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the 
Fresh Prince swept the rap awards in all three competitions this year.) 
</P>
<P>
Jam Master Jay, a member of the first 1-million-selling rap act, Run-D.M.C., 
said backstage that rap can no longer be denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago we weren't even invited to the Grammys," he said, "and this 
year were were nominated for a Grammy, and next year we might be on the 
Grammys, and the year after that we might be running the Grammys." 
</P>
<P>
The awards provided some consolation for Michael Jackson and Bobby Brown, who 
lost to George Michael for top soul/R&amp;B male vocalist at the American Music 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, whose "Faith" album topped both the pop and black charts, wasn't even 
nominated in the Soul Train awards, which are voted on by 2,000 members of the 
black-music community -- artists, radio programmers and record store personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius said pop stars like Michael don't stand a chance with that voting 
body. 
</P>
<P>
"That would only be possible if white people were doing the voting," he said in 
the interview. "The nonchalant disregard for the meaning of the word soul is 
not something that black people are likely to do. Pop music means many things, 
rock 'n' roll means many things, but soul means only one thing."

SAN DIEGO'S OPERATIC VOICE IS STILL STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When former San Diego Opera general director Tito Capobianco was hyping his 
nascent summer Verdi Festival, he predicted that San Diego would become the 
Verdi capital of the world, the equivalent of Bayreuth, Bavaria, for 
Wagner-lovers. Ten years after his overly optimistic prediction, both 
Capobianco and his Verdi Festival are long gone, but the local opera scene has 
survived without the flamboyant Argentine impresario. 
</P>
<P>
If the state of opera in San Diego can be judged by performances across town 
this weekend, the Capobianco legacy still hovers in the wings. Saturday at the 
Civic Theatre, San Diego Opera opens Puccini's unsinkable "Madama Butterfly," 
the final production of the current four-opera season. After Capobianco left 
San Diego Opera in 1983, the company scaled down the number of operas it 
produced in order to contain its debt, and resorted to conservative programming 
-- familiar operas such as "Butterfly," "Tosca," "Faust" and "Il Trovatore" -- 
to rebuild its subscription base. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has taken the company six seasons to rebuild, according to general 
director Ian Campbell, the formula has worked. Campbell announced a more 
ambitious and expanded 1989-90 season earlier this week, and was able to add a 
performance of "Madama Butterfly" because of high ticket demand. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, San Diego State University's opera workshop presents a bill of four 
one-act operas at Smith Recital Hall. Like the opera company, the university's 
opera program has also gone through a recovery period since its association 
with Capobianco. From 1981 to '83, Capobianco's Opera Center, at that time the 
local company's educational program, joined forces with the SDSU music 
department to offer opera courses and produce operas on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get opera back on the boards here," explained Martin Chambers, 
recently appointed chairman of the music department. "After Capobianco left, 
the program here was fallow several years. When I came here in the fall of 
1986, the department decided to resurrect the program." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers has been rebuilding the university opera program slowly, relying on 
students and faculty who would have a continuing commitment to the program, 
rather than a few experts brought in for a short-term stint, the premise of the 
former program. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers has the right background to head a university opera program. The 
Canadian tenor sang in European opera houses for seven years before he returned 
to North America to assume a university position. He continued to sing roles 
with Toronto's Canadian Opera Company under Lotfi Mansouri, that company's 
general director until his recent appointment as head of the San Francisco 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the SDSU opera workshop, Chambers is not attempting to vie 
with the downtown company for production values. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in producing the best stage product," he said, "but in 
training students how to act, sing and put an opera together. We are not only 
interested in singers, but see potential designers and directors coming out of 
this program." 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's Smith Hall program, Chambers will conduct his cast and the SDSU 
opera orchestra in Douglas Moore's 1958 one-act comic opera "Gallantry." The 
rest of the program features Ralph Vaughn Williams' "Riders to the Sea," based 
on the William Synge play; "Bastien and Bastienne," Mozart's first Singspiel, 
and Hugo Weisgall's monodrama "The Stranger," based on a Strindberg play. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers does not see the performances of his opera workshop transforming the 
campus consciousness about opera. 
</P>
<P>
"We invite students, especially music appreciation students, to the open dress 
rehearsals, and the responses are pretty positive, but we have to struggle to 
get audiences." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers does not predict a second attempt at making an alliance between San 
Diego Opera and the SDSU music department, even though he has good relations 
with Campbell. Earlier this season, Chambers made his local opera debut in San 
Diego Opera's "Lucia di Lammermoor" production, and he will appear in next 
season's production of Poulenc's "Dialogues des Carmelites." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Campbell is doing a fine job with his education program, and we are 
both concerned about spreading our available resources too thin. He has 
generously helped us out with the loan of some props and set, however."

JANSS' ART CACHE TO GO ON BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE MAGNATE AMASSED QUALITY, ECLECTIC COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-two contemporary works, including a prime early painting by Francis 
Bacon that is expected to break the British artist's record of $1.76 million, 
will be offered May 2. Four modern works, by Rene Magritte, Jean Delville, 
Giorgio Morandi and James Ensor, will be sold May 9 in a sale of Impressionist 
and modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Though Janss and his family made their fortune in the American tradition of 
developing land -- about 90,000 acres of Southern California property and ski 
resorts at Snowmass in Aspen, Colo., and Sun Valley, Idaho -- Janss is revered 
in the art community as an eccentric, intuitive collector. He jumped to his 
death, at 74, on March 16 in Santa Monica, after suffering a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by artists and adventurous dealers, Janss built a consistently 
high-quality, if eclectic, collection from sources all around the world. 
Pre-Columbian art, Mimbres pottery and antique chess sets mingled with 
contemporary masterpieces in his West Los Angeles home. His collecting was an 
intensely personal pursuit, and he never formed strong attachments to museums 
-- nor gave them reason to expect that he might donate his collection to them. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted an auction. He had discussed it for years, and I 
approve of that. He didn't want his collection entombed in some kind of shrine. 
He believed that the works have a life of their own," said Janss' daughter, 
Dagny Janss Corcoran, who owns Art Catalogues, an exhibition catalogue shop in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Art walked into Janss' life in the late '50s, according to Corcoran. "He was 
sitting up there in Thousand Oaks, working with his race horses or whatever he 
was doing at the time, and he just turned left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the people responsible for his change of direction were artist Sam 
Francis and Walter Hopps, the current director of the Menil Collection in 
Houston, who was a founder of the vanguard Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles and a 
director of the Pasadena Art Museum in the late '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Corcoran, Francis introduced himself after Janss boldly (and 
without much knowledge) stated in an interview that Francis, Mark Rothko and 
Jackson Pollock -- the three contemporary American artists whose work he then 
owned -- were the most important painters in the world. Meeting one artist led 
to another, and Janss found their ideas and life styles completely captivating, 
Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hopps became "a sort of professor" to Janss, opening doors for the 
collector and filling his head with new information but never making decisions 
for him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Janss, of all the major collectors I have known over the past 40 years, was 
unquestionably the most independent," Hopps wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Stories abound from Janss' collecting years. There's the one that New York 
dealer Leo Castelli tells about meeting the unconventional Californian who 
eventually became a good friend. "He walked into my gallery in 1963 from God 
knows where -- looking ragged, as if he were from Texas or the desert -- and 
said he wanted to buy a Rauschenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the end of the show and I told him that only a large one, 'Die Hard,' 
(an early silk-screened painting that is in the auction) was available. He 
said, 'Fine. I'll take that.' When I told him the price was $16,000, he pulled 
a crumpled check out of his pocket and promptly filled it out," Castelli 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of a David Hockney purchase in 1974 is even more picturesque: Janss 
plucked "A Grand Procession of Dignitaries in the Semi-Egyptian Style" from the 
sky. On the way to the Kasmin Gallery in London with Dagny, the collector first 
saw Hockney's 12-foot-long canvas dangling from a crane while it was being 
loaded into an upstairs window of the gallery. Undaunted by his odd viewpoint 
and the painting's plastic wrapping, he immediately decided to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"A Grand Procession," a fantasy painted in 1961, is valued at $750,000 to $1 
million -- well above Hockney's record of $647,680, set in December by "A Neat 
Lawn." Painted while Hockney was a student at the Royal College of Art in 
London, the theatrical parade of strange personages was inspired by Constantine 
Cavafy's 1904 poem, "Waiting for the Barbarians." The painting is among early 
works that caught the attention of Hockney's first dealer, John Kasmin, and is 
considered a seminal work because it foreshadows his later "stage" paintings 
and set designs. 
</P>
<P>
Among other works set to leave the Janss collection and go out into the world 
are Bacon's "Study for a Portrait of Van Gogh II," valued at $2 million to $2.5 
million. "There's no question whatever" that the painting will reach or exceed 
that estimate, according to Lucy Mitchell-Inness, director of Sotheby's 
contemporary art department. 
</P>
<P>
The 1957 oil depicting a desolate artist trudging through a terrifyingly bleak 
landscape is one of six Bacon works inspired by Vincent van Gogh's "The Painter 
on the Road to Tarascon," which was destroyed during World War II. Bacon 
painted the version in the Janss collection after a trip to Tangiers and 
interpreted the theme of artist as haunted outsider in terms of the North 
African sun, using dark shadows and searing color. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Diebenkorn's 1959 oil, "Coffee," may also set a record. The painting of 
a seated woman drinking a cup of coffee is valued at $800,000 to $1 million -- 
close to the record $1.16 million paid last May for "July," a similarly styled 
figurative work done two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Three constructions by Joseph Cornell, a drawing and a sculpture by H.C. 
Westermannand a 1953 abstraction by Franz Kline will be offered in the May 2 
sale. The auction roster also lists two paintings each by Jean Dubuffet, Sam 
Francis, Arshile Gorky, Philip Guston and Robert Rauschenberg and two groups of 
ceramic cups by Kenneth Price. 
</P>
<P>
One piece, Edward Kienholz's 1959 mixed-media construction called "Walter 
Hopps, Hopps, Hopps" ($60,000 to $80,000), is a witty tribute to an art world 
impresario who helped shape Los Angeles' development as an art center and 
became Janss' friend and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran and Mitchell-Inness characterize the Janss collection as one of 
personal choices, loosely woven together by a thread of Surrealism. Though only 
Magritte's 1946 five-panel painting, "L'Evidence Eternelle," is clearly Surreal 
and works such as the Diebenkorn defy any connection to that movement, many 
pieces convey a sense of strangeness. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Hockney, it's merely the suggestion that much is going on 
beneath the surface of a fantastic procession. Jean Delville's 1892 "Portrait 
of Madame Stuart Merrill," on the other hand, is a typically peculiar Symbolist 
work that depicts a possessed woman with a halo of wild red hair entering a 
magical state as she rolls her eyes into her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran said that her father never changed his mind about an artwork he had 
purchased and rarely sold pieces from his collection. He was in the news in 
1978, however, for the sale of Jasper Johns' "According to What" to Dominique 
de Menil. "The painting had become so important that it was always in demand 
for exhibitions. My father hated to have it off the wall, so he decided to sell 
it at the end of the Whitney show (a retrospective that toured for more than a 
year)," Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
The family has retained some small artworks and those that were intended as 
gifts, she said, but all the "major pieces" are up for sale. Sotheby's May 2 
auction also includes 19 Pop artworks from the collection of the late German 
industrialist Karl Stroher.

A group of UCLA law students awarded actors James Woods ("True Believers") and 
Jimmy Smits ("L.A. Law") with plaques Wednesday night honoring them for 
"showing the legal profession in a positive light." Both actors received the 
awards from the UCLA Entertainment Law Society for playing idealistic 
attorneys, determined to right wrongs and ensure justice for disadvantaged 
clients. "This is a special kudo that even Oscar can't match," said Woods.

The Royal Court Theatre in London will open a British play next week that has 
been branded by Iran as scurrilous and a satanic sequel to the Salman Rushdie 
affair. The theater denied Thursday that it risks provoking Muslim anger with 
"Iranian Nights," a new work by English playwright Howard Brenton and Tariq 
Ali, an Oxford-educated Pakistani who, like Rushdie, was born a Muslim. 
"Iranian Nights" was written as a direct response to the plight of Rushdie, a 
naturalized British citizen born in India, whose novel, "The Satanic Verses," 
provoked a death threat from Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini. Rushdie has been in hiding since then. "As far as I'm concerned the 
intention is to contribute positively to debate, and to educate and enlighten," 
said Simon Curtis, the theater's deputy director. He declined to discuss the 
play's contents. According to advance reviews in the British press, in "Iranian 
Nights," Scheherazade tells of a poet who writes a set of verses that anger a 
"Holy Man" in a land once called Persia, providing him with a cause with which 
to unite his people after a war. The play is set to begin a 10-day run on 
Wednesday.

Mayor Tom Bradley recommended an additional $1.9 million for grants to cultural 
organizations in his fiscal 1989-1990 city budget proposal Thursday. The 
recommendation jibes with interim spending plans for the proposed $20 million 
Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts, the city's new cultural funding program, to 
become fully operational in July, 1990. If the City Council approves Bradley's 
proposal, which contains $450,000 for a new citywide arts festival project and 
an additional $155,000 for the city's mural program, $3 million in grants will 
be awarded in July. Bradley's action shows "a great effort to upgrade city 
support for the arts immediately," said Cultural Affairs Department General 
Manager Al Nodal. ALEENE MacMINN

Melodiya, the Soviet Union's only record company and the world's largest record 
producer, will soon receive competition from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, a 
small, prestigious U.S. record company that embarked on a joint venture with 
Soviet partners to produce recordings of Soviet artists for sale in both 
countries. Melodiya, which issues 1,000 titles a year with a total pressing of 
100 million copies, has been criticized for its poor quality of recordings and 
a lack of daring. Calling its new company Arts and Electronics, the joint 
venture has already built a state-of-the-art digital recording studio in the 
Moscow Conservatory of Music. ALEENE MacMINN

 Bargain-basement Bret Easton Ellis: Six post-punk characters spend a dreary 
weekend whining about Angst and ennui, which they mispronounce. The film is a 
disaster technically: Some scenes are so dimly lit (and/or badly shot and/or 
stained from processing errors) that it's difficult to tell one character from 
another. Writer-producer-director Gregg Araki reportedly made this gritty 
exercise in self-indulgent alienation for $5,000; it looks like less. CHARLES

 Yojiro Takita's hilarious satire on a suburban family so money-grubbing that 
it runs a newspaper distributorship and a catering service -- both exploiting 
the elderly -- right out of the kitchen (where the mother is also operating her 
erotic wake-up service while she prepares breakfast). As the film becomes 
increasingly outrageous it develops considerable complexity, and its indictment 
of materialism, Japanese-style, is often ironic and paradoxical. Like Takita's 
earlier "Comic Magazine," a corrosive satire on the excesses of the media, "The 
Yen Family" is a swift, satisfying treat. RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS

 Writer/director John Dingwall has fashioned what is essentially a 
two-character horror story about an imprisoned woman and her tormentor. The 
twist is that the heroine's confinement is purely psychological: She is a 
friendless agoraphobic with a brutal, mind-raping husband, and the suspense 
lies in whether she will gather the wherewithal to walk out the front gate of 
her own house. The husband's bottomless catalogue of crafty bullying tactics 
eventually becomes as wearying for us as for her. It's an exaggerated and 
tiresome but often truthful portrait of the quintessential co-dependent 
relationship. CHRIS WILLMAN

'PARADISE' ECHOES NOYCE'S SOFTER, GENTLER TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard on the heels of Phillip Noyce's smashing new sea-and-sex chase thriller 
"Dead Calm" comes a much different movie, one which Noyce shot several years 
ago: "Echoes of Paradise" (Fine Arts). 
</P>
<P>
In "Calm," Noyce shows that he knows how to make a smoking melodrama. In 
"Echoes of Paradise," he's trying something softer, gentler: a psychological 
love story about an Australian mother and wife (Wendy Hughes) who leaves her 
would-be politician husband after discovering his incessant infidelities and 
takes up with a Balinese dancer (John Lone) in a Thai tourist paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to cauterize her own pain and humiliation, Hughes' Maria McAvoy drifts 
into a languorous, little alternative community: with the homosexual 
hotel-owner, Terry (Rod Mullinar) and his seductive and ambiguously charming 
guest, Raka (Lone). As she falls, or slides, into an extramarital affair, Maria 
has the self-conscious stance of an uncertain actress, edging into a 
bewildering role. Raka and Terry, theatrical to the core, manipulate their 
performances more adroitly: Raka with a silken, lazy ease; Terry more 
flamboyantly, with witty lines and troubled eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Do some directors keep making the same film, in various guises? Both of Noyce's 
recent films are about triangles, about a husband and wife kept physically 
apart after a crisis in their marriage, and with a third male character -- 
strange, sexually aggressive, possibly with a pathological edge -- coming in to 
roil the waters and to keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Calm" was like "Knife in the Water" with an electric chainsaw; it was all 
swift mechanics, with a technical gleam that burned your eyes. "Echoes of 
Paradise," written and executive-produced by Noyce's wife, Jan Sharp, digs 
deeper into its characters. It keeps its edges cloaked in mist, the sunlight 
dropped and filtered in a latticework of Asian shadows, the love scenes 
unfolding serenely, by candlelight. Both lovers are on vacation, Raka on an 
extended retirement from the stage, and Noyce and Sharp give us a sense of what 
happens when ordinary time hits a stop. 
</P>
<P>
It's a subtle film that doesn't make any obvious errors. And it has two 
splendid, all but faultless, leading performances -- by Wendy Hughes and John 
Lone. They mesh seamlessly, quietly reversing our usual conceptions of 
male-female movie personas. Despite her soft, wounded expression, Hughes' 
acting has the keener edge, the more aggressive, searching attack, while Lone, 
in a role that predated "The Last Emperor," gives his Raka more rounded, 
voluptuous contours, a honeyed smile, eyes like flaming liqueur. 
</P>
<P>
But, somehow it doesn't go far enough, doesn't open up enough possibilities. 
Like the wife, this movie is somewhat trapped; it has lovely moments, but it's 
restrained, hemmed in -- and the cinematography, by Peter James, is a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy and muted and soft, it suggests Maria's repressed home life when she's in 
Australia, but, in Thailand, it doesn't change. It doesn't release you into the 
hot exoticism of her new surroundings, or suggest, even subliminally, the 
danger, glamour or flukey romance that might be sucking her in. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what the film suggests is that interludes are dangerous, that marriage 
is a serious affair, that the world outside can never be avoided. But "Echoes 
of Paradise" (MPAA rated R, for sex and language) also tries for the poetics of 
the unplanned impulse. It's a shame that more of its moments aren't up to 
Hughes' and Lone's best. You're left at the end with two finely delineated, 
perfectly etched performances and a mood that stays languorous, pensive, 
drifting. The paradise vanishes and only the echoes remain. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

LIKE FATHER, KATHARINE KRAMER TAKES RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Spell it Katharine, with an a." Petite and effervescent, with a wild mane of 
crimson tresses framing her animated face, Katharine Kramer was taking a break 
from rehearsals at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill, and explaining the 
significance of the vowel in the middle of her first name. 
</P>
<P>
"After my father, Stanley Kramer, made 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' " she 
explained, "he always said that if he had a boy he would name him after Spencer 
Tracy. But he had me, so he and my mother named me Katharine, after Katharine 
Hepburn. She's my godmother, and her first gifts to me were a christening dress 
and the specific instructions to always spell my name with an a. And I've 
always been very careful about following her instructions. Wouldn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Kramer is at the Cinegrill through Saturday with a show -- "The 
Colors of Myself," crafted for her by old pros Earl Brown and Carl Jablonski, 
with the musical direction of the dependable Tom Shell. She is almost surely 
the youngest performer to work the well-known room and is well aware that she 
is taking a professional risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is a risk," she said. "But I believe in the act, I believe in myself, 
I believe in the people I'm working with, and I've used my own money to make it 
happen. And it's something I had to do. But my dad's always been a risk-taker, 
too, so I guess he encouraged it in me. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go to college because I was too eager to do things, not just study 
them. Fortunately, my parents have always given me the opportunity to have free 
choice, and that's what I do, I listen to my own instinct. Maybe that's why my 
dad refers to me as the 'Rebellious Redhead.' He says I was born looking for a 
spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
Has her position as the daughter of one of Hollywood's best-known directors had 
an effect on Kramer's career? 
</P>
<P>
"In one sense," she replied, "it's always been more difficult for me, because 
people tend to judge you twice as hard as they might otherwise do, and I've 
always wanted to make it on my own. 
</P>
<P>
"But in another sense, I've learned a lot about the industry that I might not 
otherwise have known. My dad's never been a Hollywood type, and he doesn't 
socialize all that much. I mean, I didn't exactly grow up with Frank Sinatra in 
my living room every night. But I did grow up with a fairly focused look at the 
industry from the inside. And that helped; it gave me the real scoop." 
</P>
<P>
The Kramer family left Los Angeles for Seattle when she was 10 but returned to 
Southern California two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her youth, Kramer has had an extensive amount of professional 
experience. She appeared in several professional regional theater productions, 
studied with Herbert Berghof in New York and sang with several swing-style big 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
She was so young when she began singing that liquor laws required that she wait 
in the kitchens of the large hotels in which she worked until it was time to do 
her numbers. "Other people tell their grandchildren about being born in a 
truck," she explained. "I guess I'll be able to tell stories about sitting 
around in some of the finest kitchens in America." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, the experience opened up the great treasury of 
American popular songs for Kramer, and she has been fascinated with it ever 
since. She worries, however, that her love of classic Gershwin and Rodgers 
&amp; Hart might "make people think I'm just trying to hop on the nostalgia 
trend. But I've been singing these songs since I was 10, and well before Linda 
Ronstadt and Michael Feinstein started recording them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told that I should be singing the music of my own generation, but 
this is the music that's true to me, and it doesn't feel out of date at all. In 
fact, I feel very linked with the future, in part because of my age, but also 
in part because, to me, the past is linked with the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the heart and the innocence of the music of the past -- of the '20s, 
'30s and '40s -- and I like to think that retaining it will help revive the 
same feelings of heart and innocence in the music of the future. That's one of 
my real goals. It's something I really want to be a part of."

KRAMER DEBUT: PROMISING BUT OVERSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The overwhelming problem with Katharine Kramer's show at the Hollywood 
Roosevelt's Cinegrill on Wednesday evening was that her hourlong debut 
performance was a show -- replete with scripted beginning, middle and end -- 
that promised to deliver "The Colors of Myself." 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious though it was, the 20-year-old Kramer would have fared better had she 
merely chosen a handful of appropriate tunes and sung them. This route would 
have saved her not only the expense of a writer, director and choreographer -- 
none of whom contributed much to her efforts -- but would have allowed her 
audience to better enjoy the considerable talents of a promising young singer. 
</P>
<P>
An attractive young lady with piercing blue eyes, Kramer displayed a strong, 
well-trained alto voice that suffered from her choice of material. Though her 
opening theme song, "The Colors of Myself," was melodically attractive, it was 
also a bit overstated (lyricist Earl Brown got a bit carried away with a line 
like "the only place for me is on stage"). Be that as it may, she followed it 
with a weak rock tune called "Rhythm Is Gonna Get You" that was about as 
heartfelt as a dunning notice and not nearly as effective. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief (how long could it take?) rundown of her life's story, Kramer 
paid homage to big bands with a medley of tunes that had little or nothing to 
do with big bands. But from the baker's dozen tunes came snippets enough to 
convince listeners of her fine musical qualities: a good sense of time ("The 
Joint Is Jumpin'," "After You've Gone") and a stylish feel for the ballad 
("Embraceable You," "You'll Never know"). 
</P>
<P>
Kramer's theatrics during her show bordered on histrionics, most of which could 
have been done away with. Her movements were stiff and unnatural, her use of 
props (a picture of Clark Gable for a rendition of "You Made Me Love You" was 
too much) excessive, and her on-stage removal of a wig completely unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
But in the great theatrical tradition, Kramer could belt a song like nobody's 
business. A pair of Jerry Herman tunes ("Wherever He Ain't," "Time Heals 
Everything") were terrific vehicles, as was a medley of Judy Garland tunes and 
her selections from "Les Miserables" and "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
Though the colors of Kramer's self weren't too bright, her future certainly is. 
She could probably work steadily on the Broadway stage, and if she were to dump 
her show and design some sets of tunes (a few uptempo things, some ballads, a 
blues), she could also enjoy a career as a chanteuse. A. JAMES LISKA

Dennis Farber's art is like those grade school projects where you scribble a 
design in crayon, cover it with a thick coat of paint, then scratch through the 
paint to reveal patches of the image below. Farber uses photographs -- of 
crowded boardwalks, vacant lots, urban skylines -- for the lower layer, while 
gold leaf serves as the surface coat. The metaphor here is easy to decipher, 
and Farber's images read as inquiries into the dichotomy of the ideal vs. the 
real. Gold leaf calls forth all sorts of sacred associations and represents the 
divine; photographs, of course, represent the real, and Farber's combination of 
the two suggests that dirty reality will inevitably bleed through whatever 
fragile veil of beauty one attempts to impose on it. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are minimalist sculptures by Susan Venable that look as though 
they belong in the corporate headquarters of AT&amp;T. Steel grids sprouting 
crops of copper wire, the work is described in a press release as "an 
exploration of the relationship between surface and structure," but looks more 
like the guts of a disemboweled computer. Lacking both the formal classicism of 
first rate Minimalism, and the invigorating trashiness currently in vogue with 
the avant-garde, Venable's work is pretty much adrift in its own orbit.

If life is a stage then Laurie Pincus is a playwright turned set designer. The 
New York artist's thin wooden cutout plywood figures are painted with the 
bright colors of a third-grade primer. They display a fascination for the 
theatrics of early film as well as folk art's straightforward approach to 
articulating the figure. Yet despite all the melodramatic posturing the 
tableaux she creates are emotionally empty. 
</P>
<P>
The characters, in their shallow plays with real space, feel as remote as 
single frames taken from an unfamiliar old movie. Titles like "Gangster, T.V. 
Man and Art" run by like a list of lead characters taunting the scene's 
ambiguity with meaning only to let the hint drop. 
</P>
<P>
As metaphors for the human condition Pincus' characters are a bunch of wooden 
eccentrics, more facade than real. What makes them interesting in their flat, 
paper doll stylishness is the way the artist adds playful fragments of film 
technique to suggest states of mind. From the enlarged figurative montage in 
pieces like "The Witness" to the bent, ominous shadow doppelgangers in "The 
Shadowboxer," Pincus translates old film devices into interesting and 
surprising pseudo stagecraft. Most intriguing is the rolling canvas backdrop 
she uses in three small wall pieces. Here the figures stay rooted while the 
background unfurls time, space or a dream narrative behind them. This kind of 
invention, recalling the rotating scenery in old Western movies, is what makes 
the static stylizations fun. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to April 
29). SUVAN GEER

*** "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." Image, 117 minutes, two CLV Extended Play 
sides, under $35. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 1939 RKO version with Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara and Edmond 
O'Brien. For the most part, it's a typical video disc, a good reproduction of 
the film without any special laser attributes. But Image has added a unique 
bonus usually reserved for more expensive discs: a second audio track in which 
film historian Paul Mandell offers behind-the-scenes insights. Fascinating 
tidbits cover special effects (the use of oil paintings on glass combined with 
live action) and makeup (Laughton's misshapen eye often moves about from scene 
to scene). But the gossip may be the most captivating: During Laughton's 
whipping scenes in the oppressive heat, director William Dieterle called for 
one retake after another; Laughton returned home in the evening with welts over 
his body and minor sunstroke. Unfortunately, narrator Mandell doesn't say 
enough, so we're left with long pauses waiting for the film to play out. The 
producers should take a listen to the commentaries on the Criterion Collection 
video discs to see how it should be done. Barbara Saltzman

JAZZ TAP ENSEMBLE STEPS BACK INTO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As dancers from Jazz Tap Ensemble rehearse for its first hometown season in two 
years (tonight through Sunday and April 21-23 at the Morgan-Wixson Theater in 
Santa Monica), they convey a subtle sense of musicians improvising after hours 
in an empty nightclub. While the pianist lays down a blues track, their tapping 
offers moody counterpoint, the two art forms weaving in an acoustic entity. 
</P>
<P>
That mutuality of dancers and musicians -- what founder/artistic director Lynn 
Dally calls the "jazz combo concept" -- has characterized Jazz Tap's work for 
the last 10 years. This has been a decade of extensive national and 
international touring, several changes of personnel, the occasional use of such 
guest artists as Honi Coles and Gregory Hines, evolution of choreography and 
financial ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
But the rhythm tap group is now launched on what promises to be a busy and 
productive anniversary year, following several months of economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
Dally looks back at those problems and says, "They weren't unusual in this 
field and in these times. It's about money, and you can never escape it. 
Running any dance company is a constant fight about where to find the next loan 
or foundation source. Touring costs are horrendous, arts funding has been cut 
and a lot of sponsors are less able to take a risk and present challenging 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming off a deficit situation caused by an accumulation of many things. 
When you're just hanging on, all you have to do is make two or three not-wise 
business decisions and suddenly you're in trouble. For example, we spent $5,000 
we really couldn't afford on a promotional video that didn't turn out well." 
</P>
<P>
Another compounding factor, Dally notes, was that bookings were off during this 
period. "Sometimes we get booked as a novelty and in that sense shifted aside 
from the mainstream. As a novelty you have to wait several years before someone 
brings you back. And what's really ironic is that sometimes we're called 
'non-traditional,' when we're very much in the middle, using two American art 
forms: jazz and tap." 
</P>
<P>
Another irony is that Jazz Tap is better known in its tour cities than in Los 
Angeles, an economic fact of life Dally would like to change by establishing a 
home base here. Through stringent cost-cutting measures, she and her board of 
directors have reversed the deficit and are striving toward greater local 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
With a new booking agent, choreography commissions and some helpful grants from 
the National Endowment for the Arts and California Arts Council, Dally said she 
feels Jazz Tap is back on track. She has, in fact, expanded the group by adding 
trumpeter Stacy Rowles and dancer Mark Mendonca, 19, from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Why change the configuration of three dancers and three musicians? "I've been 
doing this work long enough to begin to feel some urgency about passing it on 
and providing a setting for someone else," Dally says. "Now that we've made a 
connection with older dancers like Harold Nicholas and Jimmy Slyde, who have 
guested with us (Eddie Brown will guest in the upcoming season), I want to 
expand with younger people. 
</P>
<P>
"Aesthetically, I like having more ages in the group because it's interesting 
to choreograph that way. Mark is raw and young but he has a combination of 
skill, information and musical intuition that makes him right for this group. 
He can relate to what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Mendonca, who began with Jazz Tap in February, says he is excited about joining 
the group he has admired since he was 12. A tap dancer for 13 years, with some 
ballet and jazz training, he has concentrated on a cappella tap improvisation 
for the past few years and said he brings a different style to the group. 
</P>
<P>
"My movement is less perfect than their jazz, ballet and modern dance," he 
says. "My eye sees different shapes in movement than the others do -- it's from 
my background, all those hours of improvising. 
</P>
<P>
"As for my rhythm, I play fewer notes with my feet and I give them stronger 
accents. It fits in with what the group does because it works musically. 
Rhythms don't go wrong." After 10 years, Dally said that Jazz Tap has deepened. 
"We're better rhythm dancers now," she says. "What we do is more refined, it 
has a greater dynamic and a deeper musicality. It's not that our style is 
changing, it's that the possibilities are greater for me as a choreographer. 
Our evolution depends on the different qualities and styles of the people in 
front of me."

THE MUPPET MAN JOINS HIS CUDDLY CREW; 
</P>
<P>
HENSON VARIETY SHOW WILL DEBUT TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After more than 20 years as the man behind the Muppets, Jim Henson is 
understandably reluctant to come out from behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
But Henson, 52, has decided to brave the cameras as host of a series for NBC, 
"The Jim Henson Hour," a comedy-variety program that blends old Muppets, some 
new Muppets, live action and computer animation and debuts at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had originally planned to introduce the series in January, but it was 
postponed due to production delays and lack of an appropriate time slot. Henson 
had hoped the show would land in the 7 p.m. Sunday time slot now occupied by 
"The Magical World of Disney." 
</P>
<P>
But in any time slot, Henson said in an interview, he was not terribly pleased 
to find himself thrust into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I always prefer to be slightly behind camera," said Henson, a professorially 
absent-minded sort with longish gray hair and a neat beard of the same hue. 
"But (appearing on camera) seemed like the logical thing for this type of a 
show." 
</P>
<P>
The type of show Henson meant is the family variety hour, a genre that has had 
few successful incarnations in recent years. By coming out for a fireside chat 
with the audience, Henson hopes to re-create the magic of Walt Disney's family 
series, which has survived in various incarnations since 1958 -- most of which 
featured the grandfatherly Walt in conversation with his audience, as well as 
his animated friends. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Frons, the NBC programming vice president overseeing the show, thinks the 
Henson hour has a chance to resuscitate variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
Today's audience has grown too sophisticated for the traditional song-and-dance 
variety shows, he said, but they remain eager to sample new varieties of 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Real People' in 1979 and 1983's 'Bloopers and Practical Jokes' were variety 
shows," he said. "And I know this is going to sound strange, but 'Unsolved 
Mysteries' (NBC's real-life crime series), while it is not a variety show in 
the traditional or any other sense of the word, is a new form, it's reinventing 
the form. I think Henson would fall into the same category." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Henson show has been in development for two years, Frons said the 
series also fits nicely into the network's plan to provide more wholesome 
family shows -- partly in response to the recent deluge of complaints about 
"trash TV" programming on the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that, in an attempt to respond to the viewers and the 
advertisers, whom we have heard loud and clear, we are trying to show that we 
are a full-service network, and that we have things we can point to with 
pride," Frons said. 
</P>
<P>
Unconcerned with network politics, Henson only hopes he can fall into the same 
category as Kermit the Frog. Henson, who performs the voice of Kermit, believes 
his presence can be the amiable glue that holds the format-less show together 
-- much as Kermit provides the voice of sanity among the motley Muppets. Kermit 
will co-host the variety show, 12 episodes of which have been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think that Kermit was a normal person in the middle of a bunch of 
crazies," Henson mused. "And I guess I sort of see myself in that role." 
</P>
<P>
The show's collection of oddball characters is even broader and more colorful 
than Henson's usual. "The Jim Henson Hour" rockets Muppetry into the Space Age 
by creating Muppet Central, a computer-generated control room from which Kermit 
and other regulars program the show. Among those regulars is Waldo C. Graphic, 
a colorful, hummingbird-sized, computer-generated entity who travels at high 
speed among the Muppets and human guest stars. Also new to the Muppet clan is 
Digit, an off-kilter half-human-half-robot, who helps Kermit run Muppet 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
Other new Muppets include characters of the more traditionally cuddly sort, 
including the relentlessly adorable Bean Bunny -- hired by Kermit to be cute, 
as Henson said, "so the rest of us don't have to be." Bean's aggressive side, 
however, will be revealed in a future sequence titled "Bambo." 
</P>
<P>
Henson at first did not want to get involved in the NBC project, having plenty 
of other projects to keep him busy. His New York-based company, Henson 
Associates, produces Saturday morning cartoon series, cable TV series, live 
arena shows and feature films and runs a healthy licensing business for Muppet 
products. Henson dreams of doing a Broadway show based on his characters. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC managed to land him, he said, by offering him the opportunity to do a 
show whose format can vary from week to week. The series also provides a new 
forum for Henson's "The Storyteller," an Emmy Award-winning collection of 
live-action fables hosted by John Hurt, which formerly ran on NBC as occasional 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are nice," Henson said modestly. "They won a couple of Emmys. They're 
some of the prettiest television we've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
Along with "The Storyteller," the second half-hour each week will feature 
dramatic pieces, including the animated "Snake Samba" -- which Henson says 
creates a "whole new look," with bright paint-box colors culled from African 
art -- and "Dog City," a parody of several old movie classics with a cast of 
animated canines. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the entire Henson hour will be devoted to one subject; some 
upcoming specials include "Living With Dinosaurs," the story of a 9-year-old 
boy and his stuffed prehistoric pet, and "Monster Maker," about a teen-ager who 
gets a job building the creatures for fantasy films. 
</P>
<P>
Henson said the show will blend child-pleasing Muppet antics with sophisticated 
adult satire in hopes of appealing to both age groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to do something outside of 'Sesame Street,' which is 
specifically aimed at children," he said. "We do this show at a level we 
enjoy."

MUPPETS MAINTAIN HUGGABILITY IN 'JIM HENSON HOUR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of television's oldest stars -- the Muppets -- are still among the 
freshest. 
</P>
<P>
That applies to the "Sesame Street" creatures on PBS, "Jim Henson's Muppet 
Babies" on CBS and now also to "The Jim Henson Hour," one of the new Friday 
night entries on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Its premiere -- at 8 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39 -- is a happy, 
imaginative, cleverly written, fur-flying romp. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Muppeteering yields entertainment on two levels: visual for the young 
and satirical for adults. The program's magazine segment includes that fabulous 
singing group, The Extremes; a visit with a somewhat bizarre-looking candidate 
in the Miss Galaxy pageant ("I want to work with underprivileged children -- 
and eat them!") and a splendid production of "My Dinner With Godzilla" starring 
comedian Louie Anderson and Godzilla itself. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, the bill arrives. Louie to Godzilla: "Let's see, you had Tokyo, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
Another regular segment is that old favorite, "The Storyteller," tonight 
featuring John Hurt as the medieval spinner of tales. Written by Anthony 
Minghella, the delightful opening story is about a giant who has no heart. But 
how many do? 
</P>
<P>
"The Jim Henson Hour" has old Muppets and new Muppets, all of them goofy, all 
of them huggable, all of them a bright addition to prime time. HOWARD ROSENBERG

TRUSTEES WON'T DISCLOSE REASON; 
</P>
<P>
CHANCELLOR OF COLLEGE DISTRICT PUT ON LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The chancellor of the North Orange County Community College District was ousted 
from his post after a midnight vote by the Board of Trustees, but district 
officials and board members contacted Thursday refused to say why. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor James S. Kellerman, whose $97,000-a-year contract runs through June, 
1991, was informed of the decision to place him on paid administrative leave 
Wednesday afternoon by board President Otto Locayo. 
</P>
<P>
Locayo and three other board members interviewed Thursday refused to say 
whether the board will move next to dismiss Kellerman. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote to remove Kellerman, taken at 11:55 p.m. Tuesday, is the 
second time in 3 years that district trustees have ousted their chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Kellerman, 54, a former vice chancellor for the district, was appointed 
chancellor in February, 1986, after his predecessor, Leadie Clark, was fired. A 
discrimination suit filed by Clark, who is black, was settled for $125,000 in 
an out-of-court agreement in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Kellerman were unsuccessful Thursday. His wife, Tricia, 
declined to comment when reached at the couple's Fullerton home. 
</P>
<P>
Berdette (Bert) Cofer, 61, was named to replace Kellerman on an interim basis. 
Cofer, who emerged from semi-retirement in January when he signed a 1-year, 
$450-a-day contract to be the district's interim vice chancellor of finance and 
facilities, said Thursday that he will not be a candidate for the permanent 
position if Kellerman ultimately is fired. 
</P>
<P>
As for Tuesday's action, Cofer said he had "no indication that what happened 
was about to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Cofer retired in July after 12 years as a financial executive with Yosemite 
Community College District and now lives in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not aware of why the board made its decision," Cofer said. "I did 
not ask and I did not want to know. I view my role at this juncture as keeping 
the college strong and the instructional program operating to the benefit of 
the students and community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Findings' by Counsel 
</P>
<P>
Board members said Thursday that Kellerman's removal as chancellor was based on 
"findings" by Spencer Covert, the district's legal counsel, but refused to 
elaborate. Covert could not be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The matter that resulted in Kellerman's ouster had been discussed in closed 
session over "a couple of months," according to board member Wallace Hardy. He 
said the action was not prompted by any charges of misconduct, conflict of 
interest or any disagreement with the board or college faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"We did something fairly drastic, but it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision," 
Hardy said. Added Hardy: "I was fairly pleased with the way he was doing his 
job." 
</P>
<P>
A faculty government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
there was growing dissatisfaction on the part of faculty government and union 
members with Kellerman's perceived lack of initiative to recruit minority 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly bill passed last fall, AB 1725, requires, in part, that community 
college faculties reflect the racial diversity of the state population by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Faster-Acting Chancellor' 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us wanted a faster-acting chancellor," the faculty member said. "The 
top administration was not moving as quickly as possible to get in line to hire 
the most qualified minority instructors." 
</P>
<P>
North Orange County Community College District runs Cypress and Fullerton 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview shortly after becoming chancellor in 1986, Kellerman said staff 
morale had improved significantly since he took over from Clark. He contrasted 
his leadership style, saying: "I'm considerably more open, believe in more 
participation of the faculty, staff and students."

VIET GROUP WANTS OFFICIAL RECALLED;

<P>
MEMBERS UPSET OVER WESTMINSTER COUNCILMAN'S REMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A leader of Orange County's Vietnamese community announced plans Thursday to 
recall Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr., who voted to deny a parade 
permit sought by a group of South Vietnamese military veterans while telling 
them, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese community will not sit still for this," said Arthur Suchesk, a 
spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee who pledged to 
start the recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
Fry's statement, made at a Westminster City Council meeting earlier in the 
week, was racially insensitive, Suchesk and Vietnamese veterans have charged. 
The armed forces day committee sought a parade permit and approval to block 
traffic on busy Bolsa Avenue in Westminster's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
Fry, who joined three other council members who voted against the request, told 
the group's representatives that they should commemorate their war dead on a 
U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day or Veteran's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be Americans. If 
you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam," Fry said. "That may 
be unfair, but that's my opinion, and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of 
people around here." 
</P>
<P>
Fry made the controversial statement during the city's first council meeting to 
be broadcast on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"His statements were uncalled for," said Tony Lam, a Vietnamese community and 
business leader. "It's an insult. He's so naive to make that kind of a 
statement. We're trying to be in the mainstream of America, yet, on the other 
hand, we're trying to maintain our cultural heritage. That's why we work in 
harmony. But that kind of a statement really breaks up the harmony." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Human Relations Commission on Thursday condemned Fry's 
comments and called for both an apology and a reconsideration of the parade 
request after hearing from three representatives of the Vietnamese veterans' 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County Human Relations Commission deplores the comments attributed 
to Councilman Fry as an affront to the Vietnamese community and to the general 
community," Commission Chairman Daniel Ninburg said in a statement issued after 
the regular commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"These remarks caused the issue before the council to be clouded by 
emotionalism. We therefore urge Councilman Fry to apologize . . . and we call 
on the City Council to reconsider its denial in an atmosphere free of 
prejudiced comments," the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster City Council voted 4 to 1 late Tuesday to reject the proposal, 
which would have honored all soldiers who fought the Communists in Vietnam. 
Only Mayor Charles V. Smith, a Korean War veteran, supported the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Tien Nguyen, another committee member and former officer in South Vietnam's air 
force, said the parade would have commemorated all Vietnam veteran "comrades in 
arms," including those from New Zealand, the Philippines, Canada, Thailand, the 
United States and South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with the issue of assimilation; it's just to honor 
their dead and our dead. That's the issue here," Suchesk said. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans' group plans to mobilize the Vietnamese community and mount an 
"anti-Fry" campaign with demonstrations, stories in the Vietnamese-language 
media and posters publicizing Fry's statement, Suchesk said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Fry, whose brash, off-the-cuff statements in the past have landed 
him in similar embarrassing situations, denied that he is a bigot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a racist. My vote was a protest against some of the divisiveness we 
now have in the city," Fry said, alluding to Westminster's growing Vietnamese 
community, which has established its own aggressive business base but still 
retains its cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see two of everything like we got going in this city," Fry said. "We 
have two chambers of commerce, and we even have two Lions clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, when Vietnamese refugees left their homeland, thousands were 
relocated to Orange County, where an estimated 100,000 Vietnamese residents 
live. Vietnamese living in Westminster, a city of 75,000 people, make up almost 
15% of the population.

'WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT DRUGS?';

<P>
CHURCHES DEMAND WAR ON 'EPIDEMIC'

<P>
In an atmosphere charged with the excitement of a political convention, 1,200 
church members packed an Anaheim auditorium Thursday and won commitments from 
the mayors of Orange County's two largest cities to do more to combat drugs in 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors of Anaheim and Santa Ana promised the crowd that they would take to 
their city councils a resolution declaring the existence of a "drug epidemic" 
and calling for coordinated action by local police, prosecutors, judges, 
educators and elected officials to eradicate it. 
</P>
<P>
To the delight of the crowd, Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter and Santa Ana Mayor 
Daniel H. Young put their promises in writing on a blackboard wheeled out to 
the school auditorium stage by Father John Lenihan of St. Boniface Church in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional 90-minute meeting began with members of 15 Santa Ana and Anaheim 
churches standing and roaring as Lenihan called out the names of each of their 
parishes, which have banded together to form the Orange County 
Congregation-Community Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the stage, Hunter clenched his jaw and Young folded his hands and 
glanced down at papers in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
Then the audience heard a report from Stan Martin of St. Joseph's Church in 
Santa Ana, who outlined problems found by the interfaith federation during 6 
months of research: a lack of detoxification beds for drug addicts; too few 
police officers and prosecutors assigned to combat illegal narcotics; a 
shortage of jail space, and too little money spent on anti-drug programs in 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't find the money to deal with the drug epidemic that is destroying our 
families and killing our children," Martin told those assembled. "We want a 
coordinated, strategic campaign -- today, not tomorrow. What's being done today 
is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting then turned somber as group members gave testimony about their own 
family experiences with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Maciel of St. Joseph's parish wept as she told the story of her brother, 
Thomas, who died at age 28 in an Orange County Jail cell in 1984. It was the 
last of several such visits that began after "Tommy" began using drugs at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Alaniz, a mother of three from Anaheim, told of her 6-year-old already 
talking with friends about other children using marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I had a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it shook me that my 6-year-old already had to be involved in that 
conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Alcala of St. Boniface parish drew a thunderous ovation when she asked 
the mayors why politicians seem so concerned about building new freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we doing about drugs?" she asked. "Isn't that more important?" 
</P>
<P>
Hunter quickly made it clear that he agreed with Alcala. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many weak-kneed . . . milquetoast politicians who are going 
around the county telling you that traffic is the No. 1 problem," Hunter said. 
"I agree with you. We need to stop drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter told the crowd that, as a former police officer, he is familiar with the 
problems caused by drug abuse and drug trafficking in communities. "There are 
people today in state prison because of Fred Hunter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution to the drug problem, Hunter said, is that "punishment must 
be swift, it must be sure, it must be severe. . . . If one marijuana cigarette 
is found in a car, take that car. If a dope pusher is selling cocaine, take 
that house." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Young, who followed the fiery Hunter to the podium, told the 
crowd that he was "saddened by the testimony and not naive to it." He recited a 
list of Santa Ana city programs aimed at fighting drugs, but acknowledged, 
"It's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
The congregations were brought together with the help of the Orange County 
Sponsoring Committee, an umbrella group of religious and lay community leaders 
that began organizing county neighborhoods in the 1970s.

SWISS POLICE ARREST FOURTH SUSPECT IN WAYNE-LUBY ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Century City private investigator who allegedly hired two men to rough up 
John Wayne's daughter and her companion has been arrested in Switzerland, 
Newport Beach police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
O. Daniel Gal, 32, was arrested by Swiss police earlier this week on a 
provisional warrant issued by Interpol, the international police agency. 
Newport Beach authorities said Gal would be brought back to California within 
60 days to face charges of criminal conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said Gal was arrested sometime between 
Monday and Wednesday by the Swiss, but it was not immediately known where in 
Switzerland he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got this much from the Justice Department," Newman said. "We will know 
more later. All we know now is they got him." 
</P>
<P>
Gal is the fourth and final person to be arrested in connection with the Oct. 3 
assault on Aissa Wayne and financier Roger Luby at Luby's Newport Beach estate. 
Police have accused Wayne's former husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis of Pomona, of 
masterminding the attack by two pistol-carrying intruders because of a bitter 
dispute over the custody of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, two men surprised Wayne and Luby in the garage of Luby's 
home, bound and beat them and slashed one of Luby's Achilles' tendons. Before 
leaving, one of the attackers turned to Wayne and said: "You're (messing) with 
the wrong guy. Next time, we kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon, pleaded innocent to a single conspiracy charge 
and is being held in Orange County Jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear 
in Orange County Superior Court today for a hearing to appeal a decision 
denying him bail. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who allegedly carried out the attack, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, of 
Burbank and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, also remain jailed with 
bail set at $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Gionis hired Gal's firm last year when he and Wayne 
were going through an acrimonious divorce and custody fight over their 
daughter. Prosecutors claim that Gal eventually hired Hintergardt and Bouey to 
carry out the attack at Luby's home. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, construction workers across the street from Luby's 
estate told police that two men fitting the descriptions of Gal and Hintergardt 
were seen outside the Luby home the day of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
In statements to investigators, Gal conceded he was outside Luby's home that 
day but claimed he was there merely conducting routine surveillance on Wayne. 
He said he knew nothing of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they closed in on Gal when they learned that Hintergardt had 
previously worked for Gal's investigative agency, and a search warrant revealed 
that in the weeks before the attack, Gionis had paid Gal about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
By Feb. 14, when Newport Beach police went to Gal's Century City offices to 
question him, Gal was in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At Gionis' bail hearing, prosecutors introduced into evidence records 
suggesting that Gionis and Gal had exchanged messages through an intermediary 
as recently as February. 
</P>
<P>
That evidence included a series of fax messages between Gal in Europe and his 
sister, Emmy, in Los Angeles, which prosecutors said included a discussion of 
how to handle Newport Beach police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 9 message, Gal's sister wrote that she had "talked to Tom Gionis 
finally" and that Gionis had told her to have Gal contact him at his Upland 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In another message, Gal advised his sister, "If (Newport Beach Police Sgt. 
Mike) Jackson talks to you, you don't know where I am or when I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police said Gal was arrested after confidential information 
placed him in either France or Switzerland. According to Newman, the local 
warrant was forwarded to the State Department, which then worked through the 
Justice Department to contact Interpol.

8 COUNTY RESIDENTS INDICTED IN MAJOR POT-SMUGGLING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Several Orange County residents, including a Tustin attorney, are among 12 
people indicted in the alleged smuggling of at least 26 tons of marijuana to 
the West Coast from Southeast Asia, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents said the ring transported the drug in several shiploads between 
1984 and 1987, usually transferring their illicit cargo to smaller vessels 
before landing in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-count indictment, which also alleges several conspiracies to defraud the 
Internal Revenue Service and violate federal tax laws, was unsealed late 
Wednesday after the arrests of five of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tustin Lawyer Surrenders 
</P>
<P>
A sixth, Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50, surrendered to federal 
authorities Thursday morning. All were arraigned Thursday afternoon before U.S. 
Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Assistant U.S. Attys. Steven D. Clymer and Russell Hayman, 
Tassopulos set bail for Pearson at $1 million. Pearson's attorney, James 
Riddet, called the amount an "absolute outrage" and said his client had made 
himself available to federal prosecutors almost from the beginning of the 
18-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson could not raise the $1-million bail, Riddet said, and the suspect was 
being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, former Maui, Hawaii, resident William Uhler, 39, 
who in 1986 reportedly gave a Cypress address, and Eugene LaForce, 53, of Cave 
Junction, Ore., organized and directed at least four major marijuana shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler, LaForce, longtime Maui resident Walter M. Hillinger, 56, and others 
allegedly brought 8 tons from Thailand aboard a ship named the Lloyd B. George 
in September, 1984, transferring it off the coast of Mendocino County to two 
smaller vessels that carried it to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in Hawaii 
</P>
<P>
Hillinger was arrested Thursday morning in Hawaii, the U.S. attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 7 tons of marijuana allegedly was brought to California in 1985 aboard 
the Lady Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel whose ownership reportedly was 
traced to a partnership that included several names from the obituary columns 
of the Orange County Register. Federal authorities said the ring went to great 
lengths to cover up ownership of the vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the prosecutors said, Uhler, LaForce and the others smuggled 11 
additional tons of marijuana from Thailand to a point between Hawaii and 
Tahiti, where it was put aboard another vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried 
to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drug charges, Uhler, Pearson, Dovie M. Briggs, 56, a Cypress 
income-tax preparer who is Uhler's mother-in-law, and Terry P. Dee, 47, of Seal 
Beach, former owner of Faber Laboratories, a Fullerton business that tested 
crankcase oil, were indicted on federal income tax charges. 
</P>
<P>
Others indicted were Larry A. Doyle, 49, of Newport Beach; Charles E. Larsen, 
45, of Costa Mesa; Martin E. Levine, 49, of New York City and San Francisco; 
Michael A. Tzouanakis, 35, of Costa Mesa; Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset 
Beach, and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay.

GREEN LIGHT GIVEN TO KILL RED FOXES IN SEAL BEACH REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge declared Thursday that red foxes are fair game for government 
trappers at a national wildlife refuge in Seal Beach, finding that the foxes 
can be killed because they pose a significant threat to two endangered species 
of birds. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher refused to grant an animal rights 
group's request for an injunction that would have prohibited the U.S. 
government from killing or maiming the foxes at the refuge within the Seal 
Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
Although a federal court trial is pending on a suit filed by the Orange 
County-based Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., government officials said after 
Kelleher's ruling that they expect the trapping and killing of the animals to 
resume immediately. Trapping of the foxes had been permitted but killing them 
had been prohibited under a court order of last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have ordered the trapping and 
killing of several hundred of the foxes since 1986, an effort they say is 
essential to preserve two species of birds on which the foxes prey: the 
light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foxes Not Natives 
</P>
<P>
Both birds are native to California and are listed nationally as endangered 
species. The red foxes, which are not native to California, are believed to 
have been introduced in the area many decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights group challenged the trapping program almost immediately, and 
a legal battle that has pitted supporters of the foxes against those backing 
the birds has since been mired in federal trial and appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue remains to be decided in the coming federal court trial, 
Kelleher made clear in his ruling Thursday that, so far, he finds the evidence 
overwhelmingly in the government's favor. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to grant the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. a preliminary injunction 
to halt the fox trapping, Kelleher said he was strongly persuaded that to allow 
the red foxes to roam unhindered within the 5,000-acre weapons station "would 
jeopardize the lives of the two endangered species." The military site includes 
the Anaheim Bay National Wildlife Refuge, where the birds nest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 6 Clapper Rail Pairs 
</P>
<P>
Kelleher said he was particularly swayed by testimony Thursday from Richard 
Zembal, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who said that the population 
of the clapper rails has generally declined in the last few years to a low of 
only 6 pairs earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although he knew of only a few direct sightings of the red foxes preying on the 
clapper rails, Zembal said numerous signs around the birds' nests -- such as 
fox hairs and tracks -- make the danger apparent. "There's no question . . . 
(the red foxes) are a predator," he told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Kelleher said that Congress, through passage of recent environmental protection 
statutes, has made clear that when the interests of two competing species hang 
in the balance, an endangered animal should receive the higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Animal Lovers group, disputing Kelleher's findings, said 
they plan to press ahead for a full trial on the issue in hopes of gaining a 
permanent injunction against the government's killing of the red foxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely flabbergasted by the judge's decision, because the hard 
evidence all points the other way from his decision," said Harold Baerg, 
president of the animal lovers group. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the government's policy in Seal Beach, in addition to moving 
toward the virtual extinction of a species of fox that was brought into this 
area, has inadvertently harmed other animals in the refuge as well. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture trapper Craig Knight testified that in 
the course of catching about 84 red foxes last year, his traps also caught 60 
untargeted skunks, opossums and wild cats. Like the foxes, they too were killed 
by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials could not say how many foxes still roam the Seal Beach site. 
According to Animal Lovers officials, about 263 of the animals have been killed 
by the government in the last 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert B. Briggs said Kelleher's decision was an important 
affirmation of the government's position. He said he expects federal officials 
to complete an environmental assessment of the red fox situation in Seal Beach 
by November, as ordered by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision 
earlier this year.

HER 2 SONS TEMPORARILY MOVED TO GRANDPARENT'S HOME

Carol Brooks, the North Tustin baby-sitter at whose home one toddler drowned 
and two others suffered brain damage after falling into a swimming pool, has 
temporarily lost custody of her own two children. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Frank Fasel placed the children in 
the Yorba Linda home of their paternal grandmother, Connie Duplex, at the 
request of Brooks' ex-husband, Ken Duplex, who also lives in the home. 
Permanent custody will be determined at a court hearing set for May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex, a 22-year-old plumber, alleged in court papers filed Wednesday that 
Brooks, from whom he has been separated for about a year and a half, "has a 
history of child abuse" and has kept the children in a "totally filthy" 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what kind of a mother I am, and he knows I would never hurt my 
children," Brooks said in an interview Thursday. "So, he's trying to use the 
pool accident." 
</P>
<P>
The two children, Alex, 2, and Daniel, 1, were inside the gated and fenced pool 
area when Brooks found the three other toddlers at the bottom of the murky pool 
on March 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office has not yet decided whether to 
file charges against Brooks because of the swimming pool incident, in which 
14-month-old Arthur Matthew Griese died. Melissa Polsfoot, 19 months, of Tustin 
is in a coma in stable condition; Jonathan Weston, 22 months, of North Tustin 
is reported in stable condition but not in a coma. Doctors have said that both 
children suffered severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
"This emergency situation occurring at my ex-wife's residence has made me 
deathly afraid regarding my boys' living situation," Duplex said in his 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 24, helped her parents run the unlicensed day-care home, which county 
social services workers had twice ordered closed. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' alleged abuse of her own children stems from an incident that occurred 
at a gas station in Newport Beach last July. Duplex claims that Brooks, angry 
that her former husband was unwilling to try to reconcile their differences, 
grabbed Alex by the arm, whipped him over her shoulder and slammed him to the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks disputed that account of the incident in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, think about it," she said. "If I had done that on a busy street in 
Newport Beach, don't you think we would have had a circle of people around us?" 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' version of the incident is that Duplex wanted to take Alex away from 
her and that, in the struggle, she ripped Duplex's shirt. Alex was never taken 
out of her car, she contended. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex's attorney, John Balent, said the incident was included in Duplex's 
declaration Wednesday to persuade Fasel to take the children away from Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the judge well enough that he's not going to move them just because she 
was watching children when they fell into a pool," Balent said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said she could not understand why Fasel placed the children in Duplex's 
house, given his current legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex was arrested April 2 on a warrant charging him with assault and battery 
and threatening a witness. He was held overnight in Orange County Jail and is 
now awaiting trial on the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Balent said the charges were based on false complaints filed by Brooks. 
However, Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said 
details of the case were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks further alleged that Duplex owes her $855 for about 3 months' child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex Thursday acknowledged that he is in arrears on child-support payments. 
"Right after I got the divorce, I lost my job," he said. He earns less than he 
used to at his new job in Riverside County and so far has been unable to catch 
up on the $300 monthly payments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex and Brooks met at a fast-food restaurant where both worked a few years 
ago, Brooks said. They married in September, 1986, and were separated about a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
"We were both unstable with the marriage. He was not grown up enough," she 
said. "I was young and stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was granted visitation privileges three times a week, pending the May 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"They're too young to be involved in this stuff," Brooks said about her two 
boys. "They don't understand why there is all this upheaval and why they are . 
. . living somewhere else."

MOORE USES HIS SLIDER TO END ATHLETICS' SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not likely that anyone in the Oakland Athletics' front office dared even 
consider a scenario that included Jose Canseco's and Mark McGwire's 
simultaneous tenure on the disabled list when they signed free-agent pitcher 
Mike Moore this winter. But it's beginning to look like $3.9 million well 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
The team that would be the 1927 Yankees may have to make like the 1965 Dodgers 
for a while if it intends to win that World Series championship it covets. The 
A's version of Murderers' Row looks more like petty thieves these days without 
their big guns, but the starting pitchers are doing their best Sandy Koufax and 
Don Drysdale imitations. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium, it was Moore's turn and the tall 
right-hander responded with a three-hit shutout for eight innings as Oakland 
beat the Angels, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of performance General Manager Sandy Alderson had in mind when 
he signed the former Mariner to a three-year deal and -- more important to the 
A's -- a marked departure from Moore's debut in Oakland green and gold. Moore 
made his first start Saturday against Chicago and yielded nine hits, five runs 
and seven walks in 5 1/3 innings of a 7-4 A's loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw the kind of pitcher he was all spring and then you saw the situation 
Saturday," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "Mike was obviously real excited 
(Saturday). It was just a matter of being himself." 
</P>
<P>
It's kind of hard to imagine Mike Moore being really excited. On the surface 
anyway, this is not an excitable boy. He's willing to admit that it's possible 
he was a tad too pumped up for his Oakland coming-out party, but he wasn't 
exactly hyperventilating. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous (Saturday), I just had better stuff today," Moore said. "I 
guess there's a possibility I was trying to do a little too much in the first 
game. I was overthrowing a little." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, he was just over-achieving. Lance Parrish lined a single to left in 
the second. Jack Howell singled to right in the second and Glenn Hoffman 
blooped a single to left in the eighth. Howell was the only Angel runner to 
reach second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think this was the real Mike Moore today," he said. "I struggled a 
little bit with location of my fastball early, but my breaking ball picked me 
up." 
</P>
<P>
That's putting it mildly. Moore's slider not only picked him up, it slammed the 
Angels down. He struck out seven, and all but one were left-handed batters who 
chased low-and-inside sliders all day. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike threw a lot of nasty sliders in real good locations," said Dave Duncan, 
the A's pitching coach. "He used the inside part of the plate very well. He 
established the slider for strikes early, was ahead in the count a lot and got 
them to chase some sliders that were just below the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who was 65-96 with a 4.38 earned-run average in parts of seven seasons 
with Seattle, finished up last year with a 5-3 record in his last 12 starts. 
The A's figured he would have been at least 8-0 during that span if he were 
pitching for Oakland. His ERA was 2.38, he struck out 91 batters in 90 2/3 
innings and had five complete games and two shutouts during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Moore appeared to be on his way to his first shutout and complete game with the 
A's Thursday, but La Russa decided to remove him after the eighth because Moore 
had thrown 119 pitches and ace reliever Dennis Eckersley "needed an inning of 
work." 
</P>
<P>
"A shutout would have been nice, but we've got the best bullpen in the business 
and a long way to go," Moore said. "I felt pretty good, but I had thrown quite 
a few pitches." 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of them were of the quality variety and that's just what the 
A's need at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important win in a lot of ways," La Russa said. "It stopped a 
two-game (losing) streak, and if you're going to have a good year, you can't 
have extended losing streaks. And it picked us up when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he didn't feel any added pressure to pitch well because of the 
absence of Canseco and McGwire, but Duncan, for one, is willing to admit that 
the pitching staff may have to carry an added burden for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can throw shutouts every day," he said, "but, over the course 
of the year, if anybody can lose two key offensive players and overcome it with 
quality pitching, then we're that team." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, Bob Welch and Storm Davis won 54 games last year, more than any 
other trio of starters in the league. Of course, they benefited from the Bash 
Bros. offense that averaged almost five runs a game for Stewart and Welch and 
more than five for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Moore figures to make the A's rotation even more formidable and he won't be 
complaining about the missing links in Oakland's offensive chain. The A's 
lineup looks pretty good to him the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Seattle scored an average of just 3 1/2 runs a game behind him last 
year.

OCC RECOVERS QUICKLY, RIPS GOLDEN WEST, 15-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Orange Coast College's baseball team hit a brief low Tuesday, when it was upset 
by last-place Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
But OCC came back with a 15-2 pounding of Golden West in an Orange Empire 
Conference game Thursday at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, OCC could have moved into a first-place tie with Rancho Santiago, but 
was upset, 10-7. Now, OCC (23-9-1 overall and 10-6 in conference) is a 
half-game out of first. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we looked past Riverside," OCC Coach Mike Mayne said. "It was 
important for this club to win today. I was leery coming in. You stub your toe 
against Riverside and you don't know if it's going to be an infection." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, OCC took control from the outset with three runs in the first and 
three more in the second to build a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
From there, OCC pitcher Ryan Thibault had things going his way. Thibault, a 
left-hander, pitched a six-hitter with nine strikeouts and one walk. His record 
improved to 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Thibault threw about as well as you can," Mayne said. "He made three bad 
pitches all day. Other than that, he was in command." 
</P>
<P>
OCC's Scott Talanoa hit a three-run home run well over the left-field fence to 
give OCC a 6-0 lead in the second. Hector Santa Cruz had walked with one out in 
the second, and Craig Nixon followed with a single. Jason Young flied to center 
for the second out, but Talanoa hit his conference-leading 13th home run of the 
season. Talanoa, OCC's designated hitter, also had an RBI single in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
OCC was helped in the first when Golden West third baseman Josh Bammer dropped 
a high pop-up near the mound. Young flied to center for what would have been 
the third out, but it was only the second. Talanoa, Marty Cordova and Eddie 
Pierce followed with consecutive RBI singles off loser Dave Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West managed single runs in the fourth and fifth to make it 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
OCC came back with two more runs in the sixth, two more in the seventh, and 
five in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, Young and Pierce had three hits each for OCC, which had 16. Talanoa had 
four RBIs, Santa Cruz, Cordova and Pierce had two RBIs each. Nixon also scored 
four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West falls to 15-11-1 overall, and 9-6 and fourth place in conference. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire games: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 4, Riverside 2 -- Cypress moved into a first-place tie with Rancho 
Santiago with a victory at Riverside. Dennis Burbank (9-4) and Jeff Patterson 
combined on a six-hitter. Patterson pitched 2 1/3 innings, retiring the final 
eight batters he faced, for the save. Doug Yates hit a two-run homer in the 
third for Cypress (24-11, 10-5). Mitch Kaylor had an RBI single in the ninth 
for Cypress' final run. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 5, Fullerton 3 -- Saddleback scored five runs in the third inning 
for the victory at Saddleback. Sean Therien went two for four with two RBIs, 
and Don Harrell added two hits for Saddleback (14-10-1, 6-7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Eric Patton (4-3) gave up seven hits and struck out nine for the victory, and 
Todd Bush got his ninth save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In a nonconference game: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 14, Cerritos 9 -- Tim Reynolds went four for six with three 
RBIs and a home run, Conrad Colby went three for three with two RBIs, and John 
McTaggart had three hits and three RBIs to lead Rancho Santiago (21-12) at 
home.

FULLERTON IS HOPING TO VAULT BACK TO THE FUTURE;

<P>
TITAN GYMNASTS MAKING FIRST APPEARANCE IN NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE 1986 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 21, Heather Thomas is the old lady of Cal State Fullerton gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
When the Titans begin competition in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships at Athens, Ga., today, Thomas will be the only gymnast who was on 
the last Titan team to compete for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1986, when Thomas was a freshman who spent a lot of time looking up 
to Tami Elliott, one of the best gymnasts in Fullerton history. That was back 
when Fullerton's making it to the nationals was as sure a as spring making it 
to April. 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years in a row, Fullerton was in the nationals. That streak ended after 
1986, though. Now Fullerton is back, after a two-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
For Coach Lynn Rogers, the central emotion is relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I confess to kind of taking for granted those 11 years, assuming we'd always 
have healthy kids, assuming I'd always make the right decisions," Rogers said. 
"Then there was the dry spell." 
</P>
<P>
And now there is this team, a team with no seniors and only two juniors -- 
Thomas and Debbie Broderick. It is a team that is so young that it may not much 
feel the pressure of the nationals. After all, the whole team will be back to 
try again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was one of the gymnasts who performed best at the NCAA West Regionals at 
Titan Gym, leading the team to a finish that made the Titans sixth-seeded team 
in the 12-team national championships, which conclude Saturday. Along with 
Thomas, Fullerton's highlighted performances in the regionals came from 
sophomore Stacey Harris and Gina Satterly, a freshman who set two school 
records this season, one on the balance beam, and another in the floor exercise 
that she shares with Harris. 
</P>
<P>
She has been at Fullerton longer than anyone else one the women's team. She 
might also qualify as the most heavily taped. 
</P>
<P>
She was redshirted in 1987, the year after her freshman year, because of knee 
surgery. Last year, after suffering a bad ankle sprain just before the season, 
she was limited to competing on the uneven bars and balance beam, forgoing the 
vault and floor exercise and the strain they would have added to her knees and 
ankles. 
</P>
<P>
As she practiced one day last week, Thomas had one knee and both ankles taped. 
</P>
<P>
But the time off, and the time away from vault and floor exercise seem to have 
helped, more than hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, you see at 16 or 17 that gymnasts plateau out," Rogers said. "She's 
better now than she was at 16 or 17. I wish we had her for three or four more 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as she stayed away from vault and floor, she improved on bars. Now 
bars may have surpassed the beam as her best event. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot on bars," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rogers: "There's a range or margin of safety when you're working on bars. 
She plays on the aggressive end of everything she does." 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive end, in this case, is a release move on the bars that Rogers 
said not many others at Athens will do. 
</P>
<P>
"That may be the single most important individual event for us," Rogers said. 
"If she hits and makes the final, she's in the top eight and that gives her a 
chance at the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of this team, though, is that it doesn't have to rely on one 
person or one event. There are no superstars, and no dead weight. That makes 
for confidence going into this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think we need to go in and do what we did all year," Thomas said. "I 
don't think we've had a bad meet." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, seeded sixth, is shooting for second through fourth at the 
nationals. UCLA is highly favored, and seeded No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
With Thomas at one end of the scale, Satterly, a freshman from Chino High 
School who competed for KIPs gymnastics, anchors the other. 
</P>
<P>
With a well-developed natural sense of balance and awareness of space, she she 
excels on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
"You could put this kid upside down and blind-folded in a dark room and she'd 
be able to land with out taking a step," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Should she make an error, Rogers said, she is more able than most to make up 
for it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's off, she can make the correction before it's too late," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Satterly, still enjoying getting used to the differences between individually 
oriented club gymnastics and the college team sport, said she is trying to keep 
her excitement in check. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to stay low key and not get all pumped up because we haven't done 
that all season," she said. "I don't think anything will really change. That's 
kind of been our style all year. We know our job and we go do it."

SERVITE'S DEREK BROWN TO SKIP ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Servite High School running back Derek Brown, who set the Orange County 
single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards last season, has decided not to 
play in the Orange County All-Star football game, according to North Coach John 
Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
"We called all the players or their coaches to find out who wanted to play in 
the game and the Servite athletic director said that Derek would not being 
playing," Barnes said. "He didn't give any reason. I guess Derek just didn't 
want to play. 
</P>
<P>
Brown broke former Edison star Kerwin Bell's mark of 2,226 yards set in 1979. 
Brown also scored 30 touchdowns, including kickoff returns of 92 and 93 yards 
in the Southern Section Division I playoffs. He could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The full team is scheduled to be announced Saturday.

ST. JOSEPH'S FERNANDEZ CATCHES MATER DEI LOOKING

<P>
The Mater Dei softball team may have taken studying for quarterfinal exams a 
little too far, like out to the softball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs got caught studying instead of swinging at pitches Thursday in a 
2-1 loss at home to defending Angelus League champion St. Joseph of Lakewood, 
the top-ranked team in the Southern Section 5-A. 
</P>
<P>
Seven times on two-strike counts, Monarch batters watched as St. Joseph's Lisa 
Fernandez, the Southern Section's top pitcher, delivered a third strike. She 
had a total of 15 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little inexperienced," Mater Dei Coach Cathy Quesnell said. "I don't 
think they understand that on a two-strike count you've got to protect the 
plate, choke up and make contact." 
</P>
<P>
All the scoring came in the first inning. With one out, Fernandez and catcher 
Suzanne Picket singled. Bev Stiglbauer grounded to second baseman Jennifer 
Cline, who flipped it to shortstop Rose Imbriano at second. But Imbriano 
dropped the ball and Fernandez scored from second on the error. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Ourique singled up the middle to score Pickett from third before the 
Monarchs (10-4-2 overall, 0-1-1 in league play) retired the side. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei leadoff batter Beth Lomeli doubled down the first-base line. 
Fernandez struck out the next two batters, then walked Cline before Amy Moeller 
singled to left to bring Lomeli home for the last run of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Quesnell was pleased with her team's performance. The Monarchs managed four 
hits and one earned run against Fernandez, which is saying something. Fernandez 
(14-0) has allowed only five earned runs in her four-year career. She is four 
no-hitters away from breaking Michele Granger of Valencia's record for career 
no-hitters (36) and three games away from Granger's record for career victories 
(71). 
</P>
<P>
"(Fernandez) is just such a fantastic pitcher that even to get one run and as 
many hits as we did, to make the contact, was a confidence builder," Quesnell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph is 15-0, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei freshman Terri Kobata (6-2-1), coming off a 12-inning scoreless tie 
against 4-A champion St. Paul Tuesday, had four strikeouts and gave up six 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making excuses, but she was a little tired," Quesnell said. "We're 
having finals, and it's such a rotten week to play both St. Joseph and St. 
Paul." 
</P>
<P>
In other Angelus League games: 
</P>
<P>
Rosary 8, Bishop Amat 7 (11 innings) -- Kristina Luna doubled in the 
game-winning run with two outs in the bottom of the seventh to give Rosary 
(8-6, 2-1) the victory at Lions Field. Luna had four hits and three RBIs. 
</P>

runs to lead Canyon (11-7, 2-0) at home. Santa Ana Valley is 6-10, 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 5, Foothill 2 -- Chris Redman pitched a no-hitter, striking out 
eight, for the Spartans at Villa Park. Redman (6-5), who has pitched 19 
consecutive innings without a run, allowed unearned runs in the fifth and 
seventh innings. Anne Salzman had two hits, two RBIs and scored a run for Villa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 4, El Dorado 0 -- Jennifer Clement (6-7) pitched a one-hitter for the 
Knights (6-8, 2-0) at Katella. Clement allowed only a first-inning single. 
Cynthia Oliver had a double and two RBIs for Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 3, Loara 0 -- Shannon Skoglund (8-8) pitched a no-hitter, striking 
out three, for Los Alamitos (8-8, 2-0) at Loara. Dana Cipollone had a two-run 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
In the Freeway League: 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 5, Fullerton 0 -- Amy Huett (4-3) pitched a no-hitter, striking out 
11, for the Lancers (11-5, 1-1) at Sunny Hills. Stacey Thurber had three hits 
and scored two runs for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>

Shawna Savage had four RBIs and went three for four with a two-run homer to 
lead Bolsa Grande (4-10, 2-4) at Rancho (0-6). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Christian 3, Whittier Christian 1 -- Capistrano Valley

ORANGE MICRO GETS AST'S LINE OF APPLE DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine's AST Research Inc. sold for an undisclosed sum its line of Apple 
computer products to Orange Micro Inc. in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it sold the products to focus on its much bigger business making 
products for Apple's chief competitor, IBM. AST had said earlier that its Apple 
lines were up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Among the products Orange Micro bought are devices that allow Apple computers 
to run IBM software and a device that lets Apple computer screens display video 
images, such as the images from a security camera. 
</P>
<P>
AST executives were not available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Micro, a maker of devices that allow Apple computers to use non-Apple 
printers, said the new product lines will more than double its sales, which it 
does not disclose beyond saying they are less than $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old Orange Micro said the AST products are also more expensive than 
the products it sells now, such as AST's co-processor add-on boards that allow 
Macintosh personal computers to run IBM software. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the video device that Orange Micro says may have the greatest sales 
potential. Among other uses, the product allows a user to take video images and 
incorporate them into reports on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most exciting product we got in terms of potential," said 
Karl Seppala, director of marketing for Orange Micro. 
</P>
<P>
The video device, called NuView, will be renamed Alive.

$40-MILLION BUTTERFIELD CASE; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L INSURER TO PAY FSLIC $5 MILLION IN DAMAGE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The liability insurer for two top former Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan 
executives has agreed to pay $5 million to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. to settle the agency's $40-million damage suit against the 
pair, Donald and David Endresen. 
</P>
<P>
The FSLIC spent more than $281 million trying to unravel Santa Ana-based 
Butterfield's problems after the S&amp;L was declared insolvent and seized by 
government regulators in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The agency originally filed the damage suit against former Butterfield 
president Donald Endresen; his father, David, who was chairman of the company; 
his brother, William, a vice president; four other individuals, and Butterfield 
Equities Corp., the Endresen-controlled holding company that owned the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants had already either settled for smaller amounts or, in the 
case of William Endresen and Butterfield Equities, had filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement on behalf of the Endresens was agreed to by Harbor Insurance Co. 
of New York, which had carried liability insurance on Butterfield's executives. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, neither Endresen admitted wrongdoing, their attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the FSLIC said a trial is pending in a separate civil action 
seeking $40 million in damages from a group of businessmen in Washington and 
Oregon who sold real estate properties to Butterfield under what the FSLIC 
alleges were questionable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield, which once was one of the fastest-growing S&amp;Ls in the state, 
was operated under a government-sponsored management program from the time it 
was seized until it was sold to Downey S&amp;L of Newport Beach last year.

HARD-TO-BUDGE PUDGE BEGETS AD FLIMFLAM ON CELLULITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLE JACOBS, Carol Jacobs is articles editor for Shape Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard about cellulite -- that jiggles-when-you walk stuff that clings to 
your hips, thighs and buttocks and gives you dimples where you don't want them. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers who promote cellulite-banishing remedies and products would have 
you believe that cellulite is fat gone wrong -- a "unique" breed of fat made of 
fat, water and toxic waste that is immune to traditional weight-loss methods 
(diet and exercise) and responds only to special treatments and products (which 
ad people are happy to sell you). 
</P>
<P>
But before you invest your next paycheck on products or treatments to banish 
hard-to-budge pudge (whether it's an herbal wrap that sets fat free or hip 
boots that squeeze it into submission), there is something you should know 
about cellulite: 
</P>
<P>
Technically, it does not exist -- not in medical dictionaries or journals, and 
certainly not on you. 
</P>
<P>
* The American Medical Assn. states flatly that there is "no medical condition 
known or described as cellulite." 
</P>
<P>
* The Food and Drug Administration says cellulite is "fat on fat": 
double-decker fat, perhaps, but fat nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
* "Fat is fat, wherever it appears on the body," according to the New York 
County Medical Society. "Books (on cellulite) exploit women through a gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, the Postal Service has filed many false-representation 
claims against manufacturers of "cellulite cures" and has seized products as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no such thing as cellulite, but who can deny those dimples and 
quivering, cottage-cheese thighs? If that's not cellulite, what is it? 
</P>
<P>
"There's so little research that most of what we know about the nature of 
cellulite is based on hypothesis," says Dr. Gerald Imber, assistant professor 
of plastic surgery at Cornell University Medical College and a plastic surgeon 
in private practice in New York City. "Basically, the dimples that you see on 
hips, thighs and buttocks are your basic, normal fat, but in an abnormally 
abundant supply." 
</P>
<P>
Imber says dimpling occurs in places on the body where there is an insufficient 
blood supply to sustain the growth of fat cells. As a result, fat cells 
collapse and form dimples. Sometimes, fibrous bands develop between these fatty 
pockets, then sink, giving the skin a bumpy look like cottage cheese. 
</P>
<P>
ORIGINS OF CELLULITE 
</P>
<P>
Cellulite may be a U.S. obsession, but it's not an American invention. The 
concept of cellulite originated in European health spas in the early 1900s but 
didn't become a household word in the United States until 1973, with the 
publication of the blockbuster "Cellulite: Those Lumps, Bumps and Bulges You 
Couldn't Lose Before," by Manhattan beauty salon owner Nicole Ronsard. 
</P>
<P>
Her book offered a six-point program for ridding the body of toxic wastes and 
cellulite through diet, exercise, breathing, massage and relaxation, along with 
a plausible-sounding (but medically preposterous) explanation of what causes 
cells under the skin's surface to become saturated with water and waste 
products that can't be properly eliminated by the liver, kidneys and other 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
The wastes harden and combine with fat and more waste to form pockets of a 
gel-like substance that bulges and creates cellulite, the book says. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Vincent F. Cordaro, a former FDA medical officer, this 
"irrational and unscientific" explanation goes against at least two medical 
facts: Wastes and toxins are not held in any one part of the body; and any 
retention of body wastes signals serious health problems, such as kidney or 
intestinal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"A person who retains wastes and toxins would be very ill, and could die if not 
treated," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The New York County Medical Society agrees: "To present cellulite as a disorder 
of the liver and, by confused association, of the kidneys, intestine and skin, 
is a distortion of science and shows total ignorance of pathophysiology." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to date no one has distinguished fat from cellulite. Biopsies taken at 
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University on fat and "cellulite" cells showed no 
cellular differences, according to Dr. Neil Solomon, former secretary of 
Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who conducted the research. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to suggest that all fat cells are equal. Dr. Peter Vash, assistant 
clinical professor at UCLA and president-elect of the American Society of 
Bariatric Physicians, says new studies show that some fat cells are more 
metabolically active than others. 
</P>
<P>
All fat cells have several metabolic receptors that can be influenced by 
various agents, including sex hormones, emotional stress and tension, 
medication, nicotine and, to some extent, metabolically active agents in food, 
such as caffeine and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Vash says the interaction of all these agents may alter the surface of some fat 
cells so that dimpling results. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing is not a different kind of fat but a situation in which 
certain fat cells have reacted differently to bodily interactions," Vash says. 
</P>
<P>
DIMPLE DISTRIBUTION 
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature was a bit uneven in her distribution of dimples. Hormonal and 
hereditary factors make women more prone to lower-body dimpling than men, who 
tend to store fat in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The connective tissue beneath a woman's skin forms large, round fat-cell 
chambers, while male fat-cell chambers are divided into small, polygonal units 
that do not readily bulge when filled. 
</P>
<P>
Certain outer skin layers (the epidermis and corium) in women are thinner than 
in men -- and more likely to reveal fat bulges underneath. These skin layers 
become increasingly thin and elastic with age, which makes "quivering thighs" 
particularly troublesome for older, overweight women. 
</P>
<P>
Cellulite may not exist, but the alleged treatments and cures are very much 
with us, paid for by unknowing consumers who will do or pay anything to banish 
flab. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. William Jarvis, a professor of health education at Loma Linda 
University in San Bernardino County and president of the National Council 
Against Health Fraud, the rise and fall of the cellulite hoax depends on you, 
the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"You can save yourself thousands of dollars and possible physical injury by 
seeing cellulite for what it is: an illusion created by hucksters more 
interested in taking away your money than your fat." 
</P>
<P>
CELLULITE CURES 
</P>
<P>
Dry up the cellulite hoax by avoiding the following cures: 
</P>
<P>
* Wraps. Popular at spas, you're wrapped, like King Tut, in steaming cloths for 
half an hour to 90 minutes. Proponents say the heat "sets free" fat, water and 
wastes trapped in pockets just beneath the skin and immediately reduces fat by 
transporting excess water from fatty tissue to the bloodstream, where it is 
eliminated naturally by the body's own cleansing system. 
</P>
<P>
Other explanations include: "Fat is pulled out through the skin" and "the wrap 
breaks down cellulite, which will then be eliminated naturally by the body." 
</P>
<P>
Falling for this is not only worthless (all you really lose is water -- and 
money), but potentially dangerous. According to the FDA, tightly wrapping the 
body can cause injury to people with diabetes, varicose veins or other health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Massage: Hands off this hands-on remedy. Proponents say massage pounds away 
at cellulite and breaks it down so it is more easily eliminated by the body. 
But while a massage can relax and stimulate muscles and promote intramuscular 
and intracellular elimination of metabolic wastes, massage will not burn or 
remove fat. Fat cells, like tissues, can't be moved; they simply grow or shrink 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
You can, however, get a pretty good workout by giving a massage. 
</P>
<P>
* Scrubbers: You can't wash cellulite away, no matter how hard you scrub. 
Brushes, horsehair mats and other devices sold for this purpose serve only to 
remove the top layers of dead skin cells, not fat, which is seven layers below. 
</P>
<P>
* Gels and creams (to dissolve cellulite): Anything strong enough to dissolve 
fat would also destroy the skin and tissues on top of it, leaving serious burns 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
* All-natural vitamins, supplements tablets, etc.: These supplements may

* Passive exercise machines: The most wishful cure of all says that you can lie

machines were seized by FDA officials for fraudulent advertising.

'ZOOT SUIT' CREATOR STRESSES IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"From the time I was 6 years old," playwright and director Luis Valdez told a 
Cal State Fullerton audience Wednesday night, "I found myself asking, 'Who am 
I?' " 
</P>
<P>
Valdez -- founder of El Teatro Campesino, creator of the stage hit "Zoot Suit" 
and writer and director of the film of the same name, plus "La Bamba" and "The 
Ballad of Gregorio Cortez" -- mused on the topic of identity, personal and 
cultural, as the university's Distinguished Hispanic Lecturer for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As an artist, Valdez said, he seeks to define "what it means to be an 
American." His writing has evolved from the highly political actos of the early 
days of El Teatro Campesino (the Farm Workers' Theater) to become more 
introspective. 
</P>
<P>
"My writing gets more personal as it goes," Valdez told a vocal and 
appreciative crowd in the university's Little Theater. "These days I know who I 
am, to a point." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez spent the day at Cal State Fullerton, giving two lectures during the day 
and meeting with students informally. He appreciates the chance to meet with 
students, Valdez said in a brief interview after his evening talk. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me the opportunity to discuss pure ideas," he said, "Ideas motivate 
my work." 
</P>
<P>
Now hot in Hollywood after the success of "La Bamba," which told the story of 
singer Richie Valens, Valdez said he is casting for a new feature film that 
will be completed in about a year. He declined to describe the project, other 
than to say it is "about Europe" and a break from the Latino-oriented themes of 
his previous work. He is directing the film but did not write it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Valdez plans to revive the 1979 stage hit "Zoot Suit" for a national 
tour, with a stop next year in Los Angeles, site of its first success. Dates 
and location remain to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
He also remains active with El Teatro Campesino, which this year for the first 
time presented a Passion play at its base in San Juan Bautista, 35 miles 
northeast of Monterey. The play included a procession, was performed in front 
of the Spanish mission there and drew at least 1,000 people for each 
performance, Valdez said during his talk. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez was born in the San Joaquin Valley farming town of Delano in 1940. His 
family became owners of a large ranch in 1941, as did other Latino farm workers 
with the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful ranch," Valdez said, with three houses and several barns. 
"I was a landed Chicano. . . . We had land, but not under our fingernails. Then 
something terrible happened. The United States won the war." 
</P>
<P>
The government, which had supported and encouraged the Latino landowners in the 
early days of the war, abandoned them after the victory. The ranches were lost 
in a collapse of agricultural prices -- "one by one they went out, like 
candles" -- and by 1946 the Valdezes were once again migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rude awakening for young Luis, who had grown up in relative affluence. 
"I said, 'What the hell happened?' " Valdez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, expressing mock distaste, he asked, "You want me to pick this?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poverty, Valdez said, he had one thing he still treasures: the wide 
San Joaquin Valley sky. 
</P>
<P>
"We were poor, but we had the stars," he said, telling how he and his brother 
saved to buy a small telescope. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather, a Yaqui Indian, refused to go to church but would stand each 
evening, hands on hips, and look at the sky. "I didn't know he was revitalizing 
himself," Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
He related early episodes of discrimination: being told to sit in the Mexican 
section of a cinema in Vallejo, the railroad tracks that divided the whites 
from the ethnics in Delano, not being able to play with the "American" kids. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 6, he met Cesar Chavez, 10 years his elder. "He was a pachuco, and 
best friends with my cousin, Billy, who was also a pachuco," Valdez said about 
the juvenile street toughs. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when Chavez organized the grape strikes of the mid-1960s, Valdez 
organized El Teatro Campesino and toured the San Joaquin Valley with his 
troupe, playing for farm workers from the back of a flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's lecture, Valdez often invoked the name of Chavez and Martin 
Luther King Jr. He also quoted such disparate sources as Mao Zedong and Thomas 
Jefferson in a talk that, though entitled "Latinos and the Arts -- Past, 
Present and Future," was more of an inspirational and philosophical discourse 
than a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
His appearance was sponsored by the university's Chicano Resource Center, 
Chicano studies department, Hispanic Faculty and Staff Assn., the theater/dance 
department and the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez, a small, compact man with a deep, booming voice, veered between 
humorous anecdotes (with punch lines often delivered in Spanish) and deeper 
ruminations. He closed with a theatrical flourish, his voice rising 
dramatically as he exhorted his audience to "dream a common dream. 
</P>
<P>
"America is a dream that binds us all together," he told the crowd and finished 
with a simple pun that summarized his message: "What is art? Thou art."

NITZER EBB PRODUCES HARSH, INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH TECHNO-ROCK SOUNDS AT CLUB 
POSTNUCLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British techno-rock bands tend to be a Jekyll and Hyde bunch that can be found 
vacillating between darkly ironic languor and chirpy, pepped-up pop. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach, Nitzer Ebb's version of 
British techno-rock couldn't have been further from that (Depeche) mode. The 
trio with the nonsense name played "industrial" dance music that was bluntly 
emphatic rather than ironic. As for chirpy pop -- well, Nitzer Ebb (the "i" is 
pronounced long, as in 'night') sounded about as chirpy and pop-ish as a drill 
press. 
</P>
<P>
A more appropriate British literary reference here would be H.G. Wells' 
futuristic science-fiction novel "The Time Machine." Its villains are a 
horrific race of industrial gnomes known as the Morlocks, who dwell 
underground, operating sinister machinery and cannibalizing the innocent flower 
children who live in the sunlight. With its clanging, synthesized beats and 
hypnotically repeated chants full of fear and loathing, Nitzer Ebb played 
Morlock rock that frequently suggested totalitarian imagery. 
</P>
<P>
For ears that thrive strictly on melody, the concert might have seemed like an 
hour in hell. Singer Douglas McCarthy ranted fragmentary tirades in a rasping, 
guttural voice. His songwriting partner, percussionist Bon Harris, and guest 
drummer Julian Beeston hammered away on electronic drums to produce crashing, 
metallic beats. Pre-programmed backing tracks added little in the way of melody 
or softening texture. Musical variety consisted of a choice between fast and 
slow, dark and not-quite-so-dark. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this was an interesting show, thanks largely to McCarthy's athletic, 
pumped-up performing style and the punk-influenced fervor of his yowling. With 
short, tousled hair, angular looks and jerk-to-the-beat movements, he resembled 
Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, minus Mothersbaugh's way of sweetening technological 
music with pop hooks. At peak moments, when fast, surging beats took hold and 
had some of the dancers in the audience leaping and bobbing, Nitzer Ebb 
generated a fascinating turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
The music also posed some interesting paradoxes. This was openly mechanized 
sound, with each song locked into the structure and time dictates of the 
assembly line. With McCarthy barking what often sounded like commands against 
this harsh sonic backdrop, Nitzer Ebb evoked a dehumanized, Orwellian world. 
Yet, McCarthy's thrashing, sweaty movements and the desperate energy of his 
howling conveyed a sense of rebellion -- perhaps doomed -- against mechanized 
musical bonds and totalitarian means of social control. 
</P>
<P>
In its most positive song, "Let Your Body Learn," Nitzer Ebb boasted that its 
mechanical sound could offer "freedom from fear, giving release." That's a 
strange claim for music that so often conjured up chilling images. But it was 
music that also kept the audience moving, responding and singing back phrases. 
</P>
<P>
So Nitzer Ebb's industrial hammering did allow a listener some freedom of 
choice: It could paralyze the mind and motivate the body or it could invite 
speculation about the paradox of modern technology, which has the potential 
both to enslave and to liberate. Not a bad evening's work for a band you 
couldn't hum along to.

A SAUCY SYMPHONY NIGHTLY IN FIRST-CLASS KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't spend any time in the kitchen of the Chez Cary restaurant if you think 
you are a whiz with food. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you can fillet a halibut like a samurai, and your entire back yard is 
an herb garden, and you think Hamburger Helper is a German au pair, and you say 
steack hache instead of ground chuck, and your own kitchen was laid out by NASA 
-- still, don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
You will feel incompetent. Guaranteed. You will feel like starting over, 
beginning with the preparation of cornflakes. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you hang around long enough, you will probably lose a pound or two. The 
constant movement and the occasionally searing heat of a traditionally 
organized European-style kitchen can do that. After all, the members of the 
kitchen staff don't spend the evening sampling food. 
</P>
<P>
They spend it chopping, peeling, mincing, dicing, frying, sauteeing, baking, 
grilling, poaching, braising, deglazing and flambeing. And sweating. 
</P>
<P>
Working in a kitchen such as the one at Orange's Chez Cary -- one of the 
county's oldest gastronomic meccas after 23 years in business -- is to occupy a 
place in a regimented operation that is part tradition, part craft, part art 
and part theater. 
</P>
<P>
Each member of the staff occupies a specific niche in the fragrant machinery of 
the kitchen, and all are interlocked through a hierarchy that can be compared, 
with equal truth, to that of an orchestra or an army (in some 19th-Century 
European kitchens, the head chef actually stood on a raised platform in the 
middle of the kitchen to direct operations). 
</P>
<P>
The evening's work, however, does not begin with a bang. The night staff at 
Chez Cary shows up about 4:30 p.m., about 2 hours before any evening diners 
arrive, and methodically begins to piece together everything that can be done 
in advance. Preparation man Rafael Serrano is already methodically chopping up 
a huge pile of parsley on one of two large wooden blocks in the kitchen's 
preparation/pantry area. 
</P>
<P>
The block, used exclusively for chopping vegetables, is well worn -- in fact, 
it has taken so many blows from knife blades that its surface is concave and 
undulating. The surface of the meat-cutting block next to it is even more 
thoroughly worn. 
</P>
<P>
Across the kitchen, in the tunnel-like enclosure containing the broilers, 
grills, ovens and gas burners, night sous chef Albert Lusser and day sous chef 
Chico Abarca (substituting this night for one of the grill chefs) are 
assembling the ingredients for one of the evening's specials, a bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
They are also performing the nightly ritual of whipping up dinners for the 
staff, tonight a coq au vin with a side of noodles. Their motions are quick but 
not hurried as they saute the chicken and pasta in large aluminum saute pans -- 
the same sort of speedy but deliberate movement one might see in a professional 
poker dealer or a sketch artist. 
</P>
<P>
With nothing to occupy his hands for a moment, Lusser absently twirls a pair of 
aluminum tongs around his index finger. 
</P>
<P>
It is Lusser and Abarca, and not head chef Eugene Piquemal, who will do most of 
the cooking. Piquemal, like all head chefs in the European tradition, is an 
overseer. He is responsible for drawing up the menu, buying food and 
coordinating the kitchen's operation. It is the head chef, Piquemal says, who 
determines the personality of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"If the head chef is a loudmouth, everyone else around will be a loudmouth 
too," he says. "If he's low-key, the people around him will follow that too." 
</P>
<P>
Since Piquemal first worked as an apprentice in 1943 in the kitchen of the 
Hotel Barbacanne in the French Pyrenees, he says he has seen enough clamorous 
kitchens and aloof chefs to know that he does not like either. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have discipline," he says. "There are some (head) chefs who are 
always drinking wine. They'll have a gallon in the walk-in 
(refrigerator/freezer). Or they sit in their office and say, 'Don't bother me.' 
But I think you've got to have discipline. My philosophy is to work with my 
people. I work with them and cook with them. Everybody has to do his part." 
</P>
<P>
The parts the staff members play at Chez Cary are not as rigidly defined as 
those of larger, more traditional European restaurants or hotels. For instance, 
the French culinary encyclopedia, "Larousse Gastronomique," lists -- in 
descending rank -- such staff positions as chef de brigade (head chef, assisted 
by a sous chef), saucier (sauce chef), garde-manger (larder chef, sometimes 
assisted by a cold chef), rotisseur (roast chef; may also act as a staff cook), 
entremettier (vegetable chef, sometimes assisted by a soup maker), poissonnier 
(fish chef), patissier (pastry chef, sometimes assisted by an ice cream maker 
and a confectioner), communard (staff cook, sometimes assisted by a keeper) and 
a tournant (relief chef). 
</P>
<P>
Dish and pot washers and vegetable preparers and other prep workers round out 
the traditional kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
At Chez Cary, kitchen staff members sometimes double up on jobs. Piquemal, for 
instance, routinely acts as the pastry chef, and Miguel Garcia, the pantry man, 
often assists as a cook. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, however, Piquemal is a kind of culinary traffic cop, walking 
to the different work sites in the kitchen and checking on progress. 
Occasionally, he steps behind the counter with the cooking chefs to make a 
suggestion or lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the soup is a creation of Piquemal's: cream-of-butter squash. And he 
takes delight in reminding Abarca of Abarca's first taste of the bright yellow 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
"He made this face," Piquemal says, "and I said, 'No, it's not done yet.' I 
added some things and then told him to taste it again, and he said, 'Oh, chef, 
this is delicious.' You have to show them you know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Abarca grins. 
</P>
<P>
Things have just begun to pick up about 6:30 as Lusser strains several gallons 
of shrimp stock from a large steam pot at the end of the ranks of burners, 
stoves and broilers. Abarca enjoys a last cup of coffee before the rush, 
drinking it from a wine glass. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, Lusser and Abarca are moving. The waiters, pushing 
brown Formica-topped trolleys fitted with burners, have begun to return from 
the dining room with orders. The pitch of the kitchen begins to rise slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Abarca quickly but gingerly picks up several rosette-shaped duchesse potatoes 
and plunges them into the deep fryer. He turns, shakes a pair of saute pans 
sizzling brightly on high flames, turns again and begins to butterfly a lobster 
tail. He is deliberate and spare, with no motion wasted. 
</P>
<P>
He and Lusser work in a sort of series of pirouettes, adding spices by hand (no 
measuring), ladling oil into pans, occasionally producing high flames out of 
the pans as they add splashes of brandy. 
</P>
<P>
And, just when the thought occurs that the duchesse potatoes have probably 
shriveled to a cinder, Abarca turns yet again and, almost without looking, 
raises the basket out of the hot oil and rolls the potatoes into a rectangular 
metal pan, perfectly browned. 
</P>
<P>
Does he remember everything that's going on? 
</P>
<P>
"Everything," he says. "Been working at this for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
By 7:15, the kitchen is up to cruising speed, and the heat level in front of 
the burners is approaching the No. 15 sunscreen stage. Abarca disappears 
briefly and returns with a plastic beer mug. He takes a long pull from it and 
places it on the top shelf above his cutting board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's water," he says, pointing to the mug. "This is good because a lot of 
chefs, they use a glass, and if it breaks" -- he spreads out his arms to 
indicate the vessels before him that are filled with chopped vegetables, 
onions, garlic, spices, butter and other condiments -- "you have to throw 
everything out." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the stuff is irreplaceable. Next to the preparation/pantry area is a 
large walk-in refrigerator/freezer, a.k.a. the larder from heaven. Inside is 
stacked just about everything incorporated into the Chez Cary dishes that can 
be prepared in advance, which is a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the blessedly cold, moist (you can see your breath) walk-in are racks of 
fresh asparagus, delicate green beans, peeled potatoes and carrots in cold 
water, ornate lemon garnishes for fish dishes, watermelons, kiwi fruits, 
decoratively sliced cheeses for onion soup gratine, breads, milk, trays of 
piped duchesse potatoes and snails in tiny rings of French bread, frozen cuts 
of beef, veal, fish and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Much of it goes from there directly to the cooks, who store an evening's worth 
of it near the burners in small tureens and dishes, or in refrigerated or 
heated cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
Each chef's domain along the burners (and each other kitchen worker's area) is 
considered inviolate, Piquemal says. Within these kingdoms about 5 feet long, 
each chef works with the same rapid efficiency of a crack Marine assembling a 
rifle blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
"These (areas) are for them and only them," Piquemal says. "They have 
everything the way they want it, and nobody touches it but them." 
</P>
<P>
On Lusser's end, for instance, are arranged containers of flour for dredging, 
butter, olive oil, capers, shallots, chopped green peppers, sliced mushrooms, 
garlic, basil, oregano, mint, beef stock, chicken stock, soups and bottles of 
Marsala wine, sherry and brandy. 
</P>
<P>
There is no painstaking portioning out of these ingredients by the chefs, no 
measuring spoons or cups hanging on pegs. Each item is snatched up quickly, 
cleanly and tossed into the ubiquitous saute pans without ceremony. And, a few 
minutes later, the finished product -- a lobster thermidor, a saltimbocca 
Florentine, a grilled pepper steak, a poitrine de poulet cordon bleu -- is slid 
across the counter for Piquemal's perusal before the waiters whisk it away. 
</P>
<P>
(The chefs do not prepare all the items on the menu, however. The salads are 
mixed and tossed at table by waiters, as are dishes that require flaming and 
instant serving, such as the dessert bananas Foster.) 
</P>
<P>
Such variety and skill, in any fine restaurant, does not come cheaply. Most 
entrees on the Chez Cary dinner menu are $20 to $25. Lunch entrees are in the 
mid-teens. 
</P>
<P>
There are dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can cut, you can burn, you can slip on the floor and break your neck," 
Piquemal says. "That's why we have padding on the floor, and we wear special 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Spills occur regularly, but "that might depend on the moon," he says. A chef is 
likely to be lightly cut or burned "about once a week." 
</P>
<P>
And there are long periods at the beginning of most chefs' careers that are 
lean, monetarily at least. Piquemal says that during his apprenticeship in 
France, he worked without pay. Lusser says his early years at hotel school in 
Innsbruck, Austria, did little to make his wallet bulge. 
</P>
<P>
They do better now. Estimates of a head chef's pay range from $50,000 a year to 
about $100,000. A sous chef can routinely earn $35,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they say, the reward is the opportunity to create dishes of their own, 
sometimes at the request of a diner or, in Piquemal's case, as part of piecing 
together a new menu for a restaurant. In fact, Piquemal spent a part of the 
evening in his spare office off the preparation area, surrounded by shelves 
laden with institutional-sized cans of fruits and vegetables, working on a new 
menu that he says will debut at the restaurant in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
It includes such esoterica as medallions of venison chausseur, roasted and 
stuffed pheasant with truffle sauce and one that got away: brochette 
d'alligator a la bayou -- broiled Cajun alligator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely delicious," says Piquemal, kissing the tips of his fingers in 
a classic chef's gesture of high praise. "But I don't think we'll use it. I 
don't think a lot of people are ready for that one." 
</P>
<P>
There are other perks: tasty on-the-job meals, an occasional trip into the 
dining room to take a bow ("Some chefs like to go out into the dining room and 
impress," says Piquemal, shrugging. "That's really not for me, but if they ask 
me, I go."), and, at Chez Cary, live music. 
</P>
<P>
The hot corner of the kitchen turns into a highly flavored sauna by the time 
Marianne Rotstein and Larry Rousseve show up at about 7:30, dressed in formal 
black and carrying a violin and guitar, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"We always play for them before we go out into the dining room," says Rotstein, 
smiling. She tucks the violin under her chin, and she and Rousseve take a 
request from the prep area: "Besame Mucho." 
</P>
<P>
Abarca and Lusser smile and, for a second or two, stop to listen. Then they dab 
their foreheads and turn back to the burners.

<P>
Countdown . . . Only 28 days until Orange County has its Ripley's Believe It or 
Not of fund raising. Never before in orange blossom land has an organization 
pulled off a coup like the one Angelitos de Oro has pulled off for May 12 and 
13. 
</P>
<P>
On those delicious spring days, two of the world's most adored and hard-to-get 
designers -- Oscar de la Renta and Bob Mackie -- will appear at back-to-back 
fund-raisers at the Amen Wardy boutique in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, before you say, "Sooooooo?" hear this: Wardy, whose haute boutique lives 
on the tongue of every self-respecting fashion wag, had never, ever said yes to 
staging a benefit in his Versailles-esque salon until Maria Crutcher of Big 
Canyon cornered him 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lucky because Amen had just been asked by Elizabeth Taylor to do a show 
for AIDS research, and he just didn't want to do it," Crutcher said recently. 
"So I asked him to do one for us. He stared at the walls, the curtains -- 
everywhere -- and I began to think: 'He isn't even listening to me!' " 
</P>
<P>
And then, according to Crutcher, Wardy jumped out of his chair and said: "OK, 
Maria. I'll do it for you." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Crutcher, a younger-than-springtime 77 and one of Wardy's most loyal 
customers (she's one of a handful of locals who have visited his posh Montecito 
digs), almost fell out of her chair. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the benefit for the support group of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of 
Orange County starred the fashions of the elegant de la Renta. Crutcher was 
chairwoman, and it was a sellout with 600 attending. Champagne was poured in 
the boutique's ballroom. And guests dined on caviar soup and other delicacies 
before they died over a fashion show staged in a voluminous white tent. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bob Mackie appeared. Crutcher chaired again. More than 1,000 
attended, and loads of fashion-plate wannabes had to be turned away. A whopping 
$150,000 was made. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it had to be a back-to-back blockbuster -- 600 at $125 each will 
lunch with de la Renta and 400 at $250 each will dine with Mackie -- for what 
Crutcher says is her swan song. "I'll help next year," she said. "But I won't 
chair the event. I'm getting a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
Ooh la la!: Time to do a fast forward on the Filofax. On July 14, the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum will celebrate Bastille Day at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport 
Beach. The event has been designated as the only official French Bicentennial 
event in Orange County, according to French Deputy Consul General John Rystso. 
</P>
<P>
But wait: Le Meridien has planned something else. On July 16, luxury buses will 
depart from the hotel and zip Francophiles to Hollywood Park, where a French 
food extravaganza will be staged on the infield. Eighty of Los Angeles' French 
restaurants -- including that divine Citrus and that mouthwatering L'Ermitage 
-- will cook up specialties. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the Orange County contingent at the blast will be Bernard 
Jacoupy, the debonair manager of Le Meridien (set to receive a nod tonight from 
the United Cerebral Palsy Assn. of Orange County for helping institute its 
annual Bastille Day 8K Run). 
</P>
<P>
A-table or E-table? Wilhelm Gustaf Magnuson hasn't come up with an A-table 
designation at his new Gustaf Anders restaurant in Santa Ana. But last Friday, 
he was pressed to come up with something close. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Segerstrom, the highly respected matriarch of the prestigious Segerstrom 
family, had swept into the stylish bistro on the arm of her grandson, Anton 
(son of Henry Segerstrom, mastermind of the campaign to bring San Diego's 
premiere restaurant to South Coast Plaza Village). So -- ever the deferential 
host -- Magnuson seated the VIPs next to a window. Better than stashing them in 
a corner by the flapping kitchen door, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. The duo were smack-dab in the middle of their nouvelle continental lunch 
when the 4.6 temblor hit, rattling the gleaming windows and shaking the 
structure so hard that "it felt like it had moved 4 inches," said Anton on 
Monday at the bistro's grand opening party. "Let's, eh, just say we didn't stay 
for dessert." 
</P>
<P>
But things stayed serene for Renee and Henry Segerstrom when they dropped by 
the restaurant last week. In fact, Gustaf Anders' chefs served up lima beans 
along with the salmon the couple ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Lima beans with salmon? "It was sort of a food joke," Magnuson said on Monday. 
"You know, the Segerstroms started out as lima bean farmers here. And they're 
still raising lima beans . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Out of Mission Viejo: Film director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa," "Tootsie") 
will be among the guests Saturday at sprawling Rancho Mission Viejo for "A Day 
in the Country -- A Nature Affair." The hosts will be Forbes 400 developer 
Richard O'Neill and his wife Donna and Santa Margarita Co. President Tony Moiso 
and his wife Melinda. The Pollacks are dear friends of the O'Neills. (Both 
share a grand passion for land.) 
</P>
<P>
The mega bash -- more than 1,000 by-invitation-only guests will attend -- will 
benefit the Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach. The 
highlight of the shebang will be the opportunity for guests to tread upon the 
hallowed ground of the ranch's Amantes camp area, frequent site of the O'Neill 
family's private celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
(Just a few weeks ago, the family's annual spring roundup was held nearby. Five 
thousand head of cattle were branded, and family members and guests whooped it 
up at their own fiesta. Now there's an A-party to climb your way up to.)

SOONER OR LATER, A CHEATER MUST LEARN A HARD LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cheaters never prosper." 
</P>
<P>
Or so the saying goes, but cheating still occurs -- every day and everywhere. 
Hot Topics wonders: "If you saw someone cheating on a test, what would you do? 
Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the teacher about it because cheating is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Canfield, 15, sophomore, Bethel Baptist 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the teacher unless (the cheater) was my friend. If he was my friend, I 
would talk to him about it." 
</P>
<P>
Erick Justiniani, 15, freshman, Bethel Baptist 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't want to learn the material for his own benefit, let him be. It's 
his future, not yours." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Rodriguez, 16, sophomore, Bethel Baptist 
</P>
<P>
"If it was someone I didn't like, I would probably say something; but if I 
liked the person, I would warn him to stop. If he didn't, I might report it." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Bentz, 17, senior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"The attitudes of my peer group would force me to overlook cheating. Anyways, 
cheaters generally lose out in the end -- if not in school, then in the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
John White, 15, sophomore, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"I just wouldn't pay attention to him. If I said something to him about it, he 
would think I'm some kind of teacher's pet." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Kilpatrick, 16, sophomore, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"Probably just ignore it and keep on doing my work because it's none of my 
business what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Aimee Masgai, 17, senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"I get mad when people cheat and get a good grade while I study and get a bad 
grade, but I wouldn't tell on them." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Stoddard, 16, junior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"Give him a dirty look and make sure that nobody copied off me. I wouldn't 
tell, though, because the whole class would hate me." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Petersen, 15, sophomore, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"Just ignore it. I wouldn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Trisha Stephen, 14, freshman, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. It's up to the teacher to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Nakagawa, 17, senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. I don't think (cheating) will help in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Chris DesRochers, 18, senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
"Ignore it because it's none of my business. It's not hurting anyone but 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Lee, 17, senior, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
"Say something to him. If he was cheating the whole time, I would tell the 
teacher. I'd make sure I remained anonymous, though." 
</P>
<P>
Jeanna Arvizu, 14, freshman, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
"After class I would ask the student about it and see if he would admit it. I 
would wait to see if it happened again before I told the teacher about it." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Martinez, 16, junior, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
"Turn him in to the teacher because if I didn't, I would be helping him cheat." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriella Scavelli, 15, sophomore, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
"Probably nothing. I wouldn't want to be a rat. I might mention something to 
the person." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Yang, 15, sophomore, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. Receiving a good education is up to the individual, and if a person 
chooses to cheat, the only person he is cheating is himself." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Bueno, 18, senior, Estancia 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't care. If he was lucky enough to get the answers, then he takes the 
risk of getting caught." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Boren, 18, senior, Estancia 
</P>
<P>
"If I know something will be done, I probably would (tell the teacher)." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Estrick, 17, senior, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
"Probably just tell him to stop or cover my paper because we're a little too 
old to be tattletales." 
</P>
<P>
Evan Itzkowitz, 14, freshman, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
"Go to the teacher and tell him what I just saw. It is immoral and unfair if (a 
cheater) gets a better grade." 
</P>
<P>
Eunice Tark, 16, sophomore, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the teacher to watch the class very carefully for the next test." 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Kim, 16, junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the teacher but not give the name of who was involved." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Trumpler, 18, senior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
"Let him get away with it because someday he'll get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Henderson, 17, junior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
"Look the other way because it is his choice to cheat and his business." 
</P>
<P>
Susanne Ban, 17, senior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
"I would see if he is copying off someone smarter than me; if so, I'd copy off 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Squires, 17, junior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
"Ignore it because it's none of my business, but if the teacher was watching, 
I'd probably tell." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Collella, 14, freshman, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
"I've been caught before. A friend of mine was cheating off me and we got 
caught. I'd probably just tell him to cut it out." 
</P>
<P>
Juli Kriger, 17, senior, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
"It would depend on the situation. If it is a test, such as the SAT, in which 
I'm competing against the person who is cheating, then I would probably report 
the situation to the proctor." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Graham, 16, junior, Pacifica 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a minor test, I'd forget it. However, if it was a major test and the 
person had been cheating often, then I would let the teacher know because then 
it would be apparent that the person plans on making cheating a habit, isn't 
studying and therefore deserves the bad grade." 
</P>
<P>
Tonia Wong, 17, senior, Pacifica 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't tell, because I don't want to get involved in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Masui, 15, sophomore, Pacifica 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do anything. I'd just sit back and shut up." 
</P>
<P>
Kirstin Aplin, 18, senior, Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
"Make sure that he had the wrong answers because he didn't take time to study." 
</P>
<P>
Christina Bass, 15, freshman, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
"Ignore it because it wouldn't have done any harm." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Murphy, 16, junior, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do anything when I see it. What's the use? What can you do? Everyone 
does it." 
</P>
<P>
Barbra Caliendo, 17, senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"It's his problem and he suffers the consequences. It will catch up with him 
later." 
</P>
<P>
Erin O'Donnell, 17, senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"See who it is, and if I didn't like him, I'd tell on him."

good grades by cheating."

SPECIAL COURAGE;

<P>
STUDENTS WITH HANDICAPS GAIN FRESH PERSPECTIVES ON BEHAVIOR THAT GO BEYOND 
TEASING, NAME-CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ, Lorenza Munoz is a senior at Capistrano Valley High School, 
where she is the editorial editor of the school newspaper, Paw Prints, and a 
member of the varsity swimming team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are considered "special" kids. Many have endured cruel teasing and 
ostracism from their classmates. For these handicapped children, life has been 
a difficult experience of dealing with wide-ranging emotions. Their experiences 
have given them and their families a special outlook on life and a sense of 
perspective that many lack. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School has an active special education program, with 
about 75 students. Their handicaps range from mild learning disabilities to 
severe ones. 
</P>
<P>
For juniors Lara Hill and Ed Lind, the difficulties of dealing with their 
handicaps are part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
She rides the halls of Capistrano Valley High in a wheelchair. But the 
wheelchair has not been with her all of her life. Lara Hill came home one day 4 
years ago with a numbness in her left cheek and an inability to control her 
left foot. The next morning, she fell into a coma, and her mother rushed her to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a healthy, athletic 12-year-old was diagnosed as having had a 
cerebral hemorrhage. She could no longer respond or react to stimuli. 
</P>
<P>
"It just hits you like a ton of bricks," said Hill's stepfather, Stephen 
Thatcher. "Everything else in the world just becomes very unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Hill, Lara's mother, said she felt many emotions upon hearing the 
diagnosis: "Fear, pain, sadness and frustration mostly. You name an emotion and 
they (were) all there. It's always frustrating when things don't go the way you 
hoped or intended." 
</P>
<P>
Lara remained in a coma for 6 weeks. Doctors told Thatcher and his wife that 
Lara was probably not going to survive, but survive she did. When she came out 
of the coma, she was brought home. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, she began to react to her surroundings. "I was washing her mouth out, 
and she wasn't swallowing," Thatcher said. "In my frustration, as I walked out 
of the room I squirted water at her mother with the syringe, and Lara laughed! 
Slapstick made her laugh! 
</P>
<P>
"I said if that worked, we could try some other things." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Thatcher, Hill and Curt, Lara's brother, began throwing pies at each 
other. Lara apparently understood their intentions before any throwing actually 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"She started laughing before (Curt) was hit with the pie," Thatcher said. "That 
meant that the thinking part of her brain wasn't damaged. She was back with us 
intellectually." 
</P>
<P>
The coma and the damage to her brain did affect her motor nerves, however. That 
is why she rides in a wheelchair and can walk only with difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"Being handicapped and in a wheelchair might not be as fun as it looks," Lara 
said. "Sure, the seat's comfortable, and it's fun having the right of way in 
the halls, but it's tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do people think it's fun? I don't think so. The problem that people fail 
to realize is that you're in the chair all of the time, and it's always there, 
no matter where you go." 
</P>
<P>
Before her illness, Lara was an exceptional athlete and constantly active. 
Realizing that she will probably never kick a soccer ball or run track again 
has been one of the hardest realities for her.

"It's tough for her, she was such a great athlete," Thatcher said. "She had a 
tremendous gift. She doesn't often say much about it, but I know it really 
bothers her." 
</P>
<P>
Lara said her way of dealing with her inability to play is "not really watching 
(soccer games). That's how I solve it." 
</P>
<P>
She was also a straight-A student. But after her hemorrhage, her grades dropped 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Her inability to write quickly holds her back," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lara is now up to a B average and is enrolled in just one special education 
class -- a study hall type of class that allows her time for homework. 
</P>
<P>
"Lara's got a great sense of humor that has bridged the whole gap of her 
handicap," said Karen Peterson, Lara's special education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very assertive. She's a tough kid and will definitely do well and be 
successful in whatever she wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
After her return home, Lara was enrolled for 3 months at the private Richard 
Henry Dana School for Children With Exceptional Needs. She re-entered public 
school by finishing up at Niguel Hills Junior High School, then enrolled at 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lara said: "I felt like, 'Wow, here I am!' Also, I was a little scared." 
</P>
<P>
Attending such a large school has both advantages and disadvantages. "Capo has 
been a good place" overall, Lara's mother said. "Sometimes it's difficult 
because of the size, and that can be very intimidating if you're sitting. She 
hasn't gotten involved with other activities. The social life passes her by." 
</P>
<P>
Lara admitted to feeling alone at times in school but said it does not affect 
her too much. "At lunch, I go into the library," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she is far from being without friends. One of them, junior Lisa Senkbeil, 
said: "She's just like (any other) person, but she just has a physical 
disadvantage. I think (handicapped kids) should be involved with things kids 
their own ages are doing. They should not be isolated." 
</P>
<P>
For her future, Lara, who has just started to take equestrian lessons, remains 
optimistic. She hopes to become a child psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"I love children," she said. "I want to go to UC Irvine, but I don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
The thought of being out on her own frightens her, but at the same time she 
looks forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my parents a lot, but I think they can cope without me," she said. "I'd 
like to live away. It's a little bit scary because I can't really take care of 
myself. My parents say I'm self-sufficient, so I guess I am. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
As students walk the Capistrano Valley hallways, many stop to greet Ed Lind. 
</P>
<P>
"Making friends is easy," said Ed, 17, who was diagnosed at age 2 as having a 
severe learning handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"(The doctors) don't know exactly how it happened," said his mother, Donna 
Downs, who gave birth to a mentally gifted daughter 7 years before Ed's birth. 
</P>
<P>
"I explained to my daughter that God (had given) him to us because he could 
have given him to another person" who would not love or accept him, Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed has a great insight into people. He's very sensitive and caring. He has 
taught me a lot about people and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Downs said the most difficult part of her son's handicap has been other people. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing was dealing with other people's reactions," she said. "He 
didn't have anybody to play with. That's when the anger came in. The kids would 
call him mentally retarded, among other names." 
</P>
<P>
It was a harsh lesson in cruelty, which Ed learned at an early age. "Sometimes 
kids make fun of me, and I get upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I try my best and ignore them. But when I get upset, I want to 
fight. But it isn't the right thing to do. I have a hard time when people call 
me names." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Degeer, Ed's teacher at Capistrano Valley, said: "Ed is easygoing. He's 
been picked on forever, and he's developed some strategies to turn the other 
cheek. But after a while, these (special education) kids get numb to 
(teasing)." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Ed's patience and understanding comes from his faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good relationship with God," he said. "If it wasn't for God, I 
wouldn't be going to school. I don't know where I'd be. I've had some hard 
challenges in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Ed, who had a very limited vocabulary as a child, began his education at age 4 
at a school for children who do not speak. 
</P>
<P>
At Capistrano Valley, he is not mainstreamed into regular classrooms but 
remains in special education classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed couldn't even say the alphabet when he first came in 1 year ago," Degeer 
said. "Now he talks in complete sentences." 
</P>
<P>
He is learning many new skills and is making progress but still can't read or 
write. 
</P>
<P>
"There's big long words that I have a hard time sounding out," Ed said. "I'm 
learning how to write my name in cursive. This is the first time I've learned 
how to cursive-write, and I like it. It's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Ed, who enjoys bowling and listening to music, hopes to move out of his house 
after he graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to face the real world by myself, try to stay out of trouble and do the 
right things," he said, adding that he would like to work as an automobile or 
motorcycle mechanic or in a fast-foods place. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, however, is less optimistic: "The future looks scary. It's not a 
matter of just moving out. It has to deal with balancing checkbooks. . . . How 
is the world going to treat him? He won't have Mom and Dad to help him deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Both Lara and Ed have accepted their limits and have learned to live with them 
through trial and error. They have found inner strength and have received 
support from family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Neither holds grudges nor feels bitterness. "I am a happy kid," Ed said. "I'm 
not angry, not mad." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not upset about it anymore," Lara said. "It happened to me. I can't change 
that. I'm sad about it, but I'm not mad at anybody. Nobody can change what 
happened to me."

STYLE: DISCOVERING THE PERFECT SEASON -- AND THE COLORS -- OF YOUR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once color analyst Pat Jensen drapes you in a rainbow of colors, dusts pastel 
hues on your eyelids and pairs you with a season, you may never see yourself 
the same way again. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen is one of a number of Orange County color analysts who provide 
one-on-one consultations with men and women to determine their most flattering 
colors. The sessions -- based on the much-publicized four-seasons color theory 
pioneered by Gerrie Pinckney, owner of the Fashion Academy in Costa Mesa -- are 
held in Jensen's Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
Intended as a guide to choosing attractive clothing and makeup, the analysis 
first determines a client's season of color based on skin tone. Once the season 
is determined, the client gets a color palette that shows a range of flattering 
shades for clothes and accessories. The analysis lasts 2 hours and costs $45. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen, a tall "winter" brunette with a perky personality, has been a color 
analyst since 1975. She points out that colors can help or hurt. For example, 
if you are a "winter" and wear brown, you get a Halloween effect. If you are a 
"spring with peachy keen skin" and wear rose blush, you get a clown effect. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a "spring," Jensen will drape aqua and royal-blue chiffon scarfs 
around your neck to illustrate how these colors enhance your skin tones. If you 
are a "winter," she will layer you with reds, deep greens and black. "Autumns" 
glow in oranges and brown, and "summers" shine in blues and pinks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some universal colors -- periwinkle and turquoise blue -- can be worn by 
anybody," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing the right colors is also a matter of psychology, she said, explaining: 
"Blondes and strawberry blondes are more approachable and friendly looking. 
People perceive them as less intimidating, but sometimes they don't get the 
respect they deserve. Colors can help with this. What we have to do is tailor 
their wardrobes to the individual's color, stature and personality." 
</P>
<P>
Once the colors are determined, it's time to go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said wardrobes should consist of seasonal neutrals (camel for "springs," 
black for "winters") and several seasonal accent colors, such as pale blue for 
"summers" and orange for "autumns." The colors identified with each season not 
only harmonize with the individual's skin and eyes, they blend with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that the seasons don't mix. Black (a winter color) and 
tan (a spring color) together is a schizophrenic look. It's Halloween, like 
orange and black. You don't work a wardrobe around Halloween colors. It's 
unworkable and you're spending too much money when you have a schizophrenic 
closet." 
</P>
<P>
Pinckney said she developed the four-seasons theory in the 1960s when she began 
studying how color affects a person's appearance and wardrobe planning. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after she devised the seasonal concept, Pinckney began offering classes 
in wardrobe planning, color theory and makeup. The Fashion Academy, which 
Pinckney opened in 1972, offers private consultations (at $45 for a 2-hour 
color analysis) as well as a 9-week, $2,300 training course and exam through 
which color consultants can obtain a post-secondary certificate from the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Pinckney trained Carole Jackson, who in 1981 wrote the book "Color Me 
Beautiful." Now accredited by the state, the academy has certified more than 40 
color analysts in the county and more than 1,000 worldwide, Pinckney said. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen, who has her certificate, said her typical customers are women who want 
to know what colors they should use in their wardrobes. But she has also had 
"lawyers bring in scruffy clients who need to look like they didn't do it and 
lobbyists from Sacramento who have to look honest." 
</P>
<P>
The seasonal approach has some detractors. Carlton Wagner, director of the 
Wagner Institute for Color Research in Santa Barbara, said that the color 
theories promoted by analysts are "useful things to know, but they don't go far 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are talking about what they find aesthetically pleasing to them, 
not how others will respond to the colors," said Wagner, who forecasts the 
hottest product colors for major corporations. "Analysts might suggest wearing 
blue-based colors, which appeal more to women than men, who prefer yellow-based 
colors. You should wear the colors that will please who you're trying to 
please." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said he used to go to color analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept telling me to wear forest green. I said, 'I will, as soon as I 
change my name to Robin Hood.' You see, you have to take into account where you 
are wearing these colors. In theory it works, but for practical matters it 
doesn't always make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Some people do take the color theory too far, said Jensen, who was wearing a 
navy-blue suit with a ruffled powder-blue blouse. Some "summers" won't be 
caught dead in anything yellow; some "winters" won't wear brown even in a pair 
of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a bible -- they are just guidelines," she said. "Don't try to 
match colors perfectly with your color palette -- just learn the basics of 
color theory. Usually if (a client) knows how to work her colors, she looks 
younger and doesn't spend as much money on unworkable clothes."

FAA, PRIVATE PILOT BLAMED IN CERRITOS CRASH FATAL TO 82; 
</P>
<P>
AEROMEXICO ABSOLVED OF ANY FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury today found the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
pilot of a small plane equally responsible for the 1986 collision of an 
Aeromexico airliner and the small plane that killed 82 people. 
</P>
<P>
The jury absolved Aeromexico from any blame for the collision over Cerritos. 
The panel found negligence by the FAA and private pilot William Kramer and said 
they were responsible for the crash in equal measure. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's task was to determine responsibility. The verdict is binding on 
Kramer's estate, but its findings on Aeromexico and the FAA are advisory to 
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who was to make his decision on their 
portion of responsibility later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Damages will be decided at later trials or by settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Franklin Silane, representing Aeromexico, said he felt that the case 
was not an indictment of air traffic safety in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"'Overall, the traffic is safe in Los Angeles and the traffic controllers are 
good at the job. A mistake was made on that day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Planes Plunged 
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred in clear skies Aug. 31, 1986, as the Aeromexico DC-9, 
with 64 people aboard, was approaching Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer, with his wife and a daughter as passengers, was flying a single-engine 
Piper that hit the jet's tail and sent both aircraft plunging into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
All aboard both planes and 15 people on the ground in suburban Cerritos were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
FAA air traffic controller Walter White, who was guiding the DC-9 to the 
airport, maintained that the Piper did not appear on his radar screen. However, 
data tapes from the radar system did record the Piper's flight. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial expert witnesses testified that Kramer's plane was visible on 
the radar screen during 62 of 64 radar sweeps in the final minutes before the 
11:52 a.m. collision in controlled airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Medical evidence was presented that suggested Kramer was disabled by a heart 
attack before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controllers 'Too Casual' 
</P>
<P>
Some of the jurors, interviewed later, said they believed that Kramer violated 
the airport's restricted airspace, which is called the Terminal Control Area, 
when he wandered into it and that air traffic controllers failed to halt 
traffic when they realized what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
One of the jurors, Valorie Mitzel of Anaheim, said she felt that air traffic 
controllers were "too casual" about their responsibilities and also faulted 
supervisors for failing to investigate properly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
She said she felt the radar scope on which the controller said he never saw the 
small plane should have been deactivated immediately and checked, which she 
said was not done. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disturbed by what happened after," she said. "If a man says 
something wasn't on the scope, why isn't it checked? Generally they were too 
casual." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors said they rejected the claim that Kramer may have suffered a heart 
attack. They said there was insufficient evidence to prove this to them. 
</P>
<P>
Mitzel said she believed the Aeromexico pilot and co-pilot were acting properly 
and probably did not see the small plane.

U. S. TAKES OVER LINCOLN S &amp; L; 
</P>
<P>
SEIZURE FOLLOWS BANKRUPTCY FILING BY PARENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just one day after its parent company filed for bankruptcy, federal regulators 
seized Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today because it had 
"dissipated its assets through violations of regulations and laws." 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's management, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said, "appeared to 
operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit of (its parent company, American 
Continental Corp.) at the expense of (Lincoln)." 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's 29 Southern California offices remained open, and depositors can 
transact business as usual. Deposits up to $100,000 are insured by the Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Lincoln has total deposits of $4.4 billion 
in 176,323 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
An oversight team led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began operating 
the $5.5-billion thrift at 7 a.m. today to "minimize losses, limit growth and 
ensure that operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner." 
</P>
<P>
Investors who own about $200 million worth of bonds may, however, lose some or 
all of their money as a result of American Continental's filing Thursday for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold the bonds to customers in Lincoln's branches. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which represents about 85% of American's assets, 
was not included in Thursday's bankruptcy filing. But federal regulators said 
the filing did include substantial assets in subsidiary operations of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
American Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. said he filed for bankruptcy after 
federal regulators demanded he relinquish control of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental has tried to sell Lincoln three times since last year. 
Federal regulators opposed the latest plan to sell Lincoln for $200 million to 
a group of investors led by John H. Rousselot, a former congressman from 
Arcadia, because the offer did not include sufficient cash. 
</P>
<P>
Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman earlier this week, resigned today, 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board named F. Roger Clark to serve as Lincoln's chief executive. 
Clark ran Montfort Savings in Dallas after it was seized by regulators.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY BUSINESSMAN SENTENCED TO 79 YEARS FOR RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Fountain Valley businessman today was sentenced to 79 years in prison for 
raping three women and attacking two others -- one of the harshest prison 
sentences ever handed down in a sexual assault case in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Panichas, 32, who told jurors at his trial that he was just "a 
good-looking guy" to whom women were easily attracted, steadfastly denied all 
the charges in interviews from the Orange County Jail following his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But in court today, Panichas told Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner that 
while he had thought each woman had consented, "I may have misread their 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
But Brickner told Panichas that he was a man "with delusions of grandeur" who 
thought he could talk his way out of any situation. 
</P>
<P>
"One only shudders to think how many others (victims)) are out there," the 
judge told him. 
</P>
<P>
Panichas was sentenced on 19 counts of rape and sexual assault in incidents 
from 1985 to 1986. He had been investigated, but never arrested, after four of 
the incidents had been reported. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marv Stern said that each 
time it had been difficult to make a case against Panichas. 
</P>
<P>
But he was finally arrested after a Las Vegas woman claimed he raped her when 
he interviewed her for a job with his cellular telephone business.

<TEXT>
<P>
A winery worker known for his hot temper killed his wife, four other people and 
wounded another in three separate shooting attacks in the California wine 
country today, then fled with his three young daughters, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The rampage began about 8:20 a.m. in the usually bucolic wine country about 50 
miles north of San Francisco, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was tentatively identified as Grand Cru Winery worker Ramon Salcido, 
28. He was the subject of a statewide all-points bulletin and a widespread 
search. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities on the ground and in helicopters were combing the area for a 
burgundy Ford sedan in which Salcido was believed to have fled with his three 
children, ages 1, 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido first went to the ranch of a prominent local man, Bob Kunde, and 
wounded ranch worker Kenneth Butti in the right shoulder, Sheriff Richard 
Michaelson said. Butti, 33, was in fair condition at Santa Rosa Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then went to the winery and shot a male co-worker to death before 
fleeing in his battered sedan, Michaelson said. The body was found in another 
car near the winery. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then went to his home in nearby Boyes Hot Springs, Michaelson said. 
The body of a woman, presumably his wife, was found there, and Salcido's three 
children were were reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
Later, authorities found three bodies at the home of Salcido's father-in-law, 
Robert L. Richards, in Cotati, about five miles west of here, said Lt. Gary 
Zanolini. Richards was not home at the time and was uninjured.

NORTH'S COMPLAINTS ON MONEY STOPPED SUDDENLY, JURY TOLD

Oliver L. North was so pinched for money that he complained about not having 
enough to buy lunch and gasoline, but his complaints suddenly stopped in 
mid-1985, a former National Security Council official testified today. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution is seeking to portray North as a career military officer who 
became money-hungry while working at the NSC, where he controlled a cash fund 
in his office safe that was intended to provide covert aid to the Contra rebels 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dix, who was the NSC's director of administration, told the jury in 
North's trial that the Marine lieutenant colonel complained on five occasions 
through mid-1985 that he was strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Would Need Cash' 
</P>
<P>
On a few occasions in the hallway as she was going home, North would run after 
her "yelling 'Mary, Mary,' " she recalled. She said that "he would need cash to 
go home," complaining that he didn't have enough to buy gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
In other instances, "Colonel North would get very upset" if the petty cash box 
for paying cab fare was empty, Dix said. 
</P>
<P>
When North was not reimbursed rapidly enough for office expenses, "he would be 
pretty frantic" in trying to get NSC staffers to process his expense accounts, 
"to turn them around as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"He said his credit cards were charged to the limit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On a few other occasions while she was in her office, "he would run by. . . . 
His face was red. . . . He was very upset with my staff" for not being 
reimbursed fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I would herd him from my area," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
North said at one point that there was "not enough for cash to go home" and 
"not enough for lunch money," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped in Mid-1985 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor David Zornow asked if North's complaining stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It stopped to the best of my recollection in mid-1985," Dix replied. 
</P>
<P>
North testified Monday that the $3,000 balance on a used GMC Suburban vehicle 
he bought in October, 1985, was paid from money he kept in a metal box in a 
closet at his home. 
</P>
<P>
But the salesman who sold the vehicle, William Howell, testified today that 
North said he was going to get the money from the White House credit union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegal Gratuity 
</P>
<P>
From February to May of 1985, Richard V. Secord, who had been enlisted by North 
to run weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, arranged four private sales of arms 
for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
North is accused of accepting an illegal gratuity from Secord -- a $13,800 home 
security system -- and converting to his own use $4,300 in travelers checks 
from Contra leader Adolfo Calero. The checks were run through a cash fund North 
kept in his office safe. 
</P>
<P>
About $90,000 to $100,000 from Calero was funneled through the office safe, as 
well as $150,000 to $200,000 in cash from Secord. North said he destroyed the 
ledger detailing how the money was spent on orders from CIA Director William J. 
Casey.

Palestinians protesting the deaths of five Arabs in a police raid clashed today 
with soldiers in the West Bank, and more than 17 people -- including a 
3-year-old girl -- were wounded by gunfire, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 11 refugee camps, towns or villages in the West Bank and occupied Gaza 
Strip had demonstrations or were shut down by general strikes called to protest 
the killings Thursday in the village of Nahalin near Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Confrontation 
</P>
<P>
The worst confrontation was in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus. Arab doctors 
said 12 Palestinians there were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 3-year-old girl, who was shot in the left side, the victims 
included an 18-year-old youth in critical condition with a bullet in the chest, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, police took unprecedented measures to prevent violence at the Al 
Aqsa Mosque during today's Muslim prayers. A riot occurred there during last 
week's prayers, and at least 2,000 extra police were called in today to prevent 
similar violence. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque is on the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as Haram Sharif, or Noble 
Enclosure. The elevated platform also houses the Dome of the Rock mosque and is 
lined on one side by the Western Wall, the last remnant of the second Jewish 
Temple. The site is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported only about 7,000 Muslims attended prayers at Al Aqsa, far fewer 
than the 30,000 predicted. Apparently many were kept away by curfews on refugee 
camps and roadblocks outside Jerusalem.

Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot to $62 million today -- a 
national record -- as gamblers and dreamers from as far away as Europe clamored 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
The geographical range is "something we've never seen before," Illinois Lottery 
Director Sharon Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed Lotto booths, 
where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just about double the average. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets near Illinois' 
borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as residents from those states 
flocked to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana just bought 
$3,200 worth," sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant in Danville. 
</P>
<P>
The previous top Lotto record was $61.98 million, set last October in 
California.

Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have privately raised 
doubts with the Bush Administration about the nomination of Donald Gregg to be 
ambassador to South Korea because of his possible role in the Iran-Contra 
affair, congressional sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has reiterated his support for 
Gregg's nomination to the high-profile diplomatic appointment by President 
Bush, Gregg's former boss. When Bush was vice president, Gregg was his national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg's nomination, which will be debated by the Senate committee next month, 
is one of several that have run into opposition in the light of disclosures 
about the Iran-Contra affair that have surfaced in the trial of former White 
House aide Oliver L. North.

FACTORY OPERATING RATE DIPS 0.2% 2ND MONTH, COOLS INFLATION FEARS

<P>
The operating rate for U.S. factories declined for the second consecutive month 
in March to 84%, the first back-to-back drop in nearly three years and a clear 
sign that the economy is cooling, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board said the March operating rate was 0.2 percentage 
points lower than February's 84.2% level and 0.4 of a percentage point below 
the January level of 84.4%, which was the highest in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
February and March represented the first consecutive declines since 
August-September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear they will have 
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report is likely to ease somewhat economists' worries that a 
substantial pickup in inflation is ahead. Analysts generally consider an 
operating rate of 85% to indicate inflationary pressures.

Business inventories rose 0.5% in February while sales plunged 0.9% in their 
steepest decline in more than two years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed 
to a seasonally adjusted $763.6 billion in February following a 0.8% increase 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
Business sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $507.3 billion in 
February after rising 1.1% during the previous month. February's decline was 
the first dip since sales fell 0.2% in November, 1987, the month after the 
stock market crash, and marked the steepest drop since a 3% decline in January, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
If increases in inventories are not accompanied by rising sales, analysts worry 
that the result could be production cutbacks that hold down economic growth.

WHOLESALE PRICES INCREASED A MODEST 0.4% LAST MONTH;

INCREASE MODEST IN SPITE OF JUMP IN HOME HEATING OIL COSTS; INFLATION FEARS

<P>
Wholesale prices, despite a big jump in home heating oil costs, rose a moderate 
0.4% in March as inflation eased somewhat after two months of steep 1% 
increases, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The boost in the Labor Department's producer price index reflected higher costs 
for both food and energy, although the increases in both categories were 
smaller than those registered in the first two months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The overall gain was close to analysts' expectations and helped calm Wall 
Street's inflation fears, causing a sharp rally in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
While March's increase was much more restrained than the strong jumps of the 
previous two months, wholesale prices one stop short of retail have risen at a 
compound annual rate of 10.2% over the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Since 1981 
</P>
<P>
That is the largest quarterly increase since prices rose at a compound annual 
rate of 13.2% during the first three months of 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Should the first quarter's rate be sustained for the rest of the year, it would 
far exceed the increase registered for 1988, when wholesale prices rose 4% in 
what was the steepest gain in seven years. Prices had risen 2.2% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets had been fearful that further bad news on the inflation front 
would prompt the Federal Reserve Board to step up its campaign to slow economic 
growth and restrain inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors, 
said the latest report was good news but doesn't totally put to rest worries 
about accelerating inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Not Over 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think at all that this suggests that the inflation watch should be 
terminated," he said. "I don't think this battle is over." 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale food prices rose 0.8% last month after jumping 1.2% during February. 
Last month's increase in food costs was led by a 38.8% gain in prices for eggs 
while vegetable costs dropped 11.6% after surging 35.3% during February. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9% in March after a 2.4% increase during the 
previous month. Last month's increase was led by a 16.8% rise in home heating 
oil prices, while gasoline costs rose 3.5% and natural gas prices declined 
5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.3% in March, 
down from a 0.6% increase a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the moderate price hikes last month for finished goods such as bread 
and clothing, the index for prices at earlier stages of production demonstrated 
stronger inflation.

MILKEN POSTS $1 MILLION, SETS ASIDE $600 MILLION

<P>
Michael Milken agreed today to set aside more than $600 million in assets and 
post a $1-million bond in connection with wide-ranging racketeering and fraud 
charges against the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier. 
</P>
<P>
Saying Milken was not a threat to flee the country before an expected trial, 
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood denied the government's request that Milken 
post $250 million in bail money. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Milken's brother, Lowell, who also faces fraud and racketeering 
charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets under racketeering statutes 
and was ordered to post a $1-million bond secured by other assets. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means the Milkens -- who left the courthouse to applause from about 
100 supporters -- will be free pending a trial prosecutors say is expected to 
last more than six months and should mark a high point in the government's 
nearly three-year crackdown on Wall Street fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg were charged in a 
98-count racketeering and fraud indictment handed up March 29 that seeks about 
$1.8 billion in forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, the 
government could have sought to freeze all of the defendants' assets before a 
trial as a guarantee they would not sell or otherwise dispose of them to avoid 
massive penalties if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced at a Manhattan federal court hearing requires Michael 
Milken to place $300 million cash in an account to be monitored by the 
government and to sign a note securing $300 million more in less liquid assets. 
</P>
<P>
Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings in Drexel -- 
which total 6% of the investment firm and are estimated at about $100 million 
-- as soon as the firm's settlement of separate civil charges with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission officially takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
That deal, announced Thursday, resolves a range of separate civil charges 
against Drexel and requires the Wall Street giant to dismiss Milken, sever all 
business dealings with him and force him to give up his Drexel holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"In substance, your honor, we expect the security for forfeiture in this case 
will amount to $700 million," Assistant U.S. Atty. John K. Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by a group of defense lawyers, Milken and his brother attended the 
hearing but did not address the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendants not only contest the indictment but they seriously, expressly 
contest the government's theories on forfeiture," said Arthur L. Liman, Michael 
Milken's attorney.

Wall Street blue chips soared more than 40 points today as investors poured 
money into the market after the release of better-than-expected inflation 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.06 points to 2,337.06 for its 
best single-day showing since it rose 43.92 points last Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The average wound up the week with a net gain of 32.26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,072 up, 393 down and 468 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 169.78 million shares, against 141.59 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.35 to 168.89. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department report that the producer price index of finished goods 
rose 0.4% in March, compared with 1% increases in each of the two preceding 
months, was close to advance estimates. Nevertheless, analysts said, investors 
were relieved that the report did not contain another unpleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, International Business Machines reported first-quarter earnings of 
$1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing, in light of 
IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this year probably would not 
live up to some of the most optimistic estimates in the financial world. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rebounded sharply in heavy trading today after the government 
reports suggesting an easing of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue jumped 1 3/16 point, or about $12 for 
every $1,000 in face amount, as its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell 
to 9.03% from 9.15% late Thursday.

The Soviets haven't lost to the United States since the 1980 Winter Olympics, 
the "Miracle on Ice" in Lake Placid, N.Y. In the last three Worlds, they have 
outscored the U.S. by a combined 37-7 score in four games. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, who lost the last world championship to Sweden two years ago in 
Vienna, have yet another advantage going into the opener against Team USA. 
Except for rebel defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov, who was recalled to the team 
late last month after being axed after an argument with national Coach Viktor 
Tikhonov earlier in the season, the Soviets have been together all season long. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing a U.S. team that wasn't formed until a week ago. In its only 
exhibition before the championships, the U.S. team was beaten 9-3 Wednesday by 
Finland.

More than a month after closing down because of unsafe track conditions, 
Pimlico Race Course has reopened with a reconditioned racing surface that track 
officials hope will be better suited to the variable weather conditions of 
spring racing dates. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was great. . . . There was a lot of bounce to it, very lively," said 
jockey Greg Hutton, who rode Keep A Count to a wire-to-wire victory in 
Thursday's first race, the first over Pimlico's renovated racing surface. 
</P>
<P>
Pimlico, which is home to the Preakness, the middle jewel of horse racing's 
Triple Crown, was shut down March 10 when jockeys refused to ride after the 
seventh race. There were three spills in the seven races.

KRISTIANSEN AIMING AT 2:20 MARATHON BARRIER

Breaking the 2-hour, 20-minute barrier in the marathon has been an obsession 
with the top women's runners since 1983 when Joan Benoit Samuelson became the 
first to go under 2:25. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, the goal is still there, and Monday in the 93rd Boston 
Marathon Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen may finally crack it. 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen has been trumpeting her intent for the past four years, after 
setting the women's world best of 2:21:06 in the 1985 London Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
But she has fallen short each time. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she appears in the best condition of her career and ready for an all-out 
assault on a sub-2:20 race. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm fit. But, I'm not thinking about 2:20 this time," she said. "This 
time, I have come to Boston trying to win the race. I will try to run as fast 
as possible and hope it will be my best time. 
</P>
<P>
"If the weather conditions are nice on Monday, I will try. It is not enough for 
me to beat Joan Benoit. I want to go for 2:20 and the world record. I wouldn't 
be surprised if I did 2:20 Monday. It's a mental barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen's recent performances indicate that she might easily crash through 
the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, she smashed the course record in winning the 10-kilometer 
(6.2-mile) Boston Milk Run in 30:58. And last month, she set the women's world 
best in winning the New Bedford Half-Marathon (13.1 miles) in 1:08:32. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people are saying we can't do it because it's too fast for women," 
Kristiansen said about a sub-2:20 marathon. "But people also said that about 
2:30 and 2:25. 
</P>
<P>
"So it would be very significant if I broke it." 
</P>
<P>
The significance of a sub-2:20 marathon would be similar to Roger Bannister 
breaking the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954. It would also continue to close 
the gap between men and women marathoners. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, there was more than a 54-minute difference between the best men's and 
women's marathoners (2:08:34 to 3:02:53). By 1980, the gap had diminished to 
just over 17 minutes (2:08:34 to 2:25:41). 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is less than 15 minutes (2:06:50 to 2:21:06).

AMATEUR STATUS OF PIRATES' KEY PLAYER QUESTIONED

Andrew Gaze, who in a six-month stay at Seton Hall helped the university to the 
NCAA basketball final, had $25,000 placed in a family fund by his club team in 
Australia, the New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Bruce Ward, general manager of the Melbourne Tigers, as 
saying that the money was put into a trust fund over a period of six months in 
1988, when the team became professional. 
</P>
<P>
He said it had come from a fund of $362,000 established by sponsors for the 
Tigers, who are coached by Gaze's father, Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an official of the NCAA as saying the payments raised 
questions about whether the rules on amateur status were violated. However, the 
organization has not started a formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Funds 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall Coach P. J. Carlesimo said he was unaware of the money going into 
the fund and Gaze himself said the money was "more like expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Gaze, 23, enrolled at Seton Hall last October and averaged 13.6 points per game 
for the Pirates on their run to the title game, which they lost 80-79 in 
overtime to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
His three-point shooting plus his maturity and experience -- he had played for 
the Australian team in the last two Olympics -- was cited as a key factor in 
keeping the Pirates together and he was the MVP of the West regional. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Gaze left and returned to Melbourne, where he signed a contract 
for $50,000 with the Tigers, whom he first joined as a junior 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gaze said of the fund: "It was more like a scholarship, helping out with my 
expenses more than anything else."
