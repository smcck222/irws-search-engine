GOOD ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS should 
not be the basis for denying residency to immigrants, the California Department 
of Health Services has advised the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It 
is good advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Please be advised that we believe denying a person legal residency solely on 
the grounds of HIV seropositivity is counterproductive and poor public health 
policy for this disease," Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the department, 
informed the INS, according to correspondence just made public. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Richard E. Norton, associate INS commissioner, promised careful 
use of the service's discretionary authority to grant waivers and said only two 
cases are pending. But more cases could develop as the process of screening 
immigration amnesty candidates continues. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer opposed the exclusion on grounds of both public health and equity. From 
the public-health-policy point of view, it is important that these people have 
"access to programs that provide education, behavioral intervention and medical 
monitoring" to minimize the risk of further spread of the infection by them, 
including the enhanced risk if they are forced underground. 
</P>
<P>
From the equity point of view, Kizer pointed out that amnesty applicants have 
been in the United States at least six years and therefore "it is likely that 
they contracted the virus while in the United States." He concluded that "it 
would be inhumane to deny these individuals legalization benefits, force them 
to resume an illegal underground existence, or constructively force them to 
leave this country at a time when they most need proper medical guidance and 
assistance." Their return to Third World nations of origin "is likely to worsen 
the worldwide HIV epidemic and, in the long run, hurt the U.S. more than 
tending to these individuals in this country now."

THE OIL CONNECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Ronald Reagan used to say about recalcitrant members of Congress, "If they 
don't see the light, make them feel the heat." Well, the Exxon Valdez accident 
has put considerable heat on the Bush Administration and its avid support for 
oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Secretary of 
the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr., acknowledging the mood of Congress, said there 
is no chance of Congress passing a bill this year to open up the refuge to the 
oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is time for the Administration to see the light and also declare that 
there will be no oil drilling off the coast of Northern California at least for 
the duration of George Bush's tenure in office. The Administration also should 
delay other proposed oil lease sales along the California coast until the 
federal government has conducted a thorough review and revision of regulations 
governing oil- spill containment and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry and top Bush Administration officials have insisted that there 
was no connection between the Exxon Valdez crude-oil spill and proposed 
drilling in the wildlife preserve about 100 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, the 
giant oil development on the Alaskan coast of the Arctic Ocean. But any oil 
found in the wildlife refuge can get to market by only one route -- via a new 
pipeline over to Prudhoe Bay, down through the trans-Alaska pipeline to the 
port of Valdez and then by tanker through Prince William Sound to refineries on 
the West Coast. That seems a tight enough connection. 
</P>
<P>
Even the oil industry's most influential allies in Congress have given up hope 
of legislation this year to explore in the refuge. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston 
(D-La.), chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and 
sponsor of a refuge drilling bill, commented: "It is not only politically 
foolish to push legislation now, it's foolish from a policy point of view." 
</P>
<P>
On the House side, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) returned from three days in 
Alaska to declare that the accident was "the tragic result of a systematic 
assault by the oil industry that rendered ineffective the entire system of 
regulatory safeguards." Miller, whose subcommittee oversees the Arctic refuge, 
said there must be a strong authority established to exercise control over 
accident cleanups. Indeed there must be. 
</P>
<P>
As with the refuge, the Bush Administration might not see any relationship 
between the Exxon Valdez and drilling off the Northern California coast. But 
the connection is very real, linked by the federal government's eagerness to 
accommodate the oil companies. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) and other 
California officials have disclosed warnings from federal experts about the 
potential dangers of drilling off the spectacular Northern California coast. 
The warnings had been either altered or suppressed altogether within the 
Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
In one memo, officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that the 
Interior Department's oil leasing agency had "inaccurately painted a picture of 
a routine operation with few potential impacts when in fact offshore 
development in Northern California and the proposed tanker traffic is a 
high-risk operation in rough seas, in a geologically unstable area, with 
potentially devastating impacts on coastal resources." That comment had been 
deleted from the version of the memo made public. Also censored was the 
statement that current technology was not capable of cleaning up a spill in the 
North Coast area. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to see the light: Drilling, pumping or transporting oil in a 
wilderness environment must never again be considered routine.

A JOINT VENTURE INTO PERESTROIKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD WILLENS, Los Angeles businessman Harold Willens has long been active 
in promoting better U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KINGISEPP, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I stood by the recently vacated Soviet army barracks, there flashed through 
my mind a felicitous phrase encountered somewhere in the dim past: Life is what 
actually happens to you while you are making all kinds of other plans. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly none of my "other plans" had ever included my being in this township 
of 50,000 about 100 miles from Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Yet here I was, participating with a small group of Americans and a large group 
of Soviets in a ceremony celebrating the conversion of a military facility into 
a factory for the manufacture of children's clothing (a consumer product so 
short in supply as to be desperately desired throughout the Soviet Union). 
</P>
<P>
The official act of conversion we were there to witness had the legal effect of 
"transferring the land and buildings from a military unit to the Garant 
Cooperative for the production of children's clothing with the assistance of 
American businessmen Mr. H. Willens and Mr. W. Bilson, they being present at 
the procedure of signing this act." And directly above the signature of Urij 
Menshikov, the authorized official of Kingisepp, appeared these words: "I do 
stress as well that the transformation of a military unit into a civil one is 
real evidence of perestroika policy having the aim to improve the life of the 
Soviet people." 
</P>
<P>
My own words, expressed on behalf of my partner, Los Angeles business executive 
Wesley Bilson, plus apparel manufacturer Bernard Grenell, project coordinator 
and translator Sophia Lansky and corporate planner Gail Woodward (a "team" 
uniquely qualified to share entrepreneurial skills and experience with our new 
Soviet friends) stressed the symbolic significance of the Kingisepp conversion 
as described by Menshikov: "To transform a military facility into a children's 
apparel factory captures the very essence of a universal priority shift from 
which all the people of the world would benefit at this moment in human 
history. We Americans here today actively support your perestroika because it 
seeks to redirect from military priorities to civilian needs the human skills, 
the technology and the financial resources required to deal with potentially 
terminal global problems. Let us hope that the small but significant step we 
witness here today becomes an example that inspires many more such steps toward 
the safer, better world we want for our children." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in full uniform, Col. Victor Makarov, the former commander of Kingisepp 
Army Base, stated that "only a short while ago I could not ever imagine that I 
would witness what is taking place here today . . . and yet I consider this act 
as a measure that is humanistic, just -- and justified." 
</P>
<P>
Although the audience reaction seemed warm and favorable to each speaker in 
turn, it struck me as being especially responsive to the words of Raisa 
Gorbachev when they were read for her by Vladislav A. Starkov, editor-in-chief 
of the popular Soviet journal Arguments and Facts. In her message, the first 
lady "conveyed her warmest wishes to the organizers of the children's-clothing 
venture being set up with the assistance of American businessmen," and 
expressed her hope "that Soviet people will welcome this as still more evidence 
of the new friendship which has been emerging in Soviet-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
Probably because of the message from Mrs. Gorbachev, the event received 
nationwide television, radio and print-media coverage, thus communicating to 
most of the Soviet Union the fact that seasoned American business executives 
were -- as an act of enlightened self-interest -- gladly sharing, at their own 
expense and with no profit potential in mind, their skills and experience, 
gained over many years. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about enlightened self-interest as some of us were being given a tour 
of the buildings already being remodeled at the base, and at the banquet 
afterward I proposed a toast to a dramatic example of enlightened 
self-interest: the Soviet-American partnership that destroyed a would-be 
world-destroyer by the name of Adolf Hilter. 
</P>
<P>
And I ended the toast with these words: "Let us drink to the reestablishment of 
that de facto partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union for in 
it lies the best hope not only for preventing catastrophic war, but also for 
solving, one step at a time, global ecological threats for which the only cure 
is prevention."

A JUST CAUSE IS NOT ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
TIBETANS LACK KEY ADVANTAGES OF THE INTIFADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER REICH, Walter Reich, a psychiatrist and senior research associate at 
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is the author of Stranger 
in My House: Jews and Arabs in the West Bank(Holt). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During past years when Tibetans were imprudent enough to hurl themselves 
against their Chinese occupiers, generating little notice abroad and even less 
support, I was sure that an important lesson for us all lay buried in their 
futile efforts. Yet it was only last month when the Tibetans began to once 
again challenge the Chinese -- using, as they had before, simple stones -- that 
I finally realized just what that lesson is. It is that, in this world, not all 
intifadas are created equal. 
</P>
<P>
It was, of course, the Palestinian intifada aimed at Israel that made this 
realization possible. I suppose I should have had a hint of it a year ago 
March, when the Tibetan intifada last flared up and the Palestinian one was 
already 10 weeks old. But at the time the Palestinian uprising hadn't yet 
achieved the success that it subsequently did, a success that enables it, a 
year later, to teach us so much about the Tibetan intifada in particular and 
all intifadas in general. 
</P>
<P>
And what a success the Palestinian intifada has been. In just 16 months it has 
reset the geopolitics of the Middle East. It has overturned diplomatic agendas 
in every world capital. It has mobilized public opinion, in the United States 
and elsewhere, in favor of its goals. It has thrown the Israeli people into 
spasms of existential dread and agonies of moral turmoil. It has turned the 
once-fearsome Israeli army into a frustrated and ineffective police force. And 
it has revived the hopes of Palestinians, both those under Israeli occupation 
and those living in other places, that they will some day realize part, or even 
all, of their decades-old national dream. 
</P>
<P>
This enormous success can be attributed primarily to three reasons. Most of all 
it's due to the powerful images of violent resistance and military response 
that burned themselves nightly and relentlessly into the consciousness and 
memories of television-watchers everywhere, both ordinary citizens and 
government officials. These images, captured by battalions of cameramen and 
described by legions of reporters, were displayed in excruciating and 
compelling detail -- detail that, in its repetitive, exquisite, prolonged and 
ferocious focus, turned individual instances of wounding and killing, and 
occasional episodes of brutality, into an endless landscape of large-scale 
murder and crushed bones. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the success of the Palestinian intifada was the widespread 
support it received, not only from fellow Palestinians outside the occupied 
territories and fellow Arabs, but also from nations long sympathetic to the 
Palestinian cause (notably the East Bloc and the Third World) as well as those 
(Japan and Western Europe) whose economic needs in the Middle East have long 
influenced their diplomatic preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Palestinian intifada has been successful because the power against 
which it has focused itself operates under self-imposed restraints. Israel has 
not been prepared to do what other powers have done in response to similar 
challenges. Israel, however imperfectly, has engaged in riot-control, not war 
and extermination. The Palestinians know that they face a nation that is 
affected by its own traditions of justice and compassion. Or consider the case 
of the British in India. Had Gandhi attempted to wrest independence from, say, 
the Soviet Union or China, or even from many of the other European powers, he 
would have had to suffer a far larger number of deaths in his intifada and 
struggle many more years. 
</P>
<P>
None of these characteristics that have made the Palestinian intifada a success 
have been present in the Tibetan intifada. The Chinese have made sure there 
would be few witnesses to the uprising, or their response to it. They banished 
not only reporters and cameras, but also tourists. The Tibetans have no outside 
supporters who count; the U.S. State Department, for its part, reacted to the 
news of the latest riots by reassuring the Chinese that it saw Tibet as forever 
belonging to China and by stressing the importance of addressing "the 
legitimate concerns of the inhabitants of Tibet," not the legitimate rights of 
the Tibetan people. And the Chinese, for their part, have exercised few 
restraints in their responses to Tibetan rioters. For them the strategic value 
of Tibet is, by itself, more than enough justification for the total absorption 
of that country and for China's settling of its own population there. 
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese, therefore, calls for Tibetan independence are treasonous acts 
of insurrection, and street riots justify all the mass killings that may be 
necessary to end them. It's not hard to understand why the Tibetan intifada has 
failed so consistently and why it will no doubt continue to fail. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tibetan intifada isn't the only one doomed to fail. Others, too, lack 
several or all of the qualities necessary for success. The several intifadas 
now simmering in the Soviet Union -- the Armenian one, the Estonian one, the 
Latvian one, the Lithuanian one, the Georgian one, the burgeoning Ukrainian one 
-- may have greater access to cameras and reporters than they would have had in 
the decades before glasnost. But that access is still a limited one. Should 
these areas erupt, outside support would be even weaker than it was for the 
East German, Polish, Hungarian and Czech intifadas that took place during the 
1950s and '60s. And they would be suppressed no less brutally, quickly, 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
And in many corners of the world, there are other intifadas that are likely, 
for various combinations of the same reasons, to fail just as surely -- the 
Tamils in Sri Lanka, for example, the Sikhs in the Punjab, and that oldest and 
bloodiest intifada of them all, the Kurds, whose unhappy fate it is to attempt 
in obscurity, and without any reliable supporters, to wrest a homeland not from 
one brutal power but from three or four. 
</P>
<P>
All of these failed and failing intifadas -- like the many that have failed in 
history, including our own American Indian intifada, are unable to achieve 
success, but not because they are carried out in the name of a cause that is 
any less just than that of a successful intifada. They fail because of the 
nature of the circumstances in which they are pursued and the nature of their 
occupying enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, any people that feels its land is occupied by another people or power 
would be wise to refrain from launching an intifada unless it can use the mass 
media to transmit and magnify its message, unless it can be sure to have 
outside friends ready to express their support in diplomatic if not military 
terms and unless it is occupied by an enemy that, like Israel, lacks the 
stomach to respond to it totally and ruthlessly. Unfortunately for Tibet, a 
just cause is never enough.

PRESERVATION OF OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both statements regarding Olvera Street's preservation (Op-Ed Page, March 24) 
underscore the historic significance of the area. Councilman Richard Alatorre 
notes that the birthplace of Los Angeles is "the cornerstone of our city's 
proud Latino legacy," while Vivien Consuelo Bonzo claims that the street has 
"embodied the traditions of the Mexican people for almost 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
If history is to be invoked, it should be accurate. If Olvera Street is to be 
preserved because it represents the beginnings of Los Angeles, the 
international composition of its founders and its early settlers should be 
acknowledged. While many residents have been made aware of the multiethnic 
heritage of the original 44 pobladores, few visitors to El Pueblo Historic Park 
appreciate the area's continuing multicultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1823 Giovanni Batista Leandri, an Italian, operated a general store 
on the south side of the Plaza. In 1836 Matias Sabichi, an Austro-Italian or 
Dalmatian sea captain, opened a business near the southwest corner of the 
Plaza. By the 1850s Olvera Street, known through part of the 19th Century as 
Vine or Wine Street, was home to Austro-Italian wine merchant Giovanni 
Cavacichi and Italian vintners Giuseppe Gazza, Antonio Pelanconi and Giacomo 
Tononi. A few years later Secondo Guasti operated a restaurant in the Avila 
Adobe, which had also served as a boarding house known as the Hotel Italia 
Unita. In an adjacent building the Italian Mutual Benevolence Society was 
organized in 1877. The group continued to meet in this area until 1932 when the 
headquarters were moved from the Italian Hall on the northwest corner of Olvera 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
This richly varied neighborhood also included Chinese residents who occupied 
buildings on the east side of the Plaza as well as the Garnier Block, the 
headquarters for the Chinese Benevolent Society for nearly 50 years. Phillipe 
Garnier, the owner, was a member of a French settlement clustered near the 
south side of the Plaza, which included such names as Prudhomme, Vignes and 
Mascarel. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, from its beginnings the historic center of Los Angeles has been 
cosmopolitan. In the interest of accuracy this multicultural legacy should be 
represented in any plan for the restoration of El Pueblo Historic Park. The 
recognition of such a legacy would not only be consistent with history, it 
would also represent an appropriate monument to the rich past of a city which 
today has become the new Ellis Island of the United States.

NORTH'S TRIAL IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North is on trial because he twisted and warped what it means to be an 
American. Being born and raised in the United States, I was taught that we 
Americans believe in the individual, making our own choices, and standing on 
our own two feet. 
</P>
<P>
According to North, being a "good American" means taking orders with an 
enthusiastic, "Yes, sir!" No questions asked. As for myself, I thought people 
are supposed to do that under the rule of dictators and tyrants.

OIL SPILL: 'THERE WAS NO EXCUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us who remember George Bush touring Boston Harbor with so much fanfare 
last year during the campaign are, to some extent, disappointed in the lack of 
enthusiasm on his part to personally survey the results of a failed 
environmental policy, which now fouls the waters of Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can deny that the environment is one area that suffers the most from the 
Administration's laissez-faire attitude and that we cannot depend on large 
corporations to police themselves in the exploitation of our natural resources, 
to protect the air, water and the land that belongs to us all. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot afford any more oil spills or an Administration that abdicates its 
responsibility to protect the environment under siege by corporate plunderers. 
I don't know if we can wait four years for a strong and forceful leader to 
rescue this kinder, gentler nation from benign neglect.

PRESERVATION OF OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary by Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. 
(OSMA), regarding the merchants' concerns related to the proposed development 
reminds me of the civic leader who would expound vociferously that all children 
in his town should have shoes but deliberately omitted saying that the shoes 
would be made in his factory. 
</P>
<P>
A point that is never revealed in the Olvera Street issue is that OSMA 
instigated and brought about the Molina bill. AB 1955 is the legislation that 
established law and the requirement for Los Angeles to accept bids on that 
portion of El Pueblo known as Olvera Street. Ironically, this is what is 
threatening the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
It was interesting to see that Ms. Bonzo has admitted that "Olvera Street 
belongs to all the people." It should be made known to her that all the people 
are the millions of residents of Los Angeles, and not just the few merchants 
who have attempted to control and manage the street during her tenure. It has 
been the attitude of OSMA members that only they know what is best for Olvera 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants of Olvera Street are divided. There are a few who follow OSMA. 
Another group formed, the Business Leadership of Olvera Street (BLO) -- our 
group includes both large and small merchants. The third group are the 
merchants who are standing by to see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
OSMA is not the only group concerned with the effect of big money, overzealous 
developers, and special interests changing the face of Olvera Street. BLO was 
established to promote the advancement of Olvera Street and to preserve its 
history and culture. Councilman Alatorre points this out in his view and 
relates reality when he states, "While we endeavor to sustain the participation 
of many merchants whose businesses are an integral part of the street, we must 
create an economic package to furnish the capital needed to renovate and 
revitalize the street."

NORTH'S TRIAL IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not an admirer of North. I don't approve of what he admits to doing during 
the Iran-Contra fiasco. However, I will accept that a career Marine might well 
see it as his duty to assume blame and protect his superiors should events take 
the bad turn that they did. When I was in the military service, we were 
thoroughly drilled on the ethics and responsibilities of an officer. We were 
referred to as "an officer and a gentlemen." Our word was our bond, and though 
you might find it hard to believe, we lived by that code. The highest priority 
in an officer's life was the welfare of the people under his command. 
</P>
<P>
I am bothered and upset by the events taking place in the trial of North. A lot 
of questions keep coming up, but to me the major question is very simple, but 
apparently the answer isn't. Former Commander in Chief Ronald Reagan, why don't 
you come forward and help the man who served you so well?

PESTICIDES, ADDITIVES IN FOOD: 'RUINED BY A DIET OF NEUROSIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Plested, a heart surgeon and president of the California Medical Assn. no 
less, says we Americans are the "healthiest, most-informed people in history," 
and are being "ruined by a diet of neurosis." The good doctor typifies the 
medical Establishment's moderate approach to curbing the country's mass 
addiction to sweets and fats and gimmicky things in boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps none of the competing food "faddists" has the complete answer, but I 
prefer selecting options provided by being "most informed" to the sick 
situation mandated by Plested and his peers of "balancing" demonstrably 
unhealthy practices with a few good ones. The medical, beef, and dairy 
industries all benefit from such moderation, but hundreds of thousands of 
unhealthy and young potentially unhealthy Americans aren't. Eventually the 
moderate constituencies will go the way of the tobacco industry, but at what a 
price in the world's "most-informed" country!

CLARK'S FIRST HOMER WITH PADRES POWERS VICTORY OVER REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this week, sitting outside in the early afternoon quiet of San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, Jack Clark talked about the home run. 
</P>
<P>
Not the one against the Dodgers that won a pennant for the St. Louis Cardinals, 
or the ones that won any number of big games for the San Francisco Giants, but 
one he held much closer to his heart. His first homer as a Padre. The one he 
didn't have yet. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in the game a long time, you aren't supposed to feel pressure, but you 
do," he was saying. "You come out here and everybody has the expectations for 
you and no, you aren't going to hit 60 homers for them. But you'd like to get 
the first one. You'd like to show them right away that everything is OK. 
</P>
<P>
"You get that first one and then you sit back and go 'Whew.' " 
</P>
<P>
Friday night around 7:20, if you were standing outside San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium, that's the sound you heard. Whew. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 games and 39 plate appearances as a Padre, Jack ripped. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes into the first of a three-game series with the Cincinnati Reds, 
Clark drove a ball 330 feet and over the right-field fence for his first home 
run as a San Diego Padre. Conveniently, two guys were on base, making it a 
three-run homer in a four-run first inning that propelled the Padres to a 6-5 
victory in front of a paid crowd of 31,894 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Feel good Jack? 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good just to hit the ball," said Clark, who entered hitting .133 with 
14 strikeouts in 30 at-bats. "It felt good just to make contact." 
</P>
<P>
As the Padres broke their two-game losing streak and won the first fall in what 
will surely be a tough 18-game match against another potential West Division 
contender, credit also was earned in other places. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Salazar, who has done exactly what Manager Jack McKeon acquired him from 
Detroit to do, had three hits including the eventual game-cinching homer in the 
sixth. It was his second homer in two days. Starter Eric Show struggled but 
lasted seven innings, allowing four runs, staying long enough to get reliever 
Mark Davis in the game. 
</P>
<P>
And then Davis struggled, allowing an RBI double by Barry Larkin the ninth to 
make it 6-5 and then walking Chris Sabo to put runners on first and third with 
two outs and Eric Davis at the plate. Davis swung and missed a curveball, 
fouled off another curveball, took a fastball high for ball one . . . and then 
lined a ball directly at Clark for the third out and Davis' fifth save in five 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you want it?" Clark shouted to Davis about 20 minutes after the game, 
holding the ball up. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," Davis said. "But we saved your ball." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's shot off Reds' starter and loser Danny Jackson (1-2) came with Randy 
Ready on second base after a walk and Tony Gwynn on first after an RBI single. 
It came on a three-and-one fastball that found its way down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"Right where it's supposed to be when a guy wants to hit a homer," said 
Jackson, last year's Cy Young Award runner-up who has allowed 11 first-inning 
runs in his three starts this season. "I can break anyone out of a slump the 
way I'm throwing. It doesn't make any difference who it is." 
</P>
<P>
The ball cleared the fence and banged off the green wall in front of the 
stands, never entering the seats. Some Padres thought this poetic justice, 
considering how the fans recently have booed Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "I hope that hit made some people happy, they've put enough 
pressure on him to hit one." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he never heard the earlier booing. He only heard the cheering that 
accompanied Friday's first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans have never bothered me, I'm been thinking so much about hitting, 
people have had to tell me about the boos," said Clark, whose homer coincided 
with his move from fourth to fifth in the batting order. "But I did hear those 
cheers when I came to the plate." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's feeling as if he might hear more cheers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fooling around with a new swing with Amos (Otis, hitting coach) and 
we may have found something that works," Clark said. "For the first time 
tonight, I came to the park and felt like I had a chance. Before, I was lost. I 
would change stances, grips, everything. I was going backward. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight for me was a victory. I just hope maybe it's something that will 
last." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three starts this season, Show, who has become one of the 
toughest pitchers in baseball, appeared to let the tough times get to him. 
</P>
<P>
After breezing through the first three innings unmarked, he allowed his first 
runner in the fourth on Larkin's double to left. Sabo then doubled to right to 
score Larkin and bring up Davis. 
</P>
<P>
After a rare visit to the mound by pitching coach Pat Dobson with the count two 
and two, Show struck out Davis. Same old Show? Not so fast. He worked ahead of 
Kal Daniels but allowed him to pop an RBI single to right. Three pitches later 
Todd Benzinger singled to center. Only fly balls by Paul O'Neill and Jeff Reed 
extracted him from that mess. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris pitched off a mound for six minutes Friday and said his sore left 
rib-cage muscle, "Isn't pulling at me anymore. It's just a dull pain now." A 
pitchers' life being what it is, this means Harris is ready to work again. 
"They told me I could pitch right away -- if they really, really, really needed 
me," said Harris, who entering Friday had missed eight days with the injury . . 
. Johnny Bench, the Hall of Fame catcher who is now a Reds' television 
announcer, talked Friday about the young man who is being increasingly compared 
to him -- Padre catcher Benito Santiago. "He is unbelievable," Bench said. "I 
love to see ability like that. The way he throws, it's scary." Did Bench ever 
throw like that? "Well, I don't remember throwing from both knees like that, at 
least not with the follow-through that he has," said Bench, generally 
considered the greatest catcher ever after a 17-year career which ended 
following the 1983 season. However, Bench does see some of himself in Santiago. 
"I led the league in passed balls with 18 when I was a rookie," he remembered 
with a smile. "And at first I was a little overly aggressive, trying to show 
off my arm to everybody. But as you gain experience, you learn to be more laid 
back. Once you get that first Gold Glove (Santiago's stated 1989 goal), you 
walk out there and get behind the plate and know everybody is watching you and 
respecting what you can do. You have more confidence in yourself, and you don't 
have to do wild things. You can be more selective." Bench says that the best 
judge of Santiago's ability will never be in how many runners he throws out. 
"What you have to look at is how many guys are intimidated into not stealing," 
he said. "When a team plays the Padres, it's like, they may have five guys who 
can steal a base, but suddenly they only have two who can steal a base. That's 
the true measure of a great catcher." . . . In Case You're Wondering Dept: 
Outfielder Shane Mack is still hanging around the Padre clubhouse, his right 
elbow still hurting, but still no treatment planned other than rest. "I just 
have to think that it will eventually get better," said Mack, who is on the 
disabled list and bound for triple-A Las Vegas as soon as he is healthy. "But 
right now it stinks. The worst pain comes when I swing, That's why it's so 
bad." Speaking of that swing, remember this time last year? Mack was in the 
midst of hitting in each of the season's first 27 games for Las Vegas. He was 
hustled to the big leagues, hit .217 in 21 straight starts in center field 
here, and hasn't been the same since.

LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING LEADS HART TO 19-3 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High got mad. And 18 hits. And towering home runs by Lance Migita, Casey 
Burrill and Ray Gardocki. 
</P>
<P>
And six innings of one-run, four-hit pitching from sophomore right-hander Keith 
Halcovich. 
</P>
<P>
And a 19-3 Foothill League victory Friday over visiting Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the Indians got even -- in a sense. 
</P>
<P>
The record will show that Alhambra, a decidedly weaker foe, defeated Hart twice 
in three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
But one of those victories was finalized Tuesday by league officials, who 
denied Hart's request to resume a March 17 game that was halted because of 
darkness with the Moors leading, 3-2, and Hart at bat with two runners on base 
in the bottom of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Alhambra ace German Louisiaga showed Hart some good pitching, 
hurling an eight-hitter to give Alhambra a 5-4 win. 
</P>
<P>
But with Friday's resounding victory, the Indians showed . . . . well, they 
showed 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted them to know that we're a good team," said Migita, who smashed 
a three-run home run midway through the Indians' eight-run second inning. 
"Those losses kind of ticked us off." 
</P>
<P>
Halcovich (5-1), who surrendered only a solo home run in the second inning by 
first baseman Robert Donko, was equally perturbed by the week's developments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it got a lot of the guys mad," Halcovich said. "We're not used to 
losing that much." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The first-place Indians (14-3, 5-2 in league play) are 40-4 through the 
past two seasons. Two of the losses were to Alhambra, of which Hart Coach Bud 
Murray flatly declared, "They have no position guys who could make our team." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, admittedly both "ticked off" by Tuesday's decision and disappointed by 
not having "beaten them bad" the same day, scheduled a team practice Wednesday 
-- ordinarily an off day for the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we weren't working hard enough," Murray said. "That was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Said Burrill: "We didn't really work on hitting. We did a lot of running and 
working on things. It was a grueling practice. Yesterday was pretty tough, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to get us fired up. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
Four batters after Migita's blast, Burrill crushed a grand slam on the first 
pitch from David Duarte (1-3) to give the Indians an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hart sent 12 batters to the plate and collected six hits in the second to take 
a 9-1 lead. Burrill's blast knocked Duarte from the game and before the 
inning's final out was recorded, Hart had punished five pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching is 80-90% of baseball and we didn't have it today," Alhambra Coach 
Tom Hall said. "The main thing was, our pitchers got the ball high in the 
strike zone and they have good hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Hart scored twice in the third, with Gardocki launching a solo home run off 
reliever John Middleton. The Indians added a solo run in the fifth, then struck 
for seven runs in the sixth as 12 batters again came to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Gardocki finished three for four with a walk and four runs batted in. Burrill 
was two for three with two walks. Second baseman Darin Tsukashima singled four 
times and scored four times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a definite boost for the team," Burrill said. "A real team-bonding type 
win."

CAMARILLO GETS A BIGGS LIFT TO 2-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Biggs decided to take matters into his own hands Friday, driving home the 
winning run and pitching a five-hitter to help Camarillo High hand Newbury Park 
its first Marmonte League loss of the season, a 2-1 decision at Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Biggs, a senior right-hander who signed with Cal, struck out three and raised 
his record to 5-1. It was Biggs' bat, however, that gave Camarillo the victory. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the top of the sixth and Camarillo trailing, 1-0, Mike Muncy 
and Matt Tackett hit consecutive singles. Chris Johnson then scored Muncy with 
a base hit. Biggs then singled to score Tackett, who narrowly beat the tag by 
Panther catcher Danny Madsen. The at-bat was the first of the game for Biggs. 
Designated hitter Jason McAtee struck out twice in both previous at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you look good when those guys come through for you," Camarillo Coach 
Ken Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Johnson was two for three for Camarillo (11-8, 4-2 in league play), which 
is in third place. Newbury Park (14-2-3, 5-1) dropped into a first-place tie 
with Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's Jeremy Dewey (5-1) pitched a complete game with six strikeouts 
and two walks. Newbury Park's run came on a solo home run by Wayne Cook, his 
second of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In other Marmonte League games: 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 12, Thousand Oaks 1 -- Mike Jenkins pitched a one-hitter and struck 
out 15 and the Pioneers hit four home runs at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who struck out eight of the final nine batters and the last six in a 
row, improved to 4-0. The only ball to leave the infield was Mike McNellis' 
double to center in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Anguiano led Simi Valley (16-2, 5-1) with two home runs. Greg Santos and 
Kenny Hood hit Thousand Oaks starter Scott Barkman's first two pitches of the 
second inning for home runs. Anguiano, the Pioneers' leadoff batter, leads the 
team with four homers. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hodgins and Hood had three hits each and Terry Hill had two hits and three 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake 7, Royal 3 -- Steve Susko's two-run single in the fifth inning broke a 
2-2 tie for the Warriors at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Susko had two hits and Mike Lieberthal had three and scored two runs. Rob Neal, 
a sophomore playing in his second game since being promoted from the junior 
varsity, was two for four and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Eby pitched a four-hitter to improve to 4-4 for Westlake (8-10, 2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Jason Jones hit a solo homer in the second for Royal (8-11, 2-4). 
</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
La Salle 1, Notre Dame 0 -- Two La Salle pitchers limited Notre Dame to three 
hits and the Lancers scored a run in the first inning to beat the Knights at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The loss broke Notre Dame's seven-game winning streak. The Knights (14-2, 1-1) 
had also won their first seven games of the season before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"They played real sound baseball," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said of La 
Salle, which improved to 2-0 in league. "They were ready for us and they were 
excited, I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Luis Solis started for the Lancers and gave way to Brian Esquival in the sixth. 
The Knights, who threatened in the sixth when they left the bases loaded, and 
the seventh, stranded 12 baserunners. With Notre Dame runners on first and 
second and one out in the seventh, La Salle turned a double play to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 7, Harvard 2 -- Chris DeCristo drove in three runs, two with a 
third-inning home run, to support the combined three-hit pitching of Greg

ALEMANY MAKES MOST OF RUNNERS IN 9-6 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alemany High maintained control of the Del Rey League on Friday, outscoring 
Loyola, 9-6, despite being outhit by the Cubs, 13-12, at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians stranded only four runners in improving to 11-8 overall, 5-1 in 
league play, 1 1/2 games ahead of St. Francis. Loyola (6-9, 3-3) is in third. 
</P>
<P>
But for some Alemany seniors, the game was more than just another step toward 
the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our last time playing at this place and we wanted to win real bad," 
senior Ray Cano said. "The whole team was pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cano was a little more excited than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The left fielder was three for four -- including a game-clinching two-run home 
run -- and finished with five runs batted in. Loyola pitcher Eric Bacura fed 
Cano a changeup in the sixth inning and Cano deposited it over the left-field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sort of expecting an off-speed pitch and he gave me an off-speed pitch 
right in the strike zone," Cano said. "So what else can you do with a pitch 
like that but hit it over the fence?" 
</P>
<P>
The home run boosted Alemany's lead to 8-5. The Indians added an insurance run 
when Jon Beauchemin followed Cano with a solo blast over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians took advantage of two errors by third baseman Ryan Lefebvre in the 
first inning to score two unearned runs. Alemany increased its advantage to 3-0 
in the second when Leo Tejada doubled to center and scored on a single by Cano. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola pulled to within 3-1 in the second when designated-hitter David Vida led 
off the inning with a single, advanced to third on a single to center by Pat 
Gilhooly and scored on an overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs went in front, 4-3, an inning later on Vida's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead was short-lived. With two out in the Alemany fourth, Brian Swanson 
reached first on an error and leadoff batter Greg Thompson bunted for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Both scored on a double by Cano, who advanced to third on a passed ball and 
scored on wild pitch to give the Indians a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs pulled to within 6-5 in the fifth when Lefebvre, aboard on a bunt 
single, scored on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
After Cano and Beauchemin homered to push Alemany in front by four in the 
sixth, Loyola loaded the bases with three consecutive singles in its half of 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre's sacrifice fly scored pinch-runner Dan Dwyer, but Alemany pitcher Tom 
Daniels (6-2) retired the next two batters to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a hell of a job getting out of that jam," Alemany Coach Jim Ozella said 
of his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, a senior right-hander, gave up 13 hits, but struck out seven and 
walked one en route to a complete-game victory.

GARLAND FINISHES WHAT HE STARTS TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brandon Garland's was thinking about compromise, his shoulder was still stiff 
and he had butterflies in his stomach. All were the result of not pitching 
enough this season. 
</P>
<P>
Garland, who went the distance for host Clairemont Friday in a 5-4 City Western 
League victory over University City (4-11, 2-3), hasn't been the starting 
pitcher since the first game of the season. A shoulder injury had kept him in 
left field, clearly his second-favorite position. 
</P>
<P>
Garland (1-1) got the call from his coach, Dave Buttles, because of his strong 
relief appearance Wednesday against Kearny, when he struck out the only two 
batters he faced to pick up a save. 
</P>
<P>
Garland, a senior right-hander, decided he would just throw fastballs in the 
first inning Friday to test his shoulder. Turned out to be decent strategy; he 
allowed nine hits to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Staying with the basics in the first inning helped. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Well, Brandon, one inning is not much to sacrifice for seven,' " 
Garland said. "They didn't hit one ball solid on me." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Clairemont wasn't exactly a terror at the plate either. The 
Chieftains (8-8, 4-2) had four hits, including a first-inning, first-pitch home 
run by Antoine Henry and a timely sixth-inning double by Jesus Jauregui. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont trailed, 4-1, going in to the bottom of the sixth. Two University 
City errors gave Jauregui the opportunity to win it. He fouled off three 
curveballs before driving a fastball to left, scoring the tying and winning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
A half-inning later, Garland finished the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing the ball a lot harder," Buttles said, "but I think he tried to 
come back a little too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Garland, seeking a college scholarship to play baseball next year, is learning 
new pitches, including a forkball. He has the tools, Buttles said. He just 
needs to set his mind to the game a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing with Brandon is between the ears," Buttles said. "He's the 
kind of guy you have to pump up all the time. He has got a lot of potential. 
But he just has got to work harder. In his mind he's working hard. But in my 
mind it's not hard enough." DON PATTERSON

INVESTORS ARE TURNING COOL TOWARD 'JUNK BOND' ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high-yield "junk bond" market is again showing why many investors consider 
it so risky. 
</P>
<P>
Rising interest rates, worries about a slowing economy and a 
multibillion-dollar flood of new junk issues set to hit the market have pushed 
prices for many junk issues down as much as 2% to 3% in the past two weeks and 
4% to 5% since the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many junk bond mutual funds -- one of the fastest-growing segments 
of the fund industry last year -- are beginning to report small but noticeable 
net outflows of money as individual investors have become dissatisfied with 
recent performance and seek safer havens in money market funds or Treasury 
bills. Such outflows could grow as publicity about falling junk bond prices on 
Wall Street reaches more small investors on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Junk bond markets typically suffer from psychological excesses on the downside 
as well as the upside, and we seem to be in one of those periods," said Richard 
S. Swingle, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price High Yield Bond Fund, the 
top-performing mutual fund last year investing in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this slump in the fast-growing $180-billion junk bond market is 
temporary or longer term remains to be seen. It certainly is not the first time 
the market has hit turbulence. An even worse slump occurred in the days 
following the October, 1987, stock market crash, as investors panicked and fled 
to top-quality government and corporate bonds, driving down junk bond prices 
sharply. But as recession fears subsided, the market subsequently recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Friday, some higher quality junk issues -- those with nearly 
"investment-grade" bond ratings -- staged a mini-rally, recovering as much as 
0.5% of their value, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
But if that rally fades and the latest slump persists, it could have 
far-reaching consequences for the economy and Wall Street. It could dampen the 
recent wave of takeovers and leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds and make 
it more difficult for many smaller companies to raise capital through junk 
issues. It also could accelerate the onset of a recession if junk jitters cause 
corporate executives and individuals to cool down their business and spending 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The slump, if it persists, could erode confidence in the already embattled 
investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond market's top trader 
and cheerleader. Buyers say the slide has nothing to do with Drexel's recent 
guilty plea to federal securities laws violations and its subsequent agreement 
to fire junk bond chief Michael Milken. But the firm -- along with other major 
Wall Street firms -- is taking some heat among bond buyers for not committing 
enough capital to maintain a high level of liquidity, or ease of buying and 
selling, in the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The capital being committed by Wall Street firms to their trading desks to 
support the market is very small in relation to the amount of issues 
outstanding," said Alan C. Petersen, senior vice president and portfolio 
manager for Cigna High Yield Bond Fund. "So there is not a lot of liquidity." 
</P>
<P>
"You would think with the broadening of the market with more retail clients 
(such as mutual funds), that would add to liquidity," added C. Richard Lehmann, 
president of the Bond Investors Assn. in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation Jitters 
</P>
<P>
Aggravating that lack of liquidity, market players say, is the prospect of some 
$9 billion in new junk issues expected to hit the market in coming few weeks, 
led by a record $5-billion issue to help finance the takeover of RJR Nabisco. 
Many of these issues are being underwritten by Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of an increase in bond defaults in a recession -- due to corporations 
being unable to make debt payments as revenue and profit decline -- also is 
contributing to the slump. Conventional wisdom holds that the rate of junk bond 
defaults could rise to between 5% and 10% in a recession, up from about 2% now. 
Higher yields, however, could offset all or part of any defaults in a 
diversified portfolio of junk issues. 
</P>
<P>
But a new unpublished study by a Harvard University professor and two others, 
publicized this week, suggests that the actual default rate has been much 
higher. It contended that investors who bought and held a portfolio of all the 
junk bonds issued in 1977 and 1978 would, 10 years later, have suffered a 
default rate of 34%. 
</P>
<P>
While many traders said the study had little or no impact on market prices -- 
and others dismissed it -- it did cause an uneasy stir on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Also causing uneasiness this week was some concern that Solomon Asset 
Management, an investment management firm, might be forced to sell its huge 
portfolio of junk bonds to meet cash demands from nervous pension clients. 
Company founder David B. Solomon is leaving the firm because he is cooperating 
in the federal government's probe of Milken and Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Issues said to be hardest hit by price declines include those of retailers, 
such as Carter Hawley Hale and Federated Department Stores, and those of 
building supply firms. Both sectors would be hurt more than the market as a 
whole in a recession, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreads Widening 
</P>
<P>
Also hit are some issues of firms that have undergone large leveraged buyouts, 
such as Southland and Interco. Traders are concerned that these firms will have 
trouble selling assets to meet debt payments, as higher interest rates are 
making it more difficult for potential buyers of these assets to finance 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Declines in these and other junk issues have been reflected in widening 
"spreads" between yields on junk issues and Treasury issues of comparable 
maturities. These spreads were below 4 percentage points about a month ago but 
lately have risen to close to 5 points, the same level following the October, 
1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
These price declines have dampened the performance of mutual funds investing in 
junk bonds. The funds on average rose only 1.78% in the first quarter, after 
rising 8.46% last year. That has helped prompt investor withdrawals from 
several funds. 
</P>
<P>
The T. Rowe Price High Yield Bond Fund, for example, has experienced a small 
but noticeable drop of just under 2% of its assets, spokesman Steven Norwitz 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors are getting a little jittery," Norwitz said, noting that while junk 
funds are offering yields of 12.5% or more, erosion of bond prices can wipe out 
part of that gain. Money market funds, on the other hand, are paying more than 
9.5% with virtually no risk to principal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty attractive safety net for people concerned about volatility in 
their principal," Norwitz said.

SEVERAL AIRLINES TO HIKE SUMMER DISCOUNT FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several U.S. airlines, led by Continental, will raise some of their discount 
fares by as much as $80 round trip, indicating that travelers may be in for 
another general round of fare hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said late Thursday that it will increase most of its discount fares 
by $20 to $80 a round trip in time for the heavy summer travel season. The 
increases, which were matched by Braniff, TWA and America West, apply to 
round-trip tickets with advance purchase requirements. The fare hikes take 
effect on reservations made after May 27. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American, United, Delta, and USAir said they were studying 
Continental's move but had not decided whether to increase their fares. If such 
major carriers do not go along with the increases, observers said, Continental 
and the others may be forced to roll as least some of them back to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Travelers 
</P>
<P>
The increases will primarily affect vacation travelers who often book flights 
in advance. Continental, based in Houston, is not raising its unrestricted 
fares, used mostly by business travelers, "at this time," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said both its MaxSaver fares and its excursion fares were affected 
by the hikes. The MaxSavers require ticket purchases as much as two weeks in 
advance, a Saturday night stay and are non-refundable. The excursion fares, 
which cost more, require a seven-day advance purchase and carry a 25% 
cancellation penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Continental is not raising its fares on the highly competitive Newark, 
N.J.-to-Washington route or on a number of routes where it competes with 
low-fare Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said it is raising ticket prices because there is a strong demand 
for air travel. "The summer is the busiest period in the airline industry, and 
this adjustment is typical for this time of year," said Ned Walker, a 
Continental spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said fare hikes in the airline industry are justified by increased 
fuel and labor costs. In addition, the analysts said, most airlines have placed 
large orders for expensive new aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increase is that the strike at Eastern Airlines has 
idled that carrier's fleet, increasing the demand for seats on other carriers, 
said William Whitlow Jr., an airline industry analyst with the Dain Bosworth 
investment firm in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Air fares have been rising generally for several months. In January, most U.S. 
airlines, led by American, raised their excursion fares in 40 markets by $20 to 
$40 per round trip in response to unusually strong demand for air travel. Also 
in January, the airlines that fly within California raised their unrestricted 
fares by 15%, amid an outcry from business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines might hesitate to match Continental's fare hikes because 
travelers are still upset over the last round of increases, said Edward J. 
Starkman, an airline industry analyst with the Paine Webber financial firm in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an unexplained strong demand for air travel that provides an 
incentive for fare increases," he said. He said competitors might match 
Continental's fares in "selective markets," rather than across the board. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steady round of hikes, travel agent Jerry Steinberg said he did not 
think travelers would be discouraged. "We've had a strong demand," said 
Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL'S NEW RATES 
</P>
<P>
Current Maxsaver fares and those for reservations made after May 26. For 
flights originating in Los Angeles to selected destinations.

U.S. CONTROL OVER DREXEL BURNHAM UNIQUE ON WALL ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its settlement of civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment firm has opened the door to government 
control of its operations that is unprecedented on Wall Street, and that has 
rarely been seen anywhere in U.S. business, many securities experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some say the government's role -- as a sort of ever-vigilant probation 
officer -- more suggests the casino industry than the rules that the regulated 
investment world usually faces. 
</P>
<P>
"In their aggregate weight, these restrictions are much greater than those of 
any similar settlement," said Sam S. Miller, a New York securities lawyer who 
also acts as ethics ombudsman at the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm. 
"Is it too much? A lot of sophisticated people on Wall Street are wondering 
about that question right now." 
</P>
<P>
Capping the most sweeping investigation ever, the SEC and Drexel on Thursday 
agreed to a settlement that, among other things, puts the firm on 
administrative probation for three years, requires it to appoint senior 
officials acceptable to the agency and requires Drexel to cooperate with the 
government's continuing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by a federal judge, the deal settles a 7-month-old civil action in 
which the SEC accused the firm of a catalogue of securities violations in 
takeover deals between 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has worked out big civil settlements with a number of Wall Street firms 
in the past decade, including Jefferies &amp; Co., Kidder Peabody, E. F. 
Hutton, First Boston Corp. and Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. But asked which 
was closest to the Drexel deal in scope, John Sturc, the SEC's No. 2 
enforcement official, could provide no answer. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any comparison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidder settlement illustrates the typical features of such deals. To settle 
charges that it profited from trading on inside information, Kidder in 1987 
hired a consultant to study how it could improve compliance with securities 
laws. The firm also agreed to formulate new rules to help it reach that goal. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its settlement, Drexel is hiring the Philadelphia-based law firm of 
Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius to examine the functioning of its departments and 
to propose ways to improve compliance with the rules. But in an unprecedented 
twist, it is also hiring an accounting firm that will help the SEC and 
prosecutors investigate the firm's past and future trading activities. 
</P>
<P>
"To have the accounting firm in an investigative role has never been done," 
Sturc said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Access 
</P>
<P>
Also unprecedented, he said, was Drexel's obligation under the agreement to 
provide free access of government investigators to all employees and documents. 
Usually, such information can only be obtained through subpoena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said no previous settlements have put firms on "administrative probation," 
to subject them to added scrutiny; nor have previous settlements limited the 
ability of some employees to invest in their own firm's securities. 
</P>
<P>
Also unusual in the SEC settlement is the appointment of an ombudsman, whose 
job will be to listen to employees' concerns about possible violations and 
independently investigate the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Some securities experts say they have seen versions of these clauses that make 
Drexel's less than totally novel. But many agree that when the features are 
combined with others, including the creation of an oversight committee of 
outside directors, the effect is unparalleled. 
</P>
<P>
Some aren't sure they like it. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Lee Sorkin, a securities defense lawyer who was formerly the SEC's regional 
administrator in New York, said it is not outlandish to compare such 
arrangements with the aggressive regulation of the casino business that goes on 
in New Jersey, for example. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators there constantly check not only the job performance of casino 
managers but also a range of miscellaneous factors, such as their contacts with 
persons who have criminal ties. 
</P>
<P>
"This sets precedent, and it may be a very dangerous one," said Sorkin. 
"There's a fine line between imposing restriction and supervision and telling a 
firm how to run its business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Without a Hearing 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Drexel employees who ran afoul of the government could be 
dismissed without even the hearing they would get if they worked for a casino. 
Securities lawyer Miller said he hadn't made up his mind whether the rules were 
a good idea but wondered whether the firm's employees would find the extra red 
tape they required frustratingly slow. "Will some investment bankers decide 
that life is just easier at the firm across the street? I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel officials have said they believe the terms will not be burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
Another securities lawyer familiar with the deal said that despite the seeming 
complexity of the terms, the settlement "probably won't be as draconian as it 
looks." Depending on their inclinations, "these investigators and watchdogs 
could get in everybody's way all the time, or they could be invisible, despite 
all the complicated terminology here," he said.

DOW JUMPS 41.06 AS CONCERNS OVER INFLATION SUBSIDE 
</P>

<P>
The stock market ran up its sharpest gain in nearly six months Friday, inspired 
by an apparent easing of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials jumped 41.06 to 2,337.06 for its best 
single-day showing since it rose 43.92 points last Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The increase allowed the index to end the week with a net gain of 32.26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,074 up, 404 down and 474 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the Big Board floor was 169.78 million shares, up from 141.59 million 
in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 201.10 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of finished goods 
rose just 0.4% in March, compared to 1% increases in each of the two preceding 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst fears that some market observers had expressed regarding the 
possibility of a big increase in the producer price index were soundly 
refuted," said Marshall B. Front, economist at the Chicago investment and 
mutual fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, International Business Machines reported first-quarter earnings of 
$1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing in light of IBM's 
warning a few weeks ago that its results this year were not likely to live up 
to some of the most optimistic estimates in the financial world. IBM shares 
gained 1 5/8 to 110 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce Department reported 
that the nation's trade deficit widened to $10.5 billion in February, and the 
Federal Reserve said industrial production was unchanged in March from the 
month before. Both numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings for the first 
quarter Thursday, rose 1 3/4 to 47 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included Merck, up 1 1/2 at 67 1/4; 
McDonald's, up 1 3/8 at 53 3/4; Philip Morris, up 2 1/8 at 119 5/8; Coca-Cola, 
up 1 3/8 at 52, and Du Pont, up 2 1/2 at 106 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices wandered to a higher close Friday, while the dollar 
firmed in a last-minute rally after an otherwise listless day ahead of the 
release of key U.S. economic statistics. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei index rose 86.50 points to 
close at 33,150.44 in the thinnest trading in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed firm after a string of economic data from both sides 
of the Atlantic that were close to market expectations, dealers said. The 
Financial Times 100-share index closed 24.9 points higher at 2,053.6, with 593 
million shares changing hands.

SAVERS TAKE SEIZURE OF LINCOLN CALMLY; 
</P>
<P>
BUT INVESTORS IN PARENT'S BONDS SEE LITTLE HOPE OF REPAYMENT 
</P>

It didn't seem to matter much that the federal government is already feeling 
the strain of bailing out the nation's troubled savings and loans -- a project 
that has already cost $40 billion and makes banking experts nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence reigned Friday, for the most part, among customers at Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. after the 7 a.m. seizure of the troubled Irvine 
institution by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"I have complete trust in the federal government," declared one Irvine customer 
as he conducted business at Lincoln's Barranca Parkway branch. "I can't believe 
the U.S. government will run out of money." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln and its 29 branch offices in Southern California were placed in 
conservatorship Friday on grounds that the institution's assets had been 
substantially dissipated and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
But while Federal Home Loan Bank Board officials stationed at various Lincoln 
branches Friday said business volume was heavier than normal in the morning, 
there were apparently no runs on deposits and no panic by customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of telephone calls in the morning, but it had all died down by 
noon," said David Loveday, a spokesman for the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits at such S&amp;Ls. Loveday was 
camped out at Lincoln's headquarters branch in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Plan to Switch 
</P>
<P>
Not that the seizure, in the wake of the bankruptcy filing Thursday by 
Lincoln's owner American Continental Corp., didn't have some fallout among 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan on withdrawing all my money from this bank and finding a new one," said 
Lisa Spielmann of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But Louise Jacobs of Santa Ana was nonchalant as she left the S&amp;L's Santa 
Ana office: "I hadn't thought much about it. I don't have that much money in 
here, so I don't feel like I have a lot to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Frueh, an Irvine customer of the troubled S&amp;L, said she is 
vacillating about her family's Lincoln account. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep trying to decide whether to close our account or not," Frueh said. "I 
don't know what to think. We just have a checking account here. If it was a 
savings account, I would have pulled it out already." 
</P>
<P>
Investors in American Continental -- many of whom are customers at Lincoln -- 
were far more vulnerable. American Continental's petition under the Chapter 11 
bankruptcy laws jeopardized the holdings of some 12,000 Southland investors who 
own about $200 million in American Continental debt. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a situation where the tens of thousands of people who own debentures 
have nowhere to turn," said one investor and depositor who asked that his name 
not be used. "This (the debentures) is an uninsured product that has no 
backing" beyond the implied backing supplied by Lincoln, which is now in 
serious financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Were Stopped 
</P>
<P>
Much of the American Continental debt was sold in small denomination bonds to 
customers of Lincoln's branches in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those bonds were sold through American Continental desks stationed in 
Lincoln offices until the state regulators ordered Lincoln to stop the practice 
last year. State law prohibits an S&amp;L from selling the corporate debt of 
its parent. 
</P>
<P>
Jean and Donald Bowman invested $120,000 in American Continental bonds -- money 
that she fears she'll never see again. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't too much hope really," Jean Bowman said Friday. "This is not my 
life savings. It's just a portion, but it's enough to sting." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if the Bowmans were entirely unsophisticated investors. Don Bowman 
had read American's bulky prospectus and said it looked very safe, Jean Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said sales representatives at the Lincoln branch where the Bowmans invested 
an initial $20,000 told them that American Continental Chairman Charles H. 
Keating Jr. had "one of the most successful private enterprises in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
"They implied that everything he touched was very safe, and that's what I fell 
for," said Jean Bowman, who lives in the San Fernando Valley. "They said what 
good condition Lincoln was in. They weren't high pressure, but they made you 
feel like you were very safe. They were very sweet."

New York Times Co.: The diversified media and forest products company reported 
first-quarter profit of $35.5 million, down 26% from a year ago. Revenue held 
steady at $423 million. The results included higher local advertising revenues 
at television stations in the Broadcasting/Information Services Group but lower 
advertising volume at its namesake newspaper and a decline in Magazine Group 
earnings due in part to development costs related to Snow Country, which began 
publication in the third quarter of 1988.

Time Inc: The New York-based diversified publishing and media firm said its 
first-quarter profit tumbled 26% to $49 million due to a 7% drop in operating 
earnings from its magazines, heavier interest expenses and costs related to its 
pending merger with Warner Communications. Revenue rose 7% to $1.14 billion. 
The revenue increase, due mainly to strong circulation at Sports Illustrated 
and People, were more than offset by higher print order expenses.

The production of Britain's economic statistics, notorious for major errors 
over the past year, is being reorganized, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Much information has been misleading. In the third quarter of last year, when 
the government was raising interest rates to cool an expanding economy, the 
gross domestic product figures showed a sharp fall in the value of goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization will give a bigger role to an enlarged Central Statistical 
Office. The agency will report to Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: GROWN-UP HEADACHES CAN SPRING FROM THE IRS' NEW

QUESTION: Is there any way around this "kiddie tax" hit that our family is 
about to take? Our 7-year-old son received about $5,000 last year from 
interest, dividends and the sale of some stock. His tax bill is in excess of 
$1,000 to the federal government alone! In the past, my wife and I have 
declared him as a dependent, but we are wondering about the wisdom of this, 
given his new tax status. Why couldn't we drop him as a dependent and let him 
take his $1,950 personal exemption on his own tax return? -- S. Q.

ANSWER: The reason is quite simple: The Internal Revenue Service thought of 
this first and made some initial moves to eliminate this possible loophole. 
According to our tax experts, the IRS hasn't issued any explicit rules and 
regulations on the maneuver you are suggesting -- yet. But many tax experts 
believe that the government made its intent clear when it said an individual 
eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return may not 
claim his own exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I need help. We are in our early 50s and earn a total of 
about $100,000 per year. We have at least $80,000 of equity in our home and 
another $35,000 in retirement accounts. Yet we couldn't put our hands on $1,000 
in cash without borrowing it. We have about $40,000 in consumer debt on which 
we pay interest ranging from 14% to 19.8%. Should we tap the equity in our home 
and pay off those bills? The monthly payments on these obligations leave us 
little room for anything but necessities. We are in the 33% tax bracket with no 
deductions except our mortgage interest. -- L. O. 
</P>
<P>
A: You have described your problem -- and proposed solution -- quite well. The 
financial planners we consulted agree that your idea to borrow against the 
equity in your house to pay off your consumer debt is a sound one. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a brief rundown of their reasoning: Given your age, and the fact that 
you have more than 10 years of full earning power ahead of you, a home equity 
loan makes perfect sense. The interest on the equity loan will be fully 
deductible and the rate is sure to be lower than the 14% to 19.8% that you are 
paying on your consumer debt. So you would be exchanging fully deductible debt 
payments for payments whose deductibility is gradually being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that you may well have more money on which to live if you 
refinance your debt as you propose. Of course, now it's up to you to make sure 
that you don't get into the same mess again. Remember, you can only spend your 
home equity once. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last week, you answered a letter from someone who has accumulated $265,000 
in an individual retirement account. Can you explain to me by what financial 
legerdemain one can amass an IRA amounting to this large a figure? I did not 
think these accounts had been around long enough, nor permitted contributions 
large enough to accumulate such an amount. -- B. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: You are not alone. We heard from more than one reader about this seemingly 
huge IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Although we can't say for sure how this particular reader accumulated a 
$265,000 IRA, our best guess would be that he rolled over a lump-sum 
distribution from one or more pension plans into one or more IRA accounts. 
These moves are allowed by law and are considered one of the best ways workers 
can protect the tax-deferred status of their pension funds when they leave an 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
Further, although you are probably well aware that Congress abolished the law 
that had allowed all workers to set aside $2,000 a year in an IRA on a 
tax-deferred basis, you may not know that you can still contribute to an IRA -- 
just without most of the tax benefits. Workers who are covered by pension plans 
or do not meet the income limits for a tax-deferred IRA account may still make 
annual contributions of up to $2,000, or $2,250 if the worker's spouse is not 
employed. These contributions are not tax-deferred. However, the interest 
generated in the IRA accounts is.

Environmentalists bought off $9 million of Ecuador's debt on in the largest 
"debt for nature swap" ever signed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy will 
buy from American Express Co. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. $9 million of 
Ecuador's debt at a discount of 11.875 cents on the dollar, putting the total 
cost to the group at $1.07 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank debt will be converted, one-for-one, by the Ecuador Central 
Bank into local currency bonds that will be spent for conserving Ecuador's 
dwindling rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Debt becomes not so much a burden as an opportunity to kill two birds with one 
stone -- debt and conservation," said Sen. Robert Kasten, a Wisconsin 
Republican who is co-sponsoring a bill that would expand debt-for-nature swaps.

INMATES LIKE 'CREATURE' MAKE PRISON HISTORY IN 3 ONE-ACT PLAYS

Actors come in all sizes, shapes and guises. 
</P>
<P>
Director Spike Sorrentino recalls his first encounter with a major cast member 
in the production of "Inside Out," opening tonight at the Lyceum Space. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrentino was "auditioning" at a local institution, the R. J. Donovan 
Correctional Facility, also known as the Rock Mountain medium-security prison 
near Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"This huge, very large man comes in and puts out this great big paw and says, 
'Hello. My name is Creature.' " Sorrentino warily grasped the man's hand. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, Creature -- that's what he likes to be called -- turned out to 
be "quite a find, a fine actor," Sorrentino said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with Creature was not with learning his lines, but in 
finding the Triple X shirts to costume him for one of the title roles in Israel 
Horovitz's parable "Rats," and for the walk-on part in Christopher R's "The 
Scam." 
</P>
<P>
Creature and five of his co-prisoners are about to make prison history with 
today's 8 p.m. performance and Sunday's 7 p.m. performance of "Inside Out," 
three one-act plays, in a benefit for the Crime Victims Fund. "Inside Out" 
marks the first time California prisoners have performed a play outside of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken something from the community," said David, one of the inmate 
actors participating in the state's Arts-in-Corrections Program. "This gives me 
a chance to give something back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
David, whos face looks naturally fierce, has shoulder-length black hair, 
numerous tattoos and a husky build, the result of hours spent pumping iron in 
the prison yard. He has served 8 1/2 years behind bars, he said, including time 
at five other prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other inmates who received special clearance to perform on the 
outside, David is a minimum-security prisoner. Most of the men chosen will 
complete their two-year terms within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisons used to try rehabilitation," David said. "Now it's just warehousing. 
It's not doing no good, being locked up. You have no values when you get out. 
The programs they do have like this are very limited. This brings values back." 
</P>
<P>
David is impressed by the message of the play Sorrentino has cast him in. In 
"Rats," he plays a rat who has intruded into the home of another, played by 
Creature. During rehearsal, the two lock in a muscle-bulging, realistic-looking 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The value part of the story has to do with getting somewhere," David said. 
"Not just giving up, but fighting to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mendoza of Pacoima tried out for the acting program because "I've always 
had an interest in music and entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza plays a monster in "The Actor and the Invader" by Robert Patrick and a 
baby in "Rats." As a cast member, he said, he has learned to work with other 
convicts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to work together to do the play. I had a little problem with one of 
the people. I've been trying hard to learn the part. He sees that, and he likes 
that, and we're working together." 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part of acting in a play is taking the kidding from other 
prisoners, said Mendoza, who wears a diaper for his role as a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in this prison, you can't let it get to you," he said. "People say, 
'Agh, a play is stupid.' I've put in a lot of work in this play. I don't let 
them get to me." 
</P>
<P>
Through Sorrentino, Mendoza has discovered other plays, such as David Mamet's 
tough-guy "American Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
"I know those kinds of characters," Mendoza said. "That's something I'd like to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Sorrentino chose the three one-acts rather than an eight-week acting course 
because "you can't go to your cell and act. If they're doing a poetry or 
drawing course, they can do that in their cell." 
</P>
<P>
But inmates can go to their cells and memorize lines in a play. Outside of the 
eight hours spent each day at manual labor, they've got nothing but time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring and drab in prisons," Sorrentino said. "This program gives a 
chance to be a little more colorful, to laugh a bit. It gives them a chance to 
talk for a few hours with someone from the outside other than a guard. One of 
the biggest things down there is to pump iron. But that's not everybody's cup 
of tea." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, inmates under Sorrentino's direction produced a Christmas musical 
video that was broadcast on the prison's closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sorrentino does not have to worry about Hollywood stealing his actors 
with more lucrative offers, prison does have its peculiarities. A month before 
opening night, a member of the cast broke a prison regulation and was taken out 
of the program. Another inmate volunteered for the role, and the show went on. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the men are savvy and bright, Sorrentino said. And they are 
surprisingly good actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Creature is so big, and yet he shows a great vulnerability. From the 
beginning, he had a clear view of where his character should go, and he went 
there." 
</P>
<P>
A human mountain with a shaved head and a bushy beard, Creature said he has 
always been a drama fan. While a student at Hoover High School, he played in a 
takeoff of "Hair." 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest part is going over the lines," Creature said. "Reading them over 
and over and trying to work out the nuances, the inflections of the character. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably what I've enjoyed the most is reading it over and over again, 
realizing you're finally coming to terms with the character you're taking from 
this script. It's rewarding, you know." 
</P>
<P>
For 21-year old Scott Ferrell, who plays in "The Scam," acting has meant 
"learning not to be afraid to express myself in front of people. At one time 
that was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrell has less than a month before he gets out of prison, and he counts 
himself lucky for having the chance to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to try something like this," he said. "I think everybody 
has."

0.4% WHOLESALE PRICE RISE STILLS INFLATION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wholesale prices advanced a modest 0.4% in March, the Labor Department said 
Friday, calming inflation fears and buoying financial markets after two 
consecutive months of unexpectedly large increases. 
</P>
<P>
The gain in the producer price index for finished goods followed increases of 
1% in both January and February. The combined rise for the first quarter 
represents an annual wholesale inflation rate of 10.1%, well above the 4.2% 
rate for the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Economists welcomed the March figures as a respite from the big increases of 
January and February, which had fueled fears that inflation was spiraling out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
The report was greeted with enthusiasm on the financial markets, where interest 
rates slackened and stock prices soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
gained 41.06 points Friday to close at 2337.06. That was the Dow's best daily 
gain since last Oct. 20. (Details in Business, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Deficit Rises 
</P>
<P>
The federal government announced also Friday that the nation's merchandise 
trade deficit rose to $10.5 billion in February from a revised $8.7 billion in 
January, but that report appeared to have little effect on the financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with reports of softening retail sales and declining industrial 
production, the producer price figures indicate that the economy is slowing 
just enough to make inflation appear more manageable, said Roger Brinner of 
Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is still here as a problem," Brinner said, "but not a hysterical 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
The March rise in the wholesale index was paced by food and energy prices, 
which rose 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. The increase for all other finished 
goods was a much more moderate 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Finished energy goods, including gasoline, advanced at a whopping 38.3% annual 
rate during the first quarter, compared to a 7% rate of decline last year. 
</P>
<P>
Brinner noted that producer price inflation has been running at an annual rate 
of 5.6% over the last 12 months, or 4.5% excluding volatile food and energy 
costs. "Both those rates are in the Federal Reserve's discomfort zone," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates in recent months in an 
effort to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures. Some economists 
have feared that the Fed's anti-inflation campaign could push the country into 
a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the generally favorable response to the March figures, the wholesale 
inflation record so far this year has been dismal, with double-digit annual 
rates at virtually every stage of the production chain. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of raw materials, for example, jumped 2.3% in March. During the first 
three months of 1989, prices of crude goods have advanced at an annual rate of 
27%, driven by an even more frightening 45.1% annual increase for crude energy 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1988, raw material prices were essentially flat, 
and crude energy prices fell at an annual rate of 24.1% 
</P>
<P>
"These crude numbers concern us terribly," said Dirk Van Dongen, president of 
the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. "These inevitably work their way 
into the system. Sooner or later, that water boiling at the bottom of the pot 
gets to the top." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York, 
noted that about four-fifths of all reporting industries registered price 
increases for finished goods at less than the 0.4% rate for all wholesale 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Fuel Costs Seen 
</P>
<P>
Although March's moderate figures brought "a sigh of relief" after the big 
gains in January and February, Kellner warned that energy prices would rise 
even higher in April's wholesale price index. Petroleum prices have increased 
sharply in recent weeks in response to the Alaska oil spill and generally tight 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.5 of a point to 112.2 in 
March from a base of 100 in 1982. That means a cross section of finished goods 
costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $112.20 last month.

'SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG'; 
</P>
<P>
HOW CONCERNED WORKERS BLEW WHISTLE ON NORTHROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On her very first day at Northrop's Western Services Department in El Monte, 
which produced guidance devices for nuclear-armed cruise missiles, Florence 
Castaneda said she knew that "something was terribly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In an electronics "clean room," Northrop employees were smoking cigarettes, 
boiling water for soup, eating lunch at their work stations and watching soap 
operas on a television set mounted on the supervisor's desk, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda noticed that instead of using industrial solvents to clean and 
prepare circuit boards for soldering, workers were using a jar of Tarn-X, a 
retail brand of polish for silverware. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a price tag on it from Thrifty Drug Store," she recalled. "I hadn't 
seen this kind of work being done in the aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
A little more than three years after starting her job, Castaneda blew the 
whistle on Northrop and played an important role in helping other Northrop 
workers get in touch with Air Force officials. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of their efforts, a federal indictment was filed earlier this week, 
charging their former supervisor, Charles Gonsalves, with criminal fraud. Tests 
were allegedly faked and in some cases not performed at all on cruise missile 
guidance systems and on stabilization systems for Marine Corps jet fighters, 
the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Gonsalves, criminal charges were filed against Northrop Corp. itself, 
two high-ranking executives and two other supervisors. Northrop has said the 
criminal charges against it and two current executives are "unwarranted," but 
the firm has acknowledged that problems existed at the plant and that Gonsalves 
and three other employees have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, the company shut down the operation. It has since cooperated 
with federal investigators, according to Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiny Outpost 
</P>
<P>
The El Monte plant was just a tiny Northrop outpost, employing about 30 workers 
and reporting to a parent organization in Newton, Mass. In the operation of the 
multibillion-dollar corporation, Western Services Department somehow fell 
between the cracks. Not only was the plant manager, Gonsalves, charged with 
fraud, but the factory's quality assurance supervisor and its chief engineer 
were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to tell me that I was a small person and that nobody would listen 
to me," Castaneda said in an interview this week. It was Castaneda and her 
fellow workers, Leocadio Barajas and Patricia Meyer, who alerted the government 
to conditions at Northrop's Western Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other defense industry whistle-blowers, Castaneda has no financial 
stake in any False Claims Act law suits, which individuals can bring on behalf 
of the government and share in the damages. She was motivated by a sense of 
concern over "those nuclear missiles out there" that she always worried "could 
be the start of World War III." 
</P>
<P>
The recent indictments and the Air Force's examination of the missiles for 
potential flaws have left her with little sense of vindication. The battle with 
defense industry giant Northrop, she said, has left her alienated and has 
destroyed her faith in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda's daughter contacted The Times last month, saying that somebody 
should tell the story of how much trouble her mother and other Northrop workers 
had in simply blowing the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the FBI in November, 1986. They told me I sounded like a disgruntled 
employee and that it was a case of sour grapes," Castaneda recalled. (Justice 
Department officials declined to comment on Castaneda.) 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a nephew in the Air National Guard arranged a meeting with Air 
Force agents from the Office of Special Investigations that anybody would 
listen to her story. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, an OSI agent came to her home in Baldwin Park and met with 
Castaneda and fellow workers Barajas and Meyer. In an interview in August, 
1987, Barajas confirmed that it was Castaneda who arranged the initial 
interview with Air Force officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Florence had earlier attempted to contact Northrop, but nothing ever 
happened," Barajas said. "Pat Meyer and Florence called back east to Precision 
Products Division (the corporate parent of Western Services Department) to say 
problems were going on. After that, absolutely nothing was done. It disgusted 
everybody. We knew that if we tried to complain, nothing would be done." 
</P>
<P>
Barajas said he wrote an anonymous letter to corporate executives at Northrop, 
but the letter eventually ended up back with Gonsalves. "He posted it on the 
bulletin board to tell everybody that it wouldn't do any good to complain. He 
laughed at it. He said, 'Whatever fool tried it didn't get anywhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the investigation was launched in 1987, however, government agents met 
with the employees once every other week at Barajas' house. Barajas provided 
investigators with a computer tape used to falsify tests on cruise missile 
guidance systems built at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the spring of 1987, the FBI asked permission to wire Barajas 
for sound to collect evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't too happy," he recalled in the 1987 interview. "This tape recorder 
was really big and bulky and it showed through my shirt. I said, 'This is the 
FBI's modern technology?' I wished I had gone to Radio Shack and bought my own 
tape recorder." 
</P>
<P>
He then went to Gonsalves and said he had told the FBI that the company was 
falsifying tests on the missile guidance units, Barajas said in the 1987 
interview. On July 14, 1987, Barajas was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Barajas and Meyer eventually allied themselves with attorney Herbert Hafif of 
Claremont and filed a suit against Northrop, charging that the firm had 
defrauded the government by improperly testing the missile components. The 
Justice Department joined that suit last month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Castaneda waged her own battle against Gonsalves and the company. 
She started her job at Northrop on Oct. 23, 1983, as a senior 
assembler/technician. She was certified by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration for a variety of electronics work, including soldering and 
assembly. The certifications were granted by Caltech's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory and by three defense contractors, Loral, Perkin-Elmer and Honeywell. 
</P>
<P>
Everything about the El Monte operation was out of the mainstream of the 
aerospace industry, she said. For example, components such as wires did not 
have "date codes," which are standard in the aerospace industry to provide for 
traceability. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to raise concerns," Castaneda said, "Mr. Gonsalves told me that 
if I just did my work like everybody else, we would get along. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were in with the crowd, you could do whatever you wanted," she said. 
"That meant going out to the track to place bets at lunch, coming to work 
intoxicated or anything else you wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Mr. Gonsalves' intent to keep everything quiet. It was his own 
operation, his own dynasty," she added. "When DCAS (the Defense Contract 
Administration Service) would come in, Miss (Cheryl) Hannan would intimidate 
them." 
</P>
<P>
(Hannan was a quality assurance supervisor at the operation and was one of the 
former Northrop officials indicted earlier this week.) 
</P>
<P>
When Northrop shut down the El Monte facility in December, 1987, it fired 
Gonsalves, Hannan and the two others. The company has acknowledged that the 
operation was not following company procedures. Gonsalves and Hannan could not 
be reached for comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before the investigations panel of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee last year, Northrop Vice Chairman Frank W. Lynch testified that 
Gonsalves' work "was inadequate or totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable 
management performance." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch testified that Northrop management learned of the problems at Western 
Services Department from the government, which had learned about them from the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why the employees went to the government instead of to Northrop 
management, Lynch testified: "Well, unfortunately, sir, the manager of the 
plant was involved in the decision to falsify or alter or not perform the 
tests. So, this was being done with the knowledge of and the direction of the 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would -- if I were in that situation -- I don't think I would 
go to that individual . . . " he added. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1984, Castaneda was injured in a fall at work. While recovering, she 
began to complain about conditions at the plant to several Northrop officials. 
She said one official in the corporate medical department even came to her home 
to listen to some of her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Barajas and Castaneda tried to contact the parent organization of the El Monte 
operation, the Precision Products Division in Newton, Mass. But, as hourly 
production workers, they apparently did not know the right people to talk to, 
they said, or the officials they reached did not want to respond. Again, 
nothing resulted from their efforts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, Castaneda went on temporary disability, a result of reinjuring 
her back and of stress, she said. By then, Northrop had grown so concerned 
about her allegations that it assigned a psychologist to her case through its 
insurance adjuster, Industrial Indemnity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The psychologist, Cherry Ann Clark, visited her at home three times a week for 
two hours each time for several months. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me to forgive Northrop and to forgive Mr. Gonsalves -- to ask God to 
forgive them -- and to just go back to work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"She would take me to her home or take me to a nice restaurant. When I would 
cry, she would cry," Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
"She got very friendly with my family," she said. "She sent my daughter 
birthday cards. She hired my son to do some work around her house." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, of San Marino, declined to comment on those statements, saying that her 
relationship with Castaneda was confidential. She confirmed, however, that she 
was assigned to some Northrop employee cases through Industrial Indemnity. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Clark also met with Barajas, Meyer and Castaneda together to give 
them the same message about forgiving the company, Castaneda said. Ultimately, 
Castaneda said, she grew disenchanted with the psychologist. One day, she 
recalled, while talking to Clark in the psychologist's Lincoln Continental, she 
opened the door of the parked car and got out. 
</P>
<P>
"She was crying, begging me to get back in," Castaneda recalled. "I didn't 
retain a lawyer until that October, when Northrop didn't send me a (disability) 
check and I couldn't pay the rent." Northrop reinstated some of the disability 
benefits, after Castaneda's attorney intervened. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Castaneda, a Potawatomi Indian, considered moving back to the 
reservation where she grew up. But she decided against it when her children 
insisted that she continue her battle to expose the problems at Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda left Northrop in April, 1987. Since then, she has attended a business 
school to study automated accounting and was graduated several weeks ago. She 
has begun to look for a job but has avoided the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
"When I can trust the system, I might try it again," she said.

TRASH RECYCLING SOUGHT TO EASE PRESSURE ON LANDFILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, reviving a proposal that once cost a predecessor his job, 
announced a comprehensive trash recycling program Friday aimed at cutting by 
nearly half the amount of garbage destined for landfills. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted by the City Council, as expected, the plan would require residents 
of all 720,000 houses and small apartment buildings in the city to put their 
glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans, newspaper and yard wastes into 
separate containers for garbage collection. A recycling program for businesses 
and for buildings of six or more residential units will be proposed later. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing less than an environmental vision of the future -- a time not 
long from now when the people of this city will regard their trash as a 
resource to be conserved and reused," Bradley said in announcing the plan, 
which could begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, created by a panel of city officials and outside consultants 
during the last nine months, comes at a time when the city is running out of 
room to dump its trash. 
</P>
<P>
The city's primary landfill in Lopez Canyon is scheduled to close in 1992. A 
proposal to stretch its capacity and keep it open through 2005 is being fought 
by residents in its San Fernando Valley neighborhood. And privately owned 
landfills that would accept the city's trash are scarce and expensive, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Key City Council members, who said they had been anticipating the recycling 
proposal, said they think it will be approved although some struggle is likely 
over how to pay for its roughly $33 million yearly cost. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget proposal announced Thursday, the mayor proposed a trash 
collection fee and suggested it could be increased later to pay for "other 
solid waste programs." 
</P>
<P>
"Over my dead body" was Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's response to the fee 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But the recycling program itself received immediate, enthusiastic support. 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who will steer the recycling program through the 
council and who joined Bradley at a City Hall news conference to announce it, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Want a Better City' 
</P>
<P>
"It's sending a clear message that the people of Los Angeles want to move 
forward. . . . We want a better city . . . and we're going to do it in a 
cost-efficient way," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro said the council would likely support the 
mandatory program, as it has backed other legislation aimed at controlling 
growth of landfills. Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district contains the 
Lopez Canyon landfill and who has been a leader on waste management issues, 
said the proposal is "long overdue. . . . Recycling is a must." 
</P>
<P>
Limited recycling projects are already in the works in several council 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Even former Mayor Sam Yorty, who was swept into office in 1961 in part for his 
promise to drop then-Mayor Norris Poulson's program of mandatory separation of 
recyclable trash, said in an interview Friday that Bradley's plan is "much more 
workable" than the one he had campaigned against. 
</P>
<P>
For several years beginning in the 1950s, residents were required to save cans 
for a once-a-month-pickup. Trash that was not properly separated was left at 
the curb. At the time, Yorty called the separation requirement "coercion 
against the housewives of this city." 
</P>
<P>
While generally approving of Bradley's proposal, Yorty could not resist taking 
a poke at his old rival: Why, Yorty wondered, didn't the mayor unveil his plan 
-- and accompanying price tag -- before he was reelected Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, each household would be given three containers: one 12- to 
14-gallon plastic rectangular box for aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles, 
one 60- or 90-gallon container for yard debris and one 60- or 90-gallon 
container for all other household garbage that is not recycleable. The larger 
containers would be suitable for automatic collection by specialized trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, to be recycled, would be stacked on top of the can-and-bottle bin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once-a-Week Pickups 
</P>
<P>
Pickups would continue to be once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Though separation of materials would be mandatory, homeowners would retain the 
right to save recyclable materials for private sale. Scavenging would be 
illegal on trash pickup days only. 
</P>
<P>
About 90,000 households would begin recycling all but the yard wastes as early 
as July. The rest of the households would be phased in within three years. 
Recycling of yard waste would be added two years later. 
</P>
<P>
During the first five years the program would cost about $46 million a year, 
with an estimated $13 million earned back through the sale of recyclable 
material and reduced landfill costs. The annual cost could balloon to $72 
million a year during the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the financing programs being explored by a special mayoral task force is 
a $3.66 per household per month fee to be levied against taxpayers, according 
to Ed Avila, chairman of the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said it may be possible to work the added recycling costs into the 
general budget, though he was not able to identify what programs would have to 
be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always paying for it in one way or another," Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the expenses are the replacement of 400 trash trucks with more modern, 
automated vehicles, and the purchase of millions of recycling bins for 
distribution to residents. The Sanitation Department would add 69 staff 
positions to oversee the program. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there are some risks that the program could cost much more than 
projected. Markets for recycled materials could dry up or become very 
competitive and that could drive prices down, they said. And as yet, there is 
no workable market for composting material, which officials hope to create with 
recycled yard trash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Acceptance 
</P>
<P>
Avila said public acceptance remains the stumbling block to mandatory 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of the elevation of public awareness and willingness to 
participate," he said. Until two to three years ago, people balked at the idea 
of having to separate their garbage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long in coming, but it's here now," Avila said. "History is 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Tobia, one of the private consultants who worked with the city to 
formulate the plans, said public opinion surveys showed that 80% of Los Angeles 
residents would cooperate. Only 6% indicated they would likely not cooperate 
under any circumstances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, cities with similar programs -- including Santa Monica, Glendale, 
Burbank, and Pasadena -- report good public cooperation, Tobia said.

DEBATE OVER LOBBYING;

<P>
HALLS OF IVY RESEARCH THE PORK BARREL 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the nation's most prestigious institutions of higher learning, it is a most 
unseemly row. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Pennsylvania, diving head first into the world of pork-barrel 
politics, has broken ranks with some of its brethren and hired a high-powered 
Washington lobbyist to seek funds from Congress to help build an engineering 
and chemistry complex on its Philadelphia campus. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, presidents of other universities have been phoning Sheldon 
Hackney, Penn's president, to make him change his mind. They have "pressed very 
hard," Hackney acknowledged, which in the understated language of academia 
suggests serious pressure indeed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convinced of Necessity 
</P>
<P>
So far, Hackney is standing pat. He is convinced that, if Penn keeps ranks with 
other elite universities that refuse earmarked funds from Congress for 
scientific buildings, it will never get its $70-million engineering-chemistry 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Hackney appears to be at the center of an esoteric academic 
squabble over how academia should do business in Washington. In fact, however, 
Hackney and his critics are grappling with two of the most difficult issues 
that have arisen in American education: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should government support for science be concentrated narrowly, among those 
doing the very best work in a particular field? Or should it be spread more 
broadly and, in the proponents' view, more democratically, so that smaller and 
poorer schools can get a share of federal largess? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should scientists determine which schools are best equipped to use scarce 
federal resources? Or should the decisions be left to politicians, who may be 
less concerned with the national interest than with the parochial concerns of 
their congressional districts? 
</P>
<P>
Historically, universities have favored letting scientists make the decisions 
about what buildings should be built with federal aid, even if that meant only 
the most elite institutions benefitted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle May Be Lost 
</P>
<P>
But some prestigious universities, including Columbia and Tulane, have broken 
ranks before. Now Penn's defection could signal the end of a losing struggle to 
prevent wholesale lobbying of Congress for funds for scientific buildings. 
</P>
<P>
That would be just fine with John Silber, the president of Boston University 
and one of the first academics to seek funds for buildings through a Washington 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Silber looks on the Penn decision as evidence that the elite universities "have 
lost the war" after proving themselves "selfish, hypocritical and arrogant in 
telling Congress not to do what it wants to do." In Silber's view, only 
Congress can break the stranglehold of a few elite universities on scientific 
research in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the universities condemned by Silber as elite dismiss funds 
earmarked by Congress for specific projects as "academic pork barrel" and warn 
that America's scientific standing could falter under its weight. 
</P>
<P>
They are especially alarmed by Penn's decision to retain Gerald Cassidy, the 
Washington lobbyist who also represents Boston University and other schools, to 
plead the case for its engineering-chemistry facility. Cassidy's firm already 
has managed to win a procession of congressional grants for its clients. 
</P>
<P>
Those who oppose Penn's decision have visions of academic grants being doled 
out in the same way as defense contracts, to institutions that happen to be in 
the districts of key congressional committee chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California, among others, has refused to seek earmarked funds 
from Congress, even though it keeps a small staff in Washington to deal with 
local congressmen and federal education agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibility of Change 
</P>
<P>
"But no one wants to be the last bastion of purity in a world gone crazy," said 
Paul Sweet, the head of the university's Washington office. "If everyone is 
doing it, we will do it too." 
</P>
<P>
Much may depend on the deliberations of the Assn. of American Universities, an 
organization of 57 influential institutions, including Penn and its critics, 
that will begin a three-day annual meeting in Washington on Sunday. The Penn 
dispute will be high on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government once had an extensive program of supporting the 
construction of scientific buildings on university campuses, but it had died by 
the early 1970s. So some universities, unable to raise funds any other way, 
retained Cassidy to approach powerful congressmen for help in building or 
modernizing scientific buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the congressmen cooperated by including funds for specific scientific 
facilities in spending legislation. The total of such grants rose from $46 
million in 1984 to $225 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To some of the elite universities, this procedure dangerously short-circuited 
the "peer review" system, the basis for distributing the bulk of federal 
research grants and, until recently, funds for scientific buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under peer review, federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation 
award grants on the basis of recommendations from committees of scientists -- 
the peers of those who are applying for the funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Problem Cited 
</P>
<P>
That system, NSF Director Erich Bloch said in a recent speech, "is the only 
mechanism that offers reasonable assurances that we will spend our money wisely 
. . . . Shortcuts around merit review are only symptomatic of a larger problem 
in our society, which is our relentless focus on near-term results rather than 
on long-term payoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Boston University's Silber scoffs at that view. The critics of allowing 
Congress to earmark the destination of science aid, he says, are merely trying 
to hang on to a system that rewards them with most of the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have the lion's share of research funds do not want any new boys 
getting into the old boys' club," he said. "It's an old boys' club, and new 
boys need not apply." 
</P>
<P>
Silber said that Cassidy helped Boston University obtain $19 million from 
Congress for a science center and $8.5 million for a biology and physics 
laboratory. Before construction of those facilities, he said, the university 
had attracted $14 million in federal research grants; since then, it has 
obtained $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Facilities bring in good faculty, who bring in research contracts with peer 
review," he said. "It does not matter where you have good facilities; 
researchers will come. If you put the supercollider project in Timbuktu, all 
the scientists would be rushing to Africa." The superconducting supercollider 
is the $5-billion, high-energy physics facility that the Energy Department has 
decided to locate in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concentration of Funds 
</P>
<P>
Congress' General Accounting Office, suggesting that the elite universities 
dominate research grants, has reported that 20 universities, led by Johns 
Hopkins, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford, received 42% 
of all the federal funds granted for university research in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complain that federal support is concentrated in California and a 
few other states. California, according to the GAO, received 14% of all 
research grants that year -- more, but not a lot more, than its 11% share of 
the national population. 
</P>
<P>
For help in Washington, many of the critics of the traditional means of doling 
out federal aid have turned to the 47-year-old Cassidy, who was the general 
counsel in the 1970s for the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition, whose 
chairman was Sen. George S. McGovern (D-S.D.). 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy started by helping Jean Mayer, a renowned nutritionist who became 
president of Tufts University, obtain $17 million from Congress for a 
veterinary school and a nutrition center in the late 1970s. That launched 
Cassidy on a lucrative career in an area that no other lobbyist was working, 
and he says his firm now represents about 100 clients, no more than half of 
them universities. 
</P>
<P>
The firm insists that it can guide innocent university officials through the 
maze of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to belittle the Midwest. I come from Ohio," said Roy Meyers, 
Cassidy's director of information. "But if you came to Washington from a school 
in Indiana or Ohio or Michigan, you wouldn't know where to begin. In this 
office, we have 200 to 300 years' experience on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
Hackney, Penn's president, seems to agree. "We needed advice," he said. "We 
needed help, and we went to a company in Washington that has a good track 
record. They know the processes how this can be done and whether this can be 
done. They have much more experience than we have." 
</P>
<P>
Hackney's critics fear that Cassidy's success will encourage more and more 
universities to join the bandwagon for earmarked funds from Congress. "What 
really began to change the landscape," said Robert Rosenzweig, president of the 
Assn. of American Universities, "was the discovery that this is a lucrative 
business for lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
The critics say that Cassidy engages in political activities that universities 
would find unseemly. "Schools that would never in a million years think of 
making a political contribution to a congressman can hire Cassidy and let him 
do it for them," said Sweet of the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
According to the records of the Federal Election Commission, which lists only 
contributions of more than $500, Cassidy averaged $15,852 a year in political 
contributions from 1985 to 1988, and his wife averaged $11,650 a year during 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, more than 40 members of the Assn. of American Universities, including 
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the University of California and Penn, voted to refuse 
to accept earmarked funds from Congress for scientific buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they pledged to try to persuade Congress to enact a general program of 
$500 million a year -- without earmarking -- for construction and modernization 
of scientific facilities. In response, Congress agreed last year to authorize a 
limited program for funding scientific facilities, although it has yet to make 
any funds available for the program. 
</P>
<P>
But now the 40-university moratorium is starting to unravel. Duke signed a 
preliminary contract with Cassidy last year but ultimately withdrew. Another 
association member, the University of Nebraska, quietly signed a contract with 
Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
But the real blow came when Penn defected. "It's like a top general defecting 
to the Russians," Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
Hackney conceded that the moratorium is "preferable public policy. But here we 
are two years later and we haven't won the argument with Congress. And my needs 
are even more pressing." 
</P>
<P>
If Penn relied solely on individual and corporate contributions, Hackney said, 
it could expect no more than half of the $70 million needed to build the new 
engineering and chemical building. "The only way to achieve this is through 
some sort of federal support," Hackney said, "and there is no ongoing federal 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Hence Penn signed a contract with Cassidy to determine whether it is feasible 
to seek the needed funds from Congress. Evidently embarrassed by the criticism 
of that decision, Hackney said: "I'm flattered by the notion that Penn is so 
important that, if we do something, everyone will follow." 
</P>
<P>
At the Assn. of American Universities, Rosenzweig is afraid of exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really the first visible institution to have done this in the last 
few years," he said of Penn. "It is a prestigious university. It is Ivy League. 
It appears to give the practice some legitimacy . . . . It isn't a sign of 
victory. I'll tell you that."

SHAMIR REJECTS TRADING LAND FOR PEACE

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he rejects trading land for peace 
despite an earlier government statement that Israel is willing to discuss any 
option with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't accept it. It is not necessary. It is not relevant," he told reporters 
upon his return to Israel from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, 73, described his 10-day U.S. visit as a success and added: "There is 
an understanding between the U.S. and Israel about our four-point peace 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir met last week with President Bush, who supported Shamir's idea for 
elections in the occupied territories but said the United States could not 
accept permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's plan offers elections to choose representatives from the occupied 
territories to negotiate an interim settlement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Several West Bank Palestinians reportedly have offered a counterproposal that 
residents elect members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Palestine 
National Council instead of representatives for talks with Israel.

State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that U.S. Ambassador Jack 
F. Matlock Jr. delivered a letter from Baker to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze outlining U.S. policy in the Middle East and proposing a 
comprehensive discussion of the subject when Baker visits Moscow early next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler declined to go into detail, but another State Department official said 
later that Baker suggested the Soviets should "do their part in moving this 
process forward by urging everyone to keep an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that Syria and the PLO hold an effective veto over West 
Bank and Gaza elections because either one could disrupt the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already urged both Syria and the PLO to refrain from 
blocking the elections. However, U.S. officials believe that the Soviet Union 
has more influence than the United States with the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's opinions carry substantial weight with the PLO because the Soviet 
Union was, for many years, the only superpower to have any sort of friendly 
relationship with the organization. Syria obtains all of its sophisticated arms 
and much of its economic support from the Soviet Union.

Shamir Unveils Plan 
</P>
<P>
Shamir last week unveiled his plan for Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza to elect 
delegates to negotiate with Israel over limited Palestinian self-government. 
The Israeli prime minister said that details of the election would have to be 
worked out later. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Friday, Baker 
described Shamir's proposal as "a positive step worthy of further 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
"In the coming weeks, we will discuss with Israel and the Arabs the details of 
these ideas, how to build on them, and how they fit into the larger picture of 
setting the stage for negotiations," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Shevardnadze, Baker summarized last week's talks by U.S. 
officials with Shamir and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the State 
Department official said. He urged the Soviets to regard the proposed elections 
"as an opportunity to move the peace process forward," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the official said that Baker did not specifically urge the Soviets to 
pressure either Syria or the PLO, the implication was clear. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the official said, Baker chided Moscow for its decision to 
sell sophisticated SU-24 medium-range bombers to Libya, a nation that 
Washington has long accused of supporting international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The bombers, with a combat radius of 800 miles, bring within range targets 
throughout the eastern Mediterranean region, including all of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Baker said that sale was not constructive," the official said.

20 ARABS WOUNDED IN PROTESTS OVER ISRAELI RAID

Army gunfire Friday wounded more than 20 Palestinians in the occupied lands 
during protests of the bloody raid by border police in the West Bank village of 
Nahhalin, Arab hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, police barred some residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 
entering the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site. 
</P>
<P>
The army launched an investigation Friday into the raid before dawn Thursday at 
Nahhalin in which at least four Palestinians were killed and as many as to 20 
were wounded, the national Itim news agency reported. It said two generals were 
leading the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the International Red Cross claimed that as many as six Arabs were 
killed at Nahhalin and accused Israeli paramilitary border police of firing 
"without discrimination and without restraint." 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Meshulam Amit, the head of Israel's paramilitary border police, 
admitted Friday that his men made mistakes at Nahhalin. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt there were faults in Nahhalin. They must be examined and 
conclusions drawn," Amit said in a telephone interview with the Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The border police have recently been given the prime role in raids and riot 
control, with the army working as backup. 
</P>
<P>
At least 11 refugee camps and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip had 
protests or were shut down by general strikes called to protest the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The worst confrontation was in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus. Arab doctors 
said 14 Palestinians there were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the wounded included 
3-year-old Nesien Fayad, who was shot in the left side. 
</P>
<P>
The army confirmed a report of two people wounded in Gaza and said it was 
checking other reports. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Jerusalem took measures to prevent violence at the Al Aqsa Mosque on 
the Temple Mount during Muslim prayers on Friday. A riot occurred there during 
last week's prayers, and at least 2,000 extra police were called in Friday to 
prevent similar violence. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, Israel closed the Magreb Gate, a key passage leading 
to Temple Mount, taking control of the gate away from the Muslim authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that only about 7,000 Muslims attended prayers at Al Aqsa 
Mosque, far fewer than the 30,000 predicted on what was the second Friday of 
the fasting month of Ramadan. Many were kept away by curfews on refugee camps 
and roadblocks outside Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army said a West Bank youth died of a bullet wound sustained in 
clashes with troops in the town of Jenin.

ISRAELI FORCES KEEP MUSLIMS FROM MOSQUE ON TEMPLE MOUNT

Israeli security forces prevented thousands of Muslims from attending Friday 
prayers at the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in a massive show of force to 
thwart rioting at one of Islam's holiest sites. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of disturbances in Jerusalem on Friday, but police fired 
rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse Muslims on the Temple Mount who wanted 
to stay the night Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied territories Friday, soldiers shot and killed an 18-year-old 
Palestinian man during a violent clash in the West Bank town of Nablus, an army 
spokesman said. Palestinian sources said a 3-year-old boy, a 10-year-old boy 
and at least 12 other Palestinians were wounded by Israeli army gunfire in 
scattered disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the intensified security measures, the army clamped curfews on most 
of the Gaza Strip and declared the two largest towns in the West Bank closed 
military zones to discourage more violence following a raid Thursday by 
Israel's paramilitary border police on the village of Nahhalin that left at 
least four Palestinians dead and as many as 20 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
A team of army investigators visited Nahhalin, 6 miles south of Jerusalem, on 
Friday to probe what has been described as one of the worst incidents of the 
16-month-old Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, in a rare public 
statement, Friday condemned police action in the raid, saying people in 
Nahhalin were fired on "without discrimination and without restraint." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross statement said that six were killed and 30 wounded at Nahhalin. 
The Israeli army repeated its finding that four were killed. Palestinians 
sources say one or two more Arabs were killed and buried immediately, but the 
claims could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Meshulam Amit, the commander of the border police, admitted Friday 
that his men made mistakes at Nahhalin, which remained under curfew Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt there were faults at Nahhalin. They must be examined and 
conclusions drawn," Amit said in a telephone interview with the Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers on Friday reported that during the Nahhalin raid, border 
police units in the village and regular army units in area had a sharp 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Citing army sources, the mass-circulation tabloid Hadashot reported: "The 
soldiers demanded the border patrol leave the area, but they refused. The 
exchange turned into a physical clash and even reciprocal stone throwing." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the largest shows of force since the start of the popular revolt 
against Israeli occupation in December, 1987, more than 3,000 police and 
soldiers Friday patrolled Arab East Jerusalem and manned checkpoints on roads 
leading into Jerusalem and at the gates of the walled Old City, where the 
Temple Mount is located. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were determined to prevent a repeat of last week's riot during 
which Muslim demonstrators threw stones at Jews praying at the adjacent Western 
Wall, the most sacred site in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were turned away at the 
Jerusalem city limits and Jerusalem residents who did not live in the Old City 
were barred and told to go to a mosque in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Police said as many as 35,000 worshipers were expected to attend prayers on the 
second Friday of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, but only about 7,000 were 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
As an additional precaution, the Magreb Gate to the Temple Mount near the 
Western Wall was closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Wall was nearly empty of Jews on Friday, although tourists 
continued to visit the area. 
</P>
<P>
The cobblestone alleys around the Temple Mount were filled with riot police 
armed with clubs, tear gas and automatic assault rifles. At the Temple Mount 
gates, police checked identity cards, turning away many young men and holding 
the cards of some who were allowed to enter.

The government of Chad says it thwarted a rebellion against President Hissen 
Habre, and neighboring Sudan said the three leaders of the attempted coup 
escaped to Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
Sudanese soldiers were disarming Chadian troops who had crossed the border, a 
Sudanese official said. 
</P>
<P>
Chad identified the plotters as Hassan Djamous, commander in chief of the armed 
forces; Idriss Debi, his predecessor; and Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat 
Itno. 
</P>
<P>
The government, in a communique released by the Chadian Embassy in Paris, said 
the coup leaders "entered into rebellion against the institutions of the 
republic" on the night of April 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said the armed forces were "ordered to destroy" the plotters and 
"put an end to the rebellion by annihilation." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the fate of the ringleaders, the Chadian Embassy would say only 
that the plot had been uncovered and its authors and accomplices rendered 
harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in N'Djamena, capital of the African nation, said that Itno 
was arrested and that Djamous and Debi had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Itno took a leading role in negotiations that led to the Habre government's 
reconciliation with numerous political opponents who had been engaged in a long 
civil war with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Habre has ruled Chad since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backed government led 
by Goukouni Oueddei.

Greek and U.S. negotiators ended their 16th round of talks on the future of 
American military bases in Greece with "little progress toward a new accord," a 
government spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, who began the most recent round of talks Monday, are trying to 
reach a comprehensive defense and economic cooperation pact that would 
determine the future of four major U.S. military bases and 20 smaller 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the two sides "examined the 
preamble and various aspects of a possible agreement, but there was no notable 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
A five-year accord on the bases expired in December, and the United States has 
a 17-month grace period before the military facilities would have to be 
dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Kostopoulos said talks will resume next month but will be "temporarily 
suspended" in June because of general elections in Greece.

S. AFRICAN IMAGE GAINS FROM NAMIBIA REBELS' MISSTEP

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South African military intelligence detected a buildup of rebel forces across 
the Namibian border with Angola back in January. South Africans monitored 
guerrilla meetings, saw the arrival of fresh uniforms and heard talk of an 
invasion to "finally chase the Boers out." 
</P>
<P>
But when South African officials complained to the world, as they often do, few 
believed them. 
</P>
<P>
Just as South Africa had warned, though, the guerrilla buildup developed into a 
major cross-border incursion by the South-West Africa People's Organization 
(SWAPO), beginning only hours after a U.N. independence plan went into effect 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO's violation of the peace accord shook the world's high regard for the 
liberation movement. But, at the same time, it gave South Africa -- often 
considered the chief destabilizing influence in southern Africa -- a rare 
moment on the diplomatic high ground. 
</P>
<P>
Long accustomed to international scorn, South Africa's white minority-led 
government suddenly has found itself in the world's good graces. SWAPO, with 
U.N. support, had battled for 24 years to end South African rule of this 
territory, sometimes called South-West Africa. But, literally overnight, South 
Africa's troops were fighting SWAPO with U.N. blessing. And, after some initial 
skepticism, the United Nations and Western governments that are often critical 
of South Africa began believing Pretoria's version of events here. 
</P>
<P>
South African officials, in a smug, I-told-you-so mood, have jetted in and out 
of Windhoek, capital of this vast territory, to bask in their new credibility. 
Even though the fighting has diminished and SWAPO insurgents are said to be 
crossing northward back to their refuge in Angola, South Africa has yet to tire 
of reminding foreign journalists that South Africa abided by its agreement to 
follow the U.N. plan for Namibian independence while SWAPO did not. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a responsible government in the world today that does not know 
exactly whatSWAPO has done," South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. (Pik) 
Botha, said recently. "We wish it had never occurred. If the result is that 
SWAPO's leadership pays a heavy price for it, that was not of our doing." 
</P>
<P>
Any threat to SWAPO's image is welcome in Pretoria, where the country that has 
governed Namibia for 74 years fears that a Marxist SWAPO government will come 
to power in November's U.N.-monitored elections. Despite widespread 
condemnation of SWAPO's invasion, the insurgent movement remains the probable 
winner of Namibia's first free and fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO's political opponents, chief among them the multiracial, capitalistic 
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), have taken to the streets with a 
well-funded campaign to discredit SWAPO. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred black Namibians wearing alliance T-shirts turned up this week 
at a South African military base in the northern Namibia city of Oshakati -- 
SWAPO's political power base -- to protest the incursions. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance supporters carried signs reading "Don't Sabotage 435," referring 
to the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, and "SWAPO -- Don't Kill the Peace." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's president, "failed hopelessly in his attempt to take over 
Namibia by force," said Barney Barnes, head of a small political party that 
merged with Democratic Turnhalle this week. "In the process, he annoyed the 
whole international community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Shifting Story 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma first said his forces were already inside northern Namibia before the 
peace process began, but few world leaders believed him. Later, Nujoma 
acknowledged that some of his rebel forces did cross the border, but only to 
turn themselves over to the U.N. peacekeeping troops. Now Nujoma has accused 
South Africa of hiding its advance knowledge of the infiltration in order to 
justify an attack on SWAPO and have an excuse to back out of the independence 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Many international leaders not accustomed to siding with South Africa admit 
that they agree with Botha. And even SWAPO's most ardent supporters in Africa 
have criticized Nujoma. 
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has provided sanctuary for the 
rebels, said his country "regrets that the SWAPO leadership could not exercise 
total control over its guerrillas at the critical moment." 
</P>
<P>
Botha goes much further. "I don't see how the SWAPO leadership could have been 
so stupid," the foreign minister told viewers of state-run television recently. 
</P>
<P>
But the insurgents' support among Namibians remains strong. Several thousand 
SWAPO supporters turned out Sunday in a black township near Windhoek for a 
memorial service for guerrillas killed in 10 days of conflict. The service was 
for the 38 fighters that SWAPO says were killed, but Namibian security forces 
say more than 275 guerrillas have actually died in the battles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to pay tribute to heroic Namibians who have lost their lives in 
the north of our land," the Rev. Jackie Basson told the mourners. "The 
independence we have been fighting for for years is being threatened by 
unprovoked attacks by South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Botha has lately suggested that SWAPO's actions have made South Africa less 
willing to negotiate with other liberation movements, such as the outlawed 
African National Congress, the principal liberation movement in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no more illusions," Botha said. "This perfidy by SWAPO has dealt the 
good and positive prospects of negotiation politics a blow. One doesn't know 
anymore who one can believe." 
</P>
<P>
For all its newly charged rhetoric, though, South Africa has passed up several 
opportunities to scuttle the peace process here. 
</P>
<P>
"They had their chance to sweep it off the table and they didn't," a political 
analyst in Namibia said recently. "That must mean they're serious."

KEY LEADERS IN SOVIET GEORGIA OUSTED FOR FAILING TO CONTROL CLASHES THAT KILLED 
19

<P>
The Communist Party of Georgia, in a decisive move intended to put a lid on 
tensions still simmering in the republic's capital after five days of martial 
law, ousted its key leaders Friday for failing to control clashes between 
demonstrators and army troops that led to 19 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
In an emergency session attended by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
the party named the republic's KGB head as Georgia's new party chief, a post 
once held by Shevardnadze himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way anyone or anything can justify the death of innocent people," 
Shevardnadze told the party meeting in a speech partially broadcast on Soviet 
television. "We have now one supreme duty: to figure out the truth and exclude 
forever the possibility of such a tragedy happening again." 
</P>
<P>
The mood in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi remained tense. Troops patrolled 
the streets, stopped cars at roadblocks for searches and cordoned off squares 
with tanks and armored personnel carriers to prevent mass gatherings, residents 
said. Foreign journalists were not permitted to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations in the republic's capital of 1.2 million people began last week 
with protesters demanding independence from the Soviet Union. Soviet troops 
invaded the republic in 1921 and it was then annexed. Georgian nationalists 
contend their needs are not adequately met by the Russian-dominated government 
in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deaths at Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
The Tbilisi protests became bloody on Sunday when troops attempted to break up 
a gathering in front of the republic's Government House. Sixteen people were 
killed during the demonstration and three died later, according to official 
figures, which listed 13 of the dead as women. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those killed were bystanders, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Gennady I. Gerasimov. A government commission, which is to include members of 
the public, has been appointed to investigate the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Placards posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash said that Dzhumber 
I. Patiashvili, the republic's Communist Party chief, was a "murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Patiashvili, speaking on Soviet television Monday night, admitted that he 
mishandled the protest, apparently by ordering troops to suppress the 
demonstrators. Two days later, Patiashvili offered to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old party leader was appointed in 1985 to succeed Shevardnadze. He 
will be replaced by Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's 45-year-old KGB chief, 
Gerasimov told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Others Ousted 
</P>
<P>
Also ousted from their party posts on the republic's ruling Politburo were 
Zurab Chkheidze, chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers, and Otar Y. 
Cherkezia, president of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said that the decisions were made after a "heated discussion" but did 
not elaborate except to say that the session was attended by Shevardnadze, who 
postponed a visit to East Germany to try to defuse the crisis in his native 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that nationalist rallies in Georgia and earlier this year in 
the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan were damaging President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society by permitting greater openness. 
</P>
<P>
"These events are like sticking a dagger in the back of perestroika," he said, 
referring to Gorbachev's policies of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also defended the government's ban on travel to Georgia by foreign 
journalists, saying: "My view is that we are providing you with enough 
information so that your readers can judge the situation by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Radio Moscow reported Friday that 328 people had been detained in Georgia over 
the last 24 hours and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
Factories and public transportation were operating normally, but attendance was 
down by about 50% at the city's secondary schools, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect and the army continued to hold about 
66,000 hunting rifles and privately owned guns collected earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people, many carrying black flags, marched through a central 
Tbilisi street Thursday for the first funeral of one of the victims, residents 
said. Additional funerals were planned for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The square outside the republic's Government House apparently has spontaneously 
become a memorial to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mountains of flowers. Every day, people place fresh flowers," Leda 
Archvadze, sister-in-law of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a jailed Georgian human rights 
activist, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The army newspaper Red Star said Friday that reports were circulating in 
Tbilisi that troops who broke up the demonstration were drunk and "butchered 
women and girls with military shovels." But the newspaper said doctors who had 
examined some of the bodies of the victims found no signs of cuts. Gerasimov 
has said that initial autopsies showed most of the victims were crushed by the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in a statement broadcast in Tbilisi two days ago, sharply rejected 
demands that the republic be granted independence and called on the Georgians 
to restore order to their republic. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia declared independence in May, 1918, in the chaos following the 1917 
Bolshevik Revolution. Moscow recognized that declaration in a treaty signed in 
1920, but Soviet troops invaded in February, 1921, and took over the region.

A 900-pound pet pig has been found safe in an abandoned drive-in movie theater 
-- four days after the owner reported a kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Marie's owner, Bob Urbanski, said he received an anonymous phone call 
late Thursday from someone threatening to harm the pig unless it was retrieved 
on the theater grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He said if we were not there in an hour, Tiffany Marie would be cut up," 
Urbanski said.

The 2-year-old spotted sow, who likes corn chips and strawberry whipped cream 
pie, apparently was taken Sunday from a yard behind Urbanksi's family-run pet 
store in this suburb south of Chicago.

WRIGHT PROBER KNOWN AS CHARISMATIC LITIGATOR

<TEXT>
<P>
When Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan was named last summer to direct the House 
investigation of Speaker Jim Wright's financial affairs, some Republicans were 
immediately suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan had raised money for Illinois Democratic Sen. Paul Simon's unsuccessful 
campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1988. And the 
Illinois lawyer had been elected as a delegate to the Democratic convention, 
although he decided not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, when the House Ethics Committee voted to charge the Texas 
Democrat with significant violations of House financial conduct rules based on 
Phelan's findings, any anxieties that he was a party apologist were laid to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Phelan's performance demonstrated traits that those who know him say 
dominate his professional approach much more than partisan loyalty. He is 
aggressive, tenacious and charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as dynamic and persuasive as anyone you'll ever meet," one former 
associate said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Wright's defenders in the House would add another description to that 
list -- ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows why you should never appoint a guy special counsel unless he's near 
retirement," said a Democratic congressional aide, referring to the 52-year-old 
Phelan. "He's too tempted to make a splash." 
</P>
<P>
Ethics Committee members and some others familiar with the investigation have 
ardently defended Phelan, saying he was appointed to do a thorough job in a 
very sensitive case and handled it expertly. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of Wright's backers have charged that his exhaustive 450-page 
report on Wright shows that, perhaps to raise his own profile politically, he 
pulled together a huge amount of largely extraneous information and cast in it 
in the harshest possible light for the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the committee is expected to release Phelan's report and begin 
pondering whether to recommend disciplinary action against Wright for allegedly 
accepting improper gifts from a businessman friend and evading House limits on 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan's acquaintances say they are not surprised that he managed to achieve in 
the Wright inquiry a feat that many others would have considered highly 
unlikely -- persuading two Democratic members of the Ethics Committee to vote 
against their party's top House leader. 
</P>
<P>
His record, they note, is one of success. In 1975, the lanky lawyer with the 
infectious laugh left his position at a Chicago law firm and started his own 
firm, now Phelan, Pope &amp; John. It has 63 members. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, they say, he developed a well-earned reputation as a 
charismatic litigator who could immerse himself in complicated cases and then 
win over jurors with his interpretation of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
A Phelan strength is "knowing instinctively how to try a case," said Bradley 
Falkof, a former Phelan associate and now a partner with Griffin &amp; Fadden 
in Chicago. He said Phelan presents his arguments clearly and persuasively in 
plain language because "you aren't going to find a jury full of Harvard 
graduates" on many cases. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan has also had a particular bent for questions of ethics. At the Chicago 
Bar Assn., of which Phelan was president in 1985 and 1986, executive director 
Terrence Murphy praised him for "heightening the consciousness" of local 
lawyers and judges on matters of professional propriety. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan initiated a program that included videotaped sessions on prime issues. 
"He stepped out front on the subject of improved ethics throughout the legal 
profession," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting his findings on Wright in executive sessions before the Ethics 
Committee, Phelan strove to build credibility and rapport with the members. 
And, some Democrats have noted privately, he apparently courted support outside 
the formal meetings as well. 
</P>
<P>
They point to an incident Tuesday night in which Phelan was robbed at gunpoint 
when walking down a street near the Capitol. His companion at the time, who 
also was robbed, was Rep. Chester G. Atkins of Massachusetts, one of the two 
Democratic panel members who a day later cast the crucial votes on the 
wrongdoing allegations. They had just had dinner together.

STATION SEEKS ALASKA VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles radio station KLSX-FM began urging listeners Friday morning to 
volunteer in the cleanup of the oil spill in Valdez, Alaska, offering plane 
fare and a week's accommodations to "qualified" people who donate their time 
and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel compelled to tell you people to donate your time and money to this 
cause," deejay Peter Tilden said. 
</P>
<P>
The station is seeking a "planeful" of volunteers to help coordinate the 
cleanup effort from Anchorage. By the end of Tilden's morning show Friday, 
about 200 people had called to volunteer their services, program director Tom 
Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the volunteers were fishermen, oceanographers, environmental scientists, 
marine biologists and veterinarians, Yates said. Those without such 
qualifications are being urged to donate money to the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers "will primarily be involved in the expedition of a more efficient 
communications system at cleanup sites in Alaska," a station press release 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Orchard, executive director of the Alaska Voluntary Response Center in 
Valdez, said he was grateful for the station's efforts. "We can really use the 
help," he said. "We can always use more communication and coordination. It's a 
madhouse here." 
</P>
<P>
The station's listeners -- who are primarily in the 25-54 age range -- likely 
consist of people who had been active in social and political causes during the 
late 1960s and early '70s, Yates said, so the volunteer effort seemed "a very 
logical thing for us to do."

CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TO POLISH BOBBIES' IMAGE

Britain's biggest police force launched a campaign Friday to polish up the 
image of the London bobby, pledging a more courteous, friendly approach in 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Imbert, commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, acknowledged 
criticism that some police officers in the 27,000-member force were rude and 
unhelpful. But he said they were a small minority. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing now is making a public statement -- for all levels of the 
police service -- of our principles that courtesy is in and abrasiveness is 
out," he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The move was in response to a survey by a public relations firm, which said a 
minority of officers were aggressive and "too free with their language" in 
dealing with the public.

OIL SLICK FOUND OFF PARK; EXXON CLEANUP SCORED

<P>
The Exxon oil slick was spotted just off another national park Friday as state 
and federal officials criticized the giant corporation's "entirely inadequate" 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-square-mile slick was reported 3 miles from Cape Douglas in Katmai 
National Park, park spokesman John Quinley said. Oil continued to wash ashore 
along the coast at nearby Kenai Fiords National Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Katmai, on the mainland west of the Kodiak Islands, is 250 miles southwest of 
Bligh Reef, where the Exxon Valdez went aground March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Erickson, an environmental engineer for the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation, said oil churned into a thick mousse by waves was 
sighted at Shuyak Island, and an oil sheen was off Afognak Island. 
</P>
<P>
Officials fear that lucrative crab, salmon, herring and other fisheries around 
the islands may be destroyed by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The oil could threaten Kamishak Bay, a major herring fishery north of Cape 
Douglas, and the mouth of the McNeil River, which feeds the bay, Quinley said. 
The river is a game sanctuary that attracts photographers from around the world 
to take pictures of brown bears feeding on salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had placed the oil only as far south as the Barren Islands, the 
northernmost in the Kodiak archipelago and a prime breeding habitat for sea 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, 
said his department has been left on standby three weeks after the spill of 
more than 10 million gallons. Officials are awaiting Exxon's plan to clean 
3,000 shore sites. 
</P>
<P>
"No plan has been submitted," Kelso said. "I do not think there is a written 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Steve Cowper and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost returned to survey the 
hundreds of miles of twisting, oily coastline. Yost set a deadline of today for 
Exxon to produce a cleanup plan for the spill, which officials said was not 
breaking up as fast as they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Cleaning Method 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they probably would have to use high-pressure hot water spray 
to cleanse many beaches, a controversial technique because it kills organisms 
on and beneath the surface of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a war," Yost said. "Don't look for a miracle on beach-cleaning. We 
need hundreds of people, maybe multi-hundreds, maybe multi-thousands." 
</P>
<P>
Cowper, who arrived Friday wearing faded jeans and rubber boots, said he was 
pleased that Yost had taken over command of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not satisfied with the way the operation was being coordinated," he 
said. "I think it's obvious that we, the state and the Coast Guard, are not 
satisfied with the way Exxon has performed." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon had good intentions, he said, but "good intentions and good performance 
are two separate items." 
</P>
<P>
Cowper led loud denunciations of Exxon by state officials last week, 
threatening even to shut down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. But officials had 
been more muted this week until Kelso's latest comments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been frustrated by the in-the-water cleanup. We don't want to see that 
replicated on the shoreline," Kelso said, calling Exxon's efforts "entirely 
inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Yost said: "I'm not satisfied with the beach cleanup program. I want a lot of 
people on the beach cleaning up." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials did not respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials had placed the lead section of the spill at the Barren 
Islands, said Larry Dietrich, director of environmental quality for the 
Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Recent storms broke up the slick less than officials hoped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that it's holding together," Dietrich said. "I don't think 
it's dispersing as well as people had hoped that it might." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of sea birds and mammals have died in the oily muck. But damage has 
been greatest on the oiled beaches. Of the 3,000 separate cleanup areas on 
islands in Prince William Sound, 44 are ready for cleanup crews, Kelso said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are already at a few beaches, shoveling up oil, scraping rocks and 
using low-pressure hoses to flush the oil back into the water where it is 
trapped and recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Dietrich said: "It's going to be difficult to launch a cleanup effort on the 
beaches until the floating product is removed." 
</P>
<P>
The total oil recovered so far was about 9% of the spill, or 882,000 gallons, 
Dietrich said, with some of the remaining material having the consistency of 
asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Cowper said it isn't known whether the steam-cleaning machines will work in 
Alaska's rugged wilderness because fresh water was used in previous operations, 
and crews in Prince William Sound will be using salt water.

State and federal officials unleashed a fresh barrage of criticism against 
Exxon on Friday, blasting the company for "entirely inadequate" efforts to 
clean up crude oil spilled when a tanker struck a reef last month. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation, said his department has been left on standby three weeks after 
the 11-million-gallon spill. Officials are awaiting Exxon's plan to clean 3,000 
shore sites.

"No plan has been submitted," Kelso said. "I do not think there is a written

Deadline on Plan 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Steve Cowper and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost returned to survey the 
hundreds of miles of oily coastline. Yost set a deadline of today for Exxon to 
produce a cleanup plan for the spill, which officials said was not breaking up 
as fast as they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they probably would have to use high-pressure hot water spray

</P>
<P>
"Don't look for a miracle on beach-cleaning," Yost said. "We need hundreds of 
people, maybe multihundreds, maybe multithousands." 
</P>
<P>
Yost did not say what he would do if Exxon did not provide a cleanup plan, but 
he made it clear that he expected to receive one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Cloud of Dust' 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt Exxon will meet the deadline," he said. "Exxon will give me a 
plan this weekend. I hope you're going to see a big cloud of dust . . . and 
when that settles, you're going to see beach cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
Cowper, who arrived Friday wearing faded jeans and rubber boots, said he was 
pleased that Yost had taken over command of the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not satisfied with the way the operation was being coordinated," he 
said. "I think it's obvious that we, the state and the Coast Guard, are not

<P>
Tells Frustration 
</P>
<P>
"We've been frustrated by the in-the-water cleanup. We don't want to see that 
replicated on the shoreline," Kelso said, calling Exxon's efforts "entirely 
inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials did not respond immediately to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The lower edge of the slick was by the Barren Islands, a prime breeding habitat 
for sea birds 200 miles from where the Exxon Valdez hit a reef on March 24, 
said Larry Dietrich, director of environmental quality for the Department of 
Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Royer, a physical oceanographer with the University of Alaska's Institute 
of Marine Science, said Friday that ocean currents would carry the oil slick 
into Cook Inlet and down the east coast of Kodiak Island, one of the world's 
most productive fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever comes into that area will stay there for an extended period. The oil 
will remain off the island for one to two months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Royer, who has studied the currents for 15 years, said the oil that flows into 
Cook Inlet will eventually be swept down the Shelikof Straits and then down the 
Aleutian chain. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that within a month or two most of the oil sheens and slicks would 
disappear from Prince William Sound waters, except for some of the bays and 
shorelines where oil will continue to pose a problem.

The wreck of the Portland, a 280-foot side-wheel steamer that claimed more than 
160 lives when it sank in a ferocious 1898 storm, has been found in 
Massachusetts Bay, a maritime explorer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Fish, co-director of Historical Maritime Group of New England, said his 
crew used sonar equipment this week to confirm that they had found the ship in 
waters north of Cape Cod.

KILLINGS SEND SHUDDER OF FEAR THROUGH WINE COUNTRY COMMUNITIES

Carol Morehouse moved to the peaceful Sonoma Valley less than a year ago with 
her husband and teen-age son to escape the "rat race" of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
So she was as shocked and fearful as anyone in this tiny wine country village 
when she heard Friday that a man had killed five people and was still at large, 
described by authorities as armed and "extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
"People normally feel very secure, very safe here," Morehouse said as she rang 
up a sale where she works at the the Secret Garden crafts boutique on state 
Highway 12. "This really is the kind of place where many people still don't 
lock their doors. So when something like this happens, it's really upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
If the killings and manhunt did not bring life to a standstill here, they 
disrupted it by stunning local residents and tourists and sending chills 
through many who knew the victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadside Discussions 
</P>
<P>
Small knots of people stood on roadsides discussing the news as police 
helicopters hovered overhead. Cars from the California Highway Patrol and the 
Sonoma County Sheriff's Department crisscrossed the valley's tree-lined roads, 
passing places with names like Oak Hill Farm and Sunny Slope Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
At Dunbar Elementary School, which backs up against the Grand Cru Vineyards, 
site of one of the slayings, school personnel took precautions to safeguard the 
more than 300 children who began arriving for class Friday morning just as 
sheriff's deputies were beginning to investigate the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The children were allowed outside for their morning recess, but by noon, with 
the killer still at large and memories of January's schoolyard massacre in 
Stockton still fresh, the principal ordered the children indoors. The afternoon 
kindergarten was canceled lest the 30 children who attend that session be 
forced to wait on the streets for the school bus. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to think this kind of thing doesn't happen in a community such as 
ours," said Dunbar Principal Rosemary Haver. "Yet it does happen. Times are 
changing, and this is just one more confirmation that they are." 
</P>
<P>
PTA President Cherry Hastings, whose 7-year-old daughter attends Dunbar, said 
the collection of small towns in the Valley of the Moon, as some call it here, 
form a tight-knit community in which neighbors still know and care for one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
One mother bringing her child to school Friday morning lived next door to the 
victim who was shot at the winery, Hasting said. The man has a young child and 
newborn baby, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking about what we can do for the family," Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
Some feared that a place known mainly for its bountiful wineries might be 
scarred with the mark of the grisly string of murders. But no one was quite 
ready to put the tragedy into perspective as long as there was a killer on the 
loose. Nerves were taut, and rumors spread from neighbor to neighbor, 
shopkeeper to customer. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. Friday, three loud pops -- perhaps a vehicle backfiring, but they 
sounded like gunshots -- echoed across the valley not far from the school. A 
sheriff's deputy posted there quickly repositioned his patrol car and scanned 
the horizon with binoculars. Parents rushed several children from the parking 
lot into the school and shut the doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspicious Vehicle 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, a Pepsi deliveryman arrived and said he thought he had 
just seen a car matching the description of the gunman's vehicle. Sitting 
beside the car was a Latino man staring into the hills, the deliveryman said. A 
teacher called the 911 emergency line to report the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
But hours later, the killer still had not been captured. As word, and hope, 
spread that he might have left the area, residents began to feel more secure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not panicking," Hastings said. "What's uppermost in our minds is how we 
can stick together and help each other."

SCIENCE PANEL ADDS VITAMIN A TO PROP. 65 TOXICS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's panel of scientific advisers voted Friday to list 
Vitamin A as a chemical that in high doses can cause birth defects, thus 
subjecting the substance to the requirements of Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific panel also decided to place cocaine on the same list, although 
state officials acknowledged that it is unlikely that any enforcement action 
under the anti-toxics initiative will be taken against drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to comply with a recent court order won by environmentalists, the 
panel provisionally designated the Environmental Protection Agency as an 
"authoritative" body. Under Proposition 65, that designation means chemicals 
identified by the federal agency as causing cancer or birth defects would be 
subject to the state's anti-toxics law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Conditions 
</P>
<P>
However, in a discussion that left even some members of the panel confused 
about what they were voting on, the panel attached a series of conditions to 
the EPA designation in a bid to limit the number of chemicals that ultimately 
would end up covered by Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
Al Meyerhoff, an environmentalist attorney who helped win the court order, 
charged that the panel was attempting to thwart the initiative and prevent the 
listing of as many as 200 chemicals, including some hazardous pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The listing of Vitamin A posed a difficulty for the panel because the substance 
is essential to human health in moderate doses. In fact, Vitamin A deficiency 
in pregnant women is known to cause more birth defects than overdoses of the 
vitamin, members of the panel noted. 
</P>
<P>
Departing from its normal procedure, the group of scientists voted to place 
Vitamin A on the list of chemicals known to cause birth defects -- but only in 
daily doses of more than 10,000 international units. Pregnant women are advised 
to consume 8,000 international units of Vitamin A per day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dangerous in High Doses' 
</P>
<P>
"The scientific panel today addressed for the first time what are called 
essential nutrients, in this case Vitamin A, which has the property of being 
dangerous in high doses or in (insufficient) doses," said Health and Welfare 
Undersecretary Thomas E. Warriner, who oversees implementation of Proposition 
65. 
</P>
<P>
"The panel was faced with the need . . . not to discourage people from 
maintaining adequate intake of Vitamin A and at the same time warning people 
whose intake is dangerously high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 65, businesses must provide a "clear and reasonable" warning 
if they expose anyone to a "significant risk" from any of the chemicals on the 
state list. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has agreed to follow the recommendations of the panel in placing 
substances on the list. 
</P>
<P>
By adding cocaine to the list of chemicals known to cause birth defects, state 
officials said they did so to draw attention to the fact that cocaine, when 
consumed by a woman during pregnancy, can cause birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were quick to criticize the panel for attempting to place 
conditions on the designation of the federal EPA as an authoritative body. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific advisers, for example, insisted on retaining the authority to 
take any chemical off the state list if they disagreed with the EPA's 
assessment. Panel members, acting on the advice of chemical industry attorneys, 
also sought to narrow the number of chemicals designated by the EPA as toxic 
that could wind up on the state list. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, charged that 
the panel is not complying with the court order issued last week requiring the 
panel to decide whether the EPA is an "authoritative" body. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for every possible way of not requiring the listing of some 
of the most hazardous chemicals we know of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff said that the actions of the panel have meant a two-year delay in the 
listing of cancer-causing chemicals used on a variety of crops, including Alar, 
a growth-inducing substance, and captan, a widely used fumigant. 
</P>
<P>
If the EPA had been designated as an "authoritative" body, he said, as many as 
200 more chemicals would already have been added to the 279 chemicals now on 
the state list. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff pledged to go back to court if the conditions imposed by the panel 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Warriner said he hoped that any disagreements between Meyerhoff and the panel 
could be resolved when the scientists' action is formally drafted into 
regulations.

Lucky taxpayers. The deadline to file federal and state income tax returns for 
1988 is two days later than normal because the regular April 15 deadline falls 
on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute filers have until midnight Monday to mail their returns. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service regional center in Fresno and the Franchise Tax 
Board in Sacramento are braced for the late rush. So is the U.S. Postal 
Service, which brings returns to the Fresno service center in tractor-trailer 
trucks this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the peak season, we get three mail drops a day, and during the peak 
period that goes up to eight or 10 a day," said Marty Gomez, spokesman for the 
IRS service center. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, the Fresno IRS center had received 5.9 million returns 
from residents of Central and Southern California and Hawaii. That is just over 
half the 11.4 million expected this tax season. 
</P>
<P>
At the tax agency in Sacramento, 7 million 1988 state returns had been 
processed as of Thursday, and 13 million are expected by the end of the tax 
season, spokesman Jim Reber said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, California taxpayers are required to attach a copy of their 
federal return when they send their state return. 
</P>
<P>
The state will be offering perplexed taxpayers help Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. People in Northern California can call 800-852-7050, while people in 
Southern California can call 800-852-5711. 
</P>
<P>
For help with state returns, California residents can call 800-424-1040.

6 CHARGED IN $70,000 WELFARE FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six family members who arrived in San Diego about two years ago from Louisiana 
were charged Friday by the district attorney's office with defrauding the 
county Department of Social Services of more than $70,000 in welfare benefits 
over 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the case represents the largest single ring of suspects ever 
charged in such a fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the defendants were arraigned on a variety of felony charges before San 
Diego Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon and held in custody on $10,000 bail 
each. The two, Daniel Lee, 46, and his wife, Virginia Lee, 41, each pleaded not 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, Glenda Lee, said to be Daniel and Virginia Lee's daughter, 
and William White, described as Glenda Lee's common-law husband, were in 
custody in County Jail and expected to be arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Suspects 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects were at large Friday and believed to be out of state. Arrest 
warrants were ordered for the two, Cora Lee and Theresa Remble. Their exact 
relationships to the Lee family were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Laura Tanney said five other members or associates of the 
family are part of the continuing investigation but have not been charged. She 
declined to comment on their roles in the alleged fraud, or whether they have 
assisted investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Rohn Dillow, chief of the Department of Social Services' special investigations 
section, characterized the ring's operation as one of the most sophisticated 
ever encountered by the department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Aliases 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group went to five of the department's eight welfare offices in 
the county from June, 1987, to July, 1988, and used a variety of aliases in 
requesting aid from MediCal, general county welfare relief, food stamps, Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children and AFDC for the homeless -- even though the 
family owns property in Louisiana, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Among the schemes to receive welfare payments, investigators said, were 
declaring dependents when they had none by "swapping children" among one 
another and declaring them their own, claiming they were homeless when in fact 
they were living in the Golden Hill area of San Diego and applying for welfare 
several times by using aliases. 
</P>
<P>
"They were quite sophisticated in terms of their ability, their knowledge of 
the system, their knowledge of the verification requirements for eligibility 
determination and in the information and documents they provided," Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
But alert eligibility technicians first snagged individuals in the ring last 
June -- about a year after the fraud allegedly started -- because of some 
inconsistencies in their statements and documents. Fraud investigators within 
the department were notified, and they in turn notified eligibility workers 
throughout the system who began reviewing their cases, Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
"They came up with a number of people who seemed to be working the same way, 
who found commonality among names -- even the aliases -- and common birth 
dates," Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
He said one or more members of the family could be expected to show up at any 
office on any day to make a request for welfare benefits, so fraud 
investigators were sent to all eight offices and put on standby until a suspect 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "the people would come in, and our fraud investigators were immediately 
called in to the interview and talked to these people," Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
By December, he said, enough information was gathered to turn the case over to 
the district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the investigation, members of the group still applied fraudulently for 
even more welfare benefits, Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
"They continued to apply for aid, even though they knew they were being 
investigated," Dillow said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Lee was believed to be personally responsible for receiving more than 
$20,000 in aid, Dillow said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police used a Taser gun to subdue a man Thursday night in Southeast San Diego 
after he threatened to kill them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, King Fung Chu, 40, of San Diego, was stopped by officers about 10:20 
p.m. while driving a car with its anti-theft alarm blaring, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which wasn't stolen, was traveling west on Home Avenue near California 
94, police said. 
</P>
<P>
When two officers approached Chu after stopping the car, he was uncooperative 
and shouted: "I'm going to kill an American cop. Shoot me, shoot me," said 
police spokesman Dave Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Police summoned a backup unit with a police dog, Cohen said. 
</P>

The dog was used by officers to distract Chu on the driver's side of the car 
while an unidentified officer broke the car's right window and fired the Taser 
gun at Chu, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The gun fires a dart that emits 50,000 volts of electricity, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Chu, who was stunned by the dart and bitten on the left arm by the dog, was 
taken to San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital where he was treated. He 
was transferred to County Mental Health for 72 hours of observation, Cohen 
said.

<P>
A Loma Portal man was arrested Friday on suspicion of fatally stabbing another 
man whom he had invited to spend the night at his apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Jones, 21, of the 3000 block of Barnett Avenue, was taken into custody 
by homicide detectives after they questioned him about the stabbing, Sgt. Jerry 
Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones told police that he stabbed Carlos Guzman, 24, of San Diego in 
self-defense after Guzman woke him about 3:15 a.m. Friday and attacked him, 
Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman died of stab wounds to his chest, according to a deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had met in bars near Jones' home at least three times in the past 
before Friday's fatal stabbing, Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is being held in County Jail without bail.

MAN HELD IN BEATING OF TWINS MAY BE RETURNED TO S.D. SOON

A 27-year-old man, arrested in Laughlin, Nev., Wednesday in connection with the 
brutal beating last month of twin 2 1/2-year-old boys abandoned at a Del Mar 
hotel, could be turned over to San Diego officials by next week, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Thomas McCoy remained in Clark County Jail in Las Vegas on Friday 
without bail on a felony child abuse warrant while San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department detectives were interviewing him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
If McCoy waives his right to a formal extradition hearing, he could be in San 
Diego to face charges of felony child abuse within a week, said Linda Miller, 
spokeswoman for the San Diego County district attorney's office. If he doesn't 
waive the right, extradition takes about 30 days, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, the former boyfriend of the boys' mother, Dorothy Denise Desimone, was 
arrested at the Edgewater Hotel in Laughlin on Wednesday night by Las Vegas 
Metro Police, who received a tip from Phoenix police that he was believed to be 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, officers found a .38-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a 
pound of a powdery, white substance believed to be methamphetamine in McCoy's 
room, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy had been a fugitive since March 25, when the boys were found battered and 
wandering in the halls of the Del Mar Inn by hotel employees. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the boys suffered severe bruises to their stomachs and sides and 
cigarette burns. They also suffered facial injuries from being slapped. 
</P>
<P>
Desimone, 25, of Oceanside, was arrested March 27 by sheriff's child abuse 
detectives at Children's Hospital when she tried to visit her twins. 
</P>
<P>
Desimone denied any role in the incident at her arraignment March 29 on charges 
of felony child abuse, child abandonment and inflicting corporal punishment on 
the boys. She is being held in the County Jail at Las Colinas on $100,000 bail.

BERNARDI SAYS NO TO HALL'S CODE OF ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi on Friday rejected as meaningless a 
code of ethics he was asked to sign by challenger Lyle Hall in the northeast 
San Fernando Valley's 7th District race. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyle violated his own code in the primary campaign," Bernardi said. "Yet he 
asks me to sign a code that I have never violated in all my years of political 
campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
Hall on Thursday challenged Bernardi to sign a pledge to exchange campaign 
literature 24 hours before it is distributed and to refrain from personal 
attacks and distortions during their campaign leading to the June 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no need to distort the facts to defeat Lyle," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Hall, a former president of the city firefighters' union, has 
strong labor support because "he has always pushed for exorbitant salaries and 
pension benefits at the cost of city services." 
</P>
<P>
"Giving him a vote on the city budget would be putting the fox in charge of the 
henhouse," Bernardi added. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has denied that if elected he would be beholden to the city employee 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both candidates were courting also-rans in Tuesday's primary in an 
effort to win their endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Each met privately Friday with Al Dib, an Arleta community activist who 
finished third among eight candidates. He got 12% of the vote. Dib said he 
probably would announce his choice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, the council dean with 28 years of service, received 42% of the vote 
but fell short of the majority required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who 
finished second with 26%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunch With Tovar 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi will have lunch today with Irene Tovar, who finished fourth with 10% 
of the vote. Tovar is a Latino activist who has strong roots in the district's 
increasingly Latino community. Hall also has phoned Tovar. 
</P>
<P>
Those who hope to elect a Latino to the seat someday are urging Tovar to back 
Bernardi because the 77-year-old councilman is likely to vacate the office 
sooner than 49-year-old Hall. But Hall and Tovar both have friends in common 
within the United Farm Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi also will meet today with Jules S. Bagneris III, a Lake View Terrace 
homeowners' leader who finished fifth with 7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the city clerk's office asked Hall's campaign to 
correct omissions in its last campaign fund-raising reports. Hall's campaign 
failed to identify the employers and occupations of many of its contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's political consultant Harvey Englander said the campaign was making every 
effort to obtain the required information.

NEIGHBORHOOD'S 'BIG WHITE DOG' TURNS OUT TO BE A BIG BAD WOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners around Encino Reservoir probably won't be comforted to learn that 
the "big white dog" they complained about to the Department of Animal 
Regulation, saying it was running wild in the neighborhood and ate a pet 
rabbit, wasn't there at all. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, no dog. 
</P>
<P>
Just a wolf. 
</P>
<P>
When Animal Regulation Officer Dennis Krouplin checked the bring-em-back-alive 
trap that officers had set for the "dog" in a brushy area of the Santa Monica 
Mountains, he found a white wolf, Animal Regulation Lt. Fred Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little bit surprised," Michael added. "That's the first wolf we've 
ever found in the Valley that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
The wolf, a full-grown female, weighs "about 90 to 100 pounds," said Thomas R. 
Walsh, the department's district supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Because the nearest wild wolves live far away in Alaska or Minnesota, the 
department presumes that the wolf was somebody's pet and escaped or was turned 
loose, Walsh said. And the officers hope to find out who the owner was, he 
said, partly because they want to discuss the wolf's future and partly because 
it is illegal to keep wolves in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a special permit to keep a wild animal like that, and in the city of 
Los Angeles, we won't issue a permit for a wolf," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no such permits outstanding, he said, and possession of the wolf in 
the city limits without one "is a misdemeanor, carrying a fine up to $500 and 
up to six months in jail." 
</P>
<P>
If no one claims her, the wolf will be offered to the Los Angeles Zoo, which 
will probably reject her because "the zoo worries about disease from animals 
that come from the outside," Walsh said. The department will try to find a 
legal home for her, he said, but would have to destroy her if none can be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't turn her loose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The wolf was taken to the West Valley Animal Shelter. She is "very shy and 
withdrawn," Walsh said, "but she isn't hysterical, the way a truly wild animal 
would be if it were caged. So I'm presuming she is accustomed to people and has 
been under control in the past." 
</P>
<P>
She has, however, been loose in the neighborhood around the southern end of 
Calneva Drive on the east side of the reservoir for almost two months, Walsh 
said. "The residents up there have been reporting her, and our officers have 
seen her a few times, but they could never get close to her." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently lived by hunting wild rabbits, ground squirrels, opossums and 
quail in the uninhabited brush around the reservoir, Walsh said. But after a 
family reported that the "dog" ate their pet rabbit, officers put out a large 
cage, baited with food, with a door that snaps closed on the animal, trapping 
it without hurting it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Walsh said, some officers who sighted the animal thought that it 
looked like a wolf, 
</P>
<P>
but the possibility was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody just said, "Naaah, it's probably some kind of mixed breed German 
shepherd." The animal is not a crossbreed, not even a mixture of dog and wolf, 
he said. "This is obviously a purebred wolf." 
</P>
<P>
He added that it is a good thing that dogs, coyotes and wolves usually prefer 
to stick to their own kind for romance. 
</P>
<P>
"If she interbred with all the coyotes we have out there, we might have a hell 
of a new kind of coyote around here."

UNDER SPECTER OF LAWSUIT, PANEL BACKS CHURCH'S BUILDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The tension filling the hearing room seemed out of place with the calm, factual 
presentations of the spokesmen for a Jehovah's Witnesses congregation and for 
the residents of an unincorporated pocket of land near Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The issue before the county's Planning and Environmental Review Board was 
clear: Would the construction of a 500-seat kingdom hall by the religious group 
severely affect the rural residential neighborhood wedged between the southeast 
outskirts of Escondido and the northern city limits of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The residents said it would; the Jehovah's Witnesses said it wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
Planning board members voted 2 to 1 to grant the church a permit to build its 
assembly hall after only a few neighbors rose to testify about the traffic 
hazards around Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive intersection near their 
homes and the congestion on the narrow two-lane streets. They told of the 
existing parking and traffic congestion on their streets because of another 
church, Emmanuel Faith Community, about their concerns that their quiet 
neighborhood would become as noisy and crowded as a shopping center to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
A large and vociferous contingent of opponents had turned out for an earlier 
round of hearings last year, in which the project was rejected unanimously by 
the same planning panel, the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the lawsuit that did it," one resident said about the lessened 
objections of the neighborhood. "Folks in the neighborhood were scared that, if 
they got up and gave their names, they'd be named in the lawsuit," as one of 
the 500 unnamed defendants in a $10-million civil suit the church filed against 
residents, leaders of a nearby church and the county. "I guess they figured we 
would back down because we didn't have the money to fight a lawsuit. And, I 
guess that they were right." 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said that, right or wrong, the residents who had rallied against 
the church backed off after the lawsuit was filed last fall. It was difficult 
to find anyone who would step forward and sign the appeal papers that would 
send the issue to the Planning Commission next month. And it was difficult to 
find anyone other than Jim Bohorquez who was willing to speak on the record to 
a reporter about the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Bohorquez -- a relative newcomer to the group -- volunteered 
to file the appeal, assuring one more hearing on the project before 
construction can begin. Bohorquez joined the residents' protest with fervor 
about a month ago after being "honked at, forced off the road and nearly run 
over" by fast-moving cars while testing his daughter's bike on neighborhood 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not intimidated by the Jehovah's Witnesses' lawsuit, but 
acknowledged that he did increase his homeowners' insurance to $1 million, just 
in case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that opponents of the kingdom hall are breaching the Park 
Hill congregation's constitutional rights to religious freedom, assembly, 
speech and association, and seeks, among other things, $10 million in punitive 
damages against leaders of a nearby church, neighborhood residents and the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit has been put on hold -- dismissed permanently against officers and 
members of nearby Emmanuel Faith Community Church, but dismissed without 
prejudice against area residents and a Sierra Club spokeswoman. The suit 
against the latter defendants can be refiled on the same issues at any time, 
according to Byron Cornelius, the attorney for the Jehovah's Witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against the county supervisors is on appeal to the 4th District Court 
of Appeal in an effort to overturn the board's earlier denial of the project, 
Cornelius said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius stressed that the suit against the opposing neighbors "is not meant 
as an act of intimidation" but as an effort "to have the matter settled on the 
issue of zoning. . . . We have the zoning, and we have met the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the Park Hill congregation and I, weren't trying to threaten the 
neighbors. We are not out to get their billfolds. We have been trying to build 
our church for the last 18 months, and we just want to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Marioncelli, an aide to Supervisor John MacDonald, shrugged off the threat 
of the lawsuit against the county. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to sue us, they take a number and get in line," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
He understands, however, how the homeowners could be intimidated by the threat 
of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their religious beliefs, Jehovah's Witnesses do not register to 
vote. Marioncelli said they use the courts to accomplish their objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"They filed suit against the homeowners and the opposition evaporated. They 
accomplished what they set out to do," Marioncelli said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald received a letter from the church group's attorney last year, 
threatening a lawsuit unless the county board granted the permit for the church 
building or allowed the group to re-apply immediately for the permit, but "we 
tend to ignore that kind of thing in this business," Marioncelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor recommended the earlier denial of the permit. The county board 
voted unanimously to deny it. The lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Bohorquez said that members of the neighborhood opposition group had told him 
of receiving telephone calls asking if they were members of Emmanuel Faith 
church during last year's stormy hearings on the church permit. When some 
recipients of the calls phoned the community church to ask if a membership 
survey was in progress, church officials said no such activity was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are genuinely frightened," Bohorquez said. "I even had trouble 
getting other people to help in handing out handbills in the neighborhood," 
advertising the April 6 planning board hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Councilman Jerry Harmon said the city is "vitally interested" in the 
church project on its southern boundary "because we are about to spend $3 
million to $4 million to rectify traffic problems on Bear Valley Parkway to the 
north that appear to be similar to the problems at the church site." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the area will be brought into the city of Escondido, "and we don't 
want to have to make the same expensive corrections at the expense of the 
city's taxpayers," he said. "New development must pay its own way." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said the city would not appeal the planning board decision because 
county officials had assured Escondido Public Works Director Dennis Wilson that 
the county is requiring the Jehovah's Witnesses group to meet all city building 
and zoning standards and to mitigate any traffic problems the church 
construction may cause.

DRIVER SENT TO PRISON FOR CARRYING 6 BOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge trash-truck driver was sentenced to two years and eight months in 
prison Friday for having six pipe bombs in his pickup truck and pointing a gun 
at another motorist. 
</P>
<P>
Frank John Salado, 40, was convicted March 24 by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Raymond Mireles, who sent Salado to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Salado was found with the bombs July 1. Los Angeles police closed a section of 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Saticoy Street for about six hours while police 
explosives experts destroyed the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the bombs were powerful enough to cause death or serious 
injury, but they said they did not know what Salado planned to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
Salado had pointed a gun at a car whose driver called police and led them to 
Salado's pickup, where officers found the bombs and two loaded handguns, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a probation officer's report, Salado contends that he found the 
bombs on top of a trash truck he was cleaning while on the job earlier that day 
at a garbage-hauling firm in Simi Valley. He said he did not know the devices 
were bombs, the report said.

PURSE SNATCHER MAY FACE MURDER CHARGE AFTER VICTIM, 84, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An 84-year-old Granada Hills woman has died in a convalescent home about a year 
after she was seriously injured in a supermarket parking lot robbery attempt, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Janice L. Maurizi said the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office is investigating whether the Sunday death of Freda Crawford is connected 
to injuries she suffered in the March 27, 1988, incident. It will be several 
weeks before coroner's investigators complete their report, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael P. Kellet and Richard Phillips, both 20, were convicted late last year 
in San Fernando Superior Court of robbing Crawford and another elderly woman 
and are serving prison terms. Phillips was found guilty of personal infliction 
of great bodily injury and two charges of robbery and was sentenced to seven 
years. Kellet was convicted of two charges of robbery and was sentenced to six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be hard for murder charges not to be filed," Maurizi said. 
"The woman was never on her own after this all happened and needed 
round-the-clock medical care." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford was putting groceries in her car in the parking lot of a Huges market 
at Devonshire Street and Balboa Boulevard when one of two men in a passing car 
reached out and grabbed her purse, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dragged 40 Feet 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who held on to the purse, was dragged 40 feet before the car swerved 
and ran over her, police said. She was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Kellet and Phillips were arrested a day later. Evidence in their car linked 
them to the other robbery in which an elderly woman's purse was snatched, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Close friend Ted Horton, 62, described Crawford as a lively woman who was 
mostly bedridden after the accident. "She was never the same," he said. "They 
took the remainder of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Services for Crawford, who died at Beverly Manor Convalescent Home, are 
scheduled Monday at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.

EX-VOCATIONAL SCHOOL OWNER GETS 5-YEAR PRISON TERM IN LOAN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The former owner of a San Fernando vocational school was sentenced to five 
years in federal prison for fraudulently collecting more than half a million 
dollars in student loans, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard R. Romero, 49, of Rancho Palos Verdes, who was co-owner of the 
now-defunct Medical Training Institute, was also ordered to pay $557,500 in 
restitution to the U.S. Department of Education for submitting 225 phony 
student loan applications between 1982 and 1984, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen 
A. Mansfield said. The other owner was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea agreement, the federal government dismissed one conspiracy charge and 
two other fraud charges against Romero in exchange for his guilty plea to two 
felony fraud charges, Mansfield said. In addition to incarceration and 
restitution, he was sentenced to three years probation upon release from 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, who ran the San Fernando school and another with the same name in 
Bellflower, solicited signatures on blank student loan applications from poor 
people standing in welfare lines, on street corners and outside churches, 
Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"He would find folks who were down on their luck and get them to sign blank 
government loan applications," Mansfield said. "He would give them a song and 
dance about how they could work in a medical office. And these were people that 
actually needed an education and a job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Attended School 
</P>
<P>
About half of those who signed the documents never attended school, Mansfield 
said. Romero fraudulently filled out loan applications in their names and 
endorsed and cashed their loan checks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which was on North Maclay Avenue, was accredited by the Department 
of Education to receive federal and state student loan money. But the 
Bellflower school was not, said Deputy Federal Public Defender Dennis J. 
Landin, Romero's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Romero fraudulently filled out applications stating that students who were 
attending the Bellflower school were enrolled in the accredited San Fernando 
school, Landin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Romero, who was deputy director of student financial aid at Cal State 
Fullerton from 1970 to 1973, never personally recruited students in welfare 
lines, but hired others to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The money was used to operate the schools and not to personally enrich Romero, 
Landis said, adding that "no one ever said he used it to buy Cadillacs and fur 
coats." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education began investigating Romero and the schools in 1984 
after receiving student complaints about poor educational offerings and the 
lack of job placement. In the two years that the schools operated, 239 students 
attended the San Fernando school and 225 went to the Bellflower school. It is 
not known how many actually found jobs as medical assistants.

GUETTERMAN STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS ON THE YANKEE STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK O'CONNELL, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Step forward, Dallas Green says to the New York Yankees every day. Lots of jobs 
here. Take one. 
</P>
<P>
No Yankee has responded to the manager's plea more than Lee Guetterman, the 
6-foot-8 pitcher whose steps forward have been huge strides. 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman, who most likely would have begun the season at triple-A Columbus, 
Ohio, had Ron Guidry not required arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow, has 
been the Yankees' most effective pitcher, the only one who remains unscored 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman has made five appearances totaling eight innings and given up six 
hits and no walks. Wednesday night, he earned his first major league save with 
a scoreless ninth inning to preserve a 5-3 victory for John Candelaria. 
</P>
<P>
That Green chose him for the assignment indicates that Guetterman's giant steps 
have taken him in another direction. He longs to be a starter, but the Yankees 
need Guetterman to be their left-handed closer until an elbow-ailing Dave 
Righetti gets his game in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"With Goot, I'm running a little bit of a hot hand," Green said. "He's been our 
best pitcher. I need a guy in that situation who'll throw strikes and not walk 
people. I have faith Goot can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman has pitched the Yankees out of jams consistently and, in the first 
save opportunity he can recall, pitched them out of a seven-game losing streak. 
He yielded a leadoff single in the ninth Wednesday night, but his sinker 
induced an immediate double-play grounder. Two more singles followed before he 
sewed it up with a bouncer to the box. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous," he admitted. "That's not a familiar situation for me." 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman's emergence as a key figure on the pitching staff has been one of 
the Yankees' quieter stories, which is somehow fitting, because the Tennessean 
himself speaks barely above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
His silent, easygoing manner may have been misinterpreted by other managers, 
notably Billy Martin. He felt Guetterman lacked aggression last year and 
shipped him out three weeks into the season. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was traded, I was told I'd have every opportunity to be a starter and 
I opened the year in the bullpen," Guetterman said. "Then I was gone after one 
bad game. When something like that happens, you start to wonder, 'What are they 
doing?' You start to think you have to be perfect every time out or you'll lose 
your job." 
</P>
<P>
If Green had any preconceived notions about Guetterman, they were positive. 
After all, Green's pitching coach is Billy Connors, something of a guru for 
Guetterman, who was 11-4 as a starter with the Seattle Mariners in 1987 when 
Connors was Seattle's pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day of camp, Lee asked if he should talk to Dallas about his role," 
Connors said. "I told him to just get people out. That would determine his 
role. Lee hasn't backed off. He's gone after the hitters and gotten ground 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
Connors kept reminding Green how well Guetterman was pitching this spring, but 
it wasn't until Guidry went down that the manager began to take a closer look 
at Guetterman for the job as left-handed long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, that role would not have interested Guetterman, a starter in 
the minors and for most of '87. That year, he was 8-1 at the All-Star break but 
was shifted to the bullpen after losing three of his next four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee won five in a row and then lost his command," Connors recalled. "He seemed 
afraid to let the guys hit the ball. That's trouble for a sinkerball pitcher. 
What was worse was his mental block about relieving. It took a long time for 
him to realize flexibility is a great asset for a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Guetterman, a devout Baptist, relied on his religious faith and the support of 
his wife, Drew, to overcome what he calls "the reliever-starter syndrome" that 
threatened to end his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize now it doesn't matter where you pitch as long as it's in the big 
leagues," he said. "It seemed like nobody was on my side, except my wife. To go 
through this was a trial, not only for me but for my wife and family. The 
stabilizing factor was the work of God."

ROSE LINKED TO POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS

<P>
Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds allowed a Montreal hotelman linked to 
gambling into the Reds' spring training clubhouse, the Dayton Daily News 
reported Friday, which if true is a violation of major league rules. 
</P>
<P>
Rules issued by the commissioner's office and the National League prohibit 
anyone not connected with baseball or the media from being in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Another Rose friend, convicted in Massachusetts of bookmaking, received the 
team discount at a Plant City, Fla., hotel for eight days during spring 
training -- a discount only the team can authorize, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Red traveling secretary Dan Lunetta confirmed that Joseph Cambra received the 
discount during his stay March 18-26. He also said he must approve the special 
rate but doesn't recall if Rose asked for Cambra's discount. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's investigation of Rose's gambling activities was reported on March 
20. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of reservations at the Plant City Holiday Inn this spring," 
Lunetta told the newspaper. "If I think a request from somebody on our staff is 
legitimate, I get them the rate. Joe Cambra doesn't mean anything to me. I just 
don't want to be in a position to put Pete Rose in a bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said Rene Longpre, manager of the Manoir Lemoyne hotel in 
Montreal, visited Rose in Florida during spring training and was in the Plant 
City clubhouse on at least two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
National League rules state: "No persons shall be admitted to the team 
clubhouse, or permitted to enter or visit the bench, except accredited 
photographers and accredited representatives of the press, radio and 
television." 
</P>
<P>
According to this week's issue of Sports Illustrated, Longpre got to know Rose 
when Rose played for the Montreal Expos in 1984 and placed bets with bookies 
for Rose on hockey and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to Longpre for comment were not returned. A spokeswoman for the Manoir 
Lemoyne said Longpre would not be at the hotel Friday and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Reds general manager Murray Cook, who once held the same position with the 
Expos, said he is acquainted with Longpre. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a straight guy, as far as I'm concerned," Cook was quoted as saying. "I 
saw him this spring. He visits Pete a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Longpre, Arnold Metz and Mario Nunez were visitors in Rose's 
clubhouse office this spring, the newspaper said. Rose has acknowledged that 
Metz and Nunez placed bets for him -- bets he said are legal. 
</P>
<P>
As to Cambra, the newspaper said it was told by the source: "The commissioner, 
of course, wouldn't approve of Pete Rose associating with Joseph Cambra or 
anyone else involved in professional gambling, past or present." 
</P>
<P>
Front-desk personnel at the Holiday Inn confirmed that Cambra was at the hotel 
on a team rate from March 18 to March 26, the newspaper reported. The hotel's 
team rate is $35 instead of $65. 
</P>
<P>
Cambra has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cambra's name surfaced earlier this week in Boston, where both the Globe and 
the Herald quoted unidentified sources as saying that Cambra showed several 
people in the Fall River-Somerset area a 1975 World Series ring and said it was 
given to him by Rose.

SCOTT IS GREAT, SO IS 'WHAT'S-HIS-NAME' AS DODGERS FALL, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Lasorda may want to reconsider his diet. As fast as he's dropping pounds, 
Dodger batting averages are dropping even faster. 
</P>
<P>
At least, Dodger pitcher Mike Morgan had an excuse for striking out twice 
Friday night in the Dodgers' 3-2 loss to the Houston Astros. In 11 years of pro 
ball, Morgan had never picked up a bat in a big league game that counted. And 
here he was, in his National League debut, facing Mike Scott, the most 
accomplished split-fingered pitcher in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"It was now you see it, now you don't," Morgan said, shaking his head. "He 
abused me, and then he got a hit off me, too." 
</P>
<P>
These days, you don't have to be a card-carrying magician to make Dodger bats 
disappear. Against Scott, who can turn even the hottest-hitting teams into 
putty, the Dodgers -- who now have five regulars hitting less than Lasorda 
weighs (he's down to 198) -- were clearly overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Eddie Murray's two-run home run in the first inning, the Dodgers' 
only hope of overtaking the Astros was the sudden seizure of wildness that 
struck Scott in the bottom of the eighth, after a home run by Ken Caminiti, the 
unknown batsman, had given the Astros a 3-2 lead in the top of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a bad pitch to the third baseman -- what's his name?" said Morgan, who 
must have missed Caminiti's RBI double off Tim Belcher the day before. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw a 1-1 changeup, I threw it a little harder than I wanted to and I got 
it up," Morgan said. "If I'd gotten it away, he might have popped it up. But 
where I threw it, even I as a pitcher might have hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
Scott had allowed just two base-runners after the first inning and had not 
walked a batter until the eighth, when he gave up a pinch single to Mike Davis. 
Scott struck out Willie Randolph, his ninth strikeout victim, but then 
proceeded to throw 11 straight balls -- four to Kirk Gibson as pinch-runner 
Mariano Duncan stole second base, four to Mike Marshall to load the bases, and 
three to Murray, who just Monday night hit his 15th grand slam, most of any 
active major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a pretty inning," admitted Scott, who knew he was on his own 
because the Astro bullpen had been used up in Houston's 15-inning win the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"I had about six guys in the pen say to me, 'Go nine,' even before I left the 
clubhouse. That put a lot of pressure on me." 
</P>
<P>
On him? Imagine the strain Art Howe, Houston's new manager, was feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, (Scott) just wanted to see if he could make me lose any more hair," said 
Howe, who favors the Telly Savalas look. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, of course, seemed ideally suited for Murray, with his .400-plus 
batting average when the bases are loaded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware of Eddie Murray," Howe said. "I saw him for four years in the 
American League. When he's got the other uniform on, it's never a day at the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't buy this April slump stuff, either." 
</P>
<P>
After taking a strike, Murray swung at Scott's sinker and hit a ground ball 
that sent Glenn Davis staggering. But the Astro first baseman not only kept his 
feet, he kept his head, flipping the ball to Scott, covering, to retire Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough ball, definitely," Davis said. "It had a lot of English on it. 
A hit like that doesn't bounce, it shoots off the ground, and you can't run up 
and charge it. I didn't get my glove back as far as I wanted to, and it almost 
shot by me." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't, however, and one last shot by a Dodger pinch-hitter -- Franklin 
Stubbs' two-out single in the ninth -- went for naught when pinch-hitter Mickey 
Hatcher flied to center field to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Dodgers' fourth in a row, a negative streak eclipsing any that 
took place last season. And just as on Thursday, when Murray's error in the 
15th led to the deciding runs, another Dodger error figured prominently in the 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
This one was committed by center fielder John Shelby, who charged Rafael 
Ramirez's single in the sixth and heaved it like a javelin into the Dodger 
dugout, allowing Gerald Young to score and sending Ramirez to third. Billy 
Hatcher's sacrifice fly scored Ramirez, tying the score at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was running on the play," said Young, one of the fastest players in the 
league, "and I peeked and saw he'd hit a line drive. There was no need for me 
to stop at second, so I kept going. It was a situation where I was gambling, 
hoping for a bad throw." 
</P>
<P>
He got it, which meant the end of the one-hit shutout that Morgan took into the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not swinging the bats right now, that's obvious," Morgan said. "But 
we're a good team. We should come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite his injuries, Kirk Gibson started Friday night, got two singles, stole 
a base, scored a run and walked. . . . Dodger second baseman Willie Randolph 
entered Friday's game without an error, handling 47 chances without a misplay. 
. . . Center fielder John Shelby became the first Dodger to reach double 
figures in strikeouts when he struck out twice against Mike Scott. That made it 
11 strikeouts in 38 at-bats for Shelby, a ratio of one strikeout per 3.5 
at-bats. Last season, Shelby's ratio of 1 strikeout per 4.3 plate appearances 
made him the easiest player in the league to strike out. . . . Orel Hershiser 
(1-1) is scheduled to face Houston's Bob Knepper (0-2) this afternoon at 1:05, 
the game to be televised by Channel 4. Knepper, who started last season 6-0 
with an 0.89 earned-run average, has given up 10 runs in 8 2/3 innings this 
season. . . . Subscribers to Z channel, the cable outlet, now have the option 
of picking up an audio feed in Spanish, with broadcasters Rene Cardenas and 
Jaime Jarrin. . . . Thursday's 15-inning game almost kept Astro Coach Yogi 
Berra from making his scheduled appearance on "The Pat Sajak Show." The TV 
people finally made arrangements for Berra, who is promoting a book, to be 
taken from the ballpark to the studio by helicopter. When Berra was told that 
Sajak's people were panicking, he said: "They're nervous? I've never flown in a 
helicopter. What if I fall out?"

LEONARD'S SLAM PUTS ANGELS IN A SLING, 9-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Flap no longer comes down when Jeffrey Leonard taxis around the bases after 
a home run. Different league, different calling card. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Sling is the thing. Serve up a home run to Seattle's new left fielder 
today and you'll have to bear watching him milk it by carrying his left arm in 
a crook, as if it's set in a plaster cast. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Mike Witt got to check it out for the first time Friday night and 
it wasn't a pretty sight, particularly when three other Mariners slinked across 
the plate before the Sling. 
</P>
<P>
When is a home-run trot more than just a home-run trot? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes after a grand slam that obliterates a 3-0 Angel lead and sends 
the Mariners on their way to a 9-5 victory before 14,590 fans at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Things had been going so well for the Angels, too. They scored three times in 
the second inning against Seattle's overpowering Mark Langston, who shut them 
out on six hits a week ago. They managed four hits in the inning, including a 
double high off the right-field wall by Dante Bichette, a run-scoring single by 
Brian Downing and a two-run single by Mark McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of excited," Angel catcher Lance Parrish said. "Langston is awful 
tough. To get three runs off him like that, I felt like we were in the driver's 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad a traffic jam had to break out in the bottom of the third. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Witt surrendered a single to Harold Reynolds, who moved to second 
when Angel third baseman Jack Howell fielded Ken Griffey Jr.'s ground ball and 
fired high and late to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Witt walked Alvin Davis, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Then he made one pitch to Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
The Sling was soon in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard hit the ball over the left-center-field fence, nearly launching it 400 
feet, nearly sinking the good ship USS Mariner, the miniature clipper that 
sends off a cannon blast with every Seattle home run. 
</P>
<P>
The powder burns were felt as far as the Angel dugout, where Manager Doug Rader 
was quick to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, you score that many runs off Mark Langston, you better 
take advantage of it," Rader said glumly. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels eventually scored five runs against Langston (2-1), but the final 
two came in the ninth inning, after the Mariners had scored three times in the 
eighth to open a 9-3 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard's slam effectively floored the Angels, who responded to the home run by 
managing one baserunner in their next five innings against Langston. 
</P>
<P>
They also struck out 10 times -- Howell three by himself -- as Langston reached 
double figures in strikeouts for the 28th time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"He got tougher as the game went on," Parrish said. "Even on his bad days, he 
looks great." 
</P>
<P>
Witt, meanwhile, continued to flounder. He surrendered two more runs on three 
hits in the fourth inning and left with one out in the eighth, having yielded a 
double to Mickey Brantley and a run-scoring single to Dave Valle. 
</P>
<P>
En route to his second loss in three decisions, Witt allowed 11 hits and seven 
runs (six earned) in 7 1/3 innings, an outing that raised his earned-run 
average to 5.48. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explains Witt's trials and troubles, Rader furrowed a brow. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to have decent stuff," Rader said. "I think it's the same old story 
-- you let the wrong people get on, you get caught up in the wrong sequencing 
and you're asking for trouble. You put yourself in a compromising situation." 
</P>
<P>
Witt's third-inning walk to Davis, Rader said, forced him to make the 
back-breaking compromise to Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, it's natural to try to be too careful," Rader said. "You 
try to make a pitch a little better than adequate, you get a pitch over the 
plate and they put the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
"Put the ball in play in this ballpark and things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Or if you put it out of play, as Leonard did. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, of course, did not struggle alone. Howell had a rough night on the turf, 
too, going hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts -- lowering his 
batting average to .118 -- while committing the third-inning throwing error and 
not covering third base quickly enough on a fourth-inning stolen base by 
Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
But on this evening, with silver linings few and far between, Rader singled out 
Howell's final at-bat in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Howell finally made contact, hitting a fly ball to left field against Seattle 
reliever Mike Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
"He battled like a dog his last time up," Rader said. "It would've been easy 
for him to throw in the towel right there. But he never quit. If he keeps 
working at it like that, he's going to dig his way out of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Solace is taken where you can find it, one supposes. And after Leonard did his 
Sling, the Angels found the pickings very slim. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield update: Friday's bone scan showed no rib fracture, but the Angel 
shortstop will still be sidelined at least a week with what was diagnosed as a 
first-degree strain of the right pectoral muscle. (Strains are graded from 
first to third degrees, first being the least severe.) He is scheduled to be 
re-examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum Tuesday and could miss the 
Angels' 10-day trip through Seattle, Chicago and Oakland. For the time being, 
however, the Angels are not planning to place Schofield on the disabled list, 
which would make him ineligible for 15 days. "I think we've just got to put up 
with this for a week," Manager Doug Rader said. "I think we've got to gamble 
here. Maybe he won't take a full two weeks to get back." 
</P>
<P>
Without Schofield, Rader will use Glenn Hoffman and rookie Kent Anderson, 
recalled Thursday from triple-A Edmonton, at shortstop. To make room for 
Anderson, the Angels reassigned reliever Vance Lovelace to Edmonton, thus 
ending Rader's 10-day experiment with an 11-man pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder started at first base for the Angels because Rader wanted to 
spare Wally Joyner the agony of having to bat against Seattle left-hander Mark 
Langston. "Cruel and unusual punishment," Rader quipped. Joyner has a career 
batting average of .130 against Langston, managing three hits in 23 at-bats.

OSTLER'S ASSESSMENT MAY HAVE MISSED MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I deeply resent Scott Ostler's comparison of Dennis Conner winning the match 
race against New Zealand to Ben Johnson winning the Olympic 100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner is a dedicated sportsman, who is an almost paranoid 
perfectionist. He is, even by most of his competitors, rated as the top sailor 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
To accuse him of cheating is one of the most absurd statements I've ever heard. 
To say that he answered Michael Fay in kind is closer to the truth.

HE MASTERED THE GAME WITHOUT WINNING MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commentator Byron Nelson's remarks that a golfer couldn't be judged great 
unless he has won a Masters title are rather snobbish and untrue. 
</P>
<P>
I think the British Open, which is not on the same course every year and is 
especially tough for Americans, is an even greater test. Lee Trevino won 
back-to-back British Opens in 1971 and '72. He also has won two PGA titles and 
two U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino will go down in my book as a great golfer, and one with a great sense 
of humor as well.

Jim Murray, in an otherwise excellent column on Parnelli Jones quitting racing 
at the peak of his career, says that "Only one other man, also a Jones -- Bobby 
-- had ever quit at the height of his powers in this way." 
</P>
<P>
But Murray seems to have missed another one who quit at the top. Try this: a 
three-time Cy Young Award winner in his last four years in the majors. In these 
four years, his records were 25-5, 19-5, 26-8 and 27-9. The ERAs were 1.88, 
1.74, 2.04 and 1.73. In each of his last two years, he had more than 300 
innings pitched and more than 300 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
During these four years he won four World Series games and lost two. In the 
Series at one point he had 27 consecutive shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
In his final official major league (World Series) game, his center fielder made 
three errors in one inning, two of them on one play. In the four-game Series, 
his teammates amassed 14 hits and two runs. They ended the Series with 33 
scoreless innings in support of their pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The (final year): 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher: Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
His age: 30.

TRAINER HARVEY VANIER TRIES TO WIN ANOTHER BLUE GRASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to find veteran trainer Harvey Vanier around Keeneland in the morning is 
easy. Just look for the guy with the oldest down jacket and the most beat-up 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the nicest guy on the backstretch. Harvey Lawrence Vanier, who will turn 
65 next Friday, may never hit the pages of Gentleman's Quarterly, but at the 
race track he is the gentleman's gentleman. Vanier has heard discouraging 
words, but he's never said one. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time this decade, the avuncular, congenial Vanier, of Waterloo, 
Ill., will try to win Keeneland's Blue Grass Stakes when he saddles Western 
Playboy, the even-money favorite, in today's $250,000 running of the 1 1/8-mile 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated Dispersal, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, is also in the 
six-horse field, along with trainer Rusty Arnold's entry of Feather Ridge and 
Tricky Creek, and Revive and Arcadia Falls, a couple of 3-year-olds that have 
been running at nearby Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Blue Grass, which except for three World War II years has been 
run the week before the Kentucky Derby, is now being run three weeks ahead, 
because Keeneland officials felt that the race was drawing weak fields in 
recent years. The Blue Grass is the next-to-last major prep for the Derby, the 
last being the Wood Memorial next Saturday at Aqueduct, where Derby favorite 
Easy Goer will make his final appearance before running at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Blue Grass has produced only two Kentucky Derby winners, Gato 
Del Sol winning at Louisville after finishing second here, and Alysheba taking 
the Derby after he finished first and was disqualified to third place by the 
Keeneland stewards for causing interference in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Vanier won the 1983 Blue Grass with Play Fellow, a 19-1 shot, after the roguish 
Marfa, the Santa Anita Derby winner, who was favored, tried to demolish all 
comers in one of the roughest runnings of the race. Marfa, who lost by a nose, 
was disqualified to fourth place, and his victims were still feeling his sting 
when the Derby was run nine days later. 
</P>
<P>
Copelan, who led the Blue Grass until Marfa stormed into the picture, finished 
fourth and was too banged up to make the Derby. Desert Wine was third here and 
second in the Derby, and Play Fellow ran sixth at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny's Halo, trained by David Cross, won that Derby. "It was a pleasure to 
look at many of those horses in the paddock at Churchill Downs and see that 
they were too worn out to beat us," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a capacity field of 20 in the 1983 Derby, and Play Fellow needed to 
win the Blue Grass in order to have enough earnings to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Play Fellow, whose career ended when he was injured while running in the 
Hollywood Gold Cup the following year, sired Western Playboy, who'll give 
Vanier another shot at winning the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse is as good as his sire," Vanier said. "He's getting better all the 
time, and he's got more confidence than he used to have. He'll try to go 
through holes that he wouldn't have tried in the past. We don't have to win 
here to go in the Derby, but he's got to give me a strong finish, at least, for 
us to go. If he would be, say, a fading second, then we'd forget about the 
Derby." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first race of his life last October at Keeneland, Western 
Playboy had two seconds and a first on off tracks at Churchill Downs in 
November. Sent to Florida for the winter, he started coughing, developed a 
virus and ran a temperature at Gulfstream Park and Vanier lost some time with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In his first start as a 3-year-old, Western Playboy ran second to Dixieland 
Brass in the Hutcheson, then he was fifth -- refusing to go for a small hole 
coming into the stretch -- in the Fountain of Youth. Sent off at 31-1 in the 
Florida Derby, he was a late-running second, five lengths behind Mercedes Won. 
Today, he'll try to use the same style to overhaul the speedy Dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Western Playboy caught another off track at Turfway Park in the 
Jim Beam, which was the same distance as the Blue Grass. He won by 1 1/2 
lengths, tying the track record with a time of 1:49. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day rode Western Playboy in the Florida Derby and the Beam, but he is 
committed to Easy Goer, so for today Vanier has hired Randy Romero to ride his 
chestnut for the first time. Romero's Kentucky Derby horse was supposed to be 
Dixieland Brass, but he went lame in the Florida Derby and has been retired to 
stud. Romero also rode Feather Ridge in the Beam. 
</P>
<P>
The other morning here, as Romero rode the Illinois-bred Western Playboy to the 
track for a half-mile workout, he gave himself a history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"An Illinois-bred ever win the Derby?" Romero asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Dust Commander," said Nancy Vanier, Harvey's wife and assistant trainer, 
and part-owner of Western Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
"Dust Commander, huh," Romero said. That was in 1970, when a 12-year-old Romero 
was racing Shetland ponies at his father's farm and fooling with quarter horses 
down in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, and Hawkster, fourth in the 
race, are scheduled to share a plane to Louisville next Friday, which will give 
them two weeks at Churchill Downs prior to the Kentucky Derby. Hawkster, 
besides breaking through the gate prior to the start of the Santa Anita Derby, 
also bled slightly in the race and will be able to run on a diuretic that's 
permitted for certified bleeders in Kentucky. Sunday Silence breezed three 
furlongs in :37 3/5 Friday morning at Santa Anita and will work five-eighths of 
a mile there next week before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Militron, winner of the Cherry Hill Mile, runs today in the Garden State 
Stakes, a 1 1/8-mile minor Kentucky Derby prep at Garden State Park. . . . 
There's a chance for rain today at Keeneland, with temperatures in the low 60s.

WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
TRAINER CANANI SEEKS A PAIR OF STAKES VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Julio Canani, third on the national money list despite having run 
horses in only 65 races this year, has two excellent chances to solidify his 
position this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Canani, whose horses have earned $1.1 million according to Daily Racing Form 
statistics through March, will be at Oaklawn Park today and back at his home 
base, Santa Anita, Sunday. Today, he runs Martial Law, the upset winner of the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap, in the $400,000 Oaklawn Handicap; Sunday, 
he'll saddle Maria Jesse, winner of the Santa Ana Handicap, in the $150,000 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law, who has accounted for about half of Canani's purses this year, 
faces a tough assignment against seven other horses, including Blushing John, 
Proper Reality and another shipper, Slew City Slew. Proper Reality will carry 
high weight of 121 pounds, four more than Martial Law. 
</P>
<P>
Running against Maria Jesse in the mile turf race for fillies and mares Sunday 
will be Claire Marine, Fitzwilliam Place, Carmanetta, Daloma, Pen Bal Lady and 
Double Wedge. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine, Fitzwilliam Place and Daloma are trained by Charlie Whittingham 
and will be an entry in the betting. Whittingham is busy on other fronts this 
weekend, running Rosadora in her American debut today in the Santa Lucia 
Handicap at Santa Anita and sending Forlitano to Florida to run in the 
Bougainvillea Handicap at Hialeah. Whittingham is second on the trainers' 
national money list with $1.7 million, behind Wayne Lukas. BILL CHRISTINE

IS IT TRUE IS LAST IN COMEBACK RACE AT SANTA ANITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is It True, who beat Kentucky Derby favorite Easy Goer last Nov. 5 in the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile race, ran for the first time since then Friday, 
finishing fifth and last in the eighth race at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Is It True suffered a knee injury and had surgery after his Breeder's Cup 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Laffit Pincay, Is It True was outrun early, went wide down the 
backstretch and faded in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant Pete, with Gary Stevens aboard, led throughout to win the $37,000 race 
by a half-length. Roman Avie, under Patrick Valenzuela, was second, 1 1/4 
lengths in front of Yes I'm Blue, ridden by Robbie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant Pete covered the six furlongs in 1:08 2/5 for his third win in five 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Sent off the third choice by bettors in a crowd of 22,880, Valiant Pete paid 
$10.40, $6 and $3. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Avie returned $6.20 and $3, and Yes I'm Blue paid $2.80 to show.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

STEWART AND PERRY MATCH 67S, REMAIN TIED FOR HERITAGE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Payne Stewart and Kenny Perry shot four-under-par 67s and remained tied for the 
lead in Friday's second round of the $800,000 Heritage golf tournament at 
Hilton Head Island, S.C., while Masters champion Nick Faldo shot a 77 and 
barely made the cut at 145. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo had double bogeys on the seventh and eighth holes, hitting into the trees 
and the water. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Perry led at 132, three strokes ahead of Rocco Mediate, who shot a 
68, and Mark McCumber, who birdied seven of the last 12 holes for a 64, best 
round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo was not alone with his problems. Defending champion Greg Norman shot a 72 
for a 149 total and missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
PGA champion Jeff Sluman improved 12 strokes from an opening 79 to a 67 but 
failed to qualify at 146. Sandy Lyle of Scotland, a former British Open and 
Masters champion, and U.S. Open titleholder Curtis Strange also missed. Lyle 
shot a 71 for a 146 total, and Strange shot a 73 for a 147 total. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player shot a three-under-par 69 to tie Gene Littler for the lead at 136 
after two rounds of the Tradition at Scottsdale, Ariz., a new $600,000 
tournament on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Littler, seeking his 11th career Senior title, shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Erickson, 63, a non-winner on the tour, was third at 139 after a 70.

MURPHY RESTORES BASEBALL AT NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The once moribund Notre Dame baseball program has been a regular member of the 
Collegiate Baseball Top 30 poll this season under Pat Murphy, who is in his 
second season as coach after spending two seasons at Claremont-Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is jazzed up about baseball," said Murphy, whose team is ranked 27th 
this week with a 24-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 30, might not make anyone forget Knute Rockne, or Lou Holtz for that 
matter, but he already has achieved several notable milestones -- including the 
signing of pitcher Pat Leahy, the grandson of Notre Dame football coaching 
legend Frank Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who in 1986 led Claremont-Mudd to its first Southern California 
Interscholastic Athletic Conference championship in 11 years, inherited a team 
that was 15-29 in 1987 and engineered a 39-22 finish last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Murphy arranged for the Miami baseball team to accompany its 
football team to South Bend for what Murphy promoted as, "The Battle before the 
War." 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish swept a two-game exhibition series and then proved it was no 
fluke by defeating the 14th-ranked Hurricanes, 4-2, in Miami last month. 
Tentative plans have been made for the USC baseball team to accompany the 
Trojan football team to South Bend in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame also has a 12-9 road win over 10th-ranked Texas to its credit. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the Notre Dame tradition will aid him in recruiting despite the 
built-in handicaps of the school's rigorous academic entrance requirements and 
funding for only four scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"We're recruiting 365 days a year in all 50 states," Murphy said. "Don't tell 
me I can't come to Los Angeles and get a top kid because I'm going to do it. 
You watch." 
</P>
<P>
Sweet stuff: Pat Sweet said he elected to attend Texas A&amp;M over Cal State 
Long Beach and Pepperdine because he wanted to "get away and try something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the weather in College Station, Tex., and his own musical tastes, 
not much has changed for Sweet, a junior left-hander from South Gate who was 
19-4 with a 3.39 earned-run average in two seasons at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet is 7-1 with a 2.95 ERA for Texas A&amp;M (40-1), which is ranked No. 1 in 
the nation for the seventh straight week. 
</P>
<P>
"The humidity gets terrible sometimes down here," Sweet said. "The first time I 
threw here it was like pitching in a steam room. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also into country music now. I used to like new wave bands like Depeche 
Mode and Erasure. But the only thing my roommates play is George Strait and now 
I'm hooked on it." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend Texas A&amp;M plays host to Texas, which has won or shared 10 
consecutive Southwest Conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
Strikeout king: Rick Davis never really considered himself a full-time pitcher 
until he struck out 11 batters in Cal State Dominguez Hills' season-opening win 
over Arizona in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of opened my eyes," said Davis, a senior right-hander who played 
shortstop last season. "At that point I was still thinking about shortstop . . 
. The next thing I know, I would never see the field again." 
</P>
<P>
Good thing for Davis, who batted .220 and committed 27 errors last season. But 
bad news for opposing hitters who have been unable to handle Davis' knuckle 
curve. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who went to Upland High and transferred to Dominguez Hills from Mt. San 
Antonio College, leads the nation in strikeouts with 126 in 104 innings. He is 
5-4 with a 2.84 ERA and has allowed 74 hits and 47 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Have a nice weekend: During Cal State Fullerton's three-game Big West 
Conference series at UC Santa Barbara last weekend, Fullerton first baseman 
David Staton got 10 consecutive hits, which tied the school record shared by 
Brent Mayne and Tom Thomas. Staton's hit parade included five home runs, two 
doubles and 14 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't looking for any particular pitch," said Staton, a junior from Tustin 
who is batting .364 with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs. "Anything that came up 
there, I hit. It's that type of situation where it didn't matter what they 
threw.

UCLA TRACK TEAM WILL FACE BIG TEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's four-year dual meet winning streak in track and field will be in 
jeopardy at Drake Stadium today when the Bruins face Louisiana State and 
Houston in a double dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has won 41 straight dual meets, one short of the school record set in 
1972-76. To break the record, the Bruins would have to beat both LSU and 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Bob Larsen said he is not optimistic, particularly when discussing 
LSU, because of injuries to three of his best athletes -- quarter-miler Steve 
Lewis, sprinter Mike Marsh and hurdler Derek Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, who ran 10.07 seconds in the 100 meters last weekend at Gainesville, 
Fla., to set the school record, and Knight are expected to compete, although 
the number of their events might be limited, but Lewis, the 1988 Olympic gold 
medalist in the 400 meters, is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably our toughest challenge in the last two years," said Larsen, 
whose record in dual meets as UCLA's coach is 39-0. "Even if our people weren't 
injured, we'd be saying (LSU) was a team capable of staying right with us." 
</P>
<P>
Houston has an improved team led by Leroy Burrell, who recently won the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. indoor championship in the long jump and 
finished second in the 55 meters. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's women also will compete in a double dual meet against LSU and Houston. 
LSU won the national championship last year, beating runner-up UCLA by three 
points. The Tigers are led by sprinter Dawn Sowell, who set the NCAA record in 
the 100 meters last weekend with a 10.93 at the Texas Relays. 
</P>
<P>
Field events will begin at 11:15 a.m., running events at 1:30 p.m. RANDY HARVEY

CUBS BEAT PHILLIES FOR 6TH STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The battle for first place in the Eastern Division of the National League was 
not going on in St. Louis, where the New York Mets were playing the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was being fought out at Philadelphia between the Phillies and the Chicago 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson drove in three runs, and the Cubs beat the Phillies, 6-4, for 
their sixth consecutive victory. Another fine relief performance by the Cubs' 
Mitch Williams enbled them to take a one-game lead over the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Williams retired all five batters he faced to save the win for Scott Sanderson, 
who went 5 1/3 innings in his comeback bid. Williams has saved five games in 
five attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, who missed most of last season with a disk problem, won for the 
first time as a starter since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a curve, slider, changeup, nothing," Sanderson said. "The ball 
felt like ice in my hands. And not because of the weather, either." 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, St. Louis 4 -- The Mets, batting only .216 before the game, raised 
their average 12 points and spoiled the Cardinals' home opener, dropping them 
into last place. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Jefferies' bases-clearing double sparked a seven-run fifth inning to rout 
Joe Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone, who lost only three games last season, evened his record at 1-1, 
although he tired in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, Pittsburgh 6 -- Hot pinch-hitter Wallace Johnson doubled home the 
winning run in the ninth inning at Pittsburgh after the Expos blew an early 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who drove in just two runs with 22 pinch-hits last season, has already 
driven in four runs with two pinch-hits this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was a costly loss for the Pirates. Two regulars, Andy Van Slyke (rib-cage 
injury) and Sid Bream (knee injury), had to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 6, Cincinnati 5 -- Jack Clark hit his first home run for the Padres, 
a three-run shot at San Diego. Luis Salazar's homer proved to be decisive as 
the Padres ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show went seven innings to improve his record to 2-1. Mark Davis, although 
he gave up a run in the ninth and had the tying run at third base, earned the 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has five saves in five chances, same as the Cubs' Williams. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 7, Atlanta 5 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his fourth home run of the 
season and drove in three runs at San Francisco to help the Giants take over 
first place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel overcame a rocky start to improve his record to 3-0. DAN HAFNER

Asking a Dixieland society to play modern jazz is like demanding that a Bach 
society play some Sousa marches. Feather should know that to impose such a 
switch on people who joined a society for a particular style would cause them 
to leave the concert hall or cancel their memberships. You must sell tickets 
and memberships to have a successful jazz society.

JAZZ SOCIETY SPECIALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As president of the Southern California Hot Jazz Society, I feel I must respond 
to Leonard Feather's article about the American Federation of Jazz Societies' 
annual convention ("Societies Lock Horns Over Image," April 3). 
</P>
<P>
Feather seems to feel that vintage jazz styles no longer have anything to do 
with the idiom and that anyone enjoying such music must be ignoring the changes 
that have taken place over the years. 
</P>
<P>
No other art form has to carry the burden of arbitrary obsolescence that 
Feather requires. 
</P>
<P>
Young artists do need to be recognized. But surely we can accomplish this 
without the forced retirements of older artists or those wishing to follow in 
their footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
If Leonard Father were the advocate of jazz that he purports to be, he might 
refrain from taking gratuitous potshots at some of its more accessible 
versions.

Trad, Dixieland, New Orleans and related older jazz forms are more uplifting, 
fun and consistent with the upbeat spirit of the American experience than so 
much of the later, dissonant, brooding jazz that draws inspiration from poppy 
pods and Colombian agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Trad-oriented jazz societies are deeply aware of, and grateful for, the black 
invention of jazz a century ago. Apart from the elderly members of the 
Preservation Hall Jazz Band, there are practically no blacks learning, playing 
or interested in listening to classic jazz, and outreach efforts by clubs like 
ours fall flat. Actually, we're keeping alive benchmark music that blacks have 
abandoned.

FACES: LIFE AFTER THARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Malashock used to be one of Twyla Tharp's vagabonds, a dancer who spent up 
to 150 days on the road each year. But since 1984, Malashock has resettled in 
his native San Diego, founding a four-member company and establishing himself 
as a choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
His 3-year-old Malashock Dance &amp; Co. opens Thursday at the Lyceum Space in 
San Diego for four nights. The company is also set to perform in July at Dance 
Kaleidoscope in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Malashock's reasons for leaving Tharp were many. Married and the father of a 
5-year-old boy, he found the touring stretches impossible and simply did not 
want to absent himself from the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I never really became comfortable with Tharp," he says. "She's not easy 
-- probably no one as brilliant and strong-willed and driven as she is would 
be. By the end we were butting heads. I gained tremendously working with her, 
but there were these other voices inside, strong enough to dictate my decision 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Locating here (San Diego) was my contribution to decentralizing dance. I don't 
believe New York should be the single focus. But what I hope to do with 
audiences, no matter where they are, is engage them on an interpersonal level. 
Surely all of us struggle with the relationships, our need for them and our 
difficulties in maintaining them. 
</P>
<P>
"I still dance," says Malashock, explaining that he is at full-performance tilt 
and, indeed, needs to express himself through movement. "As for my 
choreography, well, I never knew what ideas I had until starting to work 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a chance to work through personal issues," he says. "My 
choreography comes from places within me. It's sincere because I'm not afraid 
to confront the issues. I'm not afraid to admit, for example, my fear of just 
being in the world." DONNA PERLMUTTER

In the performed arts, substance and seriousness are not enough, as listeners 
at the Thursday night subscription concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center found out, again. 
</P>
<P>
With Debussy's languid but demanding "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune" as the 
curtain-raiser, two large-scale works -- contrasting concertos, actually -- 
dominated Andre Previn's latest Philharmonic program (repeated Friday night and 
Sunday afternoon). Before intermission, the subscribers heard the local 
premiere of Steven Stucky's recent Concerto for Orchestra; after, Brahms' 
Second Piano Concerto, with Horacio Gutierrez the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Previn and Gutierrez appear to be sensitive and equal musical partners, and 
their joint efforts on behalf of Brahms' massive B-flat Concerto proved 
admirable in many ways. But this performance never caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Cuban-born musician showed all the musical and technical 
wherewithal for this challenge; his comprehensive technique easily encompassed 
all the hurdles, complexities and knotty passages in the huge canvas. Yet, his 
reading emerged uninspired, and lacked any compelling sense of motion. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez certainly surveyed the lyric moments thoroughly and with loving 
hands; a veteran listener felt he was hearing certain passages clearly for the 
first time. And together, pianist and conductor, aided most carefully by the 
orchestra, probed and caressed every little part of Brahms' big score. 
</P>
<P>
But no amount of collegiality seemed able to get this performance off the 
ground. It moved, if not slowly, then in stately dignity, from beginning to 
end. And the lack of fire cannot be blamed on the composer. 
</P>
<P>
Stucky's Concerto for Orchestra turned out to be colorful but undramatic, 
short-seeming but actually 28 minutes in length. Something Oriental -- nothing 
overt or analyzable -- flavors its three contrasting movements. In his 
fascinating program note, the 39-year-old composer acknowledges that his method 
of organizing this piece created compositional modules rather than a genuine 
continuity. That is both the charm and the weakness of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinating sounds from a number of inner orchestral ensembles keep the 
listener engaged, and the piece ends before one's interest wanes. But any sense 
of arrival, or of direction or climax, seems never to appear. At the final 
plop, one feels only that the wandering is over -- not completed. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the work a concerto is that it is showy, outgoing, concerned with 
display, and that it exists, as the astrologists say, "above the horizon." 
Also, it never rests, or seems to stop strutting its stuff. Tonality and 
atonality co-habitate its space comfortably; Stucky's musical language emerges 
attractive, if not always pretty, yet he is clearly capable of creating 
feelings of Angst, frustration and conflict through purely tonal means. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, under Previn's confident guidance, gave an interested and 
thoroughgoing reading. Oddly, the Thursday night audience, which usually makes 
up its mind quickly about a new work, responded only tepidly to this one. 
</P>
<P>
Debussy's familiar Prelude opened the program appropriately, in a lush, rich 
and immaculate rendering which showed the Philharmonic at its most balanced.

CELEBRATING CHAPLIN CENTENARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood Heritage and the Silent Society join forces Sunday at 6 p.m. to 
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Charles Chaplin with a 
screening of the rarely seen, 12-minute "How to Make a Movie" (1918) and a 
final public showing of "The Kid" (1921), which along with the other Chaplin 
classics will be out of theatrical release for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Along with ceremonies in which Chaplin's son Sydney will participate, the films 
will be presented at the Chaplin Stage at A&amp;M Records on La Brea and De 
Longpre avenues, site of the original Chaplin Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Make a Movie" is part of the treasure trove that Lady Chaplin made 
available to film historians Kevin Brownlow and David Gill for their 
fascinating Thames Television series "The Unknown Chaplin." Outtakes and other 
odd bits and pieces of film that Chaplin had preserved allowed us to witness 
how this perfectionist film maker-clown went about creating his comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Make a Movie," however, is Chaplin's brief, off-the-cuff celebration of 
the opening of his new studio and as such is probably the most purely joyous 
piece of film he ever shot. He shows us, via time-lapse photography, a citrus 
grove being replaced with a movie studio whose office design he self-mockingly 
calls "Ye Olde English Village" -- and which are remarkably intact today. We 
see the beamingly happy and dapper 29-year-old Chaplin give a pretty girl a 
screen test; put on his "greatest treasures," his famous Tramp shoes, kept in a 
vault, and apply his "Million Dollar Moustache." There are a few bits of 
information about how film is processed in the laboratory, but "How to Make a 
Movie" is all in fun. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kid," which has the airy grace and exuberance of a ballet, introduced the 
late Jackie Coogan, who overnight became the most famous child star of the 
time, and nearly 70 years later both the film and Coogan prove irresistible. 
Coogan plays a 5-year-old, abandoned shortly after birth and rescued by 
Chaplin's inimitable Tramp. The two, happy together, survive by their wits but, 
naturally, this idyllic relationship will soon be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin keeps "The Kid" from becoming too saccharine with his formidable sense 
of humor coupled with the duo's equally impressive resilience. The film lives 
up to its introductory description: "A picture with a smile -- and, perhaps, a 
tear." "The Kid" endures, as do all the Chaplin films, because of Chaplin's 
unique eloquence and impeccable timing. Note: a teen-aged Lita Grey, who became 
Chaplin's second wife and the mother of his two eldest sons, can be glimpsed 
briefly as a notably flirtatious angel in a dream sequence.

 Krsto Papic's scathing memory-film of life in a teacher's school in the 1950s, 
and of the symbiotic relationship between a rebellious young student and his 
uncle, a charismatic Party leader, gets high marks for political audacity and 
independence, medium ones on dramatic execution and psychological edge. Papic 
keeps building toward an explosion of outrage. But, since this isn't an 
American vigilante thriller the combustion never quite arrives. MICHAEL

 Sassy and sensual, this adaptation of Gina Wendkos' play about a California 
trailer court couple -- a very pregnant wife, an unemployed philandering 
husband -- becomes a deeply touching affair. It's partly because of Dana 
Anderson as the nagging, loving wife and John M. Jackson as the exasperated 
husband, as well as bubble-gum-voiced Yeardly Smith as his baby-doll mistress. 
The film's other pluses come from director Rafal Zielinski, cinematographer 
Yuri Neyman ("Liquid Sky"), and the great blues score by Willie Dixon.

 Co-director Sergei Paradjanov ("Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors," "The Color of 
Pomegranates") has created another rapturously strange, eccentric fairy tale: a 
poor minstrel's 7-year odyssey to prevent his loved one from forced marriage by 
her Turkish merchant father. This simple story becomes a visual feast, filled 
with fruits, silks, castles, camels, birds, magical landscapes, mysterious 
hills and plains -- as Paradjanov and co-director David Abachidze give us the 
tale in painterly images, constant music and two layers of narration and mime. 
Great: my nominee, among those I saw, for the Festival's most extraordinary 
film. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

 Haiti's Duvalier dictatorship survived as long as it did in part by exploiting 
the population's widespread regard for and fear of voodoo, which should make 
interesting documentary fodder. But this grim, elliptical compendium of 
recollections of unpleasantness among the peasants, directed by Jac Avila and 
Vanyoska Gee, is more often simply ominous and confusing. CHRIS WILLMAN

composes the love-epistles for both members of an impassioned couple, even as 
he falls helplessly in love with the woman. Of all AFI/LA FilmFest's Marquez 
films, this is the simplest and gentlest: a touching idea, exquisitely 
realized. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

 Stanley Kwan's sophisticated ghost story begins with perfumed scenes of 1936 
passion between a performer-courtesan and her wealthy lover. Then we're in the 
present as the courtesan's ghost wanders through cold, neon-lit streets in 
search of her lover -- who has yet to show in the afterlife. Kwan ("Love Unto 
Waste") manipulates the dialectics of past and present, modernity and 
tradition, love and death obviously, but with irony and intelligence; the 
climax is a stunner. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

AIR CRASH VERDICT PROVIDES A SENSE OF RELIEF FOR SCARRED NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>

<P>
Relief washed across Maggie Prendiz's face like an incoming tide. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness!" she exclaimed on hearing news of the verdict in a federal 
trial to place blame in the 1986 midair collision between a single-engine plane 
and an Aeromexico jetliner in the skies above Cerritos. The crippled DC-9 fell 
like a rock into the quiet, upper-middle-class neighborhood where Prendiz 
lived, destroying her family's home of 16 years in a flash of flame. 
</P>
<P>
For Prendiz, the daily news accounts of the trial in a Los Angeles courtroom 
had kept alive the unsettling memory of that Labor Day weekend disaster. The 
jury's verdict, she said, finally ends a difficult chapter in her family's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been such a long, emotional trial for some of us," Prendiz said Friday 
as she stood in the driveway of her rebuilt home in the 17900 block of Holmes 
Avenue. "I'm just glad it's over. Maybe now we can stop watching this thing on 
TV. I know I'll rest easier tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming sleepless nights, frayed nerves and the loss of loved ones in the 
wake of the Aeromexico air disaster has been slow but steady for Prendiz and 
her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the physical restoration of the neighborhood of stucco homes and 
neatly clipped lawns on the east side of Cerritos has gone better than the 
psychological recovery of residents. 
</P>
<P>
All but of one of the 17 homes badly damaged or destroyed in the fiery crash of 
Aeromexico Flight 498 have been rebuilt or repaired. Fresh asphalt covers the 
scars left by the plane's fuselage as it showered down on Holmes Avenue, 
Ashworth Place and Reva Circle. New trees planted along the area's sidewalks 
are sprouting spring growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4 Million Damage 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the neighborhood hardly resembles the chaotic scene of Aug. 31, 
1986, when 82 people, 15 of them on the ground, were killed here in the worst 
air disaster in Los Angeles County history. Damage to the neighborhood alone 
was nearly $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't know it happened here, you'd never know," said John Augustine, 
whose home on Reva Circle sustained only minor damage. "Yet, nearly three years 
later, we still get people driving around, pointing at the sky, their mouths 
wide open. I guess we'll always be an attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding has engendered a closeness among many residents in the ethnically 
mixed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Among those who have stayed, there is a feeling we survived something 
together," said John O'Neill, a college student who was out buying ice for his 
sister's birthday party when the jetliner crashed down two homes away from his 
parent's house. "It was an incredible few days, and you got know your neighbors 
real well. . . . The new people who have moved here just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, like others in the neighborhood, applauded the jury's decision to 
blame the calamity equally on the Federal Aviation Administration and the pilot 
of the private plane that hit the DC-9. He said the small plane had clearly 
drifted into air space restricted for commercial airline traffic and federal 
officials failed to spot the intrusion and warn the Aeromexico flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a just verdict," O'Neill said. "But in the end, what does it 
really prove? It can't turn back the clock." 
</P>
<P>
And try as some might, it is difficult to escape reminders of the tragedy. Like 
the bouquets of flowers that mysteriously appear in the night in front of some 
homes. Or the basket of fruit and coins, an American Indian tradition, that is 
placed in front of the home where the Yackytooahnipahs lived on Holmes Avenue. 
Six family members died in that home. 
</P>
<P>
One psychologist believes Friday's verdict may go a long way toward healing 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept Memories Alive 
</P>
<P>
"The trial has been a double-edged sword because it has dredged up a lot of 
memories," said Patrick O'Connor, director of the county's Rio Hondo Mental 
Health Center in Cerritos. "But it may also act like a closure, the end of 
traumatic experience. The verdict brings a sense of finality to the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Prendiz wants to believe that. She and her husband and two children rebuilt and 
moved back to the neighborhood a year ago. At night, when she hears a plane 
overhead, she remembers the family photos and mementos she lost. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, we sat down as a family and talked long and hard about leaving," 
she recalled. "But this is our home. This is where are children were born. Our 
ties to this neighborhood are too strong. It is our home."

COUNTY ORDERED TO KEEP WILMINGTON MENTAL CLINIC OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest twist in a tangled legal battle, a Superior Court judge Friday 
ordered Los Angeles County officials to keep the Wilmington Mental Health 
Center open, only hours before clinic workers were to permanently vacate the 
psychiatric center. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our boxes here, but we can now stop packing," said a joyful Mary 
Ewing, a psychiatric nurse at the Wilmington clinic, which last saw patients a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start making patient appointments again. That's good news," 
Ewing said after the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patients Notified 
</P>
<P>
More than 120 patients at the Wilmington center had been notified last week 
that they would be transferred to a nearby clinic after county mental health 
officials claimed that safety reasons had forced them to close the facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Barnet M. Cooperman declared Friday that the move 
violates a preliminary injunction barring such closures and admonished the 
county for going ahead with a shutdown plan without court approval. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary injunction, which Cooperman issued last September, prohibits 
the county from closing any clinic until the state Supreme Court can rule on a 
class-action lawsuit filed last summer. Legal Aid attorneys, representing 
indigent mentally ill patients, had filed suit challenging the county's 
original plan to close eight mental health clinics and curtail services at five 
others for budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
After paring the original cut list to three clinics, county officials singled 
out the Wilmington facility -- the county's smallest -- for closure and claimed 
that the action did not violate the court order because it was not being done 
for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman, however, ruled Friday that the county should have sought court 
permission before closing the facility and throwing patients and staff members 
into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can misunderstandings be avoided . . . and persons who are 
patients at this clinic will be protected from these misunderstandings," the 
judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman added that he would consider a request by county officials to modify 
his preliminary injunction and still close the Wilmington clinic. But Mental 
Health Director Roberto Quiroz said late Friday that no decision has been made 
on whether the county would file such a request but that the clinic will reopen 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bunch of Rulings' 
</P>
<P>
"We are being subjected to a whole bunch of rulings and findings totally 
irresponsible in terms of stabilizing our situation in L.A. County," Quiroz 
said, adding that his department would try to comply with the court ruling, 
which includes an order that the county increase security and hire two more 
psychiatric social workers at the Wilmington clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman's ruling came two days after the state Supreme Court refused to block 
the Wilmington closing, concluding that the high court lacked the jurisdiction 
to enforce the preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
But after Legal Aid attorneys turned to Cooperman, the judge ruled that the 
clinic could not be closed without a specific court order or until the state 
Supreme Court had decided the clinics' case. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers were clearly stunned by the judge's decision. Immediately after 
the decision, Roberta Fesler, assistant county counsel, was asked if she had a 
comment. "Not a printable one," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Fesler said the judge's decision was "not warranted" but said the county 
would try to comply with it. However, she raised questions about whether the 
department could find the additional psychiatric social workers ordered by 
Cooperman. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not possible to comply with court order, the ball comes back to our 
court to determine what is the best way to protect the county," Fesler said, 
adding that the county might appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schettler, executive director of the Wilmington facility, took a different 
view, although he said any celebration would be tempered. "It's a relief, but 
it's still momentary. This thing is not yet over," he said. "We can't allow 
ourselves to feel too good about it because don't know what's happening around 
the next turn." 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing came on the same day that a state Senate subcommittee held 
hearings on the proposed closings of the mental health clinics. Testifying 
before members of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, Quiroz called 
the court decision a "hollow victory" for its supporters and warned that the 
county faces even deeper cuts in local programs during the next fiscal year 
because of a bleak state funding picture. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers, including mental health patients and their advocates, pressed 
for additional state funding for the mentally ill. But state Sen. Bill Greene 
(D-Los Angeles), the subcommittee chairman, cautioned that any additional 
funding for the mentally ill would be difficult to obtain.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPANY FINED OVER WASTE WATER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arrowhead Industrial Water company was fined $500,000 Friday after pleading 
no contest to illegally discharging hazardous levels of acidic waste water into 
the Los Angeles sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The company's operations manager, Ray Lamoureux, also pleaded no contest to the 
charge and was sentenced by Superior Court Judge David Horowitz to one year of 
probation and fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said the case against Arrowhead -- which treats 
waste water from other industries at a plant south of downtown Los Angeles -- 
arose from an investigation that began in April, 1988, when the city's 
Sanitation Bureau received information that led to monitoring of the company's 
sewer discharges. A short time later, the city Board of Public Works found the 
company in violation of its permit and sealed the firm's sewer connections for 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead later instituted around-the-clock monitoring of its waste-water 
discharge and also made a substantial investment to prevent future violations, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead Industrial Water also paid a $500,000 fine after it was convicted of 
illegally disposing of hazardous waste in city sewers in 1985.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 8 ARRESTED ON STOLEN PROPERTY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight people have been arrested at a South Los Angeles warehouse where, 
authorities said, more than $500,000 in stolen merchandise was found. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents and Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators took two women and 
six men into custody Thursday for investigation of felony charges of receiving 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise came from at least five cargo containers reportedly stolen from 
cargo terminals or private company loading docks throughout the county, 
sheriff's spokesman Richard Dinsmoor said. 
</P>
<P>
A South Gate businessman had told authorities that he was approached by a 
"broker" who offered to sell personal computer units valued at $500 for only 
$100, officials said. Undercover investigators then contacted the broker and 
requested to buy computers. After the suspect ordered a truck to pick up about 
150 units, investigators followed the truck to the warehouse where the arrests 
were made. 
</P>
<P>
Cargo-container thefts have been increasing in the county, sheriffs 
investigators said. During the last two months of 1988, more than $2 million in 
cargo merchandise was reported stolen in the city of Carson alone, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other suspects were being sought, investigators said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-drug education program taught by Los Angeles police officers at public 
schools has been expanded to include 10 private and parochial schools, and by 
next year as many as 70,000 students in the city's non-public schools could 
participate, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Archbishop Roger M. Mahony 
announced the expansion of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program at 
Normandie Christian School before an auditorium full of fifth- and 
sixth-graders who have attended DARE classes for nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they will offer the program next year to every private and 
parochial school in the city with more than 200 students. The new focus is not 
the result of specific drug problems in the schools, they said, but because 
students from all schools face pressures and temptations that can draw them 
into drug abuse. "Drug abuse is simply nonsectarian," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
The city, along with private and corporate backers of the DARE program, will 
pay for the expansion. The cost will be about $250,000 for five additional 
full-time officers needed next year to teach the program in as many as 162 
private schools.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARSHALL STUDENTS WIN COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-member team from Marshall High School in the Los Feliz area won the 
California State Mock Trial Competition, sponsored by the Constitutional Rights 
Foundation of Los Angeles, which concluded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall played the defense in a mock trial involving drug charges and defeated 
a team from Berkeley High School in Alameda County, said David Tokofsky, one of 
two Marshall teachers who coached the team. Marshall was declared the winner by 
a panel that included Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin and Vance 
Raye, a legal adviser to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful. I was pretty confident we were going to win," said Ana Liza 
Fulay, 17, who played a defense attorney. "I think I got all the experience I 
need to study law." 
</P>
<P>
Fulay and teammates Carlo Brooks, Arisa Mattson and Lola Moon Glaudini also won 
individual awards. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has won the city championship the last two years and came in second in 
the state competition last year. Tokofsky said the team will go to the national 
finals May 11-14 in Louisville, Ky., if it can raise the money for the trip.

MUSEUM STAFF SCRAMBLING TO CLEAN UP AFTER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Museum of Art personnel were scrambling to clean carpets and 
change air-conditioner filters Friday in preparation for today's reopening of a 
popular show of Latino artworks that was closed after a fire in a basement 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
No art was damaged in Thursday's fire in the Robert O. Anderson Building, but 
the wing was closed and most of the pieces on display were draped in plastic 
sheets in case any potentially harmful soot remained in the air, said Ron 
Bratton, deputy director of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the museum's conservation staff placed sheets of white paper on the 
floors of the four-story building to gauge how many particles were circulating 
in the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a few specks of soot floating around, but it's all extremely 
minimal," said Pieter Meyers, head of conservation for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton said he was "90% sure" the reopening of "Hispanic Art in the United 
States," featuring the work of 30 artists, would take place as scheduled. The 
show closes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Reopen Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the upper floors, where selections from the museum's 
collection of 20th-Century art are displayed, could reopen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the museum, including the Frances and Armand Hammer Building, where 
an exhibition of the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe has been drawing large 
crowds, was open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials were concerned that steam generated from the fire's intense 
heat would raise the moisture levels in the Anderson galleries, the relative 
humidity rose only to 53%, "which is pretty close to ideal," Bratton said. 
</P>
<P>
No cause has yet been determined for the blaze, a Fire Department spokesman 
said. An arson team was sent to the scene Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was brought under control in half an hour after two firefighters who 
happened to be working as fire marshals at the May Co. across the street rushed 
to the museum and held the blaze at bay until help arrived. As many as 2,000 
visitors, volunteers and employees were evacuated from the museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Factors Cited 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials said two other factors helped spare the artworks: The fire 
occurred in a 2-year-old building with multiple fire doors and steel floors; 
and the staff underwent a disaster preparedness drill as recently as March 15. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to enabling them to efficiently remove people from the building, 
the drill alerted them to the need to close fire doors and swiftly cover all 
artworks except certain pieces, like an aluminum and fiberglass honeycomb 
sculpture by Frank Stella, that can be easily cleaned, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything worked the way it was supposed to work," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, a team of six conservation workers inspected the artwork in 
the Anderson Building to ensure that no damage had occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton said the fire did char some art supplies used by the museum's education 
staff and some "rather routine" files from the ancient art department that were 
being stored in the Anderson Building's basement.

MYSTERY ILLNESS THAT HIT 18 STUDENT SINGERS IS DIAGNOSED AS HYSTERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mysterious illness that struck 18 student singers and triggered the 
evacuation of 2,550 people during a concert at the Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium has been diagnosed as mass hysteria, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although all of the stricken youngsters were treated and released at local 
hospitals for ailments ranging from dizziness and nausea to headaches and 
fainting, Santa Monica fire officials were unable to find evidence of fumes or 
toxic substances that could have caused the phantom outbreak Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department searched the auditorium with a . . . toxic fume detector 
and found no indication of a hazard," said Fire Chief William Pajaras at a 
press conference Friday. "A full search was completed, and no physical cause 
was found. It's tough to make it look like you're not ridiculing the kids, but 
the mind can really play tricks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Heat, Stress and Anxiety 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Supervisor Eugene Tucker suggested 
that the youngsters were "reacting to heat and stress (and) general anxiety 
from earlier in the day when one or two youngsters fainted." 
</P>
<P>
Health experts called the incident a classic case of mass hysteria, explaining 
that it usually afflicts female adolescents or preadolescents involved in 
psychologically or physically stressful situations. 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is one person with a real illness and sympathetic people around 
who are tensed up for some reason, and it spreads like wildfire," said Shirley 
Fannin, associate deputy director of disease control programs for the Los 
Angeles County Health Department. "But the key is that there is no pathological 
or objective signs of illness." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary Small, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the UCLA Medical School 
who has studied outbreaks of mass hysteria around the world, said the 
phenomenon is not uncommon among students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crowded Room' 
</P>
<P>
"I observe a few cases a year, most of them around this time when there are 
more assemblies and graduation ceremonies," Small said. "Assemblies can be 
places where there is not only physical stress because of the crowded room but 
also psychological stress. The children performing are excited about being in 
front of the audience, but they are also anxious that their performances will 
fall short." 
</P>
<P>
Small added, however, that even though there is no physical cause, the symptoms 
experienced by victims of mass hysteria are real. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel real and seem real," he said. "Mental anxiety or unconscious 
psychological conflicts are converted into a physical symptom." 
</P>
<P>
Margie Ashkar, whose 12-year-old daughter, Amanda, was one of those sent to a 
hospital Thursday night, was less than satisfied with such explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that there was something, maybe in the earlier part of the day, that 
was present in the air that the children breathed," Ashkar said. "I don't 
believe it was mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, her daughter agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I rehearsed in the morning, I smelled something like lacquer that was 
really weird," the youngster said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Felt Awful' 
</P>
<P>
"I felt awful and sat with other kids who felt awful too. I was fine until the 
end of the performance. Every time I moved my head it hurt. I walked out and 
collapsed," Amanda said. 
</P>
<P>
The chain reaction occurred near the end of the first of two performances of 
the 40th annual "Stairway-of-the-Stars" program, which is produced by the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District and features 1,100 members of the 
district's bands, choruses and orchestras from the 4th through 12th grades. 
</P>
<P>
But anxiety among the performers apparently increased before noon when two 
girls fainted and a third complained of nausea during rehearsals at the 
auditorium. School officials said all three were friends and were seated near 
each other at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Auditorium officials acknowledged that guard rails had been touched up with 
white water-based enamel paint in the morning, which could have left a 
lingering but harmless smell in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "it was apparent these gals had not eaten all day, and they were 
involved in a performance that was stressful," said Barbara Moran, director of 
cultural and recreational services for the city of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, one of these young ladies had a medical problem that was conducive to 
having her faint," she said. "Other youngsters followed the leader. It was a 
domino effect." 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests conducted on the youngsters at five local hospitals proved 
negative, Pajaras said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Show 
</P>
<P>
Based on information provided by the Fire Department and Santa Monica 
officials, Tucker said he decided to permit a second performance of "Stairway" 
Friday night at the Civic Auditorium. He acknowledged, however, that crowds 
were likely to be smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Because authorities were concerned about a replay of Thursday night's mass 
reaction, cameras were prohibited from the auditorium. "Part of the problem 
(Thursday night) might have been nervousness" from such attention, said Santa 
Monica Police Sgt. John Miehle. 
</P>
<P>
A young violinist, on his way into the hall for Friday's performance, said he 
hadn't noticed any unusual smells the night before. "I think it's like they 
said on the news," the teen-ager said. "I think it was hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's outbreak was similar to one that took place in 1982 when 127 people 
attending a high school football game in East Los Angeles were sent to 
hospitals complaining of nausea, stomach pains and chills. The mass hysteria 
was apparently triggered by cheerleaders who complained of feeling ill after 
drinking soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"People on both sides of the football stadium were drinking Coke from the same 
dispensers," Fannin said of the incident. "On one side, 127 people went to the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
In Israel a year later, 300 students at six Palestinian girls schools fell ill, 
and health officials there suggested mass hysteria was the cause.

SEATTLE'S HUNTHAUSEN 'DELIGHTED,' 'RELIEVED';

VATICAN REVIEW CHANGED LITTLE, BISHOP SAYS

Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen said that a five-year Vatican review of the 
Seattle Roman Catholic Archdiocese did not lead to fundamental changes in its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Hunthausen, who came under fire from Catholic conservatives and at one time 
temporarily lost his authority over annulments and in several other church 
activities, appeared with Seattle's coadjutor Archbishop Thomas Murphy at a 
news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the Pope's U.S. representative announced that an apostolic 
commission that reviewed Hunthausen's leadership had completed its work. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. We're relieved. We're pleased," Hunthausen said. "We're going 
to have a party." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the ministry has changed," said Hunthausen, 67, who added that 
the ministry was never in violation of Rome's teachings "in the broad sense." 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Archbishop Pio Laghi in Washington, D.C., chief papal 
representative in the United States, said Hunthausen "has indicated that he, 
along with Murphy, will continue to address the issues which have been of 
concern to the church." 
</P>
<P>
After Hunthausen came under fire from conservatives, the Vatican in 1985 
removed his authority in five areas where he was accused of diverging from 
church teachings, including ministry to homosexuals, liturgical matters and 
marriage annulments. An auxiliary bishop was named to perform those duties. 
</P>
<P>
When that situation proved unworkable, Hunthausen's authority was restored in 
early 1987 and Murphy was named coadjutor archbishop. 
</P>
<P>
Hunthausen has a national reputation for outspokenness on peace issues and the 
poor.

A HOLLYWOOD EFFORT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if, sometime soon, "The Cosby Show's" Cliff Huxtable tells 
his teen-age daughters that their aerosol hair spray cans are destroying the 
ozone layer. Or "Roseanne" gets a sudden impulse to recycle her Twinkie 
wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Some of Hollywood's most powerful studio executives and agents are 
launching an organization, called the Environmental Media Assn., to raise the 
public's consciousness about the destruction of the environment through TV 
shows and feature films. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will provide technical advice to script writers, said Noel 
Brown, North American director of the U.N.'s environmental program. 
</P>
<P>
Outside TV/film producer Norman Lear's Westside home Thursday night, a stream 
of Mercedes, BMWs, Rolls-Royces, and stretch limos pulled up for the first 
formal meeting of the group. Inside, about 100 of Hollywood's rich and powerful 
discussed ways to use the power of the media to steer American life styles in 
more environmentally sound directions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take more than government action," Lear said of the dwindling 
ozone layer, the destruction of the Earth's rain forests and the alarming 
growth of toxic wastes. "We're talking about a monumental shift in attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
Lear said that can start by adding "just a line of dialogue, an action." When 
the Fonz on "Happy Days" took out a library card several years ago, Lear 
recalled, thousands of inner-city youngsters followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Lear's guests included investor Marvin Davis, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner 
and his wife Jane; Creative Artists Agency President Michael Ovitz and wife 
Judy; producer Ted Field and wife Susie; Warner Bros. President Terry Semel and 
wife Jane; Castle Rock partner Alan Horn and wife Cindy. (Several Hollywood 
wives apparently came up with the idea for the group at a recent lunch.) 
</P>
<P>
Other executives associated with the group include MCA President Sidney 
Sheinberg; Disney President Frank Wells; Columbia President Dawn Steel; Fox 
Chairman Barry Diller and NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
"Studio and network executives set a climate for approval," said Andy Spahn, 
who is leaving his post as chief of staff to state controller Gray Davis to run 
the Environmental Media Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Barbra Streisand was also there, and Robert Redford -- who runs his own 
environmental effort -- has endorsed the group, as have 10 of the country's 
major environmental organizations.

A GUY WHO'LL 'SAY ANYTHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are 22 and a rising film star, don't live in Malibu, and never qualified 
for the Brat Pack by punching out a geek at a Hollywood punk-rock club, odds 
are you'll be billed as a maverick. 
</P>
<P>
John Cusack is such a person. He even lives in Chicago. This week he was in New 
York, doing interview after interview to drum-beat for "Say Anything," a quirky 
new romantic comedy that opened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, polite, possessed of rapid-fire speech, he wryly complained about 
"talking about myself for three weeks now." That an actor can so complain 
indicates a fine outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
Another good sign: He has a Chicago theater company and talks of maybe 
producing Dario Fo's "The Accidental Death of an Anarchist" or an adaptation of 
Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Theater keeps you normal? "Yeah, it does. But you also have to keep a 
perspective on the whole thing, to know that acting isn't the end-all of life." 
</P>
<P>
In "Say Anything," he plays a decent, whimsical, boundlessly upbeat kid who 
upon graduation from high school pursues and falls in love with the beautiful 
class genius (Ione Skye). 
</P>
<P>
All this time, he is planning a career in kick-boxing which, as he tells her 
bemused, divorced father (John Mahoney), is "the sport of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the lad has no fixed address for the future, although he knows 
that "I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything." 
</P>
<P>
Cusack, who has the innocent Irish face of a very big altar boy, beams when a 
visitor ventures that his "Say Anything" character had the same exuberant 
nonconformist spirit that Jason Robards showed in "A Thousand Clowns" more than 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a great compliment," says Cusack, a fan of that film and that actor. 
"I'm honored by that analogy." 
</P>
<P>
He has been a busy man -- 12 films in six years, starting with "Class." His 
dossier includes "Sixteen Candles," "The Journey of Natty Gann" and his first 
starring role in "The Sure Thing" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to grow old in coming-of-age roles, though. So last year he did 
John Sayles' "Eight Men Out," about the great baseball scandal of 1919, and 
"Tapeheads," a black comedy about the music video business. 
</P>
<P>
The latter was with his pal and ally in stage, Tim Robbins, who played the big 
baseball player with the tiny brain in "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
Having bid adieu to to teen roles, Cusack initially said no dice when 
approached for "Say Anything" by its director-writer, Cameron Crowe, the 
ex-Rolling Stone scribe who wrote "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about repeating myself and working with a first-time director," 
Cusack said. "I had a lot of trepidation." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to be in another teen genre film. It took a while -- and the 
fact that the film's executive director is James L. Brooks, writer-director of 
"Broadcast News" -- before he said yes. 
</P>
<P>
This is true, Crowe said in a separate interview. "He said, 'I've graduated' . 
. . to his credit, though, he kept his foot in the water for a long time while 
he got to know me. He didn't want me to make him what he calls the Charm 
Monster." 
</P>
<P>
The operative phrase for Cusack's character, indeed the film, is "optimism as a 
revolutionary concept," a phrase director and actor have made sort of their 
interview mantra. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Cusack lives with his older sister -- played by his older sister, 
Joan, the Staten Island secretary of "Working Girl" and frenzied production 
assistant of "Broadcast News." 
</P>
<P>
They are the best-known of five Cusack kids who grew up in Evanston near 
Chicago and started acting with a local stage group, the Piven Theatre 
Workshop. The other three -- Ann, Bill and Susie -- also are working in the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Their father, Richard, a documentary maker, also has taken up acting, appearing 
in "Eight Men Out" as the stern judge who in a courtroom scene tells Cusack: 
"You're out of order. Sit down and shut up." 
</P>
<P>
Cusack has another new movie, "Fat Man &amp; Little Boy," which stars Paul 
Newman, due out late this year. In it, he plays a nuclear physicist who worked 
on the nation's first atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
He mildly frets that he hasn't acted on stage for three years, although last 
year in Chicago he directed a gonzo satire co-authored by Tim Robbins and Adam 
Simon, "Alagazam . . . After the Dog Wars." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a small-time freak show taken over by a defense-entertainment 
corporation," he said. "The show has a tough, honest pitchman who tells white 
lies, but also showers the audience with bits of truth. . . . It's also about 
how television has kind of centralized the nation and homogenized it -- the 
same country sharing the same kind of images -- and how dangerous that can be." 
</P>
<P>
What bugs him most about movie scripts he's offered? 
</P>
<P>
That many of them "are just kind of devoid of any integrity or creativity, that 
they're just a genre film. Genre to me means making money off someone else's 
original idea. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hollywood, it's really hard to take pride in what you do. You see the Oscar 
ceremonies and it's like kind of a bad acid trip. . . . It's things like that, 
and some of the scripts you get sent that really give you the fear, make you 
think you don't want to be an actor." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Cusack will move west soon, even though it is said that one 
needs to live and take meetings in Hollywood or one will . . . well, just not 
be happening. Cusack would disagree. That he has been in 12 films since age 16 
would tend to support his position. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, I'm not really an L.A. kind of guy," he says. He does have a girlfriend 
who lives in Los Angeles, singer Suzanne Melvoin, daughter of jazzman Mike 
Melvoin. "I have a lot of friends out there, and there are a lot of good things 
to be said about L.A. But I just don't feel like driving around in a car for 
half a day. 
</P>
<P>
"And I really do like the city of Chicago. I don't know if I'll stay there 
forever. But it's doing just fine so far."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: '80 DAYS' -- THE SECOND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jules Verne's Phileas Fogg is a man for whom order, routine and precision are 
almost a religion, a man who can be counted on to "do tomorrow precisely what 
he's done today." 
</P>
<P>
It could be argued that a man of such rigidity in 1872 would hardly do anything 
as daring as staking his fortune on circling the globe in 80 days, and surely 
not on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its soft foundation, however, Verne's "Around the World in 80 Days" is 
a grandly entertaining yarn that Mike Todd turned into a memorable, 
Oscar-winning film with David Niven and Cantinflas in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes "Around the World in 80 Days" the NBC-TV miniseries, at 9 p.m. 
Sunday through Tuesday on Channels 4, 36 and 39, with Pierce Brosnan as Fogg 
and Eric Idle as Fogg's loyal French servant, Passepartout. 
</P>
<P>
Some of it is quite good, most of it quite bad -- notably when John Gay's 
script is seized by extreme fancy in having Fogg almost get his head blown off 
by Jesse James. Yes, that Jesse James. 
</P>
<P>
After betting his wist-playing companions at London's Reform Club that he can 
circle the globe in 80 days, Fogg and Passepartout set out on their marathon 
journey, unaware that Fogg has been identified as the "gentleman" who recently 
robbed the Bank of England. With seemingly all of England charting their 
progress, they travel by train, by balloon, by steamer, by elephant, by 
rowboat, by rickshaw and by foot, all the while trailed by a bumbling detective 
named Fix (Peter Ustinov), who has been assigned to capture Fogg. 
</P>
<P>
Part 1 gives "Around the World in 80 Days" a flat, plodding start, with the 
travelers getting airborne -- in a majestic hot-air balloon that carries them 
from France to Italy -- much faster than the story does. And director Buzz 
Kulik's attempts at humor plummet faster than Fogg and Passepartout do when 
they run out of fuel over the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the Far East, Part 2 is a golden, atmospheric, splendidly photographed 
travelogue that's rich in pomp and spectacle and gets by on looks alone. 
Although diminished by the small screen, it's still magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
The scene shifts to the United States in Part 3, most of which is so profoundly 
stupid that by the time it concludes, you feel like you've been watching for 80 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Like the movie, the miniseries includes numerous star cameos, some of which -- 
like Lee Remick as Sarah Bernhardt -- are awkward and intrusive, though 
essentially benign. 
</P>
<P>
What you miss most from Todd's earlier version are the classic Victor Young 
score and the clowning Cantinflas as Passepartout. In some ways, however, the 
miniseries is at least a match for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan is a fit Fogg, suitably unperturbed and unruffled, facing peril after 
peril, yet ingeniously turning every adversity into an advantage while racing 
to beat the deadline for returning to London. As a bonus, he looks swell in a 
silk hat. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Julia Nickson is more credible than Shirley MacLaine as Aouda, the 
ravishing Indian princess whom Fogg and Passepartout rescue en route to 
Calcutta. Nickson's performance is especially crucial given the heavier 
emphasis on romance between Fogg and Aouda in this flabby version. And finally, 
there are those spectacular locales -- in Britain, Macao, Hong Kong, Thailand 
and Yugoslavia -- that Kulik exploits very well. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Idle is often more Inspector Clouseau than Passepartout (Peter Sellers' 
accent wasn't any funnier), and as Fix, Ustinov is tiresomely mannered and 
overdoes grunting like Mr. Magoo. 
</P>
<P>
Even more bothersome are parts of the script. 
</P>
<P>
As a story, Verne's Foggian tale is trivial and not meant to be taken 
seriously. The characters are so unbelievable and inconsistent, and some 
elements of the plot so ludicrous, that the author may have been 20,000 leagues 
under the sea when he dreamed all of this up. His saving grace here is his 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
As a vehicle for pure adventure that fires the imagination, however, Fogg's 
global journey is not only a delight, but also something that can be changed to 
taste by altering or dropping plot parts, or by inserting new ones. Retaining 
the adventure framework of the round-the-world tour is what counts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gay's additions seem preposterous, however, especially his changing of 
a Verne character to Jesse James, who somehow turns up with his brother, Frank, 
at a San Francisco dress ball and gets into a fight with Fogg over Aouda. Their 
clash later carries over to a moving train where they have a near-duel, after 
which Jesse makes an apparently suicidal jump off the train into attacking 
Sioux, only to somehow escape. Well, he was tough. 
</P>
<P>
Also notable is a piece of contemporary dialogue put in the mouth of Aouda. 
Freshly arrived in the United States, she shows amazing perception by angrily 
criticizing the abuse of American Indians by white Americans -- surely a hot 
topic in her native India circa 1872. 
</P>
<P>
The plot fogs.

POP BEAT: POP FROM A PACIFIC PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you ran into rock singers Neil and Tim Finn on the street, you probably 
wouldn't guess that they are brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Neil, 30, is leader of the band Crowded House and he looks youthful, wholesome 
and thoughtful -- just the kind of face that can (and does) elicit squeals from 
teen-aged fans. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Tim, 36, whose third solo album has just been released by Capitol 
Records, is more brooding and intense. His mop of brown hair, piercing eyes and 
rugged face suggest an explosive nature, something of a cross between Dennis 
Quaid and Mickey Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
But their accents off-stage make it clear that they are at least countrymen: 
probably Australian. 
</P>
<P>
Well close. 
</P>
<P>
The Finns may sound, mate, like Aussie Paul Hogan, but they actually hail from 
the 7,000-population town of Te Awa Mutu, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lack of awareness of New Zealand in America," said Tim, shortly 
after flying into Los Angeles this week to help launch his new album, titled 
simply "Tim Finn." 
</P>
<P>
In town, he crossed paths with Neil, who had just wrapped up a Crowded House 
tour of Canada and the West Coast. Tim will soon begin his own concert tour, 
including a show at the Roxy on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Australia has come more into consciousness, but I find people who can't place 
New Zealand geographically," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
The American fascination with all things Aussie (the country has been the 
source of far more international pop-rock hits than any other non-U.S. region 
in the Pacific Rim) has failed to note the distinction of the related but 
different cultures that exist on two islands to the southeast of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Australians were sent there, it's a convict culture," said Tim to explain 
the persistent macho image as reinforced by characters like Hogan's "Crocodile" 
Dundee. "New Zealand was populated by dreamers looking for a new world, a new 
paradise. And though the land fit that, they found a cultural clash with the 
native culture very grim. It made the people very melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
But the brothers also admit that they themselves have long been ignorant of a 
large part of their New Zealand roots and have of late been swept up in a 
rising consciousness of the indigenous peoples of the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Crowded House recently contributed a song to "Building Bridges," an Australian 
collection of white pop and traditional and modern aboriginal acts, and 
performed at a concert for the same cause. 
</P>
<P>
And a key track, "Parihaka," on Tim's new album, tells the story of Te Whiti, a 
Maori leader who preached nonviolence during a time of bloody conflicts between 
his people and the white New Zealand settlers in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't taught about him in school," Tim said of the Maori chief. "There's 
been a lot of denial about those wars. Very few writers will write anything as 
specifically New Zealand as I did with that song." 
</P>
<P>
Neil agreed. "Most whites don't understand the aboriginals," he said, crediting 
the band Midnight Oil with helping to awaken an interest in the native 
cultures. "They tend to think they're a bunch of drunk savages, but they're a 
strong and rich culture." 
</P>
<P>
But the Finns believe things are changing. "There's a real fresh culture 
emerging in New Zealand," said Tim, who spends a lot of time in Auckland, New 
Zealand, though he lives in London now. "A real mix of Polynesian, Maori and 
Europeans. It's opening in the music field as well. There's a burgeoning rap 
culture based primarily on Maori and Polynesian youth." 
</P>
<P>
Tim sees this as part of a growing awareness of the whole Pacific region. 
"Australia and New Zealand are growing closer, and there's more and more 
Japanese tourists pouring in, and there's a growing awareness of the Russian 
presence in the Pacific. And Greenpeace is very active, so there's a real 
protective feeling toward the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The attention to the Pacific is new for the Finns, who like many in their 
culture grew up relating to their ancestral roots. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of saw England as our spiritual home," Tim said, explaining why he 
moved his first band, Split Enz, to England in the mid-'70s. "The Kinks and all 
those bands were there." 
</P>
<P>
Tim has, in fact, kept London as his home ever since, though Neil, who joined 
Split Enz shortly after the move, returned to Melbourne, Australia eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the two find themselves traversing the Pacific with regularity. 
Both have recorded in Los Angeles with American producer Mitchell Froom. 
</P>
<P>
Said Neil, "It's a 26-hour flight to London from Melbourne, but only 14 to Los 
Angeles. And Los Angeles is the first port of call for rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
But neither is ready to predict some new pan-Pacific culture or music. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger is it would become homogenous," said Tim, noting that New 
Zealanders have developed a distinctly loping brand of reggae. "It's better 
that everyone stay individual than create any Pacific sound. American pop will 
always have an influence, just by the weight of numbers and quality. But it's 
better if little regional differences emerge."

GOOD MORNING, L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
FROM SANTA ANITA TO SAN PEDRO HARBOR, WEEKEND ADVENTURE AWAITS EARLY RISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLENE M. SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 5:30 a.m. Saturday. Downtown Los Angeles is quiet and dark. At 8th and 
Wall streets, everything changes. Merchants busily prepare row upon row of 
brilliantly colored flowers. Excitement and activity spill out onto the street 
as busy employees push handcarts stacked with flowers wrapped in cellophane and 
newspaper. Soon, hundreds of busy shoppers will converge to choose between the 
tulips and irises, the roses and chrysanthemums. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 7 a.m. Sunday. The sun is up, but the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) 
is relatively empty. A short distance away, about a hundred cars sit in 
clusters in the parking lot at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, and many of them 
have been there for hours. A rooster crows as fans stream into the race track 
to watch the horses work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there's plenty to do just after daybreak. But you'll miss it all if your 
idea of the perfect weekend is to sleep late. While you are snoozing, thousands 
of other Southlanders are "up-and-at-'em" -- enjoying all kinds of activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up and out early because there are lots of things I want to do. I don't 
want to sleep my time away," said Jack Felmann, a clothing manufacturer who 
lives in West Los Angeles and who's up most days at 5:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I sleep late and wait until my wife and kids get ready to go out to 
breakfast. It can be 11 o'clock by the time we're ready to go. The next thing I 
know, someone's asking me what I want to do for dinner. The whole day is gone. 
Besides, there are some pretty terrific things you can do if you get started 
early enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Variety of Activities 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's not only joggers and fitness fanatics who are out in the wee hours 
of morning. Early risers such as Felmann savor a wide variety of activities. 
They are just as likely to be at the harbor watching the cruise ships come in 
or hiking in Griffith Park as they are to be jogging or bicycling up the coast. 
You can find them looking for bargains at the wholesale fish market or gabbing 
with other regulars at their favorite breakfast cafes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of freedom," said Ray Duane, owner and operator of a sportfishing 
boat that regularly leaves around dawn. "You get a good start on the day, see 
the sun come up and there's no traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Duane and Felmann, along with many of their early-morning soul-mates, talk 
about the peace and quiet, the lack of crowds. Others talk about how friendly 
people are. They use words such as adventure and fun. Some have an 
early-morning routine; others like to try new experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita Park attracts a variety of people on weekend mornings. You'll find 
the serious track aficionados and others drawn for various reasons. There are, 
for example, weekend photographers and parents taking children on outings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even seen a horse race," Monrovia homemaker Kathy Acker said. "We 
just come to watch the horses." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Tony Acker, take their young daughters to various 
early-morning events, including pancake breakfasts at municipal airports, and 
air shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be out-of-doors, and the morning is a good time to avoid the 
crowds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A few times each year, the Ackers bring their kids to Santa Anita for the tram 
tour of the backstretch. This area, which includes the stables and living 
quarters for some of the stable's employees, is home to almost 2,000 horses. 
Within arm's reach, the Acker children watch the horses being groomed, fed and 
walked to cool down after their workouts. The backstretch is a little village 
of movement, a virtual parade of chestnut-brown, auburn and jet- black horses 
with colorful blankets and leg wraps. 
</P>
<P>
After the short tour, the Ackers join the crowd in the grandstands where 
tuxedo-clad waiters serve breakfast to patrons who watch the jockeys exercise 
their Thoroughbreds around the track. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Wright is a serious race-track enthusiast. He comes to Santa Anita at 
sunup because that's when he can watch the horses and keep track of their 
workout times. "This is when they clock the horses," said Wright, who's missed 
only a few mornings all season. "If you get here very early -- about 5:30 -- 
you can stand where the jockeys bring the horses out and talk with them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Horses All Year 
</P>
<P>
Some people, such as Wright, follow a horse for a whole season, noting how the 
horse runs at each morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
"They can see it coming to its peak," he said. "If you pay attention to the 
workouts, you can tell when the horse is race-ready." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he starts his day early, Wright will have a leisurely breakfast 
with friends and spend the entire day at the track, moving to the finish line 
as the day progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Park, (818) 574-7223, offers free, behind-the-scenes tours nearly 
every Saturday and Sunday morning from 7:30 to 9:30 during the racing season. 
The Santa Anita season closes April 24. (Oak Tree meet begins in October.) 
Breakfast is available every race day from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Another early-morning treat is the Port of Los Angeles. The harbor at San Pedro 
is a refuge for people who prefer pelicans and solitude to horses and crowds. 
It's a quiet, peaceful place in the morning, where people watch the marine 
traffic on the main channel and stop to chat with fishermen on the docks. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy DiCola, an elementary school teacher, can be found strolling with her dog 
almost daily. "I love to watch the fishermen getting ready to go onto their 
boats. They work with their needles, mending the nets. Then the cranes yank all 
the netting onto the boat. It's very colorful when there's a lot of activity," 
DiCola said. 
</P>
<P>
If fishing conditions aren't good and the dock is quiet, DiCola strolls the 
main channel, where longshore work is going on. "You see the container docks, 
where huge containers are lifted by crane onto gigantic ships," she said. "You 
can watch the Coast Guard patrolling or washing their boats. And then, a little 
later, you'll start seeing the passenger liners come in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Painters Show Up 
</P>
<P>
The scene is so picturesque that weekend artists come to paint it. Between 7 
and 8 a.m. on a recent Saturday, two or three cruise ships returned to port. On 
Sunday morning, another one returned. Although non-passengers once could go 
into the terminal to watch liners up close, today, most onlookers have to be 
satisfied to watch the grand vessels proceed to their berths through the main 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
Watching from shore doesn't seem to lessen the excitement for some: "I never 
get tired of seeing them," said Janet Redman, manager of the Belgian Waffle 
restaurant, which sits on the main waterway. "You can see these immense ships 
coming through the harbor. They're so large they completely block out the sky 
through the restaurant windows. Then you see people waving, and it's almost 
like taking a trip with them." 
</P>
<P>
According to Redman, the huge tankers and freighters also are a thrill to 
watch. "Sometimes you'll see one coming and one going. I hold my breath. 
They're so big, I don't know how they can both get by." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Routine 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lowery has a morning routine. "I always swing by the fishing docks between 
5:30 or 6 a.m. to see what boats are in. You can tell by the noise of the sea 
gulls whether they're unloading fish or not," said Lowery, executive director 
of the Seamen's Church Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Then he watches the trucks being loaded with fish destined for restaurants and 
supermarkets throughout Los Angeles. By that time, the regular walkers are out 
and Lowery stops to chat. He finally joins them -- and many of the fishermen 
and longshoremen in the area -- at Cannetti's Seafood Grotto for doughnuts and 
coffee. "People are very friendly at that time of day," Lowery said. "It's the 
best time to just sit and talk." 
</P>
<P>
Saturdays bring another group of people to the port: those who want to purchase 
wholesale fish. Saturday between 5 and 9 a.m., the wholesale markets sell fish 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the main channel of the L.A. Harbor, take the Harbor Freeway South 
to the end. Follow signs for Ports O'Call Fishermen's Village and the Los 
Angeles Maritime Museum. This is where you get the best views. The small 
fishing fleet is adjacent to Ports O'Call Fishermen's Village. The wholesale 
fish markets are located at the end of 22nd Street on the main channel. 
Cannetti's (open daily at 6 a.m.) is nearby at 309 E. 22nd St., San Pedro, and 
the Belgian Waffle (open 9 a.m.) and Ann's Village Bakery (open daily at 7 
a.m.) are located at Ports O'Call Fishermen's Village. 
</P>
<P>
A far livelier Saturday morning is experienced at the Flower Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Forget solitude and contemplation. People who go to the Flower Mart love the 
bustle of people; they love the sights and scents of flowers; they love the 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
A two-square-block area, the market (really two associations of vendors -- the 
Los Angeles Flower Market of the American Florist Exchange and the Southern 
California Flower Market) is the place in Los Angeles to buy flowers, greens 
and florist supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Mellano's family has been in the flower business since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the market opens at 5:30 a.m. "That's when you get all kinds 
here," Mellano said. "Someone will buy one bunch of daisies for a few bucks. 
Then you see someone else buying five or six bunches of long-stemmed roses for 
a dinner party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also Visit Produce Market 
</P>
<P>
People come early in the day because they have other things to do -- and 
because they want to get the best pick of the crop, Mellano said. "Lots of 
families come down and make a day of it. They'll come here, then go to the 
produce market and then to the garment places." 
</P>
<P>
For Vicky Hauk, the Flower Mart is one of the few good reasons to come into the 
city. "When I first walked in, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven," said 
Hauk, a West Covina high school teacher. "The variety of colors and smells! 
When you're used to having limited selection and you come in and see the wealth 
of things that are available, it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Clutching her multicolored bundles, she added, "I love coming here to be a 
tourist and then go home with all these lovely goodies." 
</P>
<P>
Many people include a stop at one of the area's well-known restaurants. Gorky's 
Cafe and Russian Brewery is one of them. A 24-hour restaurant at 536 E. 8th 
St., Los Angeles, across the street from the Flower Mart, it has an artsy, 
almost Bohemian, ambiance and offers a variety of food including unusual 
omelets, made-to-order pastas and pastries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famed for Strawberry Pie 
</P>
<P>
Vickman's is another celebrated eatery, and one that's fun if you're making the 
circuit. Open Monday through Saturday at 3 a.m. and Sunday at 7 a.m., Vickman's 
is famous for strawberry pie and a huge assortment of other pastries. You'll 
also find selections such as chorizo and eggs and corned beef hash. Vickman's 
is at 1228 E. 8th St.. 
</P>
<P>
These, of course, are just a few of the places at which you'll find Southern 
California's early risers, but there are many, many other locations and 
activities. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club, (213) 387-4287, sponsors early-morning hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood-On-Location, (213) 659-9165, supplies daily lists of filming 
locations open to public viewing (there is a fee for the list). 
</P>
<P>
For those who want a tad more sleep, Grand Central Market, (213) 624-2378, 
opens at 9 a.m. Monday-Saturday; Sundays at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home to Biplanes 
</P>
<P>
Cable Airport Inc. in Upland, (714) 982-6021, is home to restored biplanes and 
antique aircraft. Many people have breakfast at the Cable Airport Cafe, open at 
6:30 a.m., where they can sit near the runway and watch the planes take off. If 
you're lucky, the hangars of the antique planes will be open when you wander 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's always pier fishing, horseback riding and just breakfasting at 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Stretch your imagination to enjoy a glorious morning in or near Los Angeles.

TAKE CONTROL OF WILLOWS AND MAKE THEM BEHAVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE TREE IN LITTLE TOKYO'S JAMES IRVINE GARDEN IS GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW PROPER 
CARE PREVENTS TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FRENCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The serene, 8,500-square-foot James Irvine Garden, next to the Japanese 
American Cultural and Community Center in Los Angeles, may seem at first to be 
a mirage. It's hard to imagine so restful a site in downtown Los Angeles, yet 
there it is in the middle of Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
A stream wends down the slope through azaleas, camellias, bamboos and trees, 
and noise and signs of the city disappear the farther down the path you walk. 
Near the bottom of the garden, by the arching wooden bridge that crosses the 
stream, a Hankow willow (also known as a corkscrew willow) crops up out of the 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Willows are associated with spring, according to the garden's landscape 
architect, Takeo Uesugi, and in his design, which follows many of the concepts 
used in traditional Japanese gardens, Uesugi tried to represent each of the 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"All trees represent different seasons," he says, and the Hankow willow (Salix 
matsudana "Tortuosa") was meant to symbolize newness, the sunrise, its new, 
green leaves, the east (west is symbolized by the color white, north by black, 
south by red). 
</P>
<P>
The Hankow willow is worth seeing in all of its seasons. Its leaves look as 
though they have been curled into ringlets, and when they drop off for the 
winter, the tree's branches and its trunk are revealed to be twisted, 
contorted, almost writhing. (These are the branches you see in flower 
arrangements.) According to Uesugi, this type of willow can grow 25 to 30 feet; 
at the Japanese garden, its size is controlled by its trimming schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Like most trees, willows should be assigned to a spot where they can be used to 
good advantage and not used where they can cause trouble. Dale Kolaczkowski of 
Stallings Ranch Nursery says willows are known for their aggressiveness, 
messiness and their propensity to attract borers and defoliating caterpillars. 
Their roots unearth sidewalks and will go long distances to seek out and 
destroy anything carrying water: sewers and even swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
But this thirstiness can be viewed in a positive light. Willows are recommended 
for boggy areas or places where water runs off and does not drain. Kolaczkowski 
recounts a client who had an island situated in a duck pond on which no tree 
would survive. A willow planted there is now thriving, and the ducks feast in 
the trees on the caterpillars the tree houses. Many people even enjoy the 
butterflies the trees attract. 
</P>
<P>
Willows are easy to start on your own, according to Kolaczkowski. When a tree 
of your choosing is dormant, he says, place a 1-inch-thick cutting in a 6-inch 
pot filled with damp Sponge Rok. Keep it in a warm place (about 70 degrees) for 
two weeks, then transfer to an 8-inch pot until rooted, 30 to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
After a young tree is planted in the ground, it should be staked well so that 
the twisting trunk can be managed into an upright position. This is especially 
important if you want to be able to walk underneath the tree later. 
</P>
<P>
Prune a Hankow willow every few years in an upright, oval shape. If kept 
well-watered, it can grow 6 feet in a season. Most trees that grow fast are 
also short-lived; this willow has a life span of about 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
The trees must be sprayed for borers (use dormant spray) and for caterpillars. 
</P>
<P>
Salix matsudana "Tortuosa" can be ordered by your local nursery from a number 
of sources, including Sell-Rite Nursery in Gardena, Orange County Nursery in 
Norwalk, L. E. Cooke Co. in Visalia, Stallings Ranch Nursery in Encinitas, 
Valley Crest Tree Co. in Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
The James Irvine Garden, open seven days a week, is next to the Japanese 
American Cultural and Community Center at 244 S. San Pedro St., Los Angeles.

GARDENING: IRISES -- MORE THAN THE SAME OLD PURPLE FLAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Egyptians pictured them in frescoes and prized them for their haunting 
scent. Painter Georgia O'Keeffe immortalized them too -- but in doing so 
crafted a black so deep that hybridizers have been frustrated ever since, 
trying to duplicate it. 
</P>
<P>
The iris, with its crisp fan of leaves and distinctive blooms, has been a 
favorite of gardeners for centuries. As growers have become more adept at 
creating new colors and forms, the flower has become more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to let people know about the changes in the iris," says Bill 
Renehart, president of the San Fernando Valley Iris Society. "It's not just the 
same old purple flag people usually think of." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Stalks on Display 
</P>
<P>
On show this weekend at the Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills, courtesy of the 
iris society, you can see just how far the flower has come. Five hundred 
different stalks will be on display; you'll see almost every color of the 
rainbow (except that elusive black and a true red -- oxblood is about as close 
as iris hybridizers have come). The flowers range in height from 4 inches to 36 
inches, some variegated, some ruffled. And, if you're of a mind, you can even 
find samples of the good old royal purple variety. 
</P>
<P>
Irises are among the easiest flowers to grow, Renehart says, and will multiply 
by the season. They can take full sun -- many commercial growers raise them in 
fields with no shade whatsoever -- but lacy shadows in the heat of the 
afternoon can help keep colors richer. 
</P>
<P>
They grow from rhizomes, or swollen roots, and you'll usually get just one 
flower stalk per rhizome. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on reblooming irises," Renehart says, "some of which will bloom 
five or six times a year. Repeat bloomers will bloom at least twice a year, in 
the spring and again either in late fall or early winter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planting Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
Renehart suggests planting the rhizomes about 18 inches apart. The plants like 
a light, sandy loam with as much humus as you can incorporate. "They don't like 
having their feet wet," Renehart says. "The drainage should be good, and you 
should let the ground dry out before you water again." 
</P>
<P>
He admits to breaking his own rules during heat spells. "You can hold the 
blooms a little longer if you water more frequently when it's hot," Renehart 
says. 
</P>
<P>
When planting rhizomes, Renehart fertilizes with Osmacote, a time-release 
pellet actually designed as tomato food. Then, throughout the year, Renehart 
feeds his irises with an all-purpose, balanced fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
There are two traditional times of year for dividing irises and replanting the 
rhizomes -- July and October. 
</P>
<P>
"You can quickly tell a mature rhizome from an immature one. Those that are too 
young (for successful planting) are full of moisture," Renehart says. "Don't 
put immature plants into the ground until they've had a time to dry out a bit." 
He says a cool, shady place on a patio or in a garage is best -- and don't bag 
or box the rhizomes until they're pretty dry, or you'll get rot and bug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
(If you buy rhizomes at this weekend's sale -- they'll be available for 
purchase Saturday only -- don't wait until July to plant, Renehart says. 
Instead, try to get them in the ground within a week.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What to Expect 
</P>
<P>
You'll probably get about four days of bloom from each plant, but, in the 
garden, the irises seem to stagger their blossoms somehow. You'll typically 
have color for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the blooms are gone, cut the stalks off, right next to the rhizome. Then, 
either live with the greenery -- you can easily plant annuals all around it -- 
or cut it back if you like a neater-looking bed. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley Iris Society Show -- 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today, noon to 5 
p.m. Sunday -- is free. Today's sale will feature plants from the estate of 
longtime growers Jack and Daisy Bennie, owners of the Ever-Blooming Iris Garden 
in Van Nuys, both of whom recently died. They bequeathed a half-acre of irises 
to the society.

MAN FACES TRIAL IN OPHTHALMOLOGIST DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man was ordered Friday to face trial June 6 on charges that he 
murdered a Newport Beach ophthalmologist in January and then stole his 
Mercedes-Benz sedan. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown set the trial date as Allen J. Lindsey, 23, 
entered a formal plea of not guilty at his arraignment in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Described by prosecutors as a male prostitute, Lindsey is accused of having 
murdered Boonkird Chualpatrcheevin, 45, on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor, a native of Thailand with a practice in Santa Ana, was found dead 
in his oceanfront duplex of a stab wound. Lindsey was arrested 5 days later on 
suspicion of murder after Los Angeles police stopped him while he was driving 
Chualpatrcheevin's car. The car was stolen the night of the doctor's murder, 
Newport Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey and his attorney, claiming self-defense in the attack, have said that 
the defendant and the victim may have been homosexually linked and that Lindsey 
was invited to the doctor's home.

EXTERMINATOR TRUCK CRASHES, SPILLING PESTICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A termite control truck carrying containers of pesticides overturned Friday, 
spilling a bug-killing chemical in a Placentia intersection and forcing 
authorities to evacuate more than 100 people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Sal Rapabas, 26, of El Monte, suffered minor injuries when 
his vehicle collided with another small truck. No one else was hurt in the 
accident, which occurred about 9:20 a.m. at the intersection of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard and Kraemer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Officials evacuated more than 100 people at the nearby El Torito Shopping 
Center and at a Fidelity Bank office as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
At least one 30-gallon container of the bug-killing chemical Dursban burst and 
spilled in the intersection, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Patti 
Range said. The chemical can cause a burning sensation if it comes in contact 
with skin or is inhaled, but there were no reports of injuries due to 
inhalation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rapabas, an employee of the Home Care Termite Control Co. in Anaheim, was 
treated for minor injuries at Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, Range said. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection was closed for about 2 hours while hazardous materials teams 
neutralized the chemical, Range said. She said the chemical was doused with 
bleach to neutralize it and that none of it seeped into storm drains.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL URGES CONCRETE PILINGS AS PIER SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An advisory committee is recommending that the new Huntington Beach Pier be 
rebuilt with concrete instead of steel pilings, and it is urging the City 
Council to approve that change at its meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Pier Design Committee previously supported rebuilding the 77-year-old 
landmark with steel legs that would be cheaper and faster to install, despite 
some protest among community members who found the idea of steel less appealing 
than the gray concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and city officials who form the committee reversed themselves 
Thursday night after learning that two piers with similar steel pilings were 
now showing signs of saltwater corrosion just 5 years after they were built. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members reported that, while not severe, rust already had 
materialized on the San Clemente and Pismo Beach piers at the spot where 
vertical steel pilings were welded to horizontal beams beneath the decking. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, two winter storms have destroyed costly parts of the Huntington 
Beach Pier, which was deemed a public hazard and closed by the city last July 
13. At the committee's recommendation, the City Council voted a few months ago 
to build a pier with steel pilings because it would save an estimated $1.5 
million and open 6 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the potential costs to repair the corroded steel combined with the less 
favorable, two-tone appearance of a steel and concrete mixture led the pier 
advisory committee members to change their recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's council meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 2000 Main St.

FOR TAX PREPARERS, FULL STEAM AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
CLOCK TICKS AWAY TOWARD WITCHING HOUR ON MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the season for little sleep and a lot of takeout. 
</P>
<P>
One owner of a tax-preparation firm didn't crawl into bed until 4 a.m. one day 
this week, while one of his employees labored all through the night. Meals come 
in cartons, or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
As Monday's income tax deadline nears -- 2 days later this year, thanks to 
today's being April 15 -- professional preparers of tax returns are spending 
long hours catering to the procrastinators of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people you told 3 months ago, and suddenly it hasn't dawned on them 
until today to do it. And now they want it done now," said Carol Aikins, an 
accountant with Debit One, a mobile tax and bookkeeping service. 
</P>
<P>
Aikins drives a motor home decked out like an office, complete with computer, 
to her clients' homes to prepare taxes. "It's the best way. That way, they (the 
clients) have everything there," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
This week, she has worked until 11 each night, only to return to her office at 
7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the road, you grab a bite," she said. "I come home famished." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Internal Revenue Service, Southern California is indeed the 
land of procrastinators. 
</P>
<P>
So far, just a little over 50% of taxpayers in the region have filed their 
returns, compared to 56% or 57% nationwide. "Southern Californians are the 
biggest procrastinators in the country," said Sally Ruhnau, a public affairs 
specialist with the Internal Revenue Service. Come Monday, she predicts, the 
IRS offices in Santa Ana and Laguna Niguel will be jammed with people asking 
for Form 4868 -- an application for extension to file a return. That too, must 
be stamped by midnight, April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhnau stressed that an extension to file does not equal an extension to pay. 
If taxes are owed, they must be estimated and a check included in order to 
avoid penalty, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frantic, very frantic," Steven H. Stevenson, a Tustin accountant, said of 
the final days. His whole family is affected by the tax-filing rush. His wife 
does clerical work and his two children, on spring break from school during the 
tax season, wind up spending several days doing chores in the office or playing 
games on the computers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all overburdened and short on time," said Hal Travis, owner of Triple 
Check Income Tax Service in Garden Grove, who worked until 4 a.m. one day this 
week. "Although I must say people are not breaking down the doors this last 
week or two," he said, adding that it appears that slightly fewer people are 
using professional preparers this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extension Forms 
</P>
<P>
Jerry McGough, office manager for A. S. Rogers &amp; Co. in Santa Ana, said his 
tax preparers are busy filing extension forms because of the complexities of 
their clients' returns. 
</P>
<P>
"Simplification (of the tax law) is not simple," he said. "It has created a lot 
of new problems." Many people are paying more to their surprise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone bemoans the tax season. 
</P>
<P>
Alethea La Mar, district manager for H&amp;R Block, is happy to keep the doors 
open as late as needed. Several locations have stayed open until 11 p.m. this 
week, and they will be open all day Saturday and Sunday as well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting the last 3 months for this," she said. "We were afraid 
people would try to do their own." She said many do walk in at the last minute, 
frustrated after trying to decipher the tax instructions on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Most clients have tried their own and can't do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service, too, is gearing up for those who don't want to pay 
Uncle Sam a day before they have to. Mail volume in Orange County is expected 
to swell by 200,000 pieces -- up to 1.8 million -- on Monday night, spokesman 
Joseph Breckenridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight post offices in Orange County will be postmarking mail received on Monday 
until midnight. If possible, taxpayers should have their returns stamped and 
ready to go when they get to the post offices because traffic is expected to be 
heavy and parking scarce. However, one post office in Santa Ana will keep its 
counter open for service until 8 p.m., and three more will stay open until 10 
p.m. In addition, the postal service will set up booths to receive and postmark 
mail until midnight at the Laguna Hills Mall, the Mall of Orange and Huntington 
Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
But postal employees don't mind the extra work, Breckenridge said. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most folks enjoy the day. It's fun. It's different. We know it's an 
important day," he said. "Employees seem to get a bang out of it." 
</P>
<P>
That's probably not how most accountants and tax preparers would describe tax 
season. 
</P>
<P>
On top of having clients who wait until the last minute, some tax preparers 
also are suffering from slowly processed returns that are sent for final 
preparation to computer firms, which likewise can get backed up this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Unitax Electronic Printing Service, one of the nation's biggest 
computer-service firms for accountants, got off to a bad start this tax season 
when new software was slow, according to Bob Lynch, vice president in the 
firm's Anaheim office, one of 28 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California, we normally process 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 returns a day. 
By the software not working early in the season . . . it doesn't take long for 
the backlog to get heavy," Lynch said, adding that Unitax has since caught up 
and is now processing returns in 3 to 4 days. 
</P>
<P>
But not all preparers are frantic these days. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Hudelson of Hudelson &amp; Alton, certified public accountants in Brea, 
said his firm is expected to finish up this week, and he was planning to leave 
work Friday to start a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an excellent season. Everything went right," he said. "The computers 
worked. The copy machines worked. Clients came in prepared." 
</P>
<P>
For tax preparers still toiling away, those long hours of staring at 1040 forms 
may work up an appetite, but there's no time for a relaxing lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"El Pollo Loco keeps pretty busy this time of year," said McGough of A. S. 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Others said they are dining well, even if the food is packaged in Styrofoam or 
cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We're eating lots of cashew chicken," said Gerald Glazer, who found a good 
Chinese restaurant not far from his Irvine office. 
</P>
<P>
At H&amp;R Block in Santa Ana, the tax preparers put in their food orders when 
two workers from a nearby Denny's came in to have their taxes done. The 
restaurant employees wound up taking lunch orders from the office crowd, and 
one drove off to pick up the food while his buddy had his taxes done, La Mar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just part of this crazy world of income tax," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, are skipping meals entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"Coffee and cigarettes is what you live on," said Theresa Leeser, owner of the 
Tax Lady in Garden Grove. "It keeps you going." 
</P>
<P>
So does looking forward to April 18, tax preparers said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeser takes no time off because she has other business clients who need to 
file payroll taxes and first-quarter sales taxes by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
But others have celebrations planned. Aikins of Debit One must get everything 
wrapped up by 2 p.m. Monday to head down to San Diego for a Neil Diamond 
concert. Triple Check workers will break open champagne Monday afternoon while 
they wait for clients to come in and pick up their completed returns. 
</P>
<P>
At H&amp;R Block offices, there are usually parties after the last return is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like New Year's Eve for us," La Mar said. 
</P>
<P>
Others have quieter celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he will do April 18, accountant Glazer replied: "Sleep."

CYPRESS COUNCIL SCHEDULES ELECTION AFTER SEARCH FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 30 days of sorting through applications and holding interviews, the 
Cypress City Council remained deadlocked in selecting a new council member and 
instead set a special election for Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The four council members had interviewed 14 applicants for the council seat 
vacated Feb. 28 by Bill Davis, who was moving out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council narrowed the field to two, Roger Geyer and Walter Bowman, but 
deadlocked in a vote at the council meeting Monday night. The deadlock stemmed 
from another issue: the proposed Cypress Downs. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 14, Cypress residents defeated by a 2-to-1 ratio a measure that would 
have allowed that major development on 167 acres surrounding the Los Alamitos 
Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry, who opposed the measure, said she and Councilman 
John Kanel supported Geyer because he is a strong opponent of the development 
plan. Council members Cecilia L. Age and Margaret M. Arnold voted for Bowman 
because he supports the development, Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
When Davis resigned, the council had 30 days to select someone to serve the 
last year of his term. Because the council could not decide in that time, it 
had to schedule a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry said that although the council made an effort to fill the post, she was 
not surprised that a special election was called. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad because the citizens suffer," Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer, an accountant, said he will run in the September election but does not 
want to see it become an expensive campaign because it is only for a 1-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, a real estate broker, could not be reached for comment, but Kerry said 
she understood that he also would run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates may file to run from June 15 to July 7. The city estimates that the 
special election will cost at least $25,000.

Recordings suggest that the April 7 Alabama concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre 
may have exceeded some recommended noise levels, but officials stressed that 
more tests will be needed to see whether the new sound system installed there 
to help reduce noise can indeed help solve a prolonged dispute. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom Friday ordered that 
the county continue to monitor the sound levels at the Costa Mesa arena at 
least through June 30, when attorneys for all sides in the dispute are to 
report back to him with more data. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just too early to tell what kinds of sound levels we're talking 
about. These things take time," said Ellwyn Brickson, a noise control 
specialist with the county Environmental Health Division, after the session 
with Beacom and the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend's concert by the country-rock band Alabama was the first time the 
new digital sound system at the arena, provided through arena operators and 
intended to do a better job of confining noise, was used. However, the band 
used some of its own audio equipment as well, according to Richard L. Spix, an 
attorney for a group of Costa Mesa residents who have been trying for 6 years 
to have the noise from concerts at the arena reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary readings indicate that the effect was mixed, county officials said. 
In a letter to Beacom dated April 12, county environmental health chief Robert 
E. Merryman said that for most of the 2-hour concert, the noise levels recorded 
exceeded recommended limits as measured at the berm within the amphitheater. 
Merryman said noise from a nearby motorcycle race on the night of the concert 
made obtaining an accurate sound reading difficult.

PRESIDENT OF SOUTHERN BAPTISTS' RADIO-TV OPERATION RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the Southern Baptists' extensive radio and television 
operation resigned this week as the agency's board of trustees was considering 
two new offers to buy the denomination's cable television network. 
</P>
<P>
Baptist Press reported that the Rev. Jimmy Allen, president of the 
denomination's Radio-Television Commission since January, 1980, announced that 
he will become chief executive of one of the companies that has made an offer 
to buy the network, if the offer is accepted. The board was meeting in Ft. 
Worth, the commission's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has a $7.7-million budget, of which its cable network, the 
American Christian Television System (ACTS), composes about half. The Rev. 
Richard T. McCartney, executive vice president of the commission, said about 
$5.5 million of the budget is subsidized by offerings from Southern Baptists. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 61, was president of the Southern Baptist Convention from 1977 to 1979. 
He helped create the network, which the commission says is available to 9.5 
million cable subscribers. It went on the air in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a $34-million deal to sell the network fell through. A group of 
investors who had signed a purchase agreement last summer was unable to raise 
purchase money and other conditions of the proposed sale, commission officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The network has a debt of about $8 million. Harold Brundige, the commission's 
board chairman, said he hoped the network could be sold and operated as a 
multi-denominational system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that the debt be taken care of if we are to continue," 
Brundige said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen announced last year that he would become a top executive of Friends of 
ACTS, the company that originally had agreed to buy the network. Chip Atkins, 
the head of the firm, also operates a San Antonio advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said on April 11 that Friends of ACTS had been bought by another group of 
investors led by Dallas-area businessman Ralph Tacker. The new group of 
investors submitted one of the offers now being considered. Allen would become 
a chief executive of the Tacker operation if that group's offer is accepted. If 
that offer is not accepted, Allen said he will consider other career options, 
including a church pastorate. 
</P>
<P>
The other offer to buy ACTS is from a group of investors led by a Ft. Worth 
businessman, Robert Sivley, who operates a television production company, Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesmen reported that a subsidiary of Atkins Advertising, ACTSCOM, 
sells advertising for the ACTS network and receives 49% of the proceeds. In the 
commission's current fiscal year, ACTS had received $272,000 from ACTSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
When the planned sale fell through March 14, Allen said, "I have felt the 
strategy of an ACTS network is the most effective way to preach the gospel to 
every person in this country. I will continue to pour my energy into that. I do 
not know what the future configuration of ACTS will be, but I do know that I 
have had a sense of vision that centers on this kind of strategy, and I want to 
help this network do what it can."

TITAN GYMNASTS SIXTH AT THE NCAAS; 
</P>
<P>
GEORGIA WOMEN WIN TITLE, EDGING TOP-SEEDED UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton, returning to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
women's gymnastics championships for the time since 1986, finished sixth Friday 
while Georgia won the national title at its campus at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded UCLA finished second, five-hundredths of a point behind Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, led by all-around performer Lisa Dolan, had a team score of 189.45, 
which was 3.20 points behind Georgia's winning score. The Titans had beaten 
Georgia twice during the regular season, in which Fullerton compiled a 16-3 
record, all three losses coming against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season, Georgia created their own mistakes," Fullerton Coach Lynn 
Rogers said. "Tonight they hit all their routines." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia won the NCAA title for the second time in three years as the Lady 
Bulldogs' Corrinne Wright finished first with a score of 38.90 in the 
all-around competition and teammate Lucy Wener tied with UCLA's Tanya Service 
at 38.70. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan, who finished ninth with a score of 38.45, was Fullerton's top performer. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was hampered by a knee injury suffered by Stacey Harris on the vault 
that prevented her from competing on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was like the World Series. It's tighter than any other meet all year 
round," Rogers said. "Unfortunately for us, it affected certain individuals who 
didn't show their potential and good stuff. Stacey's injury really hurt the 
team score because we couldn't use her score on uneven bars." 
</P>
<P>
Dolan, a sophomore, had Fullerton's highest scores in three events -- the 
balance beam, the floor exercise and the vault. By finishing in the top eight 
in beam and vault, she qualified for the NCAA individual championships today. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Thomas, who scored the Titans' best score on the uneven bars with a 
9.75, tied for fifth overall on bars and also advanced to the individual 
championships today. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia won the team competition with a score of 192.65, followed by UCLA 
(192.60), Alabama (192.10), Nebraska (190.80), and Utah (190.20). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was sixth with 189.45, followed by Arizona State and Oregon State, 
each with 187.90, Oklahoma (187.05), Florida (187.00), Arizona (186.50) and 
Ohio State (186.40).

ART ENSEMBLE TRIES FOR SYNESTHESIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Nick Nolte as painter Lionel Dobie in "Life Lessons" -- the first part 
of the film trilogy "New York Stories" -- furiously laying down glistening 
tracks of paint while his stereo booms rock music from the '60s? Now that was a 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night the Improvisational Art Ensemble -- one painter and an Orange 
County music trio -- tried to stir up some good vibes in the Irvine Fine Arts 
Center courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
They hoped, as painter Jeff Severtson told the audience, to create a kind of 
synesthesia -- the mixing of aesthetic sensations that has been the elusive 
goal of certain artists since the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
But the improvised music was a soporific New Age wash of sustained synthesizer 
and electronic saxophone sounds underlaid with a steady drum beat and the 
occasional jangle of bells. And the two bouts of improvised painting -- "Homage 
to a Poorly Drawn Circle" and "Waters Ource" -- were overly polite activities 
that yielded results of no particular aesthetic interest. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Severtson chose to paint on a square framed canvas on an easel 
(which wobbled perilously whenever he applied more elbow grease). Had he 
chosen, say, lengths of paper or a huge piece of raw canvas, he would have been 
obliged to move around more and his project would have had a more contemporary 
flair. 
</P>
<P>
The canvas-on-the-easel idea was hokey and old-fashioned, more the kind of 
thing you'd expect on some earnest educational-TV program about how easy and 
pleasant it is to paint abstract works of art at home. 
</P>
<P>
Switching brushes from time to time (and occasionally standing back to toss his 
hair and analyze his creation), Severtson eked out colorful compositions that 
clung to the edges of the canvas, including the narrow wood frame, leaving a 
void in the center. 
</P>
<P>
In "Waters Ource," which took about 40 minutes to complete, he offered a 
greater range of activities -- splats and palette-knife gouges and spills of 
paint as well as careful brush strokes and muddy washes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the entire presentation was far too restricted and self-conscious to 
work as a total art experience. Severtson never seemed really involved in his 
work and the musicians (Dya Singh, Greg Page and Soheil Massoumi) lacked the 
requisite levels of intensity and inventiveness.

CULTURE DOWN ON THE FARM? YEP, YOUTH FESTIVAL AT KNOTT'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Yes, that was Snoopy standing next to the piano, but it wasn't Peanuts Gang 
prodigy Schroeder at the keys, just Michael Fennelly, a talented San Clemente 
High School senior who will be performing April 29 at Orange County's first 
Children's Cultural Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Fennelly and violinist Sachiko Tanaka, a Mission Viejo High School sophomore, 
were on hand at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park earlier this week for the 
announcement of the festival schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The daylong event at Knott's will benefit the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society, South Coast Repertory Theatre and the Children's Museum at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the series of events feature young performers such as Fennelly and 
Tanaka, who gave the representatives of various arts organizations at the 
luncheon a sample of their work, courtesy of the Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
After posing with Snoopy, Knott's mascot, Tanaka and Fennelly played three 
brief selections. 
</P>
<P>
They included Dvorak's familiar "Humoresque," a piece frequently used as 
background music in cartoons -- usually played just before an unsuspecting 
character is clobbered by a large piece of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the young classical musicians, festival visitors will be able to 
sample everything from Chinese dancers and Japanese drummers to Broadway show 
tunes, a Dixieland band and Appalachian Mountains clog dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Other cultural events scattered through the park will include marionettes, a 
mime, a storyteller and an original musical play called "When I Grow Up," about 
the choices and pressures that children face. 
</P>
<P>
Also available will be a Nature Walk Exhibit from the children's museum, 
featuring real stuffed North American animals, and an art workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Discount tickets, priced at $13.95 for adults and $11.95 for children 3 to 11, 
entitle visitors to Knott's other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets may be purchased from the three arts organizations or at the park 
April 29 for those who ask for the special order forms. 
</P>

ALABAMA'S 'DULL' AMPHITHEATRE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to respond to your review of the Alabama concert at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre ("Despite Fog, Strobes, Alabama Delivers Dull Show," by Jim 
Washburn, April 10): 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you were unable to see distinctly or hear clearly the pure adulation 
and excitement the audience displayed for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Your comment about the songs they performed -- that they "sounded like little 
more than commercials for a very weak beer" -- really reveals your ignorance to 
the popularity of the group. This group was again voted in the People magazine 
poll as "America's favorite group." Many of those songs went to No. 1 on the 
country music charts. I highly doubt they would have achieved No. 1 status if 
the songs had "forgettable melodies," as you stated. 
</P>
<P>
Your comment about Randy Owen's "continual 'We love you (fill in regional area 
here)!' interjections" again shows your lack of knowledge of the group. Alabama 
has millions of fans across America and abroad. This is an excellent gesture to 
make the fans in every city feel special. I know Alabama is not the only group 
to do this. Randy has always been energetic and emotional in concert. That's 
just Randy. 
</P>
<P>
The song "The Fans" was written especially for the fans by Alabama. That means 
a lot in this fast-paced world of so-called superstars who eventually forget 
their roots and the people who helped them attain their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Your reference to Teddy Gentry's "The Borderline," which you state was "so 
removed from real grit and feeling that it could make Marty Robbins puke in his 
grave," was a cheap shot. (You call yourself a journalist?) The song is a 
ballad. Did you honestly ever listen to the lyrics of Alabama's songs? 
Apparently not. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite evident from your review that you have never been to an Alabama 
concert before. For some reason, it appears you have a chip on your shoulder 
about Alabama. You might be well advised to stick to reviewing pop music 
concerts because you obviously don't know anything about country music.

SEGERSTROM WINS ANOTHER YEAR AS CENTER CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry R. Segerstrom, a moving force behind the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, was reelected to a 1-year term as Center chairman Thursday and, at the 
same board meeting, recommended that Newport Beach developer William Lyon 
succeed him a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
Changes approved in the Center's bylaws Thursday limit future chairmen to three 
successive 1-year terms and board members to three successive 3-year terms. 
After a 1-year hiatus, board members and chairmen may run again. 
</P>
<P>
The new bylaws provide for the incumbent chairman in his last term to designate 
a successor, a recommendation that must then be approved by the Center board's 
executive and nominating committees before submission to the full, 55-member 
board for approval. Lyon would be subject to final board election in April, 
1990, according to Thomas R. Kendrick, Center president. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose Bill Lyon because he's a community leader," Segerstrom said Friday. 
"I've worked with him for several years." 
</P>
<P>
The mechanism for succession, Segerstrom said, is "designed to insure a smooth, 
ongoing continuity of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
But Segerstrom said he was intent upon looking at the year ahead, and not 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"My focus is on the upcoming year and the term for which I was elected," he 
said. "I have another year as chairman to prove my worth and I'm going to try 
my darndest." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the Center continued well above the national average last year, 
bolstered largely by increased interest in ballet, Kendrick said during the 
Center's annual meeting which preceded the elections Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kendrick cautioned in his speech, "projected support fell $1 million 
short of our target last year," reinforcing his belief that "we . . . are 
vulnerable to any economic downturn or substantial programming loss," and that 
"bluntly, we are now unduly -- unrealistically -- reliant on box office 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kendrick's remarks were largely upbeat, telling Center members that 
"it's a distinct pleasure to be able to tell you that 1988 operating results 
exceeded all expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a recent marketing survey recommending that the Center build up to 
three additional theaters, Kendrick said, "Clearly, there is now justification 
to consider expansion of Center facilities in the decade ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance for all performances at the Center, including those presented by 
regional organizations, dipped slightly to 78% last year, he said, but that 
figure is still at least 10 points above the national figure. He attributed 
this decline to program expansion and patrons who are becoming "more 
selective." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, attendance for the greatly expanded number of performances 
presented directly by the Center rose from 83% to 85%, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, he said, almost 650,000 people attended performances at the 
Center. Since the Center opened in September, 1986, he said, more than 1.5 
million people, including 175,000 schoolchildren, have attended about 700 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick reported a net profit on a recent new production of "Babes in Toyland" 
and continued virtual sellouts of such Broadway shows as "Me and My Girl" and 
"Can-Can." A return engagement of "Cats," he said, set a house record. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of all," he said, "last year's success can be traced directly to our 
ballet series. We staked -- and established -- a claim as the No. 1 presenter 
of touring ballet on the West Coast. And the community responded beyond my . . 
. hopes." Ballet performances increased by 75%, to 44 performances, with an 
average paid attendance of 85.4%, which he said was 15 points above the 
national average. Ballet was the only Center subscription series that increased 
over 1987, he said, nearly breaking even. An $800,000 subsidy for ballet had 
been projected. 
</P>
<P>
Box office revenue for performances presented by the Center covered 83% of 
operating costs in 1988, compared to 74% in 1987, Kendrick said. The 1988 
figure is about 20 points above the national norm for comparable facilities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That figure must -- and will -- inevitably come down as attendance moves to 
normal levels," Kendrick said. "That money must be replaced by more support or 
the quality of programming -- the key to our success -- will fall, sharply."

ASK THE JUDGE: CAR-POOL LANE VIOLATIONS CAN RESULT IN A STIFF FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDGE B. TAM NOMOTO, B. Tam Nomoto, an Orange County Municipal Court judge, 
answers readers' questions about the law. Ask the Judge runs every other 
Saturday in Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q I got a ticket for being the "sole occupant" in the car-pool lane. I heard 
that this could be expensive, and that I should go in front of a judge if I 
want the fine lowered. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
C.B., 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A The fine for driving in the car-pool lane without any passengers -- as well 
as crossing the double yellow lines to enter or exit the car-pool lane -- is 
severe. If this is your first ticket for such an offense, the total minimum 
fine, including the penalty assessments, is $246. The maximum total fine is 
$365.50. If this is your second conviction within a year, the total minimum 
fine is $368.50 and the maximum fine is $491. If this is your third or more 
conviction within 2 years, the total minimum is $613.50 and the total maximum 
is $1,226. 
</P>
<P>
It would not help to go before a judge if you are being asked to pay the 
minimum amount, since that amount is mandatory and must be imposed. In fact, 
you could run the risk of being ordered to pay a sum greater than the minimum, 
but not exceeding the maximum permitted by law. 
</P>
<P>
Q What civil rights does a minor, particularly an 11-year-old, have? A court 
has set a visitation schedule for the child to visit his non-custodial parent, 
but the child strongly objects to the visitation. Can the child be forced to 
make the visit? I have heard that a child has no say in such matters. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that a child may have his own lawyer to represent him in court. 
How much weight does this lawyer have? 
</P>
<P>
D.Y., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A The law provides that a child's wishes will be considered by the court and 
given "due weight" if the child is of "sufficient age and capacity to reason so 
as to form an intelligent preference as to custody." 
</P>
<P>
There is no magic age as to when a child will be considered capable of making 
an intelligent reference. Generally, the older the minor, the more weight will 
be given to his or her wishes, although this should not be considered a fast 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney can be appointed to represent the child in a custody dispute if the 
court finds that it would be in the child's best interests to do so. This 
generally occurs when the child's interests differ from the interests of both 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
I have often said that there is usually no simple answer to questions dealing 
with property settlements or child-custody problems arising from a divorce. I 
would suggest that you consult an attorney in order to safeguard your child's 
happiness and well-being. The attorney would be in the best position to advise 
you as to the procedure to modify visitation, and whether an attorney for your 
child is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Q I did a really dumb thing. I was caught going over 100 m.p.h. on my 
motorcycle. Can I loose my license? 
</P>
<P>
A.J., 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A The consequences of driving at that speed can be expensive. The total maximum 
fine, including penalty assessments, is $1,226. In addition, the court can 
suspend your license for up to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
If you receive a second conviction within a 3-year period, the total maximum 
fine would be the same, but the Department of Motor Vehicles will suspend or 
restrict your license for 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
If you are convicted three or more times within 5 years, the total maximum fine 
would again be the same, but the DMV will suspend or restrict your license for 
1 year. 
</P>
<P>
If the DMV should decide to restrict your license for a second or more 
conviction, you could be limited to driving to and from work.

PHOTOGRAPHY: LANDSCAPE SPECIALIST TO OFFER BLACK-AND-WHITE WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us have considered signing up for one of those high-priced seminars 
offered in some remote location but usually back out because they're too 
expensive or too far away or you really don't want to give up a week's vacation 
to shoot rocks and roots. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that, if you live in Orange County, there is no better place to 
learn a lot about photography than in your own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Enter landscape photographer Larry Vogel, who will be conducting two weekend 
workshops on "The Fine Art of Black and White Photography" May 19 and July 14 
in Huntington Beach and Westminster. The fee is $100 and each workshop is 
limited to between five and eight students. 
</P>
<P>
Because both technique and inspiration will be discussed, any photographer -- 
beginning, intermediate or advanced -- can benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel says the inspirational side is very important but is left out of many 
seminars. "I have met a lot of people in photography who have the technical 
side down but their work really lacked that emotional value," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fine line where that happens, especially in landscape photographs 
and black-and-white photography. A lot of times the quality only exists in the 
technical part of the print and there's always more possibilities than most 
people take advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
The seminar will cover such topics as composition, exposure, a modified zone 
system (what it can do technically and how it can help you control your 
vision), film developing and printing controls, making proper proofs, quality 
printing with burning and dodging, selecting the proper paper grades, archival 
techniques, the finishing studio, mounting, matting and framing. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop will start on a Friday night at Vogel's house in Westminster, 
where he will have an introductory critique session. 
</P>
<P>
A shooting session will start Saturday morning at Central Park in Huntington 
Beach, where the zone system of controlling exposure will be taught using a 
4-by-5-inch view camera. 
</P>
<P>
Different techniques of composition will be covered and there will be 
demonstrations on how to create a mood with your images. Students will then 
shoot under Vogel's direction. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects on Sunday morning will include darkroom techniques, editing and 
working toward a final archival-framed print. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take the finished work in the house and hang it on the wall," Vogel 
said. "I've had a lot of people ask me at galleries or shows: 'What were you 
thinking or feeling when you made the photograph? Did it actually look like 
this?' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of those questions come up when they see the finished work." Workshop 
participants "will have gone through the whole process and all those questions 
will be answered because they were there." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the seminar, each participant will receive an 11-by-14-inch 
mounted print taken at the park as a remembrance of the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel has a few tips for those who can't attend the workshop but would like to 
improve their landscape photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Select the proper light. Look for days with the least contrast or an overcast 
sky. Early morning or late afternoon are the best times because the film can 
seldom handle the contrast range that exists on the bright sunny days. 
</P>
<P>
Look at a lot of fine artwork at galleries and museums and learn from others. 
It will give you a sense of quality and let you know where you stand 
technically. 
</P>
<P>
Decide what you really want out of photography. Is it going to be a hobby or a 
career? Realize you will get back whatever you put into it. Nothing happens 
accidently or by itself. Also, set a photographic goal. 
</P>
<P>
Use fine-grain film with a slow film speed when shooting landscapes where a 
fast shutter speed isn't a concern. You can produce larger photographs with 
finer grain and subtler tones. 
</P>
<P>
Use a tripod. It will help you produce sharper images and also slow you down 
and make you think about your vision. 
</P>
<P>
For information, contact Vogel at (714) 891-6956. 
</P>
<P>

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE 'NOES' HAVE IT ON ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joseph N. Bell 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago, the California League of Conservation Voters issued the 
results of a study -- based on data from the state's largest environmental 
organizations -- of the fate of environmentally oriented bills in Sacramento 
over the past 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although our state senators (four Republicans and one Democrat) came out well 
(just below the full Senate average), Orange County's seven Assembly members 
(all Republicans) averaged 45% below the full Assembly support level of 
environmental bills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County had the further distinction of the state's two lowest-rated 
legislators on environmental issues: Dennis Brown of Los Alamitos and John R. 
Lewis of Orange. Each had a rating of 4% support of environmental bills as 
contrasted with the full Assembly average of 61%. Almost as low were four other 
Orange County Assembly members: Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach, Robert Frazee of 
Carlsbad, Nolan Frizelle of Huntington Beach and Ross Johnson of La Habra. The 
single exception -- and the only Assembly member to bring the Orange County 
average up instead of dragging it down -- was Doris Allen of Cypress, who 
recently introduced a bill to ban gill-netting of sea life. 
</P>
<P>
The study was based on the fate of 20 environmental bills, eight of which Gov. 
George Deukmejian signed into law. Among them: overhaul of California's Clean 
Air Act, granting wider authority to local air pollution control districts, 
strengthening the motor vehicle inspection program, and identifying the causes 
and effects of acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
I was curious about how Brown and Lewis felt about being identified as the 
legislators with the worst environmental records in the state, so I called 
them. Lewis didn't return my calls, but I reached Brown in his Sacramento 
office. He told me he wasn't in the least dismayed by his low environmental 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he said, "the majority of my colleagues don't look as clearly 
at these bills as I do. They worry about being judged anti-environmentalist. I 
look at the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked him to identify the issues that caused him to vote against several 
specific environmental bills, he said: "We vote on thousands of measures up 
here every year, and I have no idea what my reasoning was on any particular 
one. I'd have to go back and look it up. But if I believe a bill involves a 
waste of tax dollars and isn't totally responsible, I vote against it." (Brown 
was the top "no" voter in the 1985-86 session, opposing 29% of all legislation 
offered.) 
</P>
<P>
If Brown's constituents are displeased with his environmental voting record, 
they are apparently not letting him know about it. "I don't know if I represent 
the views of my constituents on environmental matters," he said. "All I know is 
that so far, there hasn't been any response from them on this issue or on the 
so-called rating I received." 
</P>
<P>
I also talked with several leading Orange County environmentalists, none of 
whom was surprised at the ratings of the Orange County Assembly delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, a Democrat, said: "I'm probably the most 
vocal elected official in Orange County opposing offshore oil -- and I've never 
been contacted by any of our Orange County Assembly members for help or 
information. It's a real challenge trying to work with them because they could 
be very helpful to us. But we have very vocal members of Congress from this 
area who want to see the oil industry expand, and I feel our local state 
legislators follow their lead totally. So we don't even try anymore. There are 
a number of state Assembly members outside of Orange County who are 
environmentally concerned -- people like Mike Roos and Sam Farr -- and they are 
the legislators we work with." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's head honcho in Orange County, Dan Hayes, is both frustrated 
and confused by this situation. Frustrated because he feels that "Orange County 
Assembly members are not in step with their constituents. Most of their money 
comes from developers, and as soon as they are approached on an environmental 
bill, they're turned off. We've tried repeatedly to work with these folks and 
have got nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a lifelong Republican who recently became a Democrat, added: "About 65 
of our members in Orange County are Republicans, which makes it especially 
frustrating. It seems like we only back Democrats locally, but that's because 
our incumbent Republicans are so bad on environmental issues. The Sierra Club 
endorsement is highly prized in other parts of the state, but not in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose a lot of the fault is ours by not making the public more aware of 
how bad the environmental records of our Orange County Assembly members are, 
but these people appear to be politically entrenched. Even so, it's confusing 
to me that Orange County voters who are so sports-conscious and spend so much 
of their time outdoors aren't up in arms about this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Rosener -- a Democrat, former member of the Coastal Commission and an 
active Orange County environmentalist -- answers that question this way: 
"Environmental matters are not the single most important issue to most voters, 
so even though these Assembly members are out of step with their constituents 
on protecting the environment, that is seldom the primary motivation of voters 
-- unless they happen to be living next to a dump site. 
</P>
<P>
"But these are important enough matters that we have always tried to develop a 
strategy for dealing with each legislator on specific issues. Even those we 
know we can't convince, we try to keep informed -- and look for other ways to 
put pressure on them, sometimes by recasting the problem in the interests of 
the developers." 
</P>
<P>
On one point, the environmentalists agreed emphatically: It would help a lot if 
the constituents of these Assembly members made their displeasure known.

BOOKS AND AUTHORS: RAY BRADBURY, HIS WORDS ADORN LIBRARY POSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The setting is Ray Bradbury's cluttered basement office in his Cheviot Hills 
home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There, looking up from his desk as if caught in mid-sentence, is the 
white-maned literary lion in his natural habitat: surrounded by a lifetime's 
worth of books and memorabilia. Displayed prominently in the foreground is a 
copy of Bradbury's latest book, "Death Is a Lonely Business," and a library 
card. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely the point of the Orange County Public Library's full-color 
poster featuring the prolific science fiction writer. 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries are my university. I am their eternal graduate," Bradbury is quoted 
as saying at the top of the poster, which celebrates the Orange County Public 
Library as "My Kind of Place." 
</P>
<P>
The limited edition poster was released this week in conjunction with National 
Library Week. It is available, for free, at all 27 Orange County branch 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury is the fourth in a series of authors selected annually to appear on 
the library's poster. Previously honored authors are T. Jefferson Parker of 
Laguna Beach, Donald Stanwood of Santa Ana and Maxine O'Callaghan of Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
With Bradbury, the library obviously has broken the tradition of featuring 
home-grown authors. 
</P>
<P>
"He is certainly one of the most renowned authors of our time and, while 
normally in the past we've always done Orange County authors, we had the 
opportunity to do Ray Bradbury . . . and he's a tremendous supporter of 
libraries," said Cheryl Pruett, community relations coordinator for the Orange 
County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett, a Bradbury fan, went along for the photo shoot in Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bigger than it appears," she said. "He opens the door and you are kind of 
taken aback. It's filled. No matter where you look you see something new and 
fascinating -- anything from Godzilla to a jar of what looks like formaldehyde 
with something strange floating in it. There are things hanging from the 
ceiling and masks and toys and world globes. . . . It's fascinating. And his 
typewriter is in the middle of all this and this is where he creates." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury was unavailable for comment this week, but fans will have an 
opportunity in May to find out how he likes being the library's latest poster 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
On May 7 the Friends of the Library Foundation will host "An Afternoon With Ray 
Bradbury" from 2 to 4 p.m. at Heritage Park Regional Library, 14361 Yale Ave., 
Irvine. Posters will be given away and copies of Bradbury books will be 
available for purchase during an autograph session with the author of 
"Fahrenheit 451" and "The Martian Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
Admission is a $20 donation for a Friends of the Library Foundation Membership. 
(The single $20 admission fee covers couples and families). The admission fee 
for current members of local Friends of the Library organizations is $10. 
Reservations may be made by calling (714) 834-6600 or 834-6835. 
</P>
<P>
