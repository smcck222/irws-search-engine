UTOPIAN PESSIMIST THE LIFE AND THOUGHT OF SIMONE WEIL BY DAVID MCLELLAN

By Nancy Mairs, Mairs, a poet and essayist, is a practicing feminist Catholic, 
you should excuse the oxymoron. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weil's life was, by her own choice, brief. On its outlines, Gabriella Fiori and 
David McLellan agree. She was born in Paris in 1909 to nonpracticing Jews, a 
"gentle, self-effacing" doctor, in McLellan's words, and his "assertive," 
"indefatigable" yet "articulate, persuasive and charming" wife, whose father 
had prevented her from studying medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Selma Weil, preferring her son, Andre, encouraged her daughter to be manly and 
forthright even at the risk of appearing rude. Both biographers reveal the 
young Weil as sickly, obstinate, disgusted by physical touch, devoted to but 
competitive with her older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Like Andre, she was highly educated, receiving a degree in philosophy from the 
Ecole Normale Superieure. In spite of devastating migraine headaches and 
generally poor health, she then taught for several years. She also became 
involved with trade unions, wrote articles for syndicalist publications and 
held menial jobs in several factories, the better to understand workers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Her activist inclinations led her to Spain during the Civil War, but within 
days of joining the anarchist militia there -- with an ineptitude that 
characterized her physical life in general -- she stepped into a pot of boiling 
oil and burned herself so badly that her parents (who dogged her wanderings and 
rescued her from more than one disaster) took her back to France. 
</P>
<P>
Upon the occupation of Paris in 1940, the three went to Marseilles, where Weil 
continued her writing, found agricultural work and deepened the spiritual quest 
that had gradually superseded her political activism. After a short, unhappy 
stay in the United States in 1942, she left her parents behind to join the Free 
French in London. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusioned and chagrined that no one had found her "any useful work that 
involved a high degree of hardship and danger," she stepped up the 
self-starvation she had practiced to some degree all her life, and by the end 
of August, 1943, she was dead -- still unbaptized -- despite her profession of 
faith "in God, in the Trinity, in the incarnation, in the redemption, in the 
Eucharist, in the teachings of the Gospel" -- because of her resistance to the 
institutional church. 
</P>
<P>
Into this biographical framework, both McLellan and Fiori weave summaries of 
Weil's rigorously intellectual reflections in the form of letters, articles and 
books, many of which were not published until well after her death. McLellan is 
the more successful at this task. His presentation, although plodding, is lucid 
and substantial, as his synopsis of Weil's favorite themes reflects: "her 
biting criticism of the view of history as progress; her antipathy to Rome and 
Israel; her admiration for the Greeks; the mistaken dominance given to science 
in contemporary society; her strong connection of art and literature with moral 
values; the centrality accorded to physical labour; her unwillingness to 
consider political institutions, however democratic, as the main legitimizers 
of the distribution of power; her awareness of the danger of all collective 
activity; her insistence that genuine liberty and equality could only be 
founded by reference to other worldly values." 
</P>
<P>
Fiori's approach, less conventionally academic, promises to be lively and 
inventive: Basing her work solely "on evidence provided by people who knew her 
and upon her works," she intends "a biography . . . designed as a mosaic 
reconstruction or, even better, an organism of living cells." Unfortunately, 
thanks to shifts in tense and point of view, overblown rhetoric and 
typographical oddities, the result is more of a mishmash, for which author, 
translator and editor all must bear responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a simple statement that Weil rejected the idea of marriage, for 
instance, Fiori is translated as saying, "As far as the idea of love codified 
in marriage, associated somehow with feminine attraction, dates, clothes, the 
signals and messages of use and wont, she perhaps never paused there at all." 
If a clear sense of Weil's being fails to emerge through McLellan's dutiful but 
dull prose, it fares no better in Fiori's meandering verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
And for some reason, the life that lies at the heart of any biography, even an 
"intellectual" one, never does quite animate either book. Perhaps the 
difficulty is that neither confronts Weil's anomalous existence as a creature, 
and specifically a female creature, struggling against incarnation. As the 
subtitle and structure of McLellan's book suggest, he views "thought" as 
separable from, and even preferable to, "life"; and, except to report her 
always disheveled appearance and her crippling headaches, he ignores her bodily 
experience almost entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, at the very end, he notes that "hunger and nourishment are the 
dominant metaphors in her writings," only in order to deny that she was 
anorexic. In view of her death, her anorexia is incontestable, however, 
although it appears to have been not the anorexia nervosa prevalent today but 
rather perhaps the anorexia mirabilis of certain medieval female mystics. By 
inexplicably passing over the dominant metaphors in her writings, McLellan has 
failed to connect the bodies of the woman and the work. 
</P>
<P>
Fiori shows herself more sensitive to such connections, affirming that, "In 
reality, there was no split between the substance and the appearance of this 
young woman" and dubbing her, with infelicity but good will, "a genius-woman." 
Her essentialist understanding of "woman" is revealed, however, when she refers 
to Weil's "feminine sensibility which more easily grasped the concrete detail 
apt to overthrow the useless abstraction." "I am not a feminist," Fiori quotes 
Weil, and apparently she perceives this statement as excusing her from a 
feminist reading, which might have provided the focus her project lacks and 
enlivened her exploration of Weil's genuinely mysterious life. 
</P>
<P>
The reader who wants a coherent, workmanlike introduction to that life would do 
well to choose "Utopian Pessimist" over "Simone Weil." Better yet, however, now 
that much of Simone Weil's own work has been translated, read some of that: 
"The Need for Roots," perhaps, or "Waiting for God." It will be worth the 
struggle.

SECULAR HERESY IN THE NAME OF CHRIST; 
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICAL MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AN INTERPRETATION BY GLENN TINDER 
(LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $29.95; 272 PP.; 0-8071-1510-X) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven Englund, Englund is a historian who divides his time between Waupaca, 
Wis., and Paris, where he has taught at the Universite de Paris-VIII and the 
Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1933, the English Catholic historian, Christopher Dawson, suggested that 
"the true social function of religion is not to busy itself with economic or 
political reforms, but to save civilization from itself by revealing to men the 
true end of life and the true nature of reality." 
</P>
<P>
In a book that is winning its author remarkable acclaim, Glenn Tinder, 
professor of political theory at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, 
undertakes to reveal "the true end of life and the true nature of reality" in 
light of the Gospels after another half-century of the creeping (or galloping) 
secularization that Dawson decried. 
</P>
<P>
Tinder laments the steep price we are paying for our secularism in diminution 
of the value we ascribe to ourselves as individuals. The person whose "every 
hair is numbered" in God's heart is, to his fellow human beings, more often a 
means than an end -- still less an "infinitely precious end." Tinder 
mercilessly dissects the self-regarding assumptions underpinning consumer 
society -- whether in the arguments it advances for abortions, its treatment of 
the old and of minorities, or its casual attitude toward the use of violence, 
military or other. 
</P>
<P>
These are but reflections of the central, psychological problem: Tinder 
discerns in us a complete inability to see ourselves for what we inevitably are 
-- evil-doers, sinners, in need if not of a redeemer, then at least of the 
consciousness that we require redemption. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he argues that the Christian vision "has to an astonishing degree 
been forgotten," that Christianity is a diminishing "moral savings accumulated 
over many centuries but no longer being replenished." And so, the ancient task 
that Tinder sets himself is to show in a new and relevant way "the 
correspondence between Christian truth and our needs as a society. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the author is at well-taken pains to explicate Christian 
concepts in secular terms. He accomplishes this via deft and pertinent literary 
references that range from Greek tragedy to Fyodor Dostoevsky to Ignazio Silone 
and via an exposition devoid of institutional or ideological tilt: "The truth 
with which Christians are in touch is not one they possess. It is not a truth 
they can adequately embody even in the infinitely pliant and receptive material 
of words, much less is it a truth they can embody adequately in the intractable 
and rebellious material that constitutes society. . . . We can only find it in 
our individual destinies. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A modern classic of political theory, "The Political Meaning of Christianity" 
is a slow read not because it is poorly written (its prose is often elegant and 
austere) but because it is the distillation of a lifetime of thought and prayer 
(Tinder is 67). Its minutely reasoned analyses of familiar topics like sin, 
hope, suffering, liberty, the church, the state, power, etc., are often 
brilliant and always fresh and illuminating, but they defy rapid summary. 
</P>
<P>
Along with discussions of familiar terms, the author proposes a number of new 
ideas and concepts -- for example, the prophetic stance: "An attitude, a way of 
facing society . . . (it) means offering one's own weakness as a medium for the 
sovereignty of God in history." Or again, destiny: any individual's call to his 
"glory as a human being," his career in God, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
Destiny is not to be confused with "objectively established fate," for it may 
be refused or embraced, depending on the person. Thus, "Christ was not 
untouched by fate, for he was crucified. His fate was transformed into destiny, 
however," by his acceptance of God's will for him. 
</P>
<P>
Tinder is never stronger than in analyzing Christian versus secular dichotomies 
-- for example, the notion of community (an ideal, "a set of perfected 
relationships") which he contrasts with society ("the kind of unity that comes 
about because of the necessities of life in the world . . . requir(ing) that 
the value of an individual be assessed on the basis of social utility"). 
</P>
<P>
What Tinder's thesis finally turns on is his contention that "there is no 
greater error in the modern mind than the assumption that Christ, the God-man, 
can be repudiated with impunity." Even here, Tinder's reasoning is subtle, and 
the reader who assumes he is being bludgeoned into kneeling in a pew has missed 
the point. The author is not pressing religious conversion -- a deeply, perhaps 
purely, personal matter -- but simply considering the political effect of the 
repudiation of the "God-man." 
</P>
<P>
That effect, as Tinder shows in analyses of modern culture and world politics 
worthy of Reinhold Niebuhr, is to lead people "inevitably to begin to dream of 
the man-god." That is to say, via the confection of idols -- the flag, the 
marketplace, the therapy session, the laboratory, etc. -- society gradually 
comes to divinize and worship itself (or some representation of itself). 
</P>
<P>
Such a society may perhaps retain a marginalized and privatized practice of 
traditional religion, but it has nothing approaching -- and indeed even no 
public language for framing -- a serious political commitment to the Christian 
"principle that we are strong only when we are weak, rich only when we are 
poor, alive only when we are (crucified) . . . (that) we do not command the 
future but receive it from the hands of God; and we receive it only by giving 
up all pretensions of historical sovereignty, in dying." 
</P>
<P>
The very statement of ideals like the above in a political context is apt to 
draw faint smiles from even sympathetic readers. But the society that rejects 
those ideals ends up believing that it has created its own transcendence and 
surrenders to "the nearly irresistible inclination to count on nothing that is 
not assured by (its) own power." 
</P>
<P>
Given Tinder's vivisection of everybody else's ideology, it is rather 
remarkable that his book has received raves from grandees in American religion 
and was the cover subject of the December Atlantic magazine. We may not be 
quite as far along the path to secularist perdition as Tinder thinks. 
</P>
<P>
In all events, whether reveille or swan-song, Tinder's work, like Karl Barth's, 
catches the reader up in the force of an unfolding, deductive but never 
reductive vision of the Christian gospel. "The Political Meaning of 
Christianity" succeeds completely in its bid to make the reader consider 
seriously what he or she thought had already been adequately considered; namely 
what another great theologian, Edward Schillebeeckx, calls Christianity's 
"tender of an offer of meaning." Rejection may follow the reading, but it won't 
be a light or ignorant rejection. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say there are no criticisms to raise. Left-wing Christians may 
not entirely buy Tinder's chariness of Liberation Theology, particularly when 
it is set alongside the author's sometimes uncritical affection for American 
democracy. More serious is a special pleading on behalf of the historical 
church. The author passes off Christianity's support of jingoism with the 
statement: "Such behavior, however, exemplifies the weakness and sinfulness of 
Christians and not the true meaning of Christianity." Many of the isms that 
Tinder rightly rejects would pass muster by that tolerant standard. And yet 
such criticisms remain external to Tinder's central project. 
</P>
<P>
Writing admiringly about Bertrand Russell's "Worship of a Free Man," the 
English critic C. S. Lewis, at the time still an agnostic, could not resist the 
observation that Russell, for all the virtues of his book, "does not face the 
real difficulty -- that our ideals are after all a natural product, facts with 
a relation to all other facts, and cannot survive the condemnation of the fact 
as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
That condemnation as always raises the troubling question of the ultimate 
sanction. Some can do without a celestial hook, as it were, on which to hang 
their idealism, particularly when the going gets rough. Tinder is not among 
them: "I do not know how atheists can avoid political despair," he confesses. 
The question, of course, was posed long before Lewis; and it will return to 
prove irksome again one day. But for now, anyway, Tinder has won our full 
attention with his answer.

Photo, "I guess fame is relative," comments author Philip Varney dryly as he 
observes the sign advertising "Famous ABC Beer" on the side of this abandoned 
commercial building in the town of Keeler. Varney identifies Keeler, located 16 
miles outside of Lone Pine on state route 136, as one of "Southern California's 
Best Ghost Towns" (see review this page), and notes that the town's most 
prominent structure, the Sierra Talc Co., has been "a favorite subject of 
artists." No doubt that distinction, too, is relative.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HAPPY TALK CONFESSIONS OF A TV NEWSMAN BY FRED GRAHAM 
(W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 352 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Colker

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who nightly watched Fred Graham, former legal-affairs reporter for CBS 
news, during the Watergate era know him as a thorough newsman with a knack for 
explaining complicated issues in down-to-earth terms. 
</P>
<P>
Those who read the first chapter of his memoirs will also know him as a very 
funny writer. His description of the behind-the-scenes insanity at a local TV 
station in Nashville, where he was a news anchor after CBS failed to renew his 
contract, is a riot. It's also poignant -- Graham relays the anguish of a man 
once near the pinnacle of his profession as he tries to fit into a rag-tag 
"Happy Talk" operation. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that after that great first chapter he suddenly makes a shift into 
a choppy style that resembles news-bite journalism. Stories about his 
interesting early careers as a lawyer and New York Times writer are told in 
snippets intercut with scenes from his childhood or college days. The effect is 
more confusing than revelatory. One wishes he had paid heed to what Bill Small, 
one of his former CBS bosses, told him when his on-air style was getting too 
fancy: "Just tell the news." 
</P>
<P>
He does relate some juicy tales from inside CBS, including some about the 
cutthroat competition among reporters. And about two-thirds through the book he 
picks up steam as he writes about the changes at CBS news -- severe cutbacks 
and the onset of the "infotainment" news style he calls "happy talk" -- that 
rocked that organization. There have been other books on the subject, but 
Graham provides the viewpoint of someone who was on the inside and saw careers 
and lives, including his own, drastically changed. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the book, he takes us back to Nashville for a fascinating look 
at local TV news. Without belittling his co-workers or the form, he explains in 
the best tradition of Graham reporting how "happy talk" works and why it didn't 
work for him. David Colker

<TEXT>
<P>
I don't mean to harp. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true. I do mean to, at least a little bit. Doesn't the elite 
triple-play author -- the one whose advance, print run and paperback sale are 
all in the six-or-more figures -- have a social responsibility? Isn't there a 
literary equivalent of noblesse oblige? 
</P>
<P>
Surely I jest; Coca-Cola and Hershey's Kisses aren't nutritious, just wildly 
popular. Stories of love gone awry can't be expected to devote a single 
psychospiritual calorie to the health and welfare of the collective soul. 
They're just fun to nibble at. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, I can't help but wish for a big, popular book that tastes 
good and is good for me, too. 
</P>
<P>
Rona Jaffe's An American Love Story (Delacorte Press: $19.95; 432 pp.) 
certainly has the pizazz. Four women are in love with the same callow fellow, 
television producer (ne talent agent) Clay Bowen. There's his wife Laura, a 
ballerina of the Gelsey Kirkland pharmaceutical school; his daughter Nina, who 
does everything she can to gain Dad's attention; Bambi, the ambitious agent, 
and Susan, the writer whose career gets launched when she befriends a Lenny 
Bruce sound-alike and gets an exclusive interview. 
</P>
<P>
The comic asks Susan, "Do you take notes, or what?" and her response is, "I 
used to, but it made people nervous. . . . Now I just remember, I have a very 
good memory." That noise you hear is all the libel lawyers who read this 
column, laughing their heads off -- and Susan is supposed to be the smartest of 
the quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the point: How many different ways can you doll up the leftovers? What 
Jaffe's dishing up is the same old story about good women gone wrong, or at 
least temporarily daft. It's the literary equivalent of comfort food. Jaffe's a 
seasoned cook, so this is very classy macaroni and cheese, but hey -- let's see 
somebody write a story about four guys who are mad as hatters over an elusive 
dame. 
</P>
<P>
At least Julia Fenton believes in equality of the sexes -- in Black Tie Only 
(Contemporary Books: $19.95; 447 pp.), both villainy and charm ooze their way 
across gender lines. Fenton is one of those name-brand authors, the ones who 
believe that proper nouns will ground an otherwise featherweight tale. She also 
seems to have a database of every best-seller story line ever spun: Fenton's 
tale of the beauteous Alexandra, a Chicago socialite, is really several stories 
at once. There's the deep, dark secret, involving a drug-hazed accidental 
death, that threatens to rear its ugly head just as Alexandra puts the 
finishing touches on a gala for Princess Di, who happens to be an old 
private-school pal from the era when the deep, dark secret occurred; there's 
Alexandra's strained marriage, where, for the sake of titillation, the sex is 
still great; and, last but bloodily not least, there's the hotel/union/Mafia 
problems that threaten Alexandra's husband's empire, as well as his wife and 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
It's familiar stuff. But whatever energy the author conserved in imagination 
she spends on the execution. Fenton won't settle for the standard 
snatch-and-grab of a kid from his school-yard playground; Alexandra is probably 
the first heroine to be confronted in an elevator by a union wacko disguised as 
a delivery man, who pops a videotape into a VCR and shows her a computerized 
simulation of the planned kidnaping of her eldest child (I've spent too much 
time wondering where he plugged the VCR in, in a moving elevator, but I've 
always had trouble with the willing suspension of disbelief). And our heroine 
doesn't stand by, quaking, while some tough guy saves the day. She's right in 
there dodging bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies have less of a role in Sidney Zion's Markers (Donald I. Fine: $19.95; 
426 pp.) but maybe that's because Zion writes about power, and women still 
don't have enough of it. This is, essentially, a buddy book: Mike O'Rourke is 
the hard-working journalist and Jesse Frank is his childhood pal, a criminal 
attorney who has made the collecting of favors -- markers -- into a lucrative 
art form. Jesse calls Mike Scoop; Mike dreams of winning the Pulitzer some day 
and, you guessed it, before too long, they're on a collision course. Zion, a 
lawyer and journalist himself (is this the world's first split-personality 
novel?), serves up an insider's look at courtroom and press room shenanigans -- 
and if his women tend to do things such as cook breakfast and marvel adoringly 
over a man's sexual prowess, maybe they do more interesting stuff offstage that 
we never read about. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Greeley has written another kind of buddy novel in The Cardinal Virtues 
(Warner Books: $19.95; 464 pp.). The buddies here are old Father Lar and 
younger Father Jamie, together facing a corrupt church hierarchy that tries to 
intrude on Father Lar's management of his rather lively flock. Greeley has 
wandered down this lucrative path before with the best-selling "The Cardinal 
Sins," and with more than 12 million copies of 10 novels in print, he's proven 
that we're as willing to read about PG-rated philosophical indiscretions as we 
are the seamier -- and/or steamier -- sort.

'THE HEIGHT OF HUBRIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could it be that Robert Ward's credentials, earned working as a television 
producer, give some indication of why television is in such a sorry state? His 
categorical assertion in his review of "Writers in Hollywood" (by Ian Hamilton, 
Book Review, April 1) that "in movies, character is completely dictated by 
plot" seems to me the height of hubris and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
That may well be the rule on "Miami Vice," but it is certainly not true in the 
best of films. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what distinguishes fine films from the mediocre is character 
development, with stories that are driven by the interrelation of unique and 
interesting people. 
</P>
<P>
Ward claims that " 'What does the hero do?' is the main question, not 'How does 
he feel?' or 'What does he think?' " In fact, one of the reasons that screen 
writing is a demanding form beyond the reach of many novelists is that the 
writer must rely on what his characters do to convey how they feel and what 
they think about. (In the best drama, as in life, characters often lie with 
words and tell the truth with their behavior -- and this certainly includes 
film drama.) 
</P>
<P>
I suggest Ward go see "Driving Miss Daisy," which won an Oscar for its writer, 
Alfred Uhry. There's not much in the way of plot, but there's 25 years of 
enlightening and moving character development.

RONALD COLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
I am researching a biography of Ronald Colman for Greenwood Press and I am 
trying to locate prints of TV shows he did for "Four Star Playhouse," "The 
Halls of Ivy," "G.E. Theater," "Studio 57" and "The Jack Benny Show." I am also 
trying to locate copies of his first and last radio shows, both for NBC: "A 
Tale of Two Cities" (1935) and "A Christmas Carol" (1956), plus his appearance 
on the NBC game show "Double or Nothing" in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
If you know the whereabouts of any of these radio and TV shows, please write 
me.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A FATHER'S WORDS BY RICHARD STERN (UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 
PRESS: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A supposedly comic novel about a divorced father struggling to come to terms 
with his ne'er-do-well son. 
</P>
<P>
Jack, who casually buzzes in and out of jobs and people's lives, obviously is 
intended to exude an irreverent, counterculture charm -- a sort of literary 
equivalent of Michael Parks in "Then Came Bronson." He comes off as a flake, a 
slug and a bore. Cy, the narrator/father, is no prize either, and the two 
characters richly deserve each other. Getting through Stern's wordy prose is as 
cumbersome as chipping through a brick wall with a nut pick, and every bit as 
much fun.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: VELOCITY BY KRISTINE MCCLOY (WASHINGTON SQUARE: $7.95) 
</P>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A promising first novel about learning to accept love and loss. Kristine McCloy 
writes well when she describes women confronting their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Ellie must come to grips with the death of her mother: The memories and the 
loss of her reassuring presence have become an almost intolerable burden. She 
turns for support to Sandra, a local waitress and self-described casuality in 
the war between the sexes. But Ellie, who's lived in New York's grubby East 
Village, also is the daughter of a small-town Southern sheriff. Her naive 
pursuit of a dope-dealing biker seems more than a little improbable. Nor is 
Jesse, the lean, mean monosyllabic dream stud, much of a character. He's 
supposed to be a freewheeling outlaw, working at the fringes of the Hell's 
Angels, but these bikers are decidedly tame -- the Blue Meanies in "Yellow 
Submarine" were more threatening. McCloy is reportedly at work on a second 
novel, and it will be interesting to watch her talent develop.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SECRETS OF THE OLD GROWTH FOREST BY DAVID KELLY &amp; GARY 
BRAASCH (GIBBS-SMITH: $15.95, ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This handsome, outsized volume combines a paean to the beauties of the forest 
with a diatribe against the timber industry. Old-growth forest is characterized 
by large conifers at least 250 years old, tall standing snags and big fallen 
logs. 
</P>
<P>
The most productive biomass on Earth, it once dominated the Pacific Northwest 
ecosystem, stretching from Northern California to Anchorage, Alaska. Barely 10% 
of the old growth remains, and much of that is slated for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
David Kelly and Gary Braasch excoriate the policies of the Bureau of Land 
Management under the Reagan administration, and accuse the federal government 
of propping up a moribund timber industry at the expense of taxpayers, hunters 
and commercial salmon fishermen. The destruction of the old growth imperils the 
habitats of more than two dozen animals, including the bald eagle, the marbled 
murrelet, the Roosevelt elk and the Olympic salamander, as well as the 
much-publicized spotted owl. With its handsome nature photographs, "Secrets" 
will appeal most strongly to conservationists, reducing this thoughtful polemic 
to a sermon to the converted.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: EUROPEANS BY JANE KRAMER (PENGUIN: $10.95) 
</P>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The polished, insightful writing in this collection of "Letter From Europe" 
columns in the New Yorker provides a welcome antidote to the shallow 
sensationalism that characterizes much of contemporary journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Kramer offers vivid portraits of individuals ranging from a doughty Breton 
innkeeper who led the local Resistance during World War II to a self-styled 
Italian psychotherapist and intellectual, currently serving a prison term in 
Milan for fraud. Her analyses of current political issues, including the French 
attitude toward expatriate North African workers and the controversy over the 
West German government's anti-terrorist measures are well-researched and 
carefully balanced. Valuable background reading for anyone planning a trip to 
Europe.

CINEFILE: IN SEARCH OF . . . RAQUEL WELCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Helen Berg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She made an early acting career of skimpy on-screen outfits in B and C movies, 
but later quieted skeptics with her comedic skills in "The Three Musketeers" 
(1974) and her SRO performances on Broadway as Lauren Bacall's replacement in 
the Tony Award-winning "Woman of the Year." Now, soon to turn 50 (Sept. 5), 
Raquel Welch is gradually easing herself out of the role of actress, aiming at 
a new career as a producer. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging Hollywood's unkindness to aging actresses, she hopes "in five 
years time I wouldn't have to be in front of the camera" and could be producing 
full-time, developing strong film roles for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with anyone," Welch says. "I think 
they are waiting to be told. . . . This is a marketplace. Here, they are ready 
for people with ideas. I have plenty of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Not that she's disappeared. She's just released her fourth fitness video ("Body 
&amp; Mind") and has made a TV movie each of the last three years. But she 
hasn't had a feature film role since 1982 when Debra Winger replaced her in 
MGM's "Cannery Row." She later sued MGM and was awarded $10.8 million, a 
judgment that's been appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"My feature career got cut off at the knees" with the "Cannery Row" incident, 
Welch admits, but feels it's now behind her. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of an office at First Management, an arm of Guber-Peters 
Entertainment, she's a bit cagey about projects she says she has in development 
-- "You're talking about a cake that is baking, and I'm not ready to open the 
oven door yet." She mentions features, TV movies, miniseries and sitcoms that 
she would produce and appear in, including a miniseries on controversial '30s 
torch singer Libby Holman, but won't provide many details. 
</P>
<P>
The face and body that made her famous were "my ticket to ride," Welch says, 
although she concedes that the sex-symbol stereotype can be a trap. "Here I am 
an actress in my late 40s -- I don't look like that, but that's where I am 
emotionally and personally. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grown up and I don't have any yen to play in 'Splash,' you know?" Mary 
Helen Berg

OUTTAKES: HANDLE WITH CARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Longtime Companion," a frank look at a group of gay friends in New York City 
coping with the impact of AIDS on their lives in the 1980s, is the kind of 
feature film some distributors would give the soft sell. But the Goldwyn Co. 
plans to pull no punches in marketing the movie, which opens in New York May 11 
and here a week later. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's very difficult subject matter, and not the easiest marketing 
job, but we think it's going to surprise people," says Tom Rothman, Goldwyn 
senior veep and worldwide production chief. "It has to be handled with great 
care, and nurtured. 
</P>
<P>
"We're addressing the (gay and AIDS) issue head-on. From a marketing point of 
view, that's the real question. We're not in any way afraid of what the movie 
is about. That's why we picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
Trailers for "Longtime Companion" are already appearing in theaters along with 
mainstream releases. They "mention both AIDS and homosexuality in the first 20 
seconds," Rothman says -- and have been drawing applause. "We feel it's a movie 
that both gay and non-gay audiences will respond to." 
</P>
<P>
Produced for American Playhouse Theatrical Films, the picture was written by 
Craig Lucas and directed by Norman Rene. The sizable ensemble cast includes 
Bruce Davison, Patrick Cassidy, Dermot Mulroney and Campbell Scott. Some are 
already doing advance publicity for the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the actors are very proud of it," Rothman said. "I think only one 
or two are gay, and I wouldn't know which ones -- it's none of my business." 
</P>
<P>
Does it take special courage for mainstream actors to appear in such a film? 
</P>
<P>
"I think so. I think the whole movie is courageous." John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: STILL KICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Norris, now age 50 and absent from the screen for more than a year, will 
see if he's got some kick left when he returns to the cameras in June, for 
Cannon Pictures' "50/50." 
</P>
<P>
The action-adventure has him teaming with a yet-to-be-cast buddy to oust a 
dictator and restore to power the "last democratic president" of the fictional 
country of Tengara. 
</P>
<P>
To be directed by Charles Martin Smith (the upcoming "Boris and Natasha"), it's 
one of two Norris projects on tap. The already-shot "Delta Force II" is due in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Norris' box-office power has waned since his back-to-back 1985 hits, "Invasion 
U.S.A." ($17.5 million gross) and "Code of Silence" ($18 million), and 1987's 
"Delta Force" ($17 million). 
</P>
<P>
His last film, "Hero and the Terror" (1988), had ticket sales of just $6 
million. "Braddock: Missing in Action" (1988) also grossed $6 million. Pat H.

OUTTAKES: SAVE THE TURTLES! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" are doing more than big box office -- 
they're helping save real-life turtles. 
</P>
<P>
Save-the-turtles benefit screenings held last month in Washington and San Jose 
raised approximately $10,000 for turtle aid, according to the recipients -- 
D.C.'s Center for Marine Conservation and San Francisco's Earth Island 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, some 40 theaters showing "TMNJ" are holding ongoing fund-raising 
activities and offering information on behalf of turtle conservation programs. 
(Locally, those include AMC's Fullerton 8, Orange Mall and Santa Ana Mainplace 
Theaters.) 
</P>
<P>
Turtle creators Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman are in discussions with the staff 
at the Center for Marine Conservation about "doing conservation-themed stories 
in the (Ninja Turtle TV) cartoon series," according to Marydele Donnelly, 
director of its Sea Turtle Conservation Program. "We're really pleased with the 
interest the movie is generating." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Reyes Jr., the young martial artist who performs as one of the film 
turtles, is helping the Earth Island Institute.

POP EYE: ARE CDS DESTROYING OUR PLANET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Earth Day coming next Sunday, a host of rock stars can boast about an 
impressive track record of promoting environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
Sting is saving the Brazilian rain forests. Don Henley, the B-52s and the 
Go-Go's have performed environmental benefits. Paul McCartney has made sizable 
donations to Friends of the Earth. Barbra Streisand offers environmental dos 
and don'ts on her album sleeves. Bette Midler and Olivia Newton-John are 
teaming up for a September Hollywood Bowl concert supporting an anti-pesticide 
proposition on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But while individual pop celebs have done their part, the record industry has 
earned an environmental black-eye for creating a mountain of trash with its 
unwieldy 6"X12" cardboard CD boxes, covered with plastic wrap. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many artists speaking out about crucial environmental issues, but 
we're selling their CDs in a box that's nothing but garbage," said Island 
Records president Mike Bone. "You tear it in half, take out the CD and throw it 
away. It's a total waste. What's worse is the U.S. is the only country in the 
world that still uses these packages." 
</P>
<P>
Rhino Records A&amp;R chief Gary Stewart agrees. "These CD packages are 
dinosaurs. If you laid the disposable packaging from the 250 million CDs that 
will be sold in America this year end to end, you'd circle the equator twice." 
</P>
<P>
While most major record label execs remain mum on the issue, these mavericks 
have escalated the battle. Spurred by RykoDisc chief exec Rob Simmons, a cadre 
of small labels and committed artists have purchased a full-page "Ban the Box" 
ad in the new issue of Rolling Stone (Signees or financial supporters include 
R.E.M., the Grateful Dead and Olivia Newton-John as well as I.R.S., Rounder, 
Rhino, Fantasy and Rykodisc Records). 
</P>
<P>
So why has the record industry, which has taken the lead on so many other 
social issues, been dragging its feet on CD packaging? 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain logic to the long box since it fits perfectly into the album 
slots in record store bins," Bone said. "So now retailers are saying -- and 
rightfully so -- why should I go through the expensive process of completely 
refixturing my stores unless I'm going to get something in return." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one key retail mogul loudly insists CD long boxes are here to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"If record company people are telling you they're getting rid of CD boxes, then 
they're smoking an illegal substance which used to be very popular in the 
industry," said Russ Solomon, the outspoken owner of the influential 55-store 
nationwide Tower Records chain. "It's just not going to happen. We're adamantly 
opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a financial issue, not an environmental issue. There's less paper used in 
CD packages than one Sunday issue of the L.A. Times. If you opened a box of 
Tide or a box of cornflakes, you'd throw away just as much cardboard as you do 
in CD boxes." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon contends that without the 6x12 display, which serves as a key 
merchandising weapon, CD sales would drop, noting that audio cassettes (which 
are sold without display packaging) have flattened out "dramatically" in terms 
of sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
He also insists that without the bulky packaging, stores would be faced with an 
enormous security problem, due to increased shoplifting. CDs might have to be 
placed in locked glass display boxes, like cassettes often are, in order to 
avoid "a huge theft problem." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry execs say a possible solution is to have manufacturers insert a 
security strip inside the CD cover which could be deactivated at the cash 
register when the CD was purchased. And since record companies would save about 
25 cents per CD in packaging costs, it would be possible to split the profits 
with retailers as a trade-off for the cost they would incur by refixturing the 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
However, Solomon doesn't buy it. "Don't think the record companies will help us 
bear the burden of converting our space," he said. "It'll never happen." 
</P>
<P>
So far, of the major record labels, only Warners and Elektra rely entirely on 
recycled paper (though most have agreed to run pro-environment messages on the 
CD boxes). But as Gary Stewart acknowledges: "All too often the labels use 
recycling as a smoke screen -- it's a commendable step, but not a real 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
The real solution is probably public pressure from environmentalists and 
activist pop stars. "If CBS or the Warner labels agreed to make the first 
move," said Island's Mike Bone. "You'd see the CD boxes disappear very 
quickly."

POP EYE: SEEING DOUBLE:

<TEXT>
<P>
Could this be a trend in the making? First we hear that ivory-tickling sex 
symbol Harry Connick Jr. is readying (count 'em) two albums for simultaneous 
release this summer (one's a trio album, the other a big band record). . . . 
Speaking of twin billing: Andrew (Dice) Clay's new double album, "The Day the 
Laughter Died," is so chock-full of shock-comedy that Geffen Records, which 
distributes Dice's Def-America label, has quietly taken its name off the album, 
which only features the Def-America logo. . . . And Columbia and Epic Records 
have teamed up to release an alternative music sampler called "Theodore." 
Budget-priced at $4.98, the 16-song cassette version of the compilation 
features a host of live tracks (including Living Colour's version of Tracy 
Chapman's "Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution") unreleased oddities (Big Audio 
Dynamite's "If I Were John Carpenter") and tracks from adventuresome up 'n 
comers like 3rd Bass, Poi Dog Pondering, Toad the Wet Sprocket and Prong.

Just when you thought everyone who ever worked for Elvis had weighed in with a 
deeply personal account of their (check one) years . . . months . . . hours 
with The King, here comes a new tribute volume: "Memories Beyond Graceland," 
penned by Mary Jenkins, Elvis' personal cook. Due out from West Coast 
Publishers this spring, her book includes many of Elvis' best-loved recipes, 
including (are you really hungry?) his favorite snack -- the peanut butter and 
banana sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare (if you're counting cholesterol, stop reading here) you'll need two 
large bananas, six slices of white bread, one stick of butter and one cup of 
peanut butter. Peel and mash the bananas. Mix the peanut butter with the 
bananas. Toast the bread lightly and spread the mix on the bread. Then melt the 
butter in the skillet and cook the sandwich on each side until golden brown.

NOTEBOOK: FERMENT AT WINE-CONSCIOUS RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Rogness, longtime wine director and maitre d'hotel at Joss, the 
contemporary-style (and extremely wine-conscious) Chinese eatery on the Sunset 
Strip, calls it "Chinese restaurant meltdown": Victor Fung, who was imported 
from Hong Kong amid great fanfare last year to serve as head chef at the 
establishment, has returned home. And, adds Rogness, Serry Osmena, "who had 
come in as a significant partner, to the great benefit of the restaurant," has 
severed her relationship with the restaurant as well, after a falling-out with 
restaurant owner Cecile Tang -- who, Rogness says, "got upset when Serry was 
listed in a review of Joss as one of the owners, even though that was true." 
Now Rogness himself resigned from the establishment, he says, after the 
proprietors failed to meet his demands regarding compensation and staff hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Is this, then, the end of Joss as we know it? By no means, Tang responds. To 
begin with, she says, chef Fung is on temporary leave, and is expected to 
return to the restaurant -- and in the meantime, his second-in-charge, Kan 
Liam, who has been with Joss since it opened, continues to run the kitchen in 
the same style. Tang further promises that the ambitious and innovative wine 
program which Rogness developed for the restaurant will continue -- but now 
under the direction of Napa Valley-based master sommelier Ronn Wiegand, who 
will visit the restaurant on a regular basis and make frequent use of the fax 
machine in updating the wine list and planning special events. (Wiegand helped 
draw up the original wine list at Joss, before Rogness was hired.) 
</P>
<P>
Regarding Serry Osmena, Tang says that, "She and I had talked about the 
possibility of her becoming a partner, but it really didn't work out. There has 
been no change in her relationship with us, then. If she were to become a 
partner, that would be a change, because she has never been one." 
</P>
<P>
Tang adds, though, that she is indeed on the lookout for a new maitre d'hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Rogness, meanwhile, is teaching wine classes at UCLA, and has formed a 
partnership with Osmena, with the idea of starting a new Iberian restaurant in 
the Hollywood or West Hollywood area in a about a year's time. Rogness has also 
formed what he calls an "umbrella group" for wine consulting and instruction, 
called The Society for the Prevention of Jaded Palates. Under said umbrella, he 
will host a series of wine events at various local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
TOOLS OF THE MODERN RESTAURATEUR: These days, it's not enough to have good food 
and efficent service. The up-to-date restaurateur must take care of the 
customer's whole being. At least that's what Noa Noa's Kenji Seki thinks. 
Discreetly printed at the bottom of the Noa Noa menu is the following: 
"Cordless payphone available. Cigarette smoking in the bar area only. Noa Noa 
concerns itself with ecological and environmental issues." 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT STEW: What's Up is new in the Brentwood Gardens complex in 
Brentwood, directly above the California Pizza Kitchen. Unfortunately, the 
menu, which features what the restaurant describes as "updated American basics 
and European provincial dishes," is a little too cute. Sample: You Can't Tuna 
Fish, Garden of Eatin', Totally Tubular, and A Clockwork Chicken. . . . And 
Toshi Takahashi, former owner/chef of the now-defunct Les Joues Hioux in 
Torrance, serves as guest chef at Chez Melange in Redondo Beach Tuesday through 
Thursday. . . The South Bay Free Clinic's third annual South Bay Gourmet 
Sampler is Sunday, April 29, from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in 
Manhattan Beach. Twenty-eight area restaurants -- from Bobby D's and the Bottle 
Inn to Tout de Suite and the Twelfth Street Grill -- will participate.

FINDING ART IN FOUND OBJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCULPTOR LETS HER COLLECTIONS OF DOMESTIC ITEMS TAKE SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you didn't know Karyl Sisson was an artist, you might think she had a fetish 
for certain household items akin to Imelda Marcos' obsession for shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Take clothespins. If Sisson admires the shape of one, she will buy it by the 
hundreds, even thousands. Likewise, she has in her studio dozens of 
industrial-size spools of zippers, all of the same make and type, and large 
bags of identical plastic buttons, tape measures and toys. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to find something I like doesn't do me much good," said Sisson, 42, with 
a laugh as she sat in her Beverly Glen Canyon studio behind the house she 
shares with her husband and son. "I have to find a lot of something." 
</P>
<P>
Sisson uses the multiples of domestic items to make widely admired, highly 
personal sculptures and basket forms. She'll stack hundreds of wooden 
clothespins, bound together by thin wire, to create a flowing pattern that 
takes on the shape of a basket. Dozens of cloth tape measures, wound tightly 
around each other, become cylindrical containers, and the buttons, connected by 
hairpins, become abstract sculptures that resemble sea urchins. A combination 
of a variety of these materials is used to make the large floor and hanging 
sculptures that dominate her studio. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at her works, and it is only upon close study that you realize that 
it's made out of clothespins," said Paul Smith, director emeritus of the 
American Craft Museum in New York. He chose Sisson's work to be part of the 
1986 exhibit that inaugurated the museum's new building and more recently 
included one of her sculptures in a touring exhibition, "Craft Today USA," that 
debuted last spring in Paris and is now headed for Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
"A clothespin is the kind of found object that, if used the wrong way in art, 
can be simply awful," he continued. "But to recycle these things in a sensitive 
way, creating textures and patterns, transforms them. It makes her work 
personal, serious and special." 
</P>
<P>
Sisson didn't start out making art out of household items and notions. She 
studied in the 1960s at New York University, where her work was strictly 
two-dimensional. After college she worked for an industrial-design firm. 
</P>
<P>
But her work changed after she moved to Los Angeles in 1972. It all began when 
she saw the patchwork quilt designs being done by a co-worker at a design 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
"It got me into fabrics, and that was the first step," Sisson said. "The second 
was that I started to go to the swap meets at the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Sisson hit the swap meets with a vengeance, collecting little dolls and other 
toys "that seemed in some ways to relate to my childhood." For her, finding 
objects of interest comes first and later, sometimes much later, she figures 
out a use for them. The swap meet items eventually ended up in the collage wall 
hangings she did in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting friends in Woodstock, N.Y., she came upon a box of what would 
become her signature items. "Whenever I go somewhere, friends know I like to go 
around to see if people are selling antiques and junk," she said. "But I'm not 
really an antiques person; I'm a junk person. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, I was at a flea market -- which is what they call swap meets in the 
East -- when I found a box, maybe 2 inches by 3 inches, and inside were all 
these miniature clothespins. They were made for children to play dolls with. I 
just liked them." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years later, after seeing an exhibit of found tin sculptures by Tony 
Berlant, she finally figured out what she would do with them. "I went into a 
drawer and saw all these clothespins and something happened," she said. "I 
started to fool around with them, making little structures." 
</P>
<P>
The first was a simple, boxlike design that she glued together out of 
clothespins and tape measures. She later unglued it so that the structure could 
change, depending on how it was held. Sisson now uses no glue or nails in her 
work, allowing the pieces to take shape more spontaneously as she works on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
To bind the pieces together, she experimented with telephone wire from a spool 
she found near a manhole. "I thought it was just what I needed," Sisson said. 
"I asked the worker there, and she said I could take it." The artist now gets 
her wire from a supplier, but she gets other binding materials -- zippers and 
old tablecloths that she shreds, for example -- from her continuing swap meet 
jaunts. 
</P>
<P>
The structures she made out of the repetition of these everyday materials are 
not, at least on an obvious level, about home life, Americana or nostalgia. But 
they do hearken back to her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't grow up sewing or making baskets or anything like that," she said. 
"But from early on I had a fascination with patterns. My mom was a buyer for 
Bonwit Teller, the big department store in New York, for 25 years and sometimes 
she would take me into work with her on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to wander into the stock room, and I can remember that, in this 
enormous room, I was fascinated by the racks of clothes, one after another. 
There was row after row of the same dress, then row after row of another dress, 
and on and on. I can still see the patterns, the rhythm they made in that 
room." 
</P>
<P>
Her experiments with unorthodox materials continued while she went to graduate 
school in the early 1980s at UCLA, where her teachers urged her to think big. 
"One time we were having a seminar in one room when from another came this 
clang," Sisson said with a laugh. "One of my sculptures had grown beyond its 
limits. The clothespins and everything had come crashing down." 
</P>
<P>
After scaling her sculptures down to a more manageable size after graduation, 
Sisson's work divided more or less into basket-like forms and sculptures. The 
baskets are the more accessible to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"They transcend language," said Laurel Reuter, director of the North Dakota 
Museum of Art. Reuter included Sisson's work in the "Frontiers in Fabric" 
exhibit now touring Asia. "It doesn't matter which country we show her work in. 
People look at them and then, as soon as they realize what they are made out 
of, they always smile." 
</P>
<P>
But the Sisson baskets are not simply novelties, Reuter continued. "I like them 
because she is using objects of containment -- clothespins and zippers -- to 
create containers that could not possibly be used to contain anything but the 
idea of containment." 
</P>
<P>
The flowing wall and floor sculptures are, for Sisson, much more personal 
works. Like the baskets, they make use of the clothespins and other household 
items. But they are less calculated and more expressive, she believes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they talk about interior-exterior issues," she said, "about how the 
exterior might reveal or conceal something about the interior and how there 
might be pieces of ourselves that we don't find particularly attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some of the sculptures are, although abstract, about specific issues 
and events in her life. "They deal with issues that I consider more of the 
feminine side of me, while I think of the baskets as more masculine. So it's no 
surprise the sculptures are more personal." 
</P>
<P>
Another important difference is that, although there is little commercial 
interest in the sculptures, the baskets sell. They are available, for prices 
ranging from $600 to $1,200, at galleries in several cities, including in Santa 
Fe, N.M., where her work will be part of an upcoming exhibit. (Because she is 
not represented by a local gallery, she sells her baskets out of her studio.) 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I feel closer to the work on the sculptures, but I'm grateful for the 
baskets," she said. "They support the art." 
</P>
<P>
The baskets have also, to a certain extent, type-cast her. "Years ago, I was 
showing slides of my work to the owner of a well-known gallery in Northern 
California," she said. "He took one look at it and said, 'Ah, craft.' " 
</P>
<P>
One art critic, writing about her sculptures, complained that they "smell too 
much of a notions counter." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think to myself, 'Maybe I'll be taken more seriously if I move on 
to another medium. Maybe I should try some casting or something.' " Sisson 
said. "But that only lasts for a few minutes. I use the materials I use because 
they say something to me. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get right down to it, it doesn't matter what my work or anyone else's 
work is made out of. It's the feelings it evokes that is important."

THE VOTING LINE: CLASSIC BOWIE AND CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rebuttal to the April 8 Pop Eye column: David Bowie has not sold out, as the 
column implied, by setting up a 900 line for fans to vote for songs that he 
should perform in his upcoming U.S. concert tour. All profits from the 900 
request number go to the Save the Children charity. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to the attempt of the British publication New Musical Express to 
prompt Bowie to sing "The Laughing Gnome" by "fixing" the telephone voting: 
Bowie was originally going to perform the song in concert until he (I quote 
from a Melody Maker interview) "found out all the voting had been a scam . . . 
perpetrated by another music paper . . . that was an end to that. I can't 
pander to the press, can I?" 
</P>
<P>
As a result of what Pop Eye called Bowie's "crass" phone line, concert-goers in 
the United Kingdom are being treated to obscure classics like "Queen Bitch, Be 
My Wife, Stay" that he otherwise would not have played. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A media spokesman for Bowie's tour confirmed that the 900 number in the United 
States will benefit Save the Children. Callers to 900 numbers are billed a fee 
in excess of the normal toll charges.

DANCE FESTIVAL'S FEES TO CHOREOGRAPHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had Sadownick gotten all the facts correct, perhaps there would be no 
"controversy" surrounding "Generator Eight," the upcoming dance festival at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Most important is the article's blatant lack of balance. Sadownick reported 
that dance producer Deborah Oliver raised the issue of the amount of government 
money the theater center had received. What he did not explain adequately 
(which I did both when he interviewed me and in a letter I sent to him) is that 
the $19 million the Community Redevelopment Agency has invested in the theater 
center has gone to the construction and maintenance of the facilities. Not one 
penny has been spent on artistic programming. Had he fully questioned 
representatives of the Cultural Affairs Commission, the CRA and the City 
Council when he spoke with them, he would have heard this from them also. 
</P>
<P>
 LATC is doing all it can at this time to support dance in Los Angeles. We are 
in the midst of eliminating a substantial deficit acquired in the transition 
from the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre to LATC in 1984-85 and have no funds to 
spend on producing dance ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
However, because a strong dance community is important to the growth of all the 
arts in Los Angeles, we are providing what we can: space, equipment, personnel, 
advisory support and mailing lists -- worth a total of more than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The portion of the box office that LATC will receive, even if the festival 
sells out all performances, will at best enable us to only break even. 
</P>
<P>
LATC is sorry some dancers cannot afford to participate. But Sadownick's unfair 
emphasis on the complaints of a few rather than on a balanced, carefully 
researched story does unjustifiable damage to dance in Los Angeles, to the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center and to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
BILL BUSHNELL 
</P>
<P>
Artistic Director, LATC 
</P>
<P>
 On April 1, Calendar published an article by Douglas Sadownick on a June 7-17 
dance festival at the Los Angeles Theatre Center that requires participating 
choreographers to cover costs by paying up-front fees. The article, "Proposed 
Dance Series at LATC Stirs Controversy Over Fees," said seven companies and 
three soloists had signed up at that point but others in the dance community 
had refused to participate because of the fees, ranging from $500 to $3,300. 
Here are responses from Bill Bushnell, LATC artistic director, and others.

ACADEMY AWARDS AND IMAGES OF PHYSICAL DISABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We in the disability community were euphoric over the choice of Daniel 
Day-Lewis as best actor for "My Left Foot." But our bubble was burst by Joan 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Collins expressed awe at the talent of Day-Lewis, a handsome 
actor, she said, "who could make himself look so ugly!" This remark was a slap 
to the 43 million disabled Americans. "Ugly," she said of a character with 
cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
This is Hollywood; this is where images are made. If society must change its 
negative image of persons with disabilities, this is where it ought to start. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugly" is not how a person deviates from the physical norm; ugly instead is 
prejudice.

ART NOTEBOOK: CRUCIFIXION: 'MOST PAINTED IMAGE' IS FOCUS OF TIMELY EXHIBITION 
WITH POLITICAL TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As food for thought to complement the Easter eggs and religious ritual of the 
holiday season, LAART's Installations One gallery in Encino is presenting 
"Crucifixion/Crucifiction." Sixty-three member artists have produced widely 
varied work for the show, which opened on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The crucifixion is probably the most painted image in Western art history -- 
and I think every artist should do at least one," said Mickey Kaplan, founder 
of LAART and curator of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The art on view ranges from straightforwardly religious works to more socially 
symbolic and satiric pieces. One even braves the controversy that surrounds U. 
S. Sen. Jesse Helms' campaign against religiously and sexually offensive art. 
</P>

In a sculpture called "Beer Mouse," artist Forrest Meader has immersed an 
iconic Mickey Mouse figure in a large jar of flat beer -- an allusion to Andres 
Serrano's controversial photograph "Piss Christ" in which a crucifix was placed 
in a container of the artist's urine. Other artists have extended the concept 
of crucifixion to the Holocaust, to racial lynchings and, for that matter, to 
abstract painting.

 "Crucifixion/Crucifiction" through April 26 at Installations One, 15821 
Ventura Blvd. (ground floor), Encino. (818) 981-9422. Open 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays.

 VENICE VENUE: Who says that every new or relocating gallery has to head for 
Santa Monica? On April 24, the Marquardt Gallery will open in Venice with a 
show of works by John Serl, a 97-year-old painter who has been heralded as an 
important figure among so-called "outsider artists" -- the self-taught or naif 
artists who develop far from art schools and the art scene and who are drawing 
increased attention as heirs to the folk art tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquardt Gallery plans to specialize in the works of such autodidact 
masters, sometimes collaborating with the Cavin &amp; Morris Gallery in New 
York and the Janet Fleisher Gallery in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a genuineness to this work. It hasn't been channeled and directed and 
refined, but is still in its pure -- and somewhat raw -- form," said Kathleen 
Marquardt, who is founding the gallery with her husband, Bruce, a management 
consultant whose clients have included the Rainforest Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Also within the gallery's purview will be contemporary painting from such 
places as Haiti and Morocco, ethnographic art from Africa and elsewhere, and 
work that otherwise relates to what is sometimes termed "the spiritual in art." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is in the artsy enclave of Market Street's beach block, across from 
one branch of L.A. Louver and next to the restaurant 72 Market Street and the 
Market Street Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited that they'll be down the street -- and we're hoping very soon 
that we'll have wonderful co-op parking," said Rebecca Rutledge, director of 
the Market Street Gallery, which opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquardt Gallery, 76 Market St., Venice. (213) 399-2570. Open from noon to 6 
p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays and noon to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKROOM AESTHETICS: Tucked away at the back of Lief, a new Scandinavian 
furniture and design emporium on Melrose Avenue, is a boxy little white gallery 
with an exhibition schedule as ambitious as many a contemporary art space. 
Shows -- many imported from the Viking north -- of cutting edge and often 
prize-winning Finnish, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian design (and, more 
occasionally, of fine art) are mounted here, changing every three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the present exhibition, on view until Thursday, are a bevy of 
chairs and an unusual table crafted by Rudi Merz, a Swiss-born sculptor who 
works in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Exceedingly simple in form, the subtly colored chairs are hand-hewn of birch, 
each slightly humped back emblazoned with a carved tree or rain-like 
crosshatching. Intersecting on the table top are tiny tracks that mutely tell 
the apparently peaceful story of a human crossing paths with a rabbit, as if in 
the quiet wilds of the snowy north. 
</P>
<P>
The whole lot, which is shown courtesy of the Amos Ammundsen Museum in Finland, 
speaks volumes about the Scandinavian reverence for nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Lief, 8264 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 658-1100. Open from 10:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays.

VIOLENCE: A GUNMAN APPARENTLY DISTRAUGHT OVER THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER SPRAYS 
MISSION BAY MEMORIAL'S EMERGENCY ROOM WITH BULLETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A La Jolla man apparently distraught over the death early Saturday morning of 
his father at the Mission Bay Memorial Hospital in San Diego returned later in 
the day with a handgun and sprayed the emergency room with bullets, killing a 
nurse and a hospital trainee and wounding two others, including a doctor and 
the father of a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford Warren Powers Jr., 46, called police from a pay phone about 40 minutes 
after the 5 p.m. shooting and turned himself in, police said. But until then 
hospital officials and police frantically ran through the 150-bed hospital, 
searched "every crevice and corner" for the gunman and desperately tried to 
protect any other staff members and the 70 patients from being harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses screamed at police out of a second-floor window. "Are we OK? Are we OK?" 
they yelled. "Why aren't there any police up here?" 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen area, workers were barricaded for more than an hour as police 
ran through the building, refusing to allow anyone to leave. "It went on for 
over an hour and we were locked in there," said one employee, describing the 
terror of not knowing whether they too might be injured. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Simmons, a hospital spokesman, described the small, quiet community 
hospital near Mission Bay as being turned instantly into a scene of "madness." 
</P>
<P>
"All that time we thought he was in the hospital," Simmons said. "There was 
such madness that we didn't even know whether he was in here or not. We tried, 
you can imagine how we tried, to protect our patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the police to check all the rooms and had police actually going through 
a search of the hospital. We went room-to-room and looked in every crevice and 
corner. And we didn't know until an hour later, when we found out he had been 
apprehended." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Burke, a nurse at the Mission Bay facility for about five years, was 
shot in the chest and died during surgery about 7 p.m. at Scripps Memorial 
Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew when she (Debbie Burke) left that it was critical and there was a 
chance she wouldn't make it. And she didn't," said police spokesman Dave Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bardin, a spokesman at the Scripps hospital, said Burke suffered a 
massive gunshot wound in the chest. "As far as I know there was only one wound, 
but it caused extensive damage in the chest area," he said. "She was in surgery 
for quite some time, and they were trying to save her." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Hughes, an emergency room physician at Mission Bay for about six 
months, was in stable condition at the Scripps hospital with five slight wounds 
to the abdomen and thigh. He did not require surgery, Bardin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Hughes was shot multiple times in the lower abdomen and in the upper 
thigh," Bardin said. "They were superficial wounds, but he's still going to be 
in intensive care." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay Hospital officials said Burke and Dr. Hughes were taken by 
ambulance to the Scripps hospital because that facility is equipped with a 
trauma unit. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency room technician, who was working as a student observer, was 
apparently killed execution-style, and pronounced dead at the Mission Bay 
hospital. His name was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a student, he didn't even work for us," Simmons said. "It's my 
understanding that he was shot once, and that the assailant then walked up and 
shot him again at close range." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth victim, identified as 38-year-old Fred Mowrer, was wounded in the 
buttocks. He and his wife, who were visiting San Diego from Albuquerque, had 
brought their 2-year-old daughter into the emergency room for treatment. Bardin 
said Mowrer was treated and would be released late Saturday night from the 
Mission Bay hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they recovered the handgun they believe was used in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, the Mission Bay hospital spokesman, said that the gunman had been in 
the hospital emergency room early Saturday morning with his father, who died of 
cardiac arrest there about 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe his father was brought into the emergency room in the middle of the 
night last night of an aneurysm and died of a heart attack shortly thereafter," 
Simmons said. "Whether he (the gunman) was there in the hospital with him, we 
don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said that Powers lived with his father, Brad Powers Sr. The elder 
Powers was a well-known architectural illustrator whose drawings include the 
County Administration Center, the Civic Theatre and the Westgate Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ernest Ullrey of the Oceanside Police Department, located about 40 miles 
north of the hospital, said Powers called his department about 6 p.m., an hour 
after the shootings, and wanted to confess. 
</P>
<P>
"He called our dispatch on the phone," Ullrey said. "He said he was involved in 
a shooting in San Diego and wanted to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
"So we sent police units out to pick him up at Hill Street and Oceanside 
Boulevard. He called from a phone booth there. We notified San Diego police, 
and based on what they told us about the shooting, we arrested him." 
</P>
<P>
Ullrey said that Powers, a resident of Castle Hills Drive in La Jolla, waited 
with his Corvette at the phone booth until the arresting officers arrived. He 
was wearing a white shirt and white pants. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, there were about three nurses, a clerk, a doctor 
and an emergency medical technician who was present to observe procedures, said 
hospital executive director Steve Hall. Technicians come in to observe and to 
learn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, a 14-year-old employee-owned facility run by the 
Epic Health Care Group, employs 350 physicians and 600 other support personnel, 
including 175 nurses, Hall said. The hospital serves patients in Pacific Beach, 
Clairemont, and southern La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time anything like this has happened," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Lloyd, a nurse who has worked at the hospital for almost three years, was 
one of those summoned to help. Two hours after the shooting, the police had 
barricaded the emergency room. She and others were crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Debbie Burke was a good friend of all of us. We all liked her, she was a great 
lady. I can't believe she is dead," said Lloyd, shaking and pale. "I think it 
is so sad, these people work in the emergency room, they give so much -- and 
now this. I've worked in emergency rooms for 20 years and nothing like this has 
ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
Other hospital employees and their families were also stunned. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Berek, an emergency room clerk, hugged a paramedic, crying "Oh my God, oh 
my God." Shortly after the shooting, about 20 police officers converged near 
the entrance of the emergency room and prepared to enter the hospital to begin 
to search the rooms for the suspect. "Get back, get back -- he could still be 
in there. We advise you to move back," police shouted to a small group of 
onlookers outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going anywhere, my husband is a doctor and he's in there," said Regina 
Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney and her husband had been shopping when her husband had been paged and 
called to the emergency room to assist after the shooting. "How could this 
happen?" she asked.

BREATHING ROOM FOR RESPIRATORY PATIENTS?; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: TESTS WILL BEGIN ON A SORT OF ARTIFICIAL LUNG THAT COULD HELP 
THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Human tests will begin soon on a device that supplies oxygen to the bloodstream 
while removing carbon dioxide, a sort of artificial lung that developers say 
could help tens of thousands of people each year. 
</P>
<P>
The IntraVascular Oxygenator can be used up to seven days, satisfying as much 
as half the body's needs, developers say. It isn't a lung replacement but a 
lifesaving boost to see a patient through a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This device does not heal the lung," said Dr. Terry Clemmer, chief of 
critical-care medicine at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. "This device buys us 
some time . . . to create an environment more conducive to healing the lung." 
</P>
<P>
The IVOX, developed by Dr. J. D. Mortensen, is inserted into the inferior vena 
cava, the large vein carrying blood to the heart, through an incision in the 
neck or groin. A bundle of tubes in it carries oxygen to the blood; carbon 
dioxide passes through fiber walls into the tubes and out of the body. It uses 
new membrane technology to provide as much oxygen as larger, external devices. 
</P>
<P>
The surface area of the human lung is roughly that of a tennis court, said Dr. 
John Watson, chief of cardiovascular devices at the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. The IVOX is "nowhere near the size of a tennis 
court, but he's certainly been able to squeeze a large surface area into a 
relatively small device. And that's by using these hollow fibers." 
</P>
<P>
The clinical evaluations are expected to show that a patient suffering acute 
respiratory failure can be supported more safely and at lower cost with IVOX 
than with current methods, Mortensen said. In animal tests lasting up to 19 
days, it didn't damage the blood or organs in 150 sheep and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of human tests will involve 10 patients and will begin once 
they're chosen. It is intended to confirm the animal results and IVOX's safety; 
a second, broader, study of its effectiveness could begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to LDS, medical centers in the first phase are Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, Penn State's Hershey Medical Center and the 
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. The Hershey and LDS teams 
received the first devices in March. 
</P>
<P>
IVOX was developed and manufactured at CardioPulmonics, a Salt Lake City-based 
firm specializing in the development of gas-permeable membranes and specialized 
critical-care devices. Mortensen, CardioPulmonics chairman, had produced an 
earlier version that didn't exchange enough gases. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the Food and Drug Administration approved an investigational 
device exemption that cleared the way for limited human testing; after both 
phases are complete, the data will be reviewed by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
IVOX could be used in situations where a patient is breathing oxygen through a 
nasal mask or an endotracheal tube and ventilator that aren't working well, 
Mortensen said. It also could help patients recover from acute episodes of 
respiratory failure resulting from inhalation of smoke or noxious agents, 
drugs, severe pneumonia and scores of other ailments. He said it could help 
tens of thousands of people each year. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as its clinical benefit, that's still to be determined," Watson said. 
"Basically, this type of step forward sort of opens the door." 
</P>
<P>
Patients who would qualify during Phase 1 must be extremely sick, near death 
and require pure oxygen, Mortensen said. Most will see benefit in two to five 
days, when they can change to a regular ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't improve would present an ethical dilemma, though Mortensen and 
Clemmer say such cases would be unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"If they become dependent on the device to avoid death, that is one of my 
greatest fears because it's only approved for seven days," Clemmer said. In a 
case like that, he said, hospital officials and the patient's family would have 
to decide whether to leave the patient on the device past the test period. 
</P>
<P>
Before IVOX, the only support for patients with respiratory failure has been 
mechanical ventilation, in which oxygen at varying concentrations is blown into 
the lung under pressure. However, the pressure and high concentrations can 
damage already weakened lungs. By reducing the time a patient is attached to a 
respirator, developers say, costs and mortality can be reduced.

YUK WARNS BRITISH OF POISON'S ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIA DUNN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Yuk, whose putrid green face has peered from poisons for almost two decades 
in America, is now warning European children. 
</P>
<P>
Although the look is the same, the name has changed because feminists in 
Liverpool, England, think the courtesy title is, well, yucky. 
</P>
<P>
Yuk, plain and simple, is far more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some sensitivity about the 'Mr.' We've never had that problem 
anyplace in the United States I know of," said Richard Garber, director of the 
Institute of Education Communications at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The bright green sticker with the stuck-out tongue and squinting eyes, touted 
as "a face only a parent could love," made its international debut in Liverpool 
in late October. There was some speculation as to whether Yuk should be 
replaced by some other distasteful term because Yuk is a common surname in 
Liverpool's Asian community. But ethnic groups said they weren't offended. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 46 U.S. poison centers using Mr. Yuk has altered the name. Each 
center's phone number encircles the sticker copyrighted by Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Garber, a former teacher and guidance counselor who helped create Mr. Yuk, 
isn't miffed over the missing "Mr." "I'd like to keep Mr. Yuk because that's 
the way we started, really. But Mr. Yuk does not have to be a mister." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the need for Mr. Yuk -- by whatever name -- is as great as when it 
was introduced in 1972 as an alternative to the skull-and-crossbones. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 of the 130 centers that pool data got 1.3 million calls about toxic 
exposures in 1988, the most recent figures available, said Dr. William 
Robertson, president of the American Assn. of Poison Control Centers Inc. 
Two-thirds involved children. In all, the death toll was 545, 26 of them 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree most poisonings occur at home and can be prevented. The 46 
centers in the Mr. Yuk program expect to distribute free 3 million sheets of 
stickers in 1990 as part of that prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"People really don't know what a poison is," Garber said. "Most people will 
think of a poison as something that's ugly, that kills bugs, that cleans drains 
and things like that. The products the kids are getting into are products used 
in the home every day, attractively packaged and scented." 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical items like aspirin and cough medicine are the main attraction 
for children, followed by cleaning substances, plants, and health care and 
beauty products, according to Garber. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters usually swallow such substances at mealtime, he said. "Kids are 
hungry, they're thirsty, and mom is busy." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yuk strips away most, if not all, of the appeal, and being instantly 
recognizable helps, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone polls in the Seattle area show that more than 95% of the public is 
familiar with Mr. Yuk, said Robertson, who serves as medical director of the 
Washington Poison Network and the Seattle Poison Center. Other warning labels 
-- Officer Ugh, a rattlesnake with "NOSIOP" (poison spelled backward), a skull 
next to a telephone receiver -- just don't seem to be as memorable. 
</P>
<P>
"When we say, 'Do you know what Mr. Yuk is,' they say 'Yes' and they can 
describe it over the phone," he said. "It's a vehicle that has helped to 
acquaint the entire community, not just parents of little kids."

<P>
Peter Brazaitis held up what looked like two alligator handbags, one green and 
supple, the other a tawny brown, cracked and peeling. 
</P>
<P>
The green bag was indeed alligator. The inferior brown bag was made from an 
endangered species of caiman, a South American reptile whose skin has bony 
plates that cannot be softened by tanning. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of these sell for $600 to $800," said Brazaitis, a herpetologist and 
curator of animals at New York City's Central Park Zoo. "Caiman skin breaks, so 
when the public buys an endangered skin, they're getting ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, unwary consumers lose twice: They pay handsome prices for inferior 
products and their purchases reduce the numbers of an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in so-called exotic leathers made from reptile skins is threatening the 
survival of the world's 23 species of crocodilians, 19 of which are threatened 
or endangered. Crocodilians include alligators, crocodiles and gavials. 
</P>
<P>
Some reptile skins are legal. Among them are the skins of American alligators, 
which make high-quality leather and are sold for $350 each. About 375,000 skins 
were obtained from legal sources last year, Brazaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you look at how many skins are estimated to be in trade, it's 2 million 
a year," he said. "Two-thirds of the trade is either from an endangered species 
or an illegal source." 
</P>
<P>
Illegal skins, which may earn their trappers a mere $5 to $10 apiece, are 
"laundered" by mixing them with legal skins before they reach tanneries, 
Brazaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in illegal skins is not confined to Asian bazaars or remote tropical 
outposts. Top department stores and the exclusive boutiques on Manhattan's East 
Side sell products made of such endangered species as the yacare caiman of 
Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just done a circuit of all the major stores surrounding the zoo here, and 
I've found products from yacare caiman," Brazaitis said. A prestigious name on 
the door is no guarantee of the quality of the reptile skin products inside, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As Brazaitis' survey suggests, trade in illegal skins is flourishing. It is 
widespread in the United States, despite tight safeguards established by the 
United Nations and by Congress, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates 2,000 to 3,000 shipments, each 
containing up to several thousand reptile skins, enter the port of New York 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
They include skins from boa constrictors, Nile crocodiles, African monitor 
lizards, Siamese crocodiles, anacondas and Indian rock pythons, all shaped into 
handbags, belts, shoes and briefcases. Many carry the names of world-famous 
designers and prestigious retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Only experts like Brazaitis can tell the legal skins from the illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to the department store, they don't care," said Brazaitis. "They 
don't know." Nevertheless, sales clerks confidently assure customers that 
everything the store sells is made from legal skins, Brazaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
The skins of more than 350 animals confiscated in New York by the Fish and 
Wildlife Service are on display at the Central Park Zoo in an exhibit titled 
"The Illegal Skin Trade." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit includes a U.S. Customs declaration form attesting to the legality 
of a wildlife shipment of royal pythons and boa constrictors from Africa. 
Brazaitis chuckled as he pointed it out. "Royal pythons come from Asia, and boa 
constrictors come from South America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most people find reptiles about as welcome as a boa constrictor's embrace. 
"People say, 'What do you want to save those things for? They eat people,' " 
Brazaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
But their disappearance leads to the loss of tropical wilderness, a problem 
receiving increasing attention as Americans prepare for the celebration of the 
20th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodilians are predators at the top of the food chain, Brazaitis explained. 
They regulate the population of other species. 
</P>

An experiment to remove aggressive, fearsome Nile crocodiles from a lake in 
Egypt showed how balances can tip, he said. "The fish that people couldn't eat 
-- the garbage fish -- proliferated. The fish people could eat couldn't 
compete. They declined." 
</P>
<P>
Caimans eat snails that carry the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, deadly to 
humans. With fewer caimans, outbreaks of the disease could be more common, 
Brazaitis suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The concern about trade in reptile skins has echoes of the anti-fur movement, 
but the situations are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of fur are concerned largely about the welfare of the animals that 
are killed and skinned for their fur. Trade in fur from endangered species has 
largely been stopped, wildlife officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in reptile skins, on the other hand, is seriously aggravating threats to 
many of the world's endangered reptiles, Brazaitis said. It is an environmental 
issue more than an animal welfare issue. 
</P>
<P>
Brazaitis would like to see it become a consumer issue. 
</P>
<P>
"If you elect to buy the caiman product, it's not going to last," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So how do customers avoid getting swindled? They can hire a herpetologist, or 
refuse to buy exotic leather. 
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer that people do not buy exotic leathers," Brazaitis said. "The 
only ones that need reptile skins are reptiles."

NEW LEASH ON LIFE;

<P>
AGENCY FINDS HOMES FOR ABANDONED PUREBRED DOGS

Lady is having as much trouble as the Tramp staying out of the pound these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
In a transient, divorce-prone society, purebred dogs are nearly as likely to be 
abandoned, neglected and mistreated as their mongrel cousins, say caretakers of 
the pampered and well-to-do of the canine set. 
</P>
<P>
Not only common breeds such as German shepherds and cocker spaniels, but 
afghans, salukis, and even borzois, or Russian wolfhounds, can be found in the 
pound with 72-hour death sentences over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't think you'd see that kind of dog in an animal shelter," said 
Nancy Phillips, who owns three dogs, two cats and a parakeet. 
</P>
<P>
But Phillips and her co-workers at Seattle Purebred Dog Rescue Inc. see it all 
the time. Since February, 1987, the nonprofit organization has been placing 
unwanted and abandoned purebreds with new owners in California, Washington, 
Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
It's the second such adoption referral agency in the nation. The first is the 
Purebred Dog Rescue of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Both were founded by Dixie Tenny Lehmann, who moved from St. Louis to Seattle 
in 1985. Lehmann set up the original dog rescue program in 1984 after a friend 
who helped place abandoned bull terriers told her that he regularly came across 
valuable dogs of all breeds in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, let's set up some kind of clearinghouse for all breeds," said 
Lehmann, who handles Welsh terriers and a half-dozen other terrier breeds for 
the dog rescue agency. 
</P>
<P>
The common reason dogs are given up is that the owner has no time for the pet. 
Others often cite a divorce or a move, Lehmann said. 
</P>
<P>
At the five Seattle-area shelters, between 25,000 and 30,000 dogs, or between 
70% and 85% of all dogs received, were euthanized last year, the Progressive 
Animal Welfare Society said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of them were purebreds, said Scott Henry, shelter supervisor of the 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The dog rescue agency tries to hook up animals from shelters or that still are 
in their owner's homes with people who call the organization looking for a 
particular breed. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year, the agency placed 334 dogs from 71 breeds into new homes. In 
1988, they found new homes for more than 700 dogs, or up to a third of the dogs 
they listed, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
A dog adopted through the rescue agency usually costs about $40 to $70, far 
less than the price of many purebred puppies. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue agency officials said they recognize there also is a need to place 
mongrel dogs in loving homes, but say there is a specialized need for their 
service.

FIRST U.S. RAILROAD, THE DELAWARE &amp; HUDSON, MAY SOON CHUG INTO HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ALBANY, N. Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a boy back in the 1920s, Dick Williams spent his happiest hours down at the 
railroad yard with his father, a dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
In those days the railroads were in their heyday, already a legend of America's 
expansion and industrialization. In young Williams' view, no occupation could 
be more romantic or more necessary than railroading. 
</P>
<P>
Or more permanent. Because the railroad that employed his father, and that he 
later served for 40 years, was the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad Co., the 
venerable D &amp; H, the nation's oldest railroad. It made its first run in 
1829. 
</P>
<P>
It might make its last run any day now. 
</P>
<P>
If no one buys the D &amp; H in the next few weeks, men will unhook its cars 
and sell them off one by one. Dick Williams always felt he would be long dead 
before such a historical ignominy would ever come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see this happening to a railroad you worked on your entire life," 
he says. Williams, who is 61, took early retirement six years ago because he 
couldn't bear to stick around for the end. 
</P>
<P>
If no buyer comes forward, more than 400 workers who make sure the D &amp; H 
runs on time between Montreal and Washington and between Albany and Buffalo 
will lose their jobs. And a chapter of American folklore will end. 
</P>
<P>
The Delaware &amp; Hudson didn't start out as a railroad. 
</P>
<P>
In 1823, brothers William and Maurice Wurtz, merchants from Philadelphia, 
carved out a canal from northern Pennsylvania to Kingston, N.Y., for the 
transport of barges loaded with coal. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, the brothers began using a new technology called a "gravity 
line." Stationary steam engines hauled cable cars up the hills and gravity took 
them down. Horses pulled them over the flats. 
</P>
<P>
D &amp; H began using steam locomotives in 1860 and gradually expanded into the 
Northeast and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
During the Civil War, the D &amp; H hauled coal to northern arsenals. In 1885, 
a D &amp; H train carried the body of Ulysses S. Grant for viewing before the 
Union general and former President was buried in New York. In the next century, 
American soldiers rode the D &amp; H south to fight the Mexican bandit Pancho 
Villa. 
</P>
<P>
Before World War II began, Winston Churchill rode the D &amp; H into Canada 
after he visited Washington to ask Congress for financial help in the fight 
against Adolf Hitler's Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, more than 250,000 miles of track crisscrossed America. Dick 
Williams, a telegraph operator and dispatcher as his father was before him, 
watched it all and marveled. 
</P>
<P>
Today, his Albany home is a museum of D &amp; H memorabilia. One item is an old 
telegraph "bug" his father gave him when he was 12 years old. He can still tap 
out words, still remembers the Morse Code 30 years after the D &amp; H stopped 
using telegraphs. 
</P>
<P>
Williams eventually became a fireman, and worked his way up to be general 
manager in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Railroad men were a breed all by themselves." he remembers. "They'd do 
anything for one another. It was like a family. You felt good accomplishing 
what you were supposed to do. You took pride in your work." 
</P>
<P>
Railroad business began declining in the 1950s with the expansion of the 
interstate highway system and cross-country trucking. 
</P>
<P>
"Trucks had a highway system that was free to them. Railroads had to own the 
property they ran over, and in most cases had to pay taxes on that property," 
William says. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s, mergers and acquisitions were commonplace as the railroads 
struggled to stay alive. The federal government got involved and the result was 
Conrail, an amalgamation of the Penn Central, New Jersey Central, Reading, Erie 
Lackawanna and several smaller railroads that were either bankrupt or about to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail would restore to D &amp; H the friendly connections it had lost when 
several railway companies around it merged, federal officials said. They said 
the move also would allow D &amp; H to expand to Buffalo and as far south as 
Washington, and that D &amp; H could remain competitive with the federally 
subsidized Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
Although Williams agrees that some federal action was necessary to save 
railroading in the Northeast, he says what was done did little to help D &amp; 
H, which had to haul freight over Conrail track at a price set by Conrail. That 
price wasn't competitive, Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an opportunity to provide some competition and we attempted to have a 
profitable operation, but it didn't work," he said. "But you had to try or you 
were dead. Conrail was a blood transfusion for D &amp; H, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
D &amp; H struggled to remain solvent, propped up by state and federal 
subsidies. From the late 1970s into the early 1980s, D &amp; H received almost 
$40 million in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, D &amp; H was one of the last major privately owned railroads in the 
Northeast, and it was losing money. It lost $14 million in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Hope for survival was revived in 1984 by the Guilford Transportation Industries 
of Billerica, Mass. Guilford owner Timothy Mellon, a financier and descendant 
of the Pittsburgh banking family, bought D &amp; H to complete a Northeast rail 
network made up of the Guilford-owned Maine Central and Boston &amp; Maine 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
With the D &amp; H, Guilford had a system that reached from New England to 
Buffalo, with legs north to Montreal and south to Baltimore and Washington. It 
represented an attempt to compete with Conrail in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Then negotiations with D &amp; H employees for labor contract changes fell 
through, and four years after it purchased D &amp; H, Guilford put it into 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Guilford officials blamed the railroad's demise on archaic union work rules at 
D &amp; H, Williams says, and the railroaders blamed Guilford's inexperience in 
running a railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the D &amp; H now rests with a Washington lawyer, Francis 
Dicello, the trustee appointed by a federal bankruptcy court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dicello says he will try to find a buyer for the line. Failing that, he may ask 
the court's permission to liquidate the company. 
</P>
<P>
D &amp; H President Carl Belke insists that the railroad will survive, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to be here, one way or another," he said.

One citizen whom the U.S. Census Bureau almost missed this year was Mayor Jim 
Scheibel -- but officials promised to right their mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Scheibel's apartment was among the 5,000 households in the St. Paul area that 
did not receive census forms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been promoting the census and the importance of filling out the forms when 
I realized I didn't have a form," Scheibel said last week. "They almost didn't 
count the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Swenson, district manager of the St. Paul census office, called Scheibel to 
assure him that a form was on the way.

ONE-THIRD OF PANAMANIANS JOBLESS IN A 'TIME BOMB' FOR THE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
PANAMA CITY, Panama 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noriega is gone, but one-third of Panamanians are out of work and unemployment 
has become the greatest threat to the new government. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be resolved or the country will go into a spiral of robberies . . . 
strikes, demonstrations against the government and backlash against the United 
States," said Carlos Rodriguez, a Panamanian who is vice president of the 
American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
For now, there seems to be no opposition to President Guillermo Endara's new 
government. The end of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's corrupt, repressive 
dictatorship and the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions have brought hope. 
</P>
<P>
The government is scratching to keep itself afloat, however, and has nothing to 
invest in reactivating the economy. It is looking to U.S. aid and private 
enterprise to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Heraza, 21, finished high school three years ago with a specialty in 
commercial accounting, which seemed sensible in an economy that is 70% to 80% 
services. He still fills out job applications, and still has no job. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 20 invasion that ousted Noriega and installed Endara seemed like a 
good idea, he said, "but they must follow through. They say they're going to 
give jobs, but unemployment -- with what has happened, it is worse." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say about 33% of the work force, estimated at 650,000 
people, is unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Looting and vandalism that accompanied the invasion caused about 90% of 
businesses to close, raising the jobless figure from about 20%. Before the 
political crisis began in 1987, about 10% of Panamanians did not have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Endara fasted during the first 12 days of March to dramatize Panama's economic 
problems. He has criticized the slow pace of U.S. aid and of freeing government 
funds frozen during the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
"People cannot eat democracy," the president said. "There could be popular 
unrest unless there are some quick solutions. The congressional delay of 
approval endangers our democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bush Administration's $1-billion package, Congress has approved $43 
million to rebuild the Chorrillo neighborhood, which was destroyed in the 
invasion, and the start of credit the Administration says is worth $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanians say they are well-equipped to use aid effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is not a basket case like some other countries," said Rodriguez, the 
general manager of Colgate-Palmolive's operations in Panama. "It has good 
infrastructure, a good entrepreneurial class." 
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. dollar as its currency, Panama was a thriving international 
banking and trade center. 
</P>
<P>
That ended with the political crisis created by U.S. indictments of Noriega for 
drug trafficking, his dismissal of presidents, the closing of banks for nine 
weeks in 1988 and U.S. economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Assets in the cluster of gleaming, modern banking towers plummeted from $40 
billion in June, 1987, to less than $15 million two years later. 
</P>
<P>
On streets that had teemed with visitors buying cameras, electronic equipment, 
watches and tailored suits, business slowed to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
The gross national product fell 20% in 1988 and 7.5% more in 1989. Much of the 
government's revenue was lost to corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stop the corruption, that by itself is income. It was that bad," said 
Guillermo Ford, the second vice president and planning minister. 
</P>
<P>
Since the invasion, the government has survived on gradually improving tax 
revenue and partial release of the $390 million in frozen funds. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a change in mentality" about taxes, said Willie Cochez, the new mayor 
of Panama City. "They know people like President Endara will not steal the 
money and they decide to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Officials continue plugging corruption leaks. Kindergartens are $3,000 a month 
better off since Cochez sent a department head to jail for stealing that much. 
</P>
<P>
New officials cut their own salaries, which saves $2.1 million a year. Endara's 
pay was reduced from $10,000 a month to $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Until Panama pays the $540 million in arrears on its $5.2-billion foreign debt, 
it will not be eligible for new loans. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, the businessman, feels Panamanians may be too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"People probably feel the problems are over and they are not," he said. "They 
probably think it will rebound to pre-1987 in three months and it will not." 
</P>
<P>
He said unemployment is a "time bomb against the Endara government or any 
democratic government." 
</P>
<P>
Government strategy is to strengthen the private sector by selling state-owned 
Air Panama, sugar mills and cement and citrus processing plants, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen even suggest that the Panama Canal, to be turned over to 
Panama at the end of 1999, could be operated as a concession. 
</P>
<P>
A major worry in this strategy is reducing the payroll of 150,000 before there 
are enough new jobs for the people dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Crime has skyrocketed because of unemployment and because so many weapons are 
in the hands of paramilitary groups set up by Noriega. Police said murders have 
gone up from four a month to 30. 
</P>
<P>
For the long term, Rodriguez said, officials speak of a U.S.-Panama free trade 
agreement similar to those the United States has with Canada and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Panama has had the Colon free-trade zone for years and it was not seriously 
affected by the crisis. Officials are promoting establishment of new in-bond 
plants there, which assemble products for export, and expansion of existing 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The zone also does a brisk trade in transshipment of goods. 
</P>
<P>
International banking could revive, but is considered unlikely to regain its 
former prominence. Panamanians dismiss concerns that the banks could again 
become a haven for drug money and say current secrecy laws allow access to 
information when laundering is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception in Panama is that the United States is delaying approval of the 
economic recovery package to squeeze out tighter restrictions on banking, 
tighter restrictions on Cuba-related companies," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Dario Carles, a former banker and now the government's comptroller, said: 
"We cannot sit and wait. We have to deliver the goods. We have to get this 
thing moving. 
</P>
<P>
"Every unemployed person has a reason to protest, and it will be bad if 200,000 
protest."

WOMEN IN POLITICS UNNERVE SOME MEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before he first debated Susan Molinari, House candidate Bob Gigante received 
this warning from campaign consultants: "Whatever you do, don't make her cry." 
</P>
<P>
Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember 1984? I can't forget it!" Bush said recently of the presidential 
campaign in which Democrat Geraldine Ferraro ran against him for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The subject arose after Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee for governor 
of Texas, said he'd rather have state Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox as his opponent 
than Ann Richards, the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman," Williams was quoted as 
saying before Richards captured the Democratic nomination in the runoff 
election against Mattox last week. 
</P>
<P>
The political landscape is strewn with faux pas committed by men -- mostly 
older men. 
</P>
<P>
"The men are nervous," said Celinda Lake, a pollster for the Democrats. "Women 
running is just plain different, and men sense it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush got himself in trouble in 1984 by saying, after debating Ferraro, that he 
had "kicked a little ass." Later, Mississippi agriculture commissioner Jim Buck 
Ross asked Ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins. "Yes. Can you?" she 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Men told women in Wisconsin and New Hampshire that they shouldn't be running 
for Congress because they had young children. One of the candidates, Sen. 
Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.) later apologized and said his statement had been "just 
plain stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to be a little bit 
more chivalric, if that's the right word," said Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, 
who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor of California against 
Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp promised not to punch his opponent in the nose, but he has taken a 
few verbal swings at her. One of his ads ends with: "Dianne Feinstein -- if she 
couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?" 
</P>
<P>
Martha Layne Collins, on the other hand, was elected governor of Kentucky in 
1983 "in part because her opponents never could figure out how to run against 
her. They never did point out anything wrong with her," said Democratic 
pollster Harrison Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
"Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like a candidate and 
talks like a candidate, you treat it like a candidate," added Hickman, whose 
clients include Van de Kamp and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who is trying to fend 
off a GOP challenge from Rep. Lynn Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Women such as Martin and Richards, who have hired two of the hardest-hitting 
media consultants in the business, are making it easier for male opponents to 
attack them by proving that they can be as aggressive as the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
They also are coming up with some deft responses to gender-related gaffes, such 
as Ferraro's comeback to Ross's blueberry-muffin question. Richards came up 
with a good one-liner after Williams, a self-styled symbol of Texas machismo -- 
confessed that he wouldn't relish running against her. "Even cowboys get the 
blues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 58, has been blue indeed since he was heard comparing the bad weather 
at his ranch to a rape situation. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy 
it," he said. The remark last month stirred up a furor, and Williams eventually 
apologized "from the bottom of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Stone attributed Williams' attitude to his age and upbringing. "His lexicon 
hasn't caught up with the times yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But while men of Williams' age may not be used to competing with women, many 
younger candidates such as Gigante, 41, consider it perfectly normal. Gigante, 
a New York Democrat with four children and a working wife, was surprised by his 
coaches' advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would she cry?" Gigante asked. "She's a mature woman. She's held office. 
She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on an issue, just like I wasn't 
going to cry if she attacked me." 
</P>
<P>
Molinari did not cry. She won the election and is serving as a congresswoman 
from Staten Island.

Ilene Banker's kindergartners listen to their hearts with stethoscopes 
fashioned from paper towel tubes, and then return to their desks where calf, 
lamb and chicken hearts await their scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, Gail Krehel's second-graders spend an hour learning about the 
dynamics of wind, and youngsters simulate the swirling of tornadoes by shaking 
homemade devices fashioned from plastic soda bottles filled with water. 
</P>
<P>
At Parkway School, cited for excellence by the U.S. Department of Education two 
years ago, elementary science is taught the way most educators think it should 
be, but all too rarely is: with hands-on experiences, adequate class time and a 
spirit of discovery and experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's governors and the Bush Administration agreed in February that U.S. 
students should be first in the world in science achievement by the year 2000. 
A key step toward reaching that goal is improving elementary science 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Study after study has shown serious deficiencies in both the quality and 
quantity of science instruction for elementary students. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the thrill of discovery, they more often get the tedium of texts. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is even more serious for girls, whose science achievement 
typically lags behind boys and worsens through high school, often because 
parents and educators offer girls little encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're systematically sorting out women and minorities," said Bill Aldridge, 
executive director of the National Science Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 international comparison of science achievement among fifth-graders in 
14 countries found U.S. students ranking in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress 
found more than two-thirds of U.S. elementary school teachers spend less than 
two hours a week on science. Eleven percent of third-graders say they had no 
science instruction at all. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, a 1988 survey found that less science was being taught in every 
elementary grade than four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth grade, for example, New Jersey schools averaged 70 minutes a week of 
science instruction in 1988, down from 98 minutes in 1984, but still better 
than the national average of 28 minutes. The science teachers association 
recommends 100 minutes of science a week for fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The sad result of this lack of time spent on science: Only one in four 
9-year-olds tested by NAEP demonstrated basic understanding of life or physical 
sciences -- were able, for example, to correctly identify in a multiple-choice 
test that a fox is a predator of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
This northern New Jersey suburb demonstrates that solid grounding in science in 
the elementary years is critical to later success. About 85% of Paramus high 
school students take at least three years of science, including biology and 
chemistry. Nationwide, only about a third do so. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that parents and educators alike consider reading the 
primary mission of elementary education. In many schools around the country, 
that has meant science doesn't rank as an educational "basic" in the same 
league as language skills or math. 
</P>
<P>
Reading instruction typically takes up as much as seven times more elementary 
class time than math, the next most-taught subject, according to several 
statewide studies. 
</P>
<P>
Science often is even more vulnerable in tight budgetary times, which many 
states, including New Jersey, now face. This month, New Jersey Gov. James J. 
Florio announced sharp reductions in state education aid, and Paramus' science 
coordinator, Bob DiBlasi, said science-related field trips could be vulnerable 
to cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a district like Paramus with a longstanding commitment to science 
education, the subject must fight for ever-scarcer classroom time, DiBlasi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure in recent years from parents and politicians for AIDS education, drug 
education, moral education and the like has put elementary class time at an 
even greater premium, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many educators contend that reaching the governors' goals for science education 
will take no less than a concerted and costly effort to improve teacher 
training and devise better curricula similar to federal programs launched in 
the early 1960s following Sputnik. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it down to my shoes: It's a matter of resources," said Joel Bloom, 
New Jersey's assistant state commissioner in charge of science programs. 
</P>
<P>
"All this talk about goals is nice, but it's not going to happen without 
money," said Aldridge, of the science teachers association. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, most elementary schools spend less than $10 per pupil for science 
supplies or equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But schools like Parkway and others cited for excellence demonstrate that new 
spending is only part of the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers like Banker and Krehel and administrators like DiBlasi illustrate that 
creativity and dedication are at least as important, especially since 
elementary schools rarely have full-scale labs. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wrhen of the Smedley Street School in Oil City, Pa., who is participating 
in a new national teacher training project sponsored by the science teachers 
association and Upjohn Co., has her third-graders make string telephones to 
study sound. 
</P>
<P>
When Banker wanted to teach her kindergartners about the heart, she got the 
father of one her pupils to donate the calf, lamb and chicken hearts from his 
butcher shop. 
</P>
<P>
To run her experiment on tornadoes, Krehel brought in the plastic soda bottles 
and persuaded Parkway's principal, Joe Roma, to give her about $50 for 
connecting tubes. 
</P>
<P>
But even if some schools seem able to do the job without fancy lab equipment, 
there is no substitute for adequate classroom time. Paramus kindergartners 
spend an average of 75 minutes to 90 minutes a week on science -- roughly 
triple the New Jersey statewide average of 29 minutes for that grade. 
</P>
<P>
Another key ingredient for solving science education's problems appears to be 
clearly enunciated districtwide goals. 
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of years in Paramus, for example, school administrators made 
it a priority to get more girls into advanced science programs. Teachers and 
guidance counselors were asked to encourage girls, and there were meetings with 
parents to make them aware of opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
One result is that this school year, eight female students are taking advanced 
placement physics, compared to none last year. And female enrollment in 
advanced placement biology is up 45% from a year ago.

MIGRANTS: AS SOON AS ENCINITAS SHUTS DOWN ONE ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT, ANOTHER 
SPRINGS UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Juana Carrillo cuddled her 2-month-old son, Samuel, as she rested in a concrete 
drainage canal down a steep slope from Interstate 5 in Encinitas, the tumult of 
the freeway providing a noisy accompaniment. Her family's arduous trip from 
Central America had landed them in this unlikely spot, facing a commercial 
center crowned at night by a giant red Big Bear electric sign and frequented by 
upscale, beachwear-clad shoppers driving shiny new Jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
Most improbably, in this Southern California suburb-scape, Carrillo and her 
family were residing amid a thriving community of rural Guatemalans, many of 
whom prefer to communicate in clipped Indian dialects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult now, but I feel things will improve," said Vicente Ramos, 
Juana's 28-year-old husband, who was seated along the ditch with his wife and 
son. 
</P>
<P>
Here along Encinitas Boulevard, up the road from San Diego and just a few 
blocks from Moonlight Beach -- now largely populated by frolicking students and 
surfers on spring break -- the Third World is converging with the region's 
version of late 20th-Century American affluence. The mix is not a smooth one. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that are logical to some but incomprehensible to others, several 
scores of migrants from rural Guatemala have in recent years set down roots 
around the Big Bear shopping center. Unable to afford area housing, many had 
settled, at least temporarily, in the 18- 
</P>
<P>
acre parcel of swampy brush behind the supermarket, until they were kicked out 
last week. Most relocated to nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, they venture from that lot and other patches of vacant land and 
post themselves on street corners, soliciting minimum-wage labor from passing 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
It is a scene that has become familiar throughout northern San Diego County and 
elsewhere in Southern California, but nowhere else do the laborers appear to 
have inflamed the passions as in Encinitas, a beachside community of 50,000 or 
so people about 25 miles from downtown San Diego. And the Big Bear market, with 
the large population of Guatemalan migrants it draws, has become a flashpoint 
of tensions, amid charges of racism and unseemly intolerance by the area's 
mostly non-Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with race or ethnic backgrounds," said Encinitas 
Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines, who has led the effort to oust the day laborers 
and their families from behind the Big Bear market, accusing them of a range of 
crimes, from murder to robbery to polluting city property. "We can't accept a 
subculture that doesn't recognize our laws. . . . This situation is out of 
control. What we have is little lawless enclaves." 
</P>
<P>
So concerned are city officials that last week an Encinitas-employed security 
firm began patroling the property. Its job is to keep the migrants off the 
land, which is owned by the city's sanitary district. 
</P>
<P>
The laborers and their supporters say the negative characterizations by Gaines 
and others amount to baseless exaggerations, and that the migrants are more 
often victims -- not perpetrators -- of attacks by area thugs and ripoffs by 
unscrupulous employers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't come here to rob anyone," said Leon Ramos, a 27-year-old Guatemalan 
who was found on a recent evening along a fence behind the Big Bear market. 
"We're here to work." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their daily roadside efforts to solicit work, the migrants say that 
jobs have been hard to come by. Most say they find employment only one or two 
days a week. Still, they say, the minium-wage pay is better than anything that 
they could hope to earn back home. And, as unstable as their lives may be, the 
migrants do not face the civil strife that many say prompted them to leave 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the charges that the migrants commit crimes, residents have 
repeatedly accused them of less grievous but perhaps more troubling offenses, 
such as defecating on lawns and urinating on street corners and spreading 
diseases. A drainage stream in the property behind the Big Bear market carries 
the migrants' "fecal matter" down to Moonlight Beach, charges Councilwoman 
Gaines. The migrants, most of whom are young men, are also widely accused of 
harassing women. 
</P>
<P>
The migrants and their defenders have rejected such characterizations as racist 
stereotypes. But such comments, repeated over and over, have projected a 
harshly negative image of the immigrant community, weighing the debate against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of this is perception," said Ozvaldo Venzor, an Encinitas salesman who 
is a longtime migrant advocate. "No one here really goes around defecating on 
anyone's lawn, but that's the kind of talk that you hear all the time. . . . 
You've got to understand that this is an upper-middle-class white community. 
People like to drive nice cars. And they don't like to see these little dark 
guys walking around." 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalans are hard to miss in the vicinity of the Big Bear market. Many 
still sport the wide-brimmed, straw-colored hats common in Mexico and Central 
America. Their legal status is mixed: Many are undocumented, but some have 
legal U.S. residence via the amnesty and political asylum programs. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the security firm doesn't appear to have changed the situation, 
beyond forcing the settlers to shift locations. Last week, most had deserted 
the encampments behind the market and moved to the adjoining strip of property 
between the freeway and the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Among those gathered along the highway was Lorenzo Paulo Mejia, a 23-year-old 
from the northern Guatemalan province of Quiche. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and two other men arrived six months ago from Mexico, where they, 
like many other Guatemalans, had spent time working. Many complain of brutal 
treatment by Mexican authorities, who are notorious for extorting bribes from 
Central American migrants en route through Mexico, where they are illegal 
aliens. (The Guatemalans learn to deny their nationality to bribe-seeking 
Mexican police, telling them that they are Indians from southern Mexico.) Why 
did Mejia leave Guatemala? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to join the guerrillas," said Mejia, adding that anti-government 
insurgents regularly conducted forced-recruitment drives in his village near 
Nebaj, which has long been the site of conflict. About 30 years of civil strife 
in Guatemala have cost more than 150,000 lives, most of them at the hands of 
the military, according to human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm lucky, maybe I'll find enough work to pay for an apartment," said 
Mejia, who sported headphones from a radio he had purchased secondhand at a 
swap meet. "All of us would prefer to live in homes, but the rent is a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalans in Encinitas represent many ethnic groups from various states 
throughout the Central American nation. However, the greatest number appear to 
come from hamlets in the northwestern province of Huehuetenango, where 
guerrilla activity and brutal military counterinsurgency campaigns have long 
been a way of life. Among the Indian groups most prevalent are the Mam and the 
Kanjobal. 
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence, experts say, that the Guatemalans have settled initially 
in northern San Diego County, despite the fact that living conditions for 
immigrant laborers have long been considered among the most primitive in the 
nation. The booming, fast-growing area, only a half-hour ride from the 
U.S.-Mexico border, has long been a first stop for relatively newer migrants 
such as the Guatemalans, who usually can find day labor in the fields, 
nurseries, homes or construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant laborers from Mexico and Central America reside in crude campsites that 
proliferate in the brush throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes, or smugglers, often drop the migrants off in Encinitas and in nearby 
communities after picking them up in the U.S. border community of San Ysidro. 
Many stay only long enough to earn enough money to head elsewhere in 
California, or to Oregon and Florida, where there are also large Guatemalan 
migrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
"In my home, the men always referred to America as tierra santa (holy land)," 
said Juan Chavez, one of two Guatemalan brothers who spoke from their campsite 
behind Big Bear market. "The truth is, when I don't find work, I don't believe 
that it is so holy," Chavez said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan Indians, along with Mixtec Indians from Mexico's Oaxaca state, 
are at the bottom rung of the immigrant-laborer community in Southern 
California. Whereas Mexican immigrants from states such as Jalisco, Michoacan 
and Zacatecas have long been established in the United States, the Guatemalan 
and Mixtec Indians are more recent arrivals and don't have the extensive social 
networks and contacts of the older Mexican communities, thus limiting their 
mobility. Seldom do migrants settle in areas where they know no one, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Guatemalans first began attracting public attention last year, 
they have been coming to Encinitas since at least the early 1980s. Raul Tomas, 
a Kanjobal Indian and native of the village of San Rafael Independencia, in 
Huehuetenango province, said that fellow Guatemalans were living behind a 
nearby Alpha Beta supermarket when he first arrived in December, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The migrants settle near markets for an obvious reason: Food and other supplies 
are readily available. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after arriving in Encinitas, Tomas says, he left for Oregon, where he 
picked strawberries and other crops. He returned to Encinitas in 1984, when he 
found his countrymen living behind the Big Bear, apparently having been thrown 
off the Alpha Beta site. He himself camped there for a time. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Tomas, now 26, is now employed as a security guard for the Big Bear 
market. One of his tasks is chasing Guatemalan loiterers. The job has earned 
him the enmity of some of his compatriots, who view him as a traitor. Tomas, 
who gained legal residence through the farm-worker amnesty program, has gained 
a degree of prosperity. He drives a 1990 red Ford pickup that he purchased with 
his savings. He recently visited his family in Guatemala for the first time 
since he left. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us do better than others," Tomas explained recently as he patrolled 
the parking lot of the commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people camped behind the Big Bear appears to have peaked last 
spring, when officials say more than 100 lived there. Since then, sweeps by 
city-employed security guards and cleanup crews have prompted many to settle 
elsewhere. About 35 migrants were said to be residing behind the market last 
week when the city hired a full-time security firm to roust the squatters, 
prompting many to shift to the land adjoining the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"This little piece of land over there is not worth worrying about," said the 
voluble Pedro Juan, a 30-year-old native of Huehuetenango who has also worked 
in Florida. "If they think I want to be buried there, they're quite mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
Vicente Ramos and his family, wary of the security guards and the bilingual "No 
Trespassing" signs posted behind Big Bear market, also took refuge recently 
along the freeway. He said he had arrived four days earlier from Guatemala, 
after a long journey through Mexico. He was concerned, he said, because his 
2-month old son had suffered from a persistent cold that was likely worsened by 
sleeping outdoors. Ramos said he brought his wife and the child along because 
he didn't want her to be alone while he worked in the north. An older child was 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman suffers a lot by herself," Ramos said as he relaxed along the drainage 
canal. "I wanted us to be together here." 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, he and his wife and child and a cousin began walking south 
along the freeway, looking for a quiet place to spend the evening. They were 
careful to remain on the east side of the fence demarking the Big Bear property 
and the lot behind it.

DIALING FOR HELP WITH HOMEWORK; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CITY SCHOOLTEACHERS ANSWER CALLS FROM STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO 
COMPLETE THE MANDATORY ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE KEY TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS, EDUCATORS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At first, the student seemed to have trouble reading the passage about farmers 
and forest lands in a seventh-grade social studies text while on the phone with 
teacher Robert Meyer to ask a question. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, one of 22 San Diego city schoolteachers who take turns staffing the 
district's new Homework Helpline, patiently guided the student back over the 
information on farming until the meaning came clear. "Yeah, I think I get it 
now," the student said, thanking Meyer as he hung up. 
</P>
<P>
But a couple of minutes later, another student called the social studies line 
for assistance on the same point. It turned out that the previous caller had 
been her 6-year-old nephew, whom she had persuaded to test the new service for 
junior- and senior-high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Having found out that Meyer, a Bell Junior High social studies teacher, didn't 
"bite," she spent the next half hour discussing with him several concepts in 
the chapter. 
</P>
<P>
That experience on a recent night sums up the potential benefits, as well as 
limitations, of the new service, funded by $24,000 in federal grants to San 
Diego last year as part of a multimillion-dollar package for special magnet 
education programs at minority schools. 
</P>
<P>
Helpline, available Monday through Thursday from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., provides 
assistance to students at eight predominantly nonwhite secondary schools in 
math, science, English and social studies. Help is available in English, 
Spanish, Lao, Vietnamese, Thai and Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
It's predicated on the fact that, with homework now required at all grade 
levels under district policy, schools need as much help as they can get in 
pushing students to complete their assignments. With many students now coming 
home to empty houses -- where one or both parents work -- educators believe 
students often have no one to turn to if they get stuck on an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that, rather than closing their books and giving up, the students 
will call Helpline. 
</P>
<P>
"Just by explaining the directions for a particular assignment, we can keep 
them from shutting the book," said Michele Waine, a San Diego High School 
teacher and one of several math instructors who take calls daily. After two 
months in operation, 64% of Helpline calls have been math-related, and Carol 
Buguey, program coordinator, has put in additional lines to prevent students 
from being placed on hold for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"We know from research that doing homework increases student achievement" 
especially at the secondary level, Buguey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Homework is not a panacea, of course, but we've known since at the least the 
time 
</P>
<P>
of the Greeks that, the more you study, the more you learn," said Herbert 
Walberg, an education professor at the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
A new study by Harris Cooper at the University of Missouri finds that homework 
assignments for elementary students should be varied, with goals of developing 
positive attitudes, habits and character traits. 
</P>
<P>
As reported in the most recent newsletter of the Harvard School of Education, 
Cooper says that homework, when completed, begins having significant effects on 
student achievement at the junior- and senior-high levels, when it serves 
primarily an academic function. 
</P>
<P>
But this latest effort in the nation's eighth-largest urban school system -- 
trying to build on the success of similar help lines in Indianapolis, 
Philadelphia and a few other cities -- won't work without other changes, 
educators admit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the studies show -- and the common wisdom assumes -- that consistent 
completion of homework brings better academic achievement -- there is 
increasing evidence that the quality of the assignments and the amount of 
parent and teacher feedback to students play a vital role as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Any type of help line is a great idea," said Rick Morris, a teacher at Sequoia 
Elementary School and a frequent lecturer to teachers in Southern California on 
ways both to improve classroom management and to excite students. 
</P>
<P>
"But to be really effective, what I call 'home education' has to include strong 
communication with parents, some accountability -- so that students know you're 
going to be checking -- and a time when I, as the teacher, will let them know 
what I thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
Many elementary- and secondary-level students do not complete assignments 
despite teacher admonitions to do so. Many teachers look upon homework as a way 
to mete out discipline or to keep students busy rather than as a creative means 
to stretch the learning day. 
</P>
<P>
So far in San Diego, students from three schools -- Bell and Morse high schools 
and Gompers secondary school -- account for almost 60% of Helpline calls, with 
students from San Diego and Lincoln high schools and from Memorial Junior High 
accounting for less than 20%. Buguey cannot explain the disparity. 
</P>
<P>
Keiller Middle School and Crawford High are the other two schools where 
educators have promoted the program, although students from any district school 
are given assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my students have just laughed when I've told them about the program," 
Waine said. "Some say they'll call but they don't, even though I tell them they 
don't (have to) give their name, that nobody checks up on them, that there is 
no penalty of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
For district trustees, the ideal, contained in their revised homework policy 
statement of March, 1988, calls for a few minutes a day spent on homework in 
early elementary grades, increasing to two hours a day or more by high school. 
Each school is expected to have a written plan carrying out the policy, and 
teachers are expected to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality has often meant settling for far less, even though almost every 
school district nationwide mandated more homework after the 1983 Carnegie 
Foundation report "A Nation at Risk" called for additional assignments as a way 
to improve dismal school performance. 
</P>
<P>
At Correia Junior High in Point Loma, principal Mike Lorch has decided to put 
teeth into his school's plan by sending students to a mandatory after-school 
homework room when they fail to turn in an assignment two times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We notify the parents that the kid is expected to be there, that there will be 
teachers and teaching assistants assigned to help them, if necessary, and that 
all the materials to complete their homework will be in the room," Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out with 135 students to the room, but now we're down to about 50 
on any given day . . . it's seen as kind of punitive, and it is mandatory, so 
the kids don't like it much. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't care whether it's punitive or not. We're saying that homework is 
important, it's part of the kid's job to learn to do it on his or her own, and 
I want kids to understand they have to work on the skills that they need." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lorch finds his teachers have begun to assign "better 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want me down in their classroom saying, 'You're giving out stupid 
homework, what's the idea of assigning 900 problems that the students did in 
the third grade' -- it's turned out to be a good way to supervise what is being 
assigned." 
</P>
<P>
Although his school is not officially part of the Helpline, Lorch has handed 
out the telephone numbers. "I think it's a good idea . . . given all the 
communications gadgets we have these days, we don't have enough good ideas on 
how to use these things." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant schools Supt. Eloisa Cisneros said that principals in her operations 
area tell her that homework assignments have become more routine, although 
there is only anecdotal evidence from teachers on whether more assignments are 
being completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we know that homework should be meaningful, to be more than just 
busywork at home, but it has taken a while for teachers to understand this," 
Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego district's new language arts/reading program -- to be 
introduced later this year -- homework will be literature-based and involve 
reading and writing activities that parents will be encouraged to share in, 
coordinator Melinda Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will give teachers more of a chance to be creative, and not 
just send home spelling and complete-the-word work sheets," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris tells teachers that homework should be a continuation of a daily lesson, 
to find out whether students have understood the material. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them trying a new skill at home," he said. "I want the work 
rather to be a continuation." Helpline teachers say that, when students 
districtwide call with similar math questions on the same night -- as has 
happened once or twice -- they conclude that a new concept has been 
inadequately introduced in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Morris also said that homework should be varied. At times, he gives students a 
non-academic assignment, such as having them collect an item for an art project 
or talking to their parents for a writing activity. 
</P>
<P>
Helpline administrators will survey some classrooms in the eight participating 
schools this spring to see if more students are completing assignments as a 
result of the phone link. Depending on results, they will expand the project to 
cover more schools next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as good as inviting the teacher into the home for dinner, to talk 
with parents and the student in the home environment, but it's a step forward 
in at least having a place for students to call" and connect with someone who 
cares, Walberg said.

MOUNTAIN OUTLOOK

"Job Corps Training Center -- good idea, wrong location." This is the sentiment 
recently expressed by a Sierra Club representative at a public hearing on the 
U.S. Forest Service proposal to build a Job Corps Training/Conservation Center 
on Mt. Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
But what is it exactly that makes the location unsuitable? The proposed site is 
on land within the Cleveland National Forest, and was formerly the location of 
a small Air Force Base. Since the Air Force vacated the site in 1981, the 
apartments, barracks, offices and other structures have deteriorated from 
neglect and vandalism. The Forest Service now proposes restoring much of the 
site and utilizing the area for a Job Corps Training Center aimed at the 
education and training of disadvantaged youths. 
</P>
<P>
The objections raised by some in the Mt. Laguna community have been varied. The 
Forest Service has effectively addressed those concerns which relate to the 
physical impact of the center upon the environment and the community. 
</P>
<P>
An adequate water source must be available to support the facility, or the 
project will not go forward. The Job Corps trainees will be closely supervised 
and will spend little if any free time outside the grounds, making it unlikely 
the crime rate will increase. The traffic generated by the center will be less 
than that created by the Air Force base during its existence. Although someone 
will always be available to debate the point, the center will not wreak 
environmental or social havoc on Mt. Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents to the center now urge using the site for a purpose that 
benefits the public as a whole, rather than "allowing it to become the private 
domain of 250 Job Corps trainees" (Letter to the Editor by A.H. Reed, March 
25.) If the criterion for approving the land's use is its accessibility to the 
general public, a great deal of other interests would be forced to vacate the 
mountain. Of the 8,680 acres that make up the Mt. Laguna Recreation area, about 
35 acres would be utilized for the center. In comparison, about 180 acres are 
leased to owners of private summer homes. Businesses, the Al Bahr Shrine Camp 
and the Sierra Club also have permits from the Forest Service allowing them 
exclusive use of several acres of property. Thus, many of those opposed to this 
particular proposal have already secured their piece of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Forest Service land is at least in theory the property of all 
Americans, some uses of that land will always benefit some more than others. 
Even campgrounds in the national forests fit this description, as some people 
cannot afford the user fees, and are thus unable to take advantage of these 
public resources. 
</P>
<P>
This type of "uneven" public benefit is not a sound reason for abandoning a 
project. A logical extension of the argument would make it impossible to do 
anything with the public lands that could not be utilized by the public at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for the Job Corps in Mt. Laguna. It will take up a relatively 
small amount of land when compared to the total acreage of the recreation area 
and will not deprive the public from the recreational uses now available. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it will enable thousands of young people to improve their futures, 
away from the urban pressures that make many of their lives so difficult. 
Reports from other communities with similar Training Centers give them high 
marks as neighbors. With a little tolerance and generosity, Mt. Laguna should 
be able to do the same.

By The authors, a couple who live in San Diego, have asked to remain anonymous 
in respect for the traditions of Al-Anon and Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago this Easter weekend I was a grudging resident of one of San 
Diego's better-advertised drug and alcohol treatment centers when the word was 
circulated that they were going to bus some of us to the Alcoholics Anonymous 
Spring Roundup for breakfast Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
I was about a week into sobriety, unhappy about life in general, uncertain of 
how I had managed to get myself into this wretched mess and eager to get out of 
the center and on with my life, even if I had to do it sober. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember thinking bleakly about the irony of it -- they were going to 
round us up, drive us to a round-up and corral us there for what I didn't know, 
but I was sure I wasn't going to like or enjoy it. Maybe that was the kind of 
treatment drunks should expect. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast was in a huge and well-decorated ballroom, jammed with people and 
full of laughter. The joie de vivre of the place was an absolute affront to my 
dour outlook that morning, almost jarring. 
</P>
<P>
I was still lamenting my permanent parting from Black Label Jack and other 
drinking companions, and the experience of newly found sobriety was only 
marginally better than the misery of alcoholism at that point. I was in no mood 
for happiness, certainly not ebullient happiness. 
</P>
<P>
One inescapable thought made the moment even worse. Here were hundreds -- maybe 
thousands -- of recovering alcoholics and all of them but me were happy. They 
thought they were having fun. Well, what should one expect from a big bunch of 
drunks who, obviously, didn't know any better? 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast was good. Table conversation mostly was about the prospects for the 
Padres in the new baseball season and similar matters, only occasionally and 
briefly turning to the occasion and why all of us were there. Afterwards, I 
settled back in my chair determined to endure the talk that was to come without 
revealing my well-developed sense of disdain to my table companions. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker, Tom P., a Midwest manufacturing executive, followed the ritual 
sharing of AA litanies, and he was good. He was really good, perhaps powerful, 
as he went through his "drunkalogue," the story of his addiction to drugs and 
alcohol and his eventual recovery from both after several personal tragedies 
and failed attempts at sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
He eloquently mixed humor with irony and triumph with despair. In my mood that 
Easter morning, I found myself quite perversely relating to the irony and 
despair parts better than the humor and triumph parts. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, I realized that, yes, I was being perverse and, yes, that was part of my 
sickness, and, yes, I should be here even if I really didn't want to. It was a 
discomforting realization that did little to improve my morning. It deflated my 
sense of disdain and it damaged my carefully nurtured melancholy, and I didn't 
much like that. 
</P>
<P>
In one aside, Tom P. told of an encounter with a down-at-the-mouth man at an AA 
meeting in a bleak church basement in a small Georgia town. 
</P>
<P>
"How are you doing?" Tom P. said he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The man grunted and replied: "Well, I'm here. But I've been there, and here is 
better." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time the room broke up with laughter, but it was the first 
time I laughed with everyone else, and I surprised (shocked?) myself. All the 
other people were laughing at Tom P.'s anecdote, I thought, but I realized I 
also was laughing at me. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, here was better than there. Yes, the others were also laughing at 
themselves because they also had been where Tom P. had been, where the dour man 
had been and, indeed, where I was at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
The realization that I wasn't the only person in the world with reflective 
insights into drinking and sobriety was both humbling and uplifting. Not only 
were all these fun-loving drunks having a lot of fun, they were doing it 
deliberately and they actually knew what they were doing! It was not a 
convention of the damned or of the deluded. The problem was me. 
</P>
<P>
I was like the man in the story, but I felt my disdain drain away. I laughed 
easily the rest of the morning. As I opened my mind the day became valuable and 
the time happily memorable. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of other "theres" I could be this Easter morning, and not all of 
them bad. But I will be at the roundup for breakfast, as I have been every year 
since my first, and I will laugh a lot and reflect a lot that "here" is a good 
place to be.

COURTROOM CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently you reported (March 28) that San Diego County is considering the use 
of collection agencies and private investigators to collect 600,000 outstanding 
traffic warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Then you report that many of our judges are shopping-cart judges, moving from 
court to court because of lack of space and no money to build new court space. 
</P>
<P>
If you multiply the outstanding unpaid fines by $30, a number I suspect is low, 
that amounts to $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
I think we should stop "considering" what to do about $18 million our traffic 
violators cheerfully ignore. Our active pursuit of this money should reduce the 
number of traffic violations, increase the confidence of our police, and maybe 
even provide us with some court space for our overworked judges.

MANY SYMPTOMS OF LUPUS CAN KEEP DOCTORS GUESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRI KOBREN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The diagnosis was made just eight years ago, but looking back, 34-year-old 
Annemarie Casey can remember a variety of symptoms that appeared while she was 
still in high school and college. 
</P>
<P>
She had a recurrent rash on her face, for instance. But her mother had rashes, 
so she was not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Her joints ached. But her grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, and she figured 
she was just following in the family footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
She had chronic coldness in her hands and feet from constriction of blood 
vessels -- a condition known as Raynaud's phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
She had kidney infections, also recurrent, and high fevers. 
</P>
<P>
"But each time I just bounced right back," she says now. 
</P>
<P>
After a miscarriage when she was in her mid-20s, however, Casey did not bounce 
back. She felt constantly ill. She lost weight and developed ulcers on her 
hands and feet. Blood tests showed altered liver function. She was told she 
might have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But then her internist called in a rheumatologist, who added up all the 
symptoms and ran some more lab tests. 
</P>
<P>
The determination that she had lupus came as something of a relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy," she said. "I didn't have liver cancer. I wasn't going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she wasn't going to have an easy time of it. Chronic and 
incurable, systemic lupus erythematosus is an auto-immune disease, meaning it 
occurs when the immune system goes haywire and makes antibodies against certain 
components of all the cells in a person's body. 
</P>
<P>
The main targets are women in the childbearing years, and experts believe 
hormonal balance is somehow involved. Just how and why are not yet known. Of 
the estimated 500,000 Americans who have lupus, 90% of them are women. 
</P>
<P>
"The pattern of the disease is exacerbation and then relative or complete 
remission," says Dr. Barry Handwerger of the University of Maryland Medical 
System. 
</P>
<P>
In some people, sunlight causes a flare-up of disease. Others get sicker after 
periods of stress, or after viral illnesses. Lupus sometimes becomes apparent 
for the first time during pregnancy, or a quiet case will flare at that time. 
Other times, the disease will go into remission then, and rebound after 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"The obstetricians are often the first to recognize it," said Dr. Michelle 
Petri, co-director of the lupus pregnancy center at Johns Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
Because it can cause inflammation in the joints, lupus is considered similar to 
arthritis. And, according to Petri, pregnancy in lupus patients is considered 
high risk. 
</P>
<P>
Two forms of lupus are known. In "discoid lupus," antibodies against the skin 
cause lesions, mainly on the face and other areas exposed to the sun. Other 
organ systems are not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Systemic lupus" is more dangerous. A rampage of antibodies can damage blood 
vessels and blood components, skin and joints, internal organs, the central 
nervous system. Brain and kidneys are especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, when diagnosis lagged far behind damage and medicines were more 
limited, patients died of infections, strokes, organ failure. "Now," Handwerger 
said, "we have survival rates approaching normal." 
</P>
<P>
Annemarie Casey, of Columbia, Md., had a successful pregnancy two years after 
her diagnosis. Gale Mangini, who lives on Maryland's Eastern Shore, was 
diagnosed after her first pregnancy; she subsequently has had a second child. 
</P>
<P>
But the disease has taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a secretary," Mangini says. "Now I can't work because of (arthritis in) 
my fingers. My son is in the second grade and can help take care of himself, 
but my 2 1/2-year-old is a problem. I have to struggle to keep up with her." 
</P>
<P>
"Lupus," from the Latin for "wolf," was named because of the butterfly-shaped 
rash that appears on the face. According to one story, the pattern resembles 
the markings on the face of the wolf.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A case of mistaken identities led Escondido youths into a gang fight late 
Friday night that injured five and caused police to arrest two men, Escondido 
Police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight, a group of youths began fighting in the parking lot of 
the Chuck E Cheese Restaurant in the 600 block of West Mission Avenue in 
Escondido, said Lt. John Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Hollis left, saying that he was going for help. Hollis, an 18-year-old 
Compton resident, returned with a gun but misidentified the group of youths 
with whom he had been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
A second fight erupted in the parking lot of K Mart, near the restaurant. About 
24 people fought with tire irons, baseball bats, broken beer bottles, a knife 
and a pistol, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two men in connection with the brawl. Louis Arbee, a 
33-year-old Escondido resident who lives in the 400 block of North Midway, was 
charged with assault with a deadly weapon, Wilson said. Police also arrested 
Hector Salgado, a 20-year-old Vista resident who lives in the 1200 block of 
Monique Court, on charges associated with a New York state warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were injured and taken to Palomar Medical Center. The injured 
included: Hollis, who suffered stab wounds in the back; Brenda Hollis, 37, of 
Econdido, who had leg scrapes; Gregory Borders, 17, of Escondido, who had 
facial scrapes; David Gomez, 23, of Escondido, who had a gunshot wound in his 
side; and Gerardo Romero, 18, who had a gunshot wound in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not disclose whether Brenda Hollis and Zachary Hollis are related. 
Reached by the Times, Brenda Hollis declined to answer any questions about 
Zachary Hollis or the Friday night fracas. 
</P>
<P>
Police are asking anyone with information about the episode to call 741-4713.

MONTCLAIR PREP, VILLAGE CHRISTIAN RIDING HIGH ON EVE OF BASEBALL CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BRIAN MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the top-ranked baseball teams in the Southern Section 1-A Division 
happen to be in the same league, and they also happen to be playing Tuesday for 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
They are Village Christian and Montclair Prep -- Alpha League rivals with a 
tradition of big games against each other. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Crusader football team nearly upset Montclair Prep and heralded 
running backs Derek Sparks and Mike Jones, losing, 28-20, in a game that 
decided the league title. Last baseball season, two of second-place Village 
Christian's three losses came at the hands of the league-champion Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry is not restricted to on-field competition, however. There's also a 
lurking tradition of not exactly, shall we say, enjoying each other's company. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids really get up for Village Christian," Montclair Prep Coach Walt 
Steele admitted. "We don't like them, and they don't like us. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an excellent 1-A team, though." 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian Coach Mike Henzie offered a diplomatic assessment of the 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Said Henzie: "Montclair Prep carries themselves a little differently than we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Montclair Prep (15-2, 3-0), ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 1-A 
poll, is carrying itself very proudly. The Mounties did a number on some larger 
schools last week, defeating Camarillo, Agoura and previously unbeaten El 
Camino Real and winning the Thousand Oaks tournament title. Such feats earned 
Montclair Prep the No. 10 spot in The Times' regional Top Ten rankings; it is 
the smallest school to be ranked this season. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Montclair Prep thumped the likes of Ventura and Taft. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played with the big boys and beaten them," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
Played with the big boys? Montclair Prep, with about 400 students, boasts some 
big names of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Keyaan Cook is a senior shortstop who clubbed two clutch home runs in the wins 
over El Camino Real and Agoura. Cook, a 5-foot-10, 215-pounder who is being 
heavily recruited by Division I schools, has three home runs this year and, 
before the tournament began, was batting .600. 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't even lead the team in power. 
</P>
<P>
Junior catcher Brent Polacheck has four home runs and is batting .562. 
Teammates J. T. Billingslea, Leland Sparks and Andy Shaw also are batting over 
.300. 
</P>
<P>
Add rivalry: Village Christian and Montclair Prep will bring impressive 
credentials to The Master's College, Village Christian's home field, for their 
first meeting of the season. Village Christian, ranked No. 7 in the 1-A, is 
12-1, 3-0 in league play. Henzie calls it "the best start I've ever had"; the 
team is batting a hefty .353. Village Christian is averaging 10 runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Crusaders are batting over .300, including Mark Vail (.400), Matt Bates 
(.409) and Jeff Cortez (.473). 
</P>
<P>
Confidence is tempered with caution at the Sun Valley campus, though, as Henzie 
prepares his team for the showdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point where you think that nobody can beat you," he said, "when 
you know darn well that any butcher can come in and cut you up." 
</P>
<P>
Parrot power: The Valley's quietest 12-game win streak came to an end Tuesday 
when Poly lost the Holt-Goodman tournament final to Birmingham, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
In Holt-Goodman play, Poly (14-3) beat Valley powers San Fernando and Kennedy 
to reach the final. In the semifinal with San Fernando, Poly overcame a 
five-run deficit in the final two innings and survived blowing a four-run lead 
in the seventh inning to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the final, Poly mounted a four-run rally in the seventh inning and had the 
bases loaded before succumbing to Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Though its players may not be the most celebrated in the Valley, Poly remains 
one of the deepest squads around and is a legitimate hopeful for a City 4-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Younger players such as sophomore first baseman Francisco Flores and sophomore 
catcher Steve Chavez -- both alumni of the 1989 Encino Pony League United 
States champion team -- have blended with experienced hands such as senior 
second baseman Roy Lozano (.323), cleanup hitter and senior shortstop Gabe 
Chavez (12 runs batted in) and senior pitcher Eddie Castellanos (Valley-leading 
8-0 record). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significant of all is the club's simple inability to accept 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're never dead in the water," Poly Coach Jerry Cord said. "Our kids fight. 
We're not gonna roll over for anybody. That's our major asset -- we just don't 
lay down." 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Birmingham, in fact, was the team's first since the first week of 
March and was met by sour, angry and bewildered looks among Poly players. 
</P>
<P>
But Cord remains on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right," he said. "You gotta come back to Earth once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Good hit, no field: While its record may not bowl you over, North Hollywood 
(5-7, 3-6 in conference) is showing improvement over last year's 3-13 final 
record. 
</P>
<P>
And there is talent: catcher Harry Marks (.416, four doubles) is being tabbed 
by some as one of the best catchers in the conference. Shortstop Erik Martinez 
(.483) is second among City Section batters in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
But the gloves? 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood has been undone more than once this season by faulty fielding, 
but never was it more apparent than in a 7-6 conference loss to Birmingham last 
week. After Marks clubbed a clutch three-run home run in the seventh inning to 
tie the score, North Hollywood committed three errors to allow the winning run 
to score in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies finished with -- ouch -- 11 errors. 
</P>
<P>
What to do for a team averaging a bit more than five errors a game? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," said Husky Coach Marty Biegel. "I just don't know. I've hit 
more ground balls to these guys in practice than Phyllis Diller has wigs." 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a hairy thought.

WESTLAKE'S EBY PUTS ON A SHOW IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, Westlake High's Mike Eby supplied the thunder. Then he supplied the 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
Eby slammed a two-run home run in the sixth and struck out the side in the 
bottom of the seventh to lead Westlake to a 4-3 win over host Las Vegas Valley 
in a consolation game of the Chaparral tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
Eby's home run gave Westlake a 3-2 lead, but Valley rallied to tie it in the 
bottom of the inning. In the top of the seventh, Keenan McAluney lined a 
one-out triple to right and scored the go-ahead run on Rob Neal's sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 8, San Diego Montgomery 5 -- Senior catcher Brandon Banaga's grand 
slam gave Simi Valley a 5-0 lead in the first inning and Brian Vasey allowed 
one earned run to lead the Pioneers in a Chaparral tournament consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
Vasey (1-0) struck out five, walked four and was two for three. Kenny Hood also 
had two hits for Simi Valley (9-8). 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 12, Serra 2 -- Crespi took advantage of 12 walks and six errors in a 
first-round game of the St. Paul tournament that was called after five innings 
because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Maurizi was three for four, scored four runs, and Brodie Van Wagenen was 
two for three with two runs batted in for Crespi (11-5). 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 5, Concord De La Salle 4 -- Steve Colella's two-out, two-run home 
run in the first inning gave host Notre Dame a lead it didn't relinquish in a 
first-round game of the St. Paul tournament. Eric Vellozi (3-2) went the 
distance for Notre Dame (10-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Alemany 15, Salesian 0 -- Three young pitchers combined to limit Salesian to 
two hits in a first-round game of the St. Paul tournament at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Kevin Tate (2-3) earned the win, and two freshmen, Rob Mary and Chris 
Tashima, pitched in relief for Alemany (9-9).

FREE ENTERPRISE AND SUBSIDIES DON'T MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's ("Pro Sports Wins Big With Taxpayer Assist," March 18) brought 
to mind a thought that I have harbored for years: Why are non-leftists so 
innocent in their use of language. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as an advocate of individual initiative, why not use "freedom of 
enterprise" instead of "free enterprise?" To a large part of the public, free 
enterprise connotes a vague concept, something gratis, bestowed by government 
on rich people. 
</P>
<P>
It does not come across as one of the freedoms, like speech, religion, press, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
As for Al Davis of the Raiders, he is negotiating for a government grant for a 
private business monopoly, which partakes of the mind-set of mercantilism. It 
may be private enterprise, but in no way is it freedom of enterprise. His 
business mentality is closer to Sir Francis Drake and other 
government-sponsored freebooters than to Henry Ford or Steve Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayer-subsidized free enterprise" is an oxymoron.

WHAT MAKES PASSOVER MATZO SO DIFFERENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria L. La Ganga made an error in her explanation of why the Passover matzo is 
different than matzo used on all other nights of the year ("Price of Matzo 
Fixed, N.J. Indictment Claims," March 21). 
</P>
<P>
The removal of a small piece of dough is not unique to Passover or to matzo, as 
a matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, it is symbolic of the portion that was removed from all dough, whether 
bread or matzo, and given to the priests that served in the Holy Temple as one 
of the forms of community support. 
</P>
<P>
For matzo to be acceptable for Passover use, stringent measures are taken to 
guarantee that no leavening of the dough takes place. The entire process -- 
beginning with the mixing of the water and flour until the matzos are removed 
from the oven -- may take no more than 18 minutes. Furthermore, the machines 
are monitored to be free of any dough particles from one baking to another so 
that the matzo be absolutely free of leavening. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Kosher for Passover matzo contains no ingredients other than 
simple flour and water. None of the above holds true for "year-round matzo." 
The additional care and labor required results in greater expense which is 
then, as usual, passed on to the customer.

HELPING OTHERS HELPS RETIRED EXECUTIVES, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Executive Service Corps of Southern California, we witness many of the 
trends highlighted in "Managing Retirement" on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Our objectives are to serve as an outlet for the energies and experience of 
retired executives, a vast reservoir of talent that often goes untapped, and to 
help managers in the nonprofit sector access the time and talent of retired 
executives who serve as volunteer management consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that 75% of top executives serve as volunteers within six 
months of retirement. Typically our consultants, who include over 250 retired 
executives, say they receive as much as they give. It is widely known that men 
and women who volunteer their time to community efforts tend to be healthier 
and happier.

ERMA BOMBECK: A LOT OF TREASURED JUNK LURKS BEHIND THOSE CLOSED DRAWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As my daughter, the neat freak, tugged to free a stuck drawer in the kitchen, I 
reached in and expertly removed the church calendar that held it immobile. The 
drawer slid out easily. 
</P>
<P>
She gasped as she viewed its contents. "How long did it take you to put 
together a drawer like this?" 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the array of eclectic junk, from screwdrivers to birthday candles. 
"I have to apologize," I said. "I've been throwing things in this drawer for 
only seven years. The one at the old house was great! I tossed stuff in there 
for 15 years. Now that was a catch-all drawer!" 
</P>
<P>
My eyes proudly took in the VFW poppy, old lottery ticket, Christmas tree bulb, 
plastic packets of ketchup from McDonald's, poker chips, corn holders, pruning 
shears, a recipe for Cajun chicken and a telephone number written on a blank 
check. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you find anything in here?" she persisted. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the point of a catch-all drawer," I said. "An item is never lost . . . 
it's just never really found." 
</P>
<P>
You show me a woman who does not have a junk drawer and I'll show you a woman 
who launders her lint. I grew up with these drawers. My grandma had one of the 
most impressive catch-all drawers I have ever seen. Hers came with a warning: 
Every time you opened it to look for something, her voice would come out of 
nowhere, "Don't hurt yourself!" It was like an arsenal -- old razor blades 
rested by a ball of crochet thread, rusty pins burrowed under roach traps, and 
paring knives were buried among buttons that never matched anything and keys 
that never fit anything. 
</P>
<P>
My mother's junk drawer wasn't as large as Grandma's, but it was more creative. 
Hers held empty cardboard spindles that at one time held ribbon. She had rolls 
of pennies she was going to check someday to see if she had one worth a 
thousand dollars. She kept piles of coupons that had expired years ago and jar 
lids she hung onto after the jars to them had broken. There was a pile of 
warranties for appliances that had died of old age and a booklet of Christmas 
carols for the piano. We didn't own a piano. 
</P>
<P>
I have tried to uphold the family tradition of the catch-all drawer. The family 
has been supportive, occasionally throwing in a watch that doesn't run anymore 
or a half-stick of gum that hardens and crumbles. 
</P>
<P>
I told my daughter, "I'd like to bequeath all of this to you, but you have to 
amass your own." She was probably more upset than she let on.

ROGER SIMON: A NATIONAL POLL EVEN A CYNIC COULD TOLERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People accuse me of being a cynic. I'd complain about this, but what's the use? 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't do any good. Nothing does any good. Besides, most people are 
weasels anyway. 
</P>
<P>
So a few days ago these two guys send me their new book, "The Cynical 
Americans: Living and Working in an Age of Discontent and Disillusion." 
</P>
<P>
They want me to care about a book on cynicism. Like I care if it's going to 
change the world, right? 
</P>
<P>
The two guys, Donald Kanter, a professor of marketing at Boston University, and 
Philip Mirvis, a private researcher and consultant, say things like: 
</P>
<P>
"Some 43% of the American populace fit the profile of the cynic, who sees 
selfishness and fakery at the core of human nature. We base this conclusion on 
the results of a national survey we conducted whose findings we report here." 
</P>
<P>
Just what we need. Another national survey. You know how I think most surveys 
are done? I think a bunch of guys get together in a room and drink some beer 
and make up the numbers. They just make them up. Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey shows that cynics mistrust politicians and most authority figures, 
regard the average person as false-faced and uncaring, and conclude that you 
should basically look out for yourself," the authors write. "Cynics at work 
deeply doubt the truth of what their managements tell them and believe that 
their companies, given a chance, will take advantage of them." 
</P>
<P>
Well, excuuuuuuuuse me. Like a company would never take advantage of an 
employee, right? No way. They're much too busy polluting the environment or 
making junk products that explode in our faces as soon as we get them home. 
</P>
<P>
So the authors include their survey in the book and you can take it yourself. 
For each statement, you indicate how you feel by marking each one Strongly 
Agree, Slightly Agree, Slightly Disagree or Strongly Disagree: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Most people will tell a lie if they can gain by it." 
</P>
<P>
2. "People claim to have ethical standards regarding honesty and morality, but 
few stick to them when money is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
3. "People pretend to care more about one another than they really do." 
</P>
<P>
4. "It's pathetic to see an unselfish person in today's world because so many 
people take advantage of him or her." 
</P>
<P>
5. "Most people are just out for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
6. "Most people inwardly dislike putting themselves out to help other people." 
</P>
<P>
7. "Most people are not really honest by nature." 
</P>
<P>
Understand? Sure you do. Maybe if you don't, I could get a chimpanzee from a 
zoo to explain it to you. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, if you answered Strongly Agree or Slightly Agree to five out of the 
seven questions, you're a cynic. 
</P>
<P>
What's a cynic? The authors say, "to put it simply, (a cynic) believes that 
lying, putting on a false face and doing whatever it takes to make a buck are 
all part of our basic human nature." 
</P>
<P>
So I called one of the authors, Donald Kanter, to ask him what was wrong with 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"A cynic is a person who mistrusts other people's motives and looks for 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses to exploit," Kanter said. "A cynic is a person 
who says: 'Don't get your hopes up, because you're just going to get screwed. 
Don't be a sucker, because you can't trust anybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
In other words, I said, a cynic is realist. 
</P>
<P>
I thought maybe I heard a sigh on the phone, but with the crummy state of the 
phone company these days, who can tell? 
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer to think that a realistic person is more of a skeptic and not 
a cynic," Kanter said. "A skeptic may doubt what you say, but leaves the 
evidence open. All of us are cynics at one time or another. It's hard to look 
at Richard Nixon or Dan Quayle and not be somewhat cynical." 
</P>
<P>
Kanter is saying that the difference between a cynic and a skeptic is that a 
skeptic looks at Richard Nixon and says: "This guy was a lousy President." 
</P>
<P>
But a cynic looks at Richard Nixon and says: "The guy was a lousy President and 
so all our Presidents are going to be lousy because that is the nature of life 
and politics in America today." 
</P>
<P>
Kanter and Mirvis fill up a whole book with examples and anecdotes and charts 
and they even tell you which areas of the country are most cynical (the 
mid-Atlantic with 48% cynics) and the least cynical (the mountain states with 
28% cynics). 
</P>
<P>
The book is very interesting, but tell me the two of them really care. Tell me 
they are not in it for the $22.95 a copy, right? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I once took a cynic test that is a lot easier than theirs. It was this 
picture of a glass with water in it. And they asked you: "Is this glass 
half-empty or half-full?" 
</P>
<P>
And I answered: "Who cares? What I want to know is if somebody had his thumb in 
it before I drink it." 
</P>
<P>
So they told me I was cynical. 
</P>
<P>
I would have argued with them. 
</P>
<P>
But what's the point?

ZAN THOMPSON: MOM HEARS THE SOUNDS OF EASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have a wonderful Easter under a bright blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
Each season has its harbinger. When the Christmas trees go up right in the 
stores after Labor Day, you know that Christmas is coming. When the newspaper 
advertisements show pictures of sweet gray-haired ladies peering wonderingly 
into azalea plants, you know that Mother's Day is coming. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, a sure sign of Easter at our house was the sound of a rheumatic 
van wheezing up the steep driveway. Our son Timothy attended college at Western 
New Mexico University with young men who lived in Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio 
and Florida, too far to go home but never too far to come to our house in La 
Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Tim was the kind of a kid who said: 
</P>
<P>
My mother won't care. 
</P>
<P>
My mother will escort 40 fourth-graders on a train trip to the San Diego 
Zoo/Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
My mother will make six dozen cupcakes with jack-o'-lantern faces. 
</P>
<P>
My mother will decorate for the football banquets, varsity and junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
It's OK. She likes to. 
</P>
<P>
And that is why our house was always filled with Midwestern basketball players 
on every holiday. One must have the senses of a jungle tracker to see them in 
the open but you get to learn the signs. The sliced ham, potato salad and chips 
and dips I put out were gone without a trace. There were sleeping bags in the 
guest rooms and there were towels in layers like moraines on the bathroom 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
And soon the telephone would begin to ring and the fluting voices of girls were 
heard. "Tell him Pam (Kimberley, Shelley, Trish, Karen) called." Either the 
boys have little signal senders on the tops of their heads that tell the girls 
they are in town or the boys called the girls days ahead from school charging 
the calls to their fathers' phones. 
</P>
<P>
Do not tell me they can't go home again. Like salmon returning to the rivers of 
the Northwest, like the swallows to Capistrano, the darlings come back and the 
sound of clothes swishing down the laundry chute for dear old Mom to put in the 
washing machine is heard. And for this, thank you, Lord. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, Doug, suggested that it might be time to stop hiding the baskets 
with the names of each boy on them when he found me filling the baskets with 
after-shave lotion as well as candy. But I could not bear to think of Easter 
morning without all of those lumbering darlings crashing from room to room and 
out in the garden to look for the baskets. 
</P>
<P>
And I noticed that when Doug found his basket with his name on it, he took it 
upstairs and put it on his dresser. And that was all that was said about 
outgrowing Easter baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, soon enough the cold air of reality would blow upon their necks, still 
looking vulnerable and boyish, and they would discover that baskets and colored 
candies and eggs come dear and seldom. It behooves us to honor the Easter Bunny 
as long as he hops in. Soon enough, he's up and down the trail taking with him 
his gauzy magic and we all need all the gentleness and laughter we can find. 
</P>
<P>
I hope you have good luck with dyeing the eggs. I am always put off when the 
dye goes inside the shell and I am faced with green and blue hard-boiled eggs 
which I can't even disguise in creamed tuna, the last refuge of hard-boiled 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
To all of you the finest of Easters, all the eggs found and no chocolate 
stains.

BETTLEHEIM'S DEATH: SOCIETY'S DISGRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patt Morrison's illuminating article, "Last Days of Bruno Bettleheim" (April 
3), was a courageous and unflinching look at what can happen to the unloved 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
That such a gentle and caring man as Bettleheim could end his life so brutally 
uncared for is a disgrace. Unfortunately, in our society this particular 
disgrace is a common one.

Paul and Anne Ehrlich are wasting their time espousing population control. 
</P>
<P>
There have been billions of words already written about the dangers of 
overpopulation. The warnings only seem to encourage baby-producing people to 
make more of them. They should be penalized.

MALIBU DIAPER SERVICE NEEDS RETHINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lerner Gray need no longer feel guilty about disposable diapers in the Southern 
California landfill, but she has made a trade-off: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
Diesel-spewing diaper delivery trucks rolling up Pacific Coast Highway to her 
home in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
2. Additional use of energy (whether gas, electric or both) to run washing 
machines and dryers, and heat wash water to the extremely high temperatures 
required to sterilize soiled diapers. 
</P>
<P>
3. Finally, the gallons of water used to launder 90 cloth diapers each week. 
Taken over a one-year period, this is a tremendous amount of water usage. 
</P>
<P>
In consideration of our serious drought in California, one could recommend that 
born-again environmentalists switch to disposable diapers.

Congratulations to The Times for running such an incisive, informative article 
on Paul Ehrlich and his new book, "The Population Explosion." Thanks to The 
Times, we know Ehrlich is one of the most dangerous men in America. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich is a social engineer. His efforts to "reprogram consciousness," to 
prescribe "politically correct" responses to people who have large families, 
and to decry affluent people whose "children take a greater toll on the 
environment than children of poor parents" smack of the old Stalinist 
totalitarian nightmares Orwell described so pungently. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich's theories were discredited years ago by the scientific community, as 
well as the concept of "global warming" he stridently harps on. He is the 
Trofim Lysenko of our time. Stanford University should be ashamed to have him 
on its faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Abrams deserves praise for his even-handed treatment.

A LITTLE RICH EVEN FOR BEVERLY HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIC CENTER: IN 1982, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE PROJECT WAS $30 MILLION. NOW 
THE CITY COUNCIL IS LOOKING AT $120 MILLION BY THE TIME THE JOB ENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fully seven years after ground was broken for the city's lavish Civic Center, 
yet another mayor of Beverly Hills will stand up this week and ask why it has 
taken so longto finish, and why it is costing so much. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it falls into my lap, and it's not a project that I feel good about. 
That's the irony of it," said City Councilman Allan L. Alexander, who is 
scheduled to be sworn in as mayor Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Max Salter, vowed last year to see the job finished before the 
end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
But workers are still swarming over the 10-acre site, lawsuits loom, and 
completion is not expected until Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said he will ask the City Council as his first act in office to 
demand a complete report on the history of the project, "and in particular 
focusing on the financial aspects." 
</P>
<P>
From a preliminary estimate of $30 million, the Civic Center has grown in size 
and complexity to the point where the total cost may exceed $120 million, 
according to city officials' latest estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we were not provided with information . . . but the information 
turned out to be wrong," Alexander said. And even if the figures had been 
right, "my feeling is that money is better spent on what goes on inside the 
building, not on the building itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figure includes major extras that were not part of the original 
design by renowned architect Charles Moore, including an $11-million renovation 
for the 59-year-old City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Beverly Hills' reputation for luxury, the fear of overspending has 
plagued the project for years. It was held up for more than a year when a 
theater and cafeteria were dropped to save costs in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
City officials now say they lost as much from the expensive redesign as they 
did by cutting the theater. 
</P>
<P>
But the trouble-plagued final phase of the Civic Center, made up of the police 
headquarters, the Beverly Hills Public Library and the arches and gardens of 
three outdoor courtyards, could end up costing as much as $23 million more than 
the $53 million quoted for it as recently as last November. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles included several months of delay in 1987 as the general 
contractor, the J. A. Jones Construction Co. of Charlotte, N.C., attempted to 
deal with asbestos in the old library and ground water that turned the police 
station site into a mudhole. 
</P>
<P>
City officials complained even then about the lack of progress. A. W. Harrison, 
Jones' project manager at the time, replied by blaming the city for "total lack 
of communication and attention to the problem itself." 
</P>
<P>
The mud and the asbestos were eventually overcome, at a cost estimated at the 
time to be nearly $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest debacle, Jones walked off the job in mid-January, claiming it was 
owed more than $10 million. The workers stayed away until the beginning of 
March, when the city and the contractor agreed to put off their disagreements 
until after the project is finished. 
</P>
<P>
Joe A. Walker, Western region project manager for Jones, said last week that he 
is confident of meeting the newly renegotiated deadlines, which call for the 
police station to be substantially completed May 8, followed by the library May 
29. The company has handed over a $2-million letter of credit that Beverly 
Hills can cash if it fails. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you shut down a project and start it back up again, it's more 
difficult than starting anew," he said. "Getting the same people back in has 
been a problem, but just the privilege of getting to work on a job like this 
brings them back in." 
</P>
<P>
January's walkout came as a shock to City Council members, who were assured at 
the end of 1989 that the work was proceeding without a hitch. City Manager 
Edward S. Kreins, who presided over the project from its inception, was forced 
to take early retirement as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But it was hardly surprising to the project's subcontractors and suppliers, 
many of whom began feeling the pinch in the second half of last year when the 
city's construction manager began a cost-cutting campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"In any project you have revisions, but in this particular situation to have 
such radical and drastic cuts at the last minute, I personally was sick for 
about a month over it," said David Schmidt, who helped design the interiors for 
the library building. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, project manager for Marshall Brown, an interior design firm of San 
Diego, said the furniture budget was slashed from $1.6 million to $350,000, and 
textured vinyl wall coverings were also dropped in favor of paint. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think the people of Beverly Hills are getting what they deserved, 
or what they should have," said Schmidt, whose firm left the job late last year 
and asked that its name not be associated with the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Cart, the city librarian, said he has since managed to put together 
"adequate furnishings" for the building, which is expected to be the showpiece 
of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Painted in soft tones of peach and sea green, the library is enlivened by 
cut-out arches and tiled alcoves. Countertops are covered in deep green marble 
from Thailand, and a corridor that gradually shrinks in height leads to a 
children's area where the desks and bookshelves are at kids'-eye level. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the budget we had for the project, I think we've got an extraordinary 
building," Cart said. 
</P>
<P>
The police building is also extraordinary, from the saunas in the officers' 
locker rooms to the single-occupancy jail cells with their views of the 
Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And the courtyards recall the architecture of 17th-Century Rome, where Moore 
looked for inspiration to solve the problem of linking the new buildings on the 
east side of Rexford Drive with the old City Hall and the fire station on the 
west side. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was three oval-shaped open spaces, but here too, reality 
interfered with the dream of a Civic Center for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Associates recall that Moore shed a tear when he learned that the elaborate 
spiral pattern he designed for the central ellipse was scratched because of 
concerns that it would confuse drivers on Rexford Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The recent economies were also painful, including decisions to eliminate 
decorative tile from the outside walls, omit palm trees from the landscaping 
and do away with three of four pedestrian bridges that were to link the already 
completed parking structure with the rest of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I view these cuts with real alarm, since the appearance of the Civic Center 
will be drastically and adversely affected," Moore said in a Nov. 4, 1989, 
letter that was delivered to Mayor Salter's home in an effort to make sure it 
got past the consultants and city staffers and into the City Council's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great shame if Beverly Hills, having asked for -- and paid for 
-- a major work of architecture, were to be denied its realization resulting 
from a random set of last-minute deletions. It is essential to us all that the 
Civic Center not be vandalized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were made under a directive from the City Council that authorized 
construction manager John Hartsock of JLH Consultants Inc. to save money by 
cutting elements of the project that were not vital to its function or 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hartsock is still being retained by the city, largely to help piece 
together a coherent account of the project to date, JLH has been replaced as 
construction manager by another firm. Hartsock declined to comment for this 
article. 
</P>
<P>
"That review is still taking place," said City Atty. Greg Stepanicich, who has 
been working with a specially hired construction-law firm to try to account for 
the cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of whether a number of people or one person is responsible, we have 
reached no conclusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he said, the city's position is that the police station, library and 
courtyard should cost no more than $53 million, and that even $10 million of 
that figure is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
The final word on who pays what to whom will have to wait for mediation once 
the project is finished, and perhaps for a final decision by the courts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential price tag of $120 million comes from: $20-million for the parking 
structure and fire headquarters, more than $11 million for renovating the City 
Hall, a possible $75.5 million for the police station, library and courtyard, 
another $10 million in architectural, engineering and construction management 
fees and about $4 million for communications equipment, furniture and other 
miscellaneous expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Will there be any more surprises? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope not," Finance Director Don Oblander said. "But the way this project has 
gone, you never say never." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CIVIC CENTER CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 21, 1982 -- City Council selects Charles Moore's design for the Beverly 
Hills Civic Center. "Get started right now," exhorts Mayor Ben Stansbury, "we 
don't even want to lose a day." Estimated price as designed: $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
April 12, 1983 -- Ground breaking. By July 7, estimated cost rises to $43.4 
million to cover improved facade, extra space, parking and safety improvements. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1984 -- Three former mayors sue to block variable-rate financing for the 
project. Costlier materials are specified, bringing the estimated cost up to 
$60 million. Architectural, engineering and construction management fees have 
also been added. "There's a real question as to whether they (the City Council) 
can afford it at all," says former Mayor Leonard Horwin. Fixed-rate bonds are 
sold instead. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 17, 1985 -- City Council appeals for a benefactor to pick up the cost of 
finishing the job, as estimates reach as high as $100 million. "What we have 
here is a Cadillac with all the options," says Mayor Edward I. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 15, 1985 -- Performing arts center and cafeteria are dropped in hopes of 
saving about $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 26, 1987 -- Ground water is discovered on the site. Work is disrupted, and 
no progress is made on police headquarters from June through September. 
</P>
<P>
March 4, 1987 -- Asbestos is found in ducts at old library. Work there does not 
resume until December. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 15, 1990 -- J. A. Jones Construction Co., the primary contractor, walks 
off the job to dramatize its claims for more than $10 million in unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
March 6, 1990 -- Although appalled at projected cost of as much as $75.5 
million to finish the police station, library and courtyard, City Council 
brings J. A. Jones back to finish the job. Council members say the final cost 
of the entire job could reach $120 million.

A roaring fire struck La Puente on March 26, 1923. The smoke and flames could 
be seen for miles. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started at the corner of Workman and Glendora streets. Twelve hours 
later, it had destroyed a dozen homes and a lumber yard.

THE CITY'S A REALITY; SO ARE THE WATCHDOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that cityhood is a year-old reality, two men who enlisted in the fight 
against it see an even greater challenge before them: the self-appointed posts 
of city watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
Al Rumpilla, former co-chair of the Vote No Diamond Bar Incorporation 1989 
Committee, and Frank Dursa, another longtime incorporation foe, now spend every 
other Tuesday evening seated in the front row, left side of the Walnut Valley 
Unified School District board room, where the City Council holds its bimonthly 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
With copies of the U.S. Constitution, Robert's Rules of Order and the Brown Act 
within reach, Rumpilla, 46, takes meticulous notes. Often, he and Dursa, 66, 
speak out loud -- and not always during the public comments period. Sometimes, 
they heckle. 
</P>
<P>
And always, they find something to criticize, whether it's furniture for City 
Hall (too expensive); a Diamond Bar newsletter with council members' names on 
the front (political propaganda); city-paid trips to conferences and seminars 
(unnecessary), or a proposal to charge people for council agenda packets. That 
last was a slap in the face, they said, since they're the only residents who 
regularly ask for copies. 
</P>
<P>
Their nit-picking may not always be appreciated, but it is certainly noticed. 
"Their hearts are in the right place," City Manager Robert Van Nort said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Dursa retired from a job in sales management for a food company; Rumpilla is on 
disability from his truck-driving job after a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't enjoy going to these stupid things, but from the very first day 
there was that violation of the Brown Act," Rumpilla said, referring to several 
closed-door meetings the council-elect held before being installed. The San 
Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune sued the city, and won a court order to open the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we're a city, I want our money spent honestly and wisely, not on 
foolish things," said Dursa, sitting at Rumpilla's dining room table on a 
recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten dollars on my tax bill would be harder for me to come up with than $1,000 
for other people making $40,000, $60,000, or $100,000 a year," Rumpilla said. 
</P>
<P>
There's barely enough space for two coffee mugs on the table, which is covered 
with the accumulation of a year's worth of City Council meetings: stacks and 
stacks of paper, thousands of reports, resolutions and ordinances the council 
has passed, revised or rejected. 
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of newspaper clippings -- Diamond Bar this, Diamond Bar that -- 
neatly mounted on scrapbook pages. 
</P>
<P>
"We've both missed two council meetings," Rumpilla boasted. "When I missed one 
(Councilman) Gary Werner called me asking, 'Are you sick?' " 
</P>
<P>
But the two men aren't always welcome. On several occasions, Mayor Phyllis 
Papen has sternly told them that they're out of order. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps for a long time, Rumpilla and five other incorporation foes will be 
blamed for botching the incorporation process and almost causing the city to 
lose $1.2 million in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The election had been scheduled for November, 1988, but was postponed because 
of last-minute objections by the residents in a letter sent to the county Local 
Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Papen, who has flown to Sacramento several times to lobby for support of a bill 
to get the money, has accused the "handful of people" of bringing about a 
situation that almost deprived Diamond Bar of tax money. 
</P>
<P>
Rumpilla dismisses the criticism with a wave of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was exercise our constitutional rights," he said. "We're being 
called gadflies, burrs on a dog's tail. Whatever you want to call me, I'd wear 
it proudly." 
</P>

SUPPORT IS SOUGHT FOR LIGHT RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank those of your readers who were so supportive and helpful to me 
in convincing the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to adopt a plan 
that places the North Coast line at the top of the county's transportation 
priority list. 
</P>
<P>
While some doubters proclaimed the line "dead" just a few months ago, the rest 
of us kept working hard to make sure that the LACTC accepted the obvious fact 
that the North Coast line, built to a station at the Westchester Central 
Business District, makes good sense and deserves their support. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear from the priorities established by the LACTC's March 28 vote that 
funding for the remainder of the North Coast line, wherever it is ultimately 
directed, will have to wait until some time in the next century. But the first 
2 1/2-mile segment will link LAX and the Westchester business district into a 
regional transportation network that has the potential to reduce traffic on our 
streets, to help clean some of the smog out of our air and to pump some badly 
needed revenue into local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to remember that funding for the project may depend on the 
passage of two statewide ballot measures, Proposition 108 and Proposition 111. 
The passage of both is required if we are to raise the money necessary for 
construction, as well as the right to spend that money. I hope everyone who 
wants a light rail for West Los Angeles will actively support these two vital 
measures.

NINJA YARMULKES? SOMBER JEWISH SKULLCAPS GO POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designer yarmulkes are turning up in vivid styles -- decorated with symbols 
ranging from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Mickey Mouse and 
Batman to Lakers and Dodgers logos. The skullcaps, once made of somber cloth, 
are now fashioned of materials ranging from plaid and paisley to leather and 
lace. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Eli Schochet, 55, remembers the time as a child when he wore a baseball 
cap instead of a Jewish skullcap to satisfy a custom requiring Jewish males to 
keep their heads covered in reverence to God. Now the rabbi wears a yarmulke 
imprinted with the logo of his favorite baseball team, the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The donning of the boldly painted skullcaps signals "a new way of going 
public," said Schochet, rabbi of Congregation Beth Kodesh in West Hills. "Jews 
were perhaps once afraid of being conspicuous. Today, the wearing of the 
yarmulke is a definite public statement." 
</P>
<P>
"You see them everywhere," said Cathy Hoffman, who hand-paints designs on 
yarmulkes in her Tarzana home and supplies them to area boutiques or sells them 
at festivals for Purim, a holiday commemorating the deliverance of Jews by 
Esther. "My sons have about 20 designs each. Every morning it's fun to help 
them pick out which one they'll wear." 
</P>
<P>
For many years, doting parents have bought yarmulkes painted with colorful 
Jewish symbols, toy trains and blocks for their infants and toddlers. Three 
years ago, older children began wearing dinosaur, Superman and He-Man images. 
About the same time, according to area shopkeepers, new designs such as 
patterned stars made on leather or suede grew popular with adults. 
</P>
<P>
The current explosion of hand-painted TV and movie character yarmulkes did not 
catch on until last year, when the gleaming Batman logo grabbed the attention 
of grade-school children. Women soon began painting the logo on yarmulkes. 
</P>
<P>
That was last year's yarmulke fashion trend. Now, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
are popping up on boys' skullcaps in area Hebrew academies. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single kid in my sons' class wears yarmulkes with some character on it," 
said Hoffman, 32, whose two sons attend Emek Hebrew Academy in North Hollywood. 
"They mostly wear Ninja Turtles, Super Mario Brothers and Ghostbusters." Super 
Mario Brothers is a Nintendo game. Most of the male students at the academy, 
which has 650 youngsters enrolled in preschool through eighth grade, wear some 
form of designer yarmulke during temple services. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's in, you'll find it on yarmulkes," she said. Hoffman started her 
enterprise in September when other mothers asked her to duplicate her designs 
for their sons. Hoffman, who paints about 30 yarmulkes a week, also receives 
special orders, sometimes numbering 300, from Hebrew academies and sports camps 
that want their logos on students' yarmulkes. 
</P>
<P>
A cottage industry, consisting mostly of one-woman businesses in New York, 
churns out many of the hand-painted designs. Most women apply acrylic paints to 
the suede or leather. About six Jewish gift stores operate in the San Fernando 
Valley, all of which reported a brisk business of the painted skullcaps the 
week before Passover, which began at sundown Monday. The festival is an 
eight-day period set aside to commemorate the exodus of Jews out of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Avrum Schwartz, 10, wears yarmulkes painted with Lakers, Dodgers and Mets 
sports logos. "I wear a Batman one too," said Schwartz, who lives in Van Nuys 
and attends Emek Hebrew Academy. "I got it in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
By the time boys reach the age of 13 or 14, the allure of cartoon images fades. 
Some older children wear sports logos and others receive hand-crocheted 
yarmulkes from girlfriends. A few adults have special-ordered yarmulkes that 
signify their professions, such as a medical symbols for doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"This says that it's possible for one to be an observant Jew and at the same 
time, be integrated into mainstream American life," Schochet said. "The designs 
may be kind of campy at times, but it proves you don't have to be morosely 
serious about religion." 
</P>
<P>
He remembered a bar mitzvah where guests wore yarmulkes painted with 
spaceships, but the practice is not widespread, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schochet's wife, Penina, manages The Jewish Quarter gift shop in Encino, which 
sells about three dozen different designs, priced from $1.50 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Although many shopkeepers carry colorful yarmulkes, no adults interviewed 
admitted to wearing the more flamboyant patterns. Most, however, said they 
color-coordinate their yarmulkes with their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Some women refuse to hand-paint the more splashy designs. "They don't think 
it's appropriate," said Harry Mezci, who assists his wife, Sharon, 30, in 
running Kepah Art, a New York City home-based business. Kepah is the Hebrew 
word for the skullcaps. "It's not really sacrilegious and there's really 
nothing wrong with it, but a lot of people complain." (Many feel the act of 
covering the head is sacred, not the yarmulke itself.) 
</P>
<P>
Kepah Art produces about two dozen yarmulkes each week, including an intricate 
star pattern and argyle design. 
</P>
<P>
Such ornamentation is generally accepted by the Jewish community, and the 
cartoon designs have rarely been censored. But when the Burbank Leader 
newspaper recently published an article about Rabbi Mark Sobel, 39, who wears a 
Mickey Mouse-emblazoned yarmulke, temple board members expressed concern about 
negative reactions that the practice might cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board, for the most part, feels the yarmulke should just be one color -- 
no symbols," said Morris Gold, a spokesman for Beth Emet Temple in Burbank, 
where Sobel serves. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, who still occasionally wears his yarmulke with the Mickey Mouse design, 
said he is "pleased that Judaism isn't just confined to the synagogue" and that 
"Jewish symbols can travel into the secular world," but would not comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Rabbi William Kramer, 70, added: "I delight in the use of joyous symbols 
in religion in general, and in particular on Kepahs because I believe in 
serving the Lord in gladness. You don't have to be somber to be religious." 
</P>
<P>
Other rabbis have joined Schochet and Sobel in wearing the whimsical designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear the Ninja Turtles during Purim festivals, on family night services and 
when I work with kids," said Douglas Cotler, who serves as cantor at Shir 
Chadash New Reform Congregation in Encino. Steven Jacobs, the temple's senior 
rabbi, also wears the turtles, which his congregation finds endearing, Cotler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Fair, a store in Sherman Oaks, sells a variety of yarmulkes painted 
with sports logos and cartoon characters for about $14. "We're constantly 
replacing them because they sell very well, especially the Ninja Turtles," said 
employee Eric Paul. "Someone came in last week who wanted the Simpsons on their 
yarmulke, but I don't think any of the women who paint them know who the 
Simpsons are." 
</P>
<P>
Most shops were doing a brisk business the week before Passover, although 
Hanukkah is the favored time for buying the designs. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes it more interesting, and helps a little boy want to wear his 
yarmulke," said Minda Mafouda, who instructs the 20 children who attend the Em 
Habanin school in North Hollywood. "If it has something that's special or 
catchy on it, they'll want to wear it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Girls as well as boys wear yarmulkes at Valley Beth Shalom Day School in 
Encino, one of the few egalitarian schools in the area. "It attracts 
attention," said Nili Ziv, director of the school, which instructs children 
from kindergarten through sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Schochet says girls often visit her Encino shop to buys pink suede, lace or 
sequined yarmulkes. "Some other stores sell them with spangles," she said, "but 
most kids go back to the cartoon characters. And we have one with Mickey Mouse 
holding a piece of matzo -- it sort of combines a couple of traditions."

WATCH GROUPS BEING FORMED IN PALMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police are trying to organize Neighborhood Watch groups in the 
Palms area, in part to combat what they say has been a major increase in thefts 
of autos and car stereos in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Police have invited community residents, business people and property owners to 
an introductory meeting at 7 p.m. Monday at St. Mary's Episcopal Church, 3647 
Watseka Ave. Police say Neighborhood Watch programs on every block could help 
prevent such thefts in the future. Anyone seeking more information or who has 
questions can call the police department at 202-4524 and ask for M.S. Cobb 
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.

A VISIT TO EGYPT'S GREAT PYRAMID WITH MUMMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN OGILVY, Ogilvy is a free-lance writer living in Hidden Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I happened to mention, in passing, that I had to go to Egypt for a few days, 
and mother said she thought she might come along as she'd never seen those 
pointed things and thought it was about time she did. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pyramids?" I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the Pyramids," she said. "I certainly don't need to see those other 
pointed things, do I? We've got one right here in London, haven't we? Used to 
belong to Cleopatra." 
</P>
<P>
"Obelisks?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You're so clever" said mother, and started to pack. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't sure that this was all that terrific an idea. Looking at Pyramids and 
obelisks and tombs involves a certain amount of walking, which was something 
mother found troublesome. Ever since her accident, that is. 
</P>
<P>
She'd been an actress for most of her life until that fateful day when, 
appearing in a production of "The Curse of the Werewolf" at the Basingstoke 
Repertory Theater she'd fallen off the plaster mountain and broken her hip. I 
pointed out that a game leg might slow down her sightseeing a bit but she 
brushed me aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always sit down," she said. "I'm sure they have places in Egypt where 
you can sit down." 
</P>
<P>
They do. One of them is the Hilton Hotel in Cairo. I like Hilton Hotels. Little 
slices of America all over the world; you know what you're going to get for 
your money. The faucets deliver the water at the correct temperature, the rooms 
are clean and comfortable and you can get a hamburger whenever you want one. 
Mother thought it was pretty nice, too. 
</P>
<P>
I found her in the American Express office in the hotel lobby. She was telling 
the pretty Egyptian girl behind the counter all about Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Pyramids, you know, are 2,000 years old." 
</P>
<P>
The girl smiled politely. 
</P>
<P>
"Five thousand, in fact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure?" asked mother, in the tone of one who has serious doubts about 
the comprehensiveness of the Egyptian educational system. 
</P>
<P>
I pushed myself forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Five, mother. At least five." 
</P>
<P>
Mother beamed. She knew where I'd been to school. 
</P>
<P>
"You're so clever," she said, then turned to the girl. "Well, we'd like to see 
them, please. And anything else of interest." 
</P>
<P>
The girl smiled. "There's the Sphinx." 
</P>
<P>
"That'll do nicely," said mother. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was very smart. It had "American Express" painted on the side. Mother, 
with some dramatic flourishes of her cane, negotiated the steps and we settled 
into the front seat. The front seat was a mistake. In fact, any seat was a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Cairo traffic moves very fast. Very fast indeed. A determined lawlessness rules 
the road. Stop signs are there to be ignored. If you dare to come to a halt at 
a red light, the drivers caught behind you will, as one man did, lean on their 
horns and shout rude things at you. 
</P>
<P>
This, for a nervous visitor, is unsettling. The authorities obviously have 
tried to contain this antisocial behavior by placing a policeman at each 
intersection. These poor men seem unsure of their duties but fill the time by 
smiling graciously into the middle distance while making small, meaningless 
gestures at the traffic thundering by. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't we going fast?" said mother. "And why have you got your eyes shut?" 
</P>
<P>
After a while the noise of the city faded behind us. The bus stopped lurching 
back and forth and settled down to a steady 80 m.p.h., allowing me to regain 
sufficient courage to open my eyes and take a peek out of the window. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance the Pyramids loomed. Not many things in this life loom, but the 
Pyramids do. Their size almost defies description. Forget the Sears building or 
the Empire State or any proposed edifice from the office of Donald Trump. 
There's not a structure in the world that can touch them for sheer monumental 
grandeur. We are talking big. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the shadow of King Khufu's ego, your eye is incapable of 
encompassing the whole. You can't see the summit, you can't determine where the 
corners turn -- in fact, all you can really make out are the vast, 
two-ton-and-up blocks of ocher stone that terrace up like a giant's staircase. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not climbing up that," said mother. 
</P>
<P>
I pointed out the sign that told us, in 12 languages, including English, that 
she wasn't allowed to anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for that," she said. "Now I think I ought to sit down somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hoisting mother onto one of the lowest of the two-ton stones was more than I 
could handle, so we looked around for something smaller on which she could 
perch. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty feet away, across scorching, broken ground, was a man with a camel. He 
was grinning encouragingly in our direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I could sit on that," said mother. 
</P>
<P>
We picked our way over what remains of King Khufu's personal cemetery. Close 
up, the camel looked bigger than he had from 50 feet away and not nearly as 
friendly as his owner. 
</P>
<P>
Noting our apprehension, the man tugged on the halter. The camel groaned, 
buckled its knees and settled slowly onto its stomach. Mother shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want to sit on it after all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is OK. Quite safe. He very nice," said the man. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," said mother. "Well, then, perhaps I could just lean up against it?" 
</P>
<P>
She limped over to the camel and cautiously leaned against its flank. The camel 
muttered under its breath. 
</P>
<P>
"On top?" suggested the man. 
</P>
<P>
"No, thank you very much," said mother. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," said the man. "Maybe you too old for on top." He turned to me. "Now you 
take photo." 
</P>
<P>
I took a photograph of mother with the man and the camel and then suggested 
that, if she felt comfortable enough where she was, I would leave her for a 
quarter of an hour to visit Khufu's burial chamber deep in the heart of the 
Great Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she felt reasonably comfortable staying with the man and the 
camel and, besides, she had her cane if there was going to be any trouble, so 
not to worry, she would be just fine. I started to walk away. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey!" shouted the man. "You pay! You pay for photo! And take old lady with 
you." He gestured proudly at his camel. "He not for leaning on. He is Photo 
Opportunity!" 
</P>
<P>
I gave the man enough money to buy several more Photo Opportunities, found a 
medium-size rock for mother to sit on and left her in the blistering sunshine 
staring at the Sphinx's backside. 
</P>
<P>
A large, fierce-looking Egyptian stood by the entrance to the Pyramid. He 
shuffled forward as I approached and a beefy arm blocked my passage. 
</P>
<P>
"I am Guide," he announced. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," I said. "But, look, I don't really need a guide. I'm just going in 
and then coming out. If you see what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK," said Guide. "I guide in, I guide out. No problem." 
</P>
<P>
I followed Guide through the twisted, broken entrance and into the hot gloom of 
the Great Pyramid. A stone ramp, covered with slatted planks, led up at a steep 
angle. Guide, coughing and spitting like a bronchial sea lion, started up the 
incline. I followed. 
</P>
<P>
The ceiling was low. I was bent almost double, but my head still brushed the 
stonework above me. And the ceiling, unlike the rest of the passage, is stained 
a shiny black. It took me a few minutes to work out why; the stones have been 
brushed for decades by countless heads. The discoloration is caused by hair 
oil, ancient and modern. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the Great Pyramid is not a place for claustrophobics. The 
structure has stood for more than 5,000 years, but the sense of all those tons 
of rock, fitted together by the fallible hand of man and now hanging 
mortar-less over your head can play unpleasant games with your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
I got a feeling of relief when, halfway up, the corridor widened and the 
ceiling soared up. Perhaps, after all, the thing wouldn't fall on my head. 
Shortly after that, breathing heavily, you reach the burial chamber of King 
Khufu. 
</P>
<P>
Guide was very informative. 
</P>
<P>
"Walls," he announced. "Also, floor and roof. Burial chamber of King. Very 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
I nodded. It was, in a dull sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
Guide pointed to the only object in the room. "Red stone sarcophagus. Empty 
now. King not in it." 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the red stone sarcophagus. Guide was right. No sign of King. A gum 
wrapper and a crushed Coca Cola can, but no King. It seemed an awfully long way 
to come just to look at a bare stone room and a red horse trough. 
</P>
<P>
The treasures the chamber once held are long gone, stolen by the tomb robbers 
of the time. They would probably have taken the granite sarcophagus, too, if 
only they could have lifted it. 
</P>
<P>
Even back then a Catch-22 principle was in operation. Khufu and other Pharaohs 
like him built these vast structures to their greater glory, riddling them with 
intricate security systems to preserve their bodies and their treasures intact 
from marauders. 
</P>
<P>
But all the marauders saw, looking across the desert at these great, glistening 
things, were billboards shrieking the message: "Come and get it!" And get it 
they did, proving forever that no matter how big and strong you build your 
safe, there's always going to be some guy, somewhere, who can crack it. 
</P>
<P>
I found mother sitting on her rock. 
</P>
<P>
"All right?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather hot," she said. "And I've seen quite enough of the Sphinx, thank you 
very much. At least from this angle." 
</P>
<P>
The girl behind the counter back in the American Express office thought perhaps 
we might like to take a trip down the Nile to see the Valley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there any Pyramids there?" asked mother. 
</P>
<P>
"No. No Pyramids. Many tombs. Many statues. No Pyramids." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," said mother. "Perhaps another time. After the Pyramids, anything else 
would probably be an anticlimax." 
</P>
<P>
"Not to mention the Sphinx," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't," said mother.

MARCUS AURELIUS RIDES AGAIN AS HIS STATUE GETS A NEW HOME IN ROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After seven years of debate and two years' work to repair the damage caused by 
pollution, one of Rome's most recognizable landmarks, the 1,800-year-old 
equestrian statue of emperor-scholar Marcus Aurelius, returned to the 
Capitoline Hill last week, ready to go on display this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of being shown in the square specifically designed by Michelangelo 
to showcase the ancient bronze artwork, Marcus Aurelius' new home will be just 
inside the Capitoline Museum bordering the square. 
</P>
<P>
There, the two-ton bronze horse and rider, almost twice life size, will be 
encased by clear plastic in a climate-controlled environment. They will be on 
display throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The statue of the emperor, his right hand extended in a gesture of greeting or 
peace, symbolizes for many Rome at the zenith of its ancient civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Marcus Aurelius will remain in the museum or be returned to the 
pedestal in the center of the square remains the subject of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
Many Romans believe that, sooner or later, the original should return to its 
rightful place at the center of the square. Others favor replacing the statue 
permanently with an exact copy in the piazza and keeping the original in the 
museum, where it will be protected from smog, acid rain and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
To meet what is described as "the rapidly increasing demand for London 
telephone numbers," the city will divide into two area codes beginning May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dialing 1, the old area code, callers from May 6 on will have to 
dial either 71 or 81, depending on the area they wish to reach. 
</P>
<P>
The 71, or inner London, number will cover a region roughly eight miles in 
diameter, centering on Trafalgar Square and including the city's financial 
district, Knightsbridge and such tourist attractions as the Tower of London, 
Westminster Abbey, Madame Tussauds and the British Museum. The 81 number will 
apply to the rest of London, including Heathrow Airport, Wimbledon and 
Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
A call placed from the United States would follow this sequence: 011 (the 
international code), 44 (United Kingdom country code) 71 or 81 (the new London 
codes) and the seven-digit number. 
</P>
<P>
Within London, visitors will have to use the new codes when dialing from one 
section of the city to the other. When outside London but still within Britain, 
they would dial 071 or 081, respectively. For directory assistance, callers 
should dial 142 within any area of London and 192 for rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
By splitting into two area codes, London will double the amount of telephone 
numbers available to 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to Spain should be aware that a strike by sanitation workers at 
midweek had crippled Madrid's Barajas International Airport for more than nine 
days, forcing passengers to dodge heaps of rubbish to board strike-delayed 
flights, and airport restaurants and cafes to close. 
</P>
<P>
The strike affected flight operations, with arriving transatlantic flights 
rerouted to other airports for cleaning. The result was long delays. 
</P>
<P>
The stoppage by 18,000 staff members of Madrid's private cleaning companies 
also affected subway stations. At press time, talks on the workers' demands for 
a nine percent wage rise were stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury rail travel is being offered between Los Angeles and the San Francisco 
Bay Area on board the privately owned California Sun Express double-decker dome 
cars of Amtrak's Coast Starlight trains. 
</P>
<P>
The new service operates daily between Los Angeles and Oakland. Organized 
sightseeing tours with an overnight stay at San Luis Obispo and Morro Bay are 
also available. 
</P>
<P>
The upper level on each of the cars seats 64 passengers in upholstered seats 
with brass handrails, oak tables and plush carpeting. All passengers have seats 
in the full-length upper dome, with unobstructed 360-degree views. 
</P>
<P>
The lower level features a 22-seat dining salon with white linens, imported 
china, French stemware and silver flatware. All meals are prepared from scratch 
by a chef in the stainless steel electric kitchen. Brunch and dinner, featuring 
a California-style menu, are served on the train. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way fare between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo is $99.50; from Los 
Angeles to Oakland without a stopover, the one-way fare is $179. Two-day, 
one-night packages are available starting at $379.

Jim Whittaker, the first American to scale Mt. Everest, plans to mark Earth Day 
on April 22 with a return trek, after 27 years, to collect trash. He will be 
aided by Soviet and Chinese climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker is leading the three-nation, 30-person expedition on a "Peace Climb" 
to celebrate world peace and the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. They will 
recover discarded oxygen bottles and other debris left by other climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of mountaineers taking part in the climb will haul gear and food from 
lower camps to higher camps to support the summit team. They will stop on their 
way down to fill empty bags with trash left behind by earlier climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, who scaled 29,028-foot Mt. Everest in 1963, does not plan to try for 
the summit.

HER WORLD: WILD IDEAS ABOUT ADVENTURE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first answered the call of the wild, I was sure it would be a wrong 
number. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of long-distance hikes, with hot and heavy breathing, seemed vaguely 
obscene. Naturally, there would be dust and bugs. I was not keen to reach out 
and touch anything. 
</P>
<P>
That is why adventure travel has exceeded my expectations. I expected nothing 
but misery. 
</P>
<P>
My first exploration was sailing east of Bali to call at islands along the 
Indonesian archipelago. An early stop was Komodo, a hilly, arid knob that is 
home to the giant black lizard called the Komodo dragon. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's doctor said the hike would be rigorous and the temperature high. He 
asked passengers to check with him before going. I figured that he would listen 
to my tales of asthma and sunburn, and insist that I stay on board. 
</P>
<P>
"The exercise will be good for you," he said with a laugh. "Come back when 
you're 90 and we'll talk." 
</P>
<P>
I gasped a lot on that steep trail, but I did not stumble. For five hours I 
kept my eyes focused on the backs of the knees of a retired Caltech professor. 
When I slowed down in the rubble of a dry riverbed, he called over his 
shoulder: "Don't stop. It makes it tougher to get started again." 
</P>
<P>
When we finally reached a clearing at the top, I collapsed in the shade of a 
banyan tree and opened a sack lunch. But the view killed my appetite. A goat 
carcass had been skewered on a spit near the edge of the bush. 
</P>
<P>
Two Komodo dragons, each almost 10 feet long, soon came lumbering out. Golden 
tongues flashed from monstrous heads. They tore into their meal with relish. 
</P>
<P>
My photographer friends loved the action, even when a dragon charged our 
circle. A native pelted it with sticks and rocks until it veered away. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Komodo was the beginning of a healthy, rejuvenating trip. Long walks and 
coral swims were part of each day; lectures, laughs and sea turtles were part 
of moonlit nights. 
</P>
<P>
On island after island, as far as the Asmat of New Guinea, I met some of the 
kindest people I've ever known, certainly the kindest headhunters. 
</P>
<P>
Since that summer I have continued to find the outdoor world accommodating -- 
from the High Sierra trails of Yosemite to the sandy banks of the Colorado 
River. It may be soft adventure, if compared to scaling K-2, but it's hard 
enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lessons I've learned: 
</P>
<P>
Don't sit at the front of a rubber shore boat. In a choppy sea, that position 
gets the most splash. The boatman doesn't stand in the rear for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Exception: On a hot day of rafting through white water, the cold spray can be 
as welcome as a broken fire hydrant to kids in a sizzling city. 
</P>
<P>
Pack a rattail comb for hikes through cactus country. Balls of cholla cactus 
jump at the chance to ride on your desert boots. If you flick them off, they 
stick to your hand. Any comb will lift them away; a rattail gives a margin of 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Carry a small mirror in self-defense. The woods are full of motes. If one gets 
in your eye, it is maddening not to be able to see to remove it. A stranger's 
finger is not the same. Nor is a friend's. 
</P>
<P>
A mirror can be glued inside the crown of a hat or into a camera case. Clip-on 
mirrors can be attached to penlights or lip balms. 
</P>
<P>
Hard mints or chewing gum can help fight thirst. An apple is a classic 
quencher. 
</P>
<P>
For an August muleback trip I carried a canteen that fit into a large pocket or 
attached with Velcro to a belt. It had a built-in plastic straw that you could 
pull up with your teeth, leaving one hand for the reins. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you've tested the earth as a mattress and found it comfortable, take an 
inch-thick pad of foam rubber to put under a sleeping bag. You'll still be 
roughing it, but your case won't seem terminal. My week of camping out in the 
Grand Canyon would have been less grand without that cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the joy in adventure travel is the hand-in-hand exuberance of summer 
camp. Tensions fade as high-powered adults focus on birds or volcanoes. Members 
of gourmet food societies get caught comparing creamy peanut butter with 
chunky. 
</P>
<P>
Once, on a Mexican island near San Martin, I watched a male elephant seal haul 
his gleaming 7,000-pound body out of the sea and onto the beach. Round, firm 
females, weighing a ton apiece, rolled aside. 
</P>
<P>
I admired their grace as I finished another chocolate-chip cookie. Maybe, I 
mused in the noonday sun, just maybe, Charles Darwin was wrong. Maybe he meant 
survival of the fattest.

WHY NOT EASTERN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Greenberg takes a cheap shot at travel agents, accusing them of selling 
away from Eastern Airlines to earn higher commissions because of higher fares 
on other airlines. Given the operational and financial problems Eastern has 
experienced since filing for bankruptcy, isn't it more likely that the concern 
of the agents is for their clients' peace of mind and the financial soundness 
of their travel dollar?

United States and asked for low fares on Atlanta-Miami, Atlanta-New York City, 
New York City-Miami routes. I gave specific travel dates that would have 
qualified me for the lowest prices. Not one agent offered to sell me the 
Eastern fare. Only one agent mentioned Eastern, but refused to sell me that 
fare because of what she said were "liability" concerns, even when I offered to 
pay by credit card -- which would have protected the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not as a practice indulge in travel agent bashing. I believe it is in the 
best interests of reader travelers to use responsible travel agents, as well as 
to protect themselves from price gouging by airlines, travel scams and 
financial liability when acting in good faith.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: CATALINA OFFERS MODERATE DISCOUNTS FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mature travelers heading for Catalina Island will find discounts aplenty in 
Avalon, but there are also deals to be had simply in getting to the island. 
</P>
<P>
The best overall prices are given to senior groups of 20 or more, but these are 
usually for midweek travel and away from the peak June-to-mid-September season. 
</P>
<P>
The two major Catalina cruise lines, Catalina Express and Catalina Cruises, 
each offer year-round, senior citizen rates for those age 55 and over. 
</P>
<P>
The Catalina Express offers daily departures from Berth 95, the Catalina 
Terminal, in San Pedro, and another terminal next to the Queen Mary in Long 
Beach. Starting next month, the company also will offer sailings from King 
Harbor in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Express sailing from Long Beach makes the best time of any Catalina cruise 
line, usually just 60 minutes to Avalon. The senior rate is $28.50 round trip, 
compared to the regular $32 adult fare. There is free parking close to the 
terminal. From San Pedro, Catalina Express has a 90-minute crossing for $25.10 
compared to the regular $27.70 fare. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Cruise, meanwhile, departs daily from the Catalina Terminal in San 
Pedro and from Long Beach, but from the Catalina Landing at 330 Golden Shore 
Blvd., not next to the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Cruises uses larger vessels, carrying up to 700 passengers, and thus 
offers longer sailings at lower rates. From both terminals it's a bit less than 
two hours to Avalon. The round-trip, senior fare from either San Pedro or Long 
Beach is $22.80, a savings of $3.20 off the regular adult fare. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Catalina Passenger Service and its Catalina Flyer, which connects 
Newport Beach and Avalon in about 75 minutes on the big 500-passenger 
catamaran. The round-trip fare from Newport's Balboa Pavilion is $28. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the island, mature travelers age 55 and up get sightseeing discounts on 
a variety of land and water trips offered by the Santa Catalina Island Co. 
</P>
<P>
These include (with the regular adult fare in parentheses): Avalon Scenic Tour 
$3.50 ($4); 10-mile Skyline Drive $7.50 ($8.50); and popular Inland Motor Tour 
$12.75 ($15). There are other discounts for the Casino Walking Tour and Top of 
the Island Dinner Tour. 
</P>
<P>
From May through September, there are water trips such as Evening Flying Fish 
Boat Tour $4.50 ($5.25); or the two-hour Sunset Buffet Cruise or four-hour 
Twilight Dining Cruise to Two Harbors (which starts in mid-June) at $27 for 
seniors versus a $29.50 regular fare. There are more discounts on the shorter 
day or night Glass Bottom Boat trips, and the Coastal/Undersea Gardens Cruise 
to Seal Rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Senior discounts for accommodations are in short supply. Which is not 
surprising considering the limited number of rooms available to meet the 
regular tourist demand. Even the few larger spots that do have senior rates are 
usually limited to midweek stays away from the peak summer season. 
</P>
<P>
Those that do have year-round senior rates include the beach-front Pavilion 
Lodge with 72 rooms and the older, 100-room Atwater Hotel. Both are operated by 
the Santa Catalina Island Co., which also runs the Catalina Express and the 
sightseeing tours. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has ties with several other inns and offers special package 
plans with transportation, sightseeing tours and varying other features for 
one- to three-night stays in early summer and late fall. But these are not just 
for mature travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Other Avalon accommodations with senior rates include the Glenmore Plaza with 
40 rooms and the ocean-front Hotel Vista Del Mar with 15 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best buys for seniors are seldom advertised, as they are operated 
through senior clubs and organizations. They are either single day excursions 
or two-day coach and cruise tours. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street Tours in Torrance, one of the largest operators of such trips for 
senior groups, has two Catalina trips in its catalogue of 100 senior outings. 
Both are based on a senior group of about 40 persons and include coach 
transportation to and from the cruise terminal to the senior's starting point. 
</P>
<P>
A day's outing, including the sailing to Avalon and back, Glass Bottom Boat 
Cruise and Avalon Scenic Tour and free time for a meal and shopping, runs about 
$36 a person for the group most any midweek date all year. 
</P>
<P>
A two-day trip, staying overnight at the Pavilion Lodge, with a Glass Bottom 
Boat Trip and the half-day Inland Motor Tour of the Island, runs about $85 a 
person for the group. But the latter is only available midweek from October 
through May.

GHOSTS OF ISTHMUS PAST; 
</P>
<P>
CATALINA'S 'OTHER SIDE' HAS A COLORFUL HISTORY INVOLVING MAJOR WARS, MOVIE SETS 
AND A NOTORIOUS VISITOR: SIR FRANCIS DRAKE.

<P>
A world away from the teeming crowds of Avalon is the "Other Catalina," a 
narrow isthmus separating the mountainous eastern and western ends of the 
island, only half a mile across and barely 50 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
Known in recent years as Two Harbors, the Isthmus has a fascinating history 
whose protagonists include Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the discoverer of 
California; Sir Francis Drake; Abraham Lincoln, plus pirates, smugglers, land 
barons, bootleggers and, in more recent times, the great names of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Two Harbors, which lies six miles from the western tip of the 21-mile-long 
island, is a diverse and fascinating vacation locale for campers, backpackers, 
naturalists, divers and other water-sports enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Two Harbors also presents a startling contrast to Avalon, which has scores of 
hotels, shops and restaurants about 14 miles to the east. Two Harbors has only 
one of each, and the "hotel" has just 11 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon has miles of streets and sidewalks. Two Harbors has only dirt roads. 
Avalon has costly homes and condominiums covering its hillsides. Two Harbors' 
hillside inhabitants are buffalo, wild pigs, goats and deer. Avalon has golf. 
Two Harbors has horseshoe-pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Isthmus is much quieter than Avalon most months of the year, it, 
too, has its invasion of day-trippers during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
We prefer the winter months. On a recent weekend, the only other visitors we 
saw were a visiting horseshoe-pitching team and yachting couples unwilling to 
risk a return voyage to the mainland because of high winds and seas. 
</P>
<P>
The Isthmus has the appearance of a small village on a remote atoll, complete 
with coconut palms and a crescent of sandy beach. Only a 10-minute walk from 
the dock at Isthmus Cove, one enters primitive country -- now under the 
protection of the Catalina Conservancy -- that teems with native plants and 
wildlife, including bald eagles and species of fox and quail. 
</P>
<P>
But the best way to orient oneself to both the terrain and history of Two 
Harbors is to take the half a mile walk from Isthmus Cove, the village center, 
to Catalina Harbor on the opposite side of the Isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, you'll pass a small red schoolhouse where grades kindergarten 
through six are taught in a single room by a single teacher. 
</P>
<P>
However, be warned. Wherever you walk on the Isthmus when the pasturage is 
green, you are likely to encounter grazing buffalo, either in herds or small 
numbers, and it is wise to keep your distance. The buffalo have been known to 
charge humans who come too close or who appear to threaten their calves. 
</P>
<P>
But the islanders appear to have a live-and-let-live relationship with the 
animals. Even the schoolchildren walk past the herd as if its presence was 
nothing extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The forebears of the buffalo, which now number about 450 and 500, were brought 
to the island in 1924 for the filming of "The Vanishing American," one of the 
first of many classic motion pictures to be shot at the Isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of a gentle rise between the two harbors, one comes to a barracks 
that was built on orders of President Lincoln during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the coves and valleys on either side of the Isthmus were the 
center of intense (but never too successful) prospecting for gold, silver and 
galena (lead ore). Many of the 1,200 claim-holders were Southerners who made no 
secret of their support for the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, who said that he could not finance the Union cause without gold 
shipments from California, was said to be afraid that the pro-Secessionist 
miners might try to seize one of the ships carrying ingots from San Francisco 
when its passage south brought it near the island or into one of its coves. 
</P>
<P>
A barracks was built in January, 1864. An infantry company of 80 men and three 
officers took up station, and cannons were put in place on the high ground to 
defend the harbors. The troops, however, were withdrawn after less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the Isthmus became a training center for the Coast Guard. 
Many hundreds of recruits slept in the old barracks after spending their days 
learning seamanship aboard a flotilla of eight schooners and four small whaling 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
The original well from which the Union soldiers drew water still stands outside 
the building, which is now the headquarters of the Isthmus Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
The road then leads down to Catalina Harbor, which is known to be the safest 
anchorage on all of the Channel Islands. It has been a haven for mariners since 
its discovery by Cabrillo in 1542. 
</P>
<P>
One of Catalina's most authoritative historians -- Charles Frederick Holder -- 
believes that Drake spent the winter of 1579 in Catalina Harbor, overhauling 
the Golden Hind after plundering Spanish towns and ships on his way up the west 
coast of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt at all, however, that Catalina Harbor and other coves on the 
seaward side of the island have been favorite haunts of smugglers, pirates and 
bootleggers over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
But in the modern era, Catalina Harbor is best known as a location site for 
motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, today's visitor can wade into the shallows and then march ashore in 
the footsteps of Gregory Peck in the role of Douglas MacArthur, fulfilling his 
pledge to return to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other major films shot there include "Mutiny on the Bounty," "The 
Ten Commandments," "Treasure Island," "The Sea Hawk" and "The King of Kings." 
</P>
<P>
The sunken hulks of sailing ships left by the studios to rot in Catalina Harbor 
still lie on the bottom, and the skeletal remains of one -- the notorious 
Chinese junk Ning-Po, a former pirate ship -- are visible at low tide. Motion 
picture and television companies still use the location frequently. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to explore the Isthmus in an afternoon, but the greater 
adventure is to roam the back country and coastline. One of Two Harbors' 
greatest attractions for hikers is that most of the historic coves -- including 
Empire Cove, site of the Indians' sacrificial altar and Temple of the Sun -- 
are easily reachable from the road. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most dramatic walks, but only for the sturdiest of hikers, is to 
Emerald Bay, six miles to the west of the Isthmus on a generally uphill road. 
One can swim to a small island at the entrance to the bay through waters that 
actually are a transparent green. 
</P>
<P>
The only concessionaire at Two Harbors is Doug Bombard, a cordial entrepreneur 
in his early 60s. 
</P>
<P>
With his three sons and a daughter, Bombard operates the restaurant and bar; a 
large year-round campground at nearby Little Fisherman's Cove ($6 per person 
per night); guest cabins at Isthmus Cove ($37 per cabin per night, but 
available only in the off-season; during summer months they are occupied by 
seasonal employees brought over from the mainland); a general store; the 
Catalina Safari tour buses, and the Catalina Express, a fleet of cross-channel 
cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Two Harbors has to posh accommodations is the Banning House, a 
rambling summer cottage built in 1910 by the Banning family, then owners of the 
entire island. Most of its 11 rooms command an incredible view of the entire 
Isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
A young, congenial Londoner, Ian Tomlinson, is in charge. The rates, including 
a generous continental breakfast, are from $115 to $175 per night during the 
peak season, which starts May 24. Our off-season rate for a room with twin beds 
was $85. 
</P>
<P>
There is one magic number to call -- (213) 520-0303 -- for information and 
reservations for all of Two Harbors' services. Call the number the morning of 
your departure to be certain that sea conditions aren't keeping the cruisers in 
port.

REAL WILDERNESS PEOPLE DON'T WEAR WAFFLE-STOMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Stall, Bill Stall is a Times editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putting aside waffle-stompers for now, next Sunday's Earth Day has had at least 
one significant impact on the American wilderness since it was first observed 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When I started wandering the Sierra in the 1960s, non-ever-decomposable filter 
cigarette butts littered every trail. As an embarrassed smoker myself, I 
started pocketing them as I hiked along. Then I began carrying little plastic 
bags to hold the foul things. A hike of just a few hours would fill the bag. 
Sometimes it seemed I was doomed to trek behind a whole crew of Humphrey 
Bogarts. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a dramatic change. It's rare to find a discarded cigarette butt 
these days, even along the most popular Sierra trails. That's one small triumph 
for the wilderness, as well as for humankind. 
</P>
<P>
The wilderness did not become fashionable April 22, 1970. When I first started 
visiting the Sierra backcountry, some of the popular areas were already overrun 
and abused. The most heavily traveled regions, naturally, were those close to 
access roads, requiring little physical effort or determination to reach. 
</P>
<P>
But there was Stall's Law covering people, cigarette butts, orange peels, beer 
cans in streams, giant logs hauled across campfires and left barely singed, 
live trees denuded by hand axes or anything else: The opportunity for a 
pleasant wilderness experience increased in direct, accelerating proportion to 
the square of the distance to the nearest road. The farther from the road, the 
more likely wilderness really would be wilderness. And people who had made the 
effort to get that far were more likely to be real wilderness people who would 
treat the backcountry gently and with respect. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, only a few people wore boots with the lugged Vibram sole. Come 
across a Vibram track in the trail and chances were it belonged to some 
climbing friend or acquaintance, or a friend of a friend. Wilderness lovers did 
not wear badges of distinction on their sleeves. Their badge was that cluster 
of lugs and the bright little yellow Vibram brand label just under the instep. 
</P>
<P>
There were other trademarks, though. Real wilderness travelers always had a 
baggy down jacket and a parka -- what the mountaineers used to call an anarok 
-- usually in bright orange. This color, now found mostly on life jackets, was 
supposed to be visible in case of a search and rescue. If you wanted to be 
saved, you did not want to look like a rock. 
</P>
<P>
To be with it, you referred to your down jacket as a duvet, the French 
mountaineer's term. Serious wilderness people shunned the lowly but versatile 
poncho. Ponchos could be bought at Wards and were really no protection against 
sustained rain with their yawning gaps between snaps. A real mountain person, 
before the Gore-Tex revolution, had a cagoule, which literally was "monk's 
cloak" and actually was a long anarok. Unlike the well-ventilated poncho, this 
all-embracing waterproof garment created an instant sauna under any amount of 
exertion. Rarely did my friends and I ever get caught out overnight up among 
the peaks, but just in case, we had to have a cagoule for the bivouac. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-Earth Day people like me finally became too embarrassed to wear army boots 
into the wilderness and got real hiking footwear, usually from REI in Seattle 
by mail order. The old eight-pound pup tent (20 pounds wet) gave way to the new 
nylon A-frames made by outfits like Sierra Design and North Face. So, too, with 
the lumpy old olive-drab, duck-feather surplus bag. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was going into the wilderness with everything looking too new. Some 
rumpled veteran passing on the trail would grunt a friendly hello, but you knew 
the stranger was sneering inwardly at this tenderfoot with all that new-fangled 
gear. You had to give the new equipment that broken-in look as soon as 
possible. Some of my friends were even known to rub dirt and pebbles on a new 
pack to give it a healthy used look. 
</P>
<P>
But then came Woodstock, Earth Day and all that ecological awareness. Almost 
overnight, everyone was wearing boots with Vibram soles, some that never 
touched granite or good trail dirt outside of Westwood or Berkeley. Worse yet, 
they called them "waffle-stompers." Why not, at least, gaufre le bruit lourd? 
</P>
<P>
College campuses blossomed into a riot of down jackets. The Sierra Design 60/40 
Mountain Parka became a trademark of not just the wilderness but of antiwar 
rallies and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
My generation got waffle-stomped. For a while, we let our stuff get as worn and 
tattered as possible so anyone could see at a glance that we were not 
latter-day Sierra Nevadans. We slung our Perlon ropes and slings of climbing 
hardware casually over shoulders, whether we were going climbing or not. We 
abandoned international orange for natural colors that blended into the 
mountains -- greens, blues, tans. Before long, their stuff was just as 
tattered. Their hair and beards were longer. Their parkas just as tan, or even 
rust. They took up rock climbing and did better at it. They had become us and 
there were too many of us. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973 the U.S. Forest Service began restricting access to the wilderness for 
the first time, setting quotas during the summer season on the Mt. Whitney 
trail. Thousands apply yearly for trail passes; many have to settle for an 
alternate trail or try again next year. The Whitney Trail corridor, if not 
recovered, at least is being protected from heavier damage. There are few 
complaints, says Charlie Robinson, a ranger at Lone Pine. 
</P>
<P>
"The people believe in the system," he added, but noted that thoughtless 
dayhikers are still prone to leave behind bags of unused charcoal briquettes 
after picnics at Lone Pine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Even the waffle-stomper is out of style these days with wilderness purists, who 
argue that the heavy lugs unnecessarily damage trails and meadows. Fashionable 
backpacking footwear now is more like a running shoe, with a thin, unlugged 
sole. I now have not one, but two pairs of these shoes. And a new down jacket 
from Patagonia, the most haute of American outdoors haute couture. It's blue. 
It is also obviously new, but after it gets mussed up a bit and perhaps has a 
couple tears mended with duct tape, it'll be just fine.

STATE, LOCAL POLITICS NO MATCH FOR URBAN CRISIS OF CRIME AND DRUGS;

GOVERNMENT: THE REAGAN LEGACY IS TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF DEALING WITH THE 
COUNTRY'S MOST VEXING PROBLEMS TO THOSE LEAST CAPABLE OF MANAGING THEM.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt concluded that in order to advance his 
New Deal program he would have to purge recalcitrant Southern senators from the 
Democratic Party. South Carolina's Ellison Durant Smith, standing for his sixth 
term, was at the top of his list. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, given the South's one-party politics, "Cotton Ed" and the 
other Dixiecrats handily survived by appealing to racism, states' rights and 
economic self-interest. It is, however, unsettling, after half a century of 
sweeping economic, social and demographic changes, to see Cotton Ed's platform 
endorsed, or at least accepted, by a considerable majority of Americans in 
three successive presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
Too many Americans, for example, believe that volunteer agencies can provide 
points of light sufficient to relieve the gloom of the inner cities. And that a 
rising tide of middle-class affluence will automatically lift a third 
generation of juvenile delinquents, socially incapacitated by the absence of 
effective family and community support. George Bush used to call that voodoo 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, confined by the fiscal straitjacket left by President Ronald Reagan's 
budget deficits and acutely aware of election returns, is in no position to 
restore curtailed social programs or devise new ones. The Supreme Court, 
meanwhile, is only a heartbeat away from the anti-affirmative-action majority 
Reagan sought and Bush is likely to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the burden of dealing with the crime-ridden urban slums has been 
transferred to state and local governments -- and every lesson to be drawn from 
history demonstrates that they have neither the will nor the capacity to handle 
social problems rooted in poverty compounded by race and class. In fact, as the 
current gubernatorial campaign in California bears witness, it is no longer 
possible even to get these pressing matters on the political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Popular concern over the rising crime rate enabled the spin doctors who shaped 
the Republican presidential campaigns to use a largely rhetorical war on drugs 
to offset the emotional appeal the war on poverty once had. In California, the 
formula has made Gov. George Deukmejian, a natural-born apostle of law and 
order, imperviously popular. As did Bush, he accompanied his promise to beef up 
the criminal justice system with a pledge not to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
This has worked so well that the two leading Democratic candidates have been 
reduced to trying to outdo each other with televised pledges to send more 
prisoners to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that such experienced public officials as Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein -- or, for that 
matter, the presumptive Republican nominee, Sen. Pete Wilson -- do not 
recognize that this "off-with-their-heads" approach is no more than an 
expedient diversion from the real problems posed by crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But politicians seem unable to resist taking a firm stand on issues where there 
is no visible opposition. The last vestige of popular support for drug use 
disappeared with the hippies. No one has any sympathy for the crack dealers 
whose traffic promotes violent crime. Nor does anyone doubt that effective 
policing is required to make city streets safer to walk. These are political 
givens. But so should be the evident futility of relying on the criminal 
justice system to deal with crime after the fact, while curtailing the social 
programs that constitute the only effective preventive. 
</P>
<P>
There is abundant evidence that this one-sided approach is destroying the 
effectiveness of the measures central to the purported war on crime. In 
California, after reinstatement of the death sentence and passage of laws 
requiring more severe penalties for lesser crimes, statistics compiled by the 
State Bar portray a judicial system near the verge of collapse: 
</P>
<P>
From 1981 to 1988, drug cases in Los Angeles more than doubled; last year the 
violent crime rate rose by 12%; between 1978 and 1986, statewide criminal-case 
filings rose by 114%; there are now about 90,000 inmates in California prisons, 
up from 25,000 in 1980; nearly two-thirds of the prisoners released on parole 
in 1986 were back in prison within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, and in its scattershot fashion, television, flesh out these figures 
with reports of random violence outside the ghettoes, where juvenile street 
gangs funded by drug money have taken over neighborhoods. On the Op-Ed pages, 
judges, law-enforcement officials, sociologists, clergymen and inner-city 
activists deplore the failure to provide education, medical treatment and 
increased economic opportunity that could succor those struggling to free 
themselves from the stultifying ghetto environment. 
</P>
<P>
As the human toll from narcotics addiction increases, so does the violent crime 
associated with the lucrative drug market. This has reached the point where 
such bellwether free-market conservatives as Milton Friedman and William F. 
Buckley advocate drug legalization. Unwilling to accept government 
responsibility for dealing with the demand side of the market, they recognize 
the futility of trying to control the supply side and propose that the state 
absorb the profits -- an exercise in social Darwinism that would write off 
those who are already hooked, and those who might be if drugs became cheaper 
and even more available. 
</P>
<P>
But these voices have no political constituency. So far, no serious candidate 
has emerged in the mid-term elections of any state pledged to support effective 
alternatives to the prevailing approach to drugs and crime, and the increased 
revenues that would be required to pay for them. This points up the even more 
serious problem posed by the progressive paralysis of our vaunted political 
process.

In your editorial the gratitude expressed by the writer to Poland's Prime 
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki could be compared to the stroking of a child and 
whipping him, all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The acknowledgement of the noble gesture of making available Polish airline LOT 
for emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel is mixed in the same sentences with all 
alleged past wrongs of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Solidarity movement Poland used to get only bad press in writings 
about Polish-Jewish relations. Now it is changing. A noble act of the Polish 
government is used as a springboard for bringing up and ventilating the old and 
unjustified charges.

For 10 years I have watched in frustration as the Republicans (for the most

none of the candidates are worthy of my vote.

STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So now the Pentagon is telling us that the B-2 'Stealth Bomber' may cost as 
much as $1.9 billion each if production is slowed down (Part A, April 4). The 
private military contractors and their cohorts in the Pentagon have grown lazy, 
fat and happy from 10 years of taxpayer-subsidized welfare for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that under the Reagan-Bush presidencies the military budget has 
more than doubled while monies for social, welfare, education and public 
infrastructure programs have been slashed. The result: a grossly inefficient 
military-industrial complex, a huge federal deficit, an uneducated, complacent 
public, crumbling roads and an upsurge in government sleaze and corporate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
It is long overdue that these contractors and their government co-conspirators 
were held accountable for their crimes against the people. The last thing we 
need is another wasteful, inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.

I cannot remember reading such an outstanding analysis before -- and one which

DIAMOND BAR GIRDS FOR CITYHOOD BIRTHDAY BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal and Karlene Edwards notice more traffic patrol cars in their Diamond Bar 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Gwen Henry points to stricter building codes that keep tract 
homes spaced farther apart. 
</P>
<P>
The Gebani family, owner of the only Middle Eastern meat market in the city, no 
longer has to use a Pomona mailing address, which the county required before 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
And City Manager Robert Van Nort boasts a balanced budget with a hefty surplus, 
to be used to beef up law enforcement and start drug-awareness programs in the 
upscale bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
The fruits of cityhood, however, aren't as noticeable for Mark Gracza, who 
marked Diamond Bar's one-year anniversary by voting to replace two City Council 
members running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"They really haven't done anything outstanding," the 33-year-old pharmacist 
said, after emerging from a polling booth in a north Diamond Bar fire station. 
"They had an opportunity to make an impact and really didn't." 
</P>
<P>
And cityhood still doesn't sit well with two longtime opponents of 
incorporation, Frank Dursa and Al Rumpilla. The two retired men believe that 
eventually city officials will levy assessment fees on homeowners to pay for 
city services, which they say are not markedly improved. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy with the county," Dursa said. "They came and swept our 
streets. I had no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 19% of Diamond Bar voters who cast ballots last week apparently 
like the way things are. John Forbing and Gary Werner, the only incumbents 
running, got four more years in office. Jay Kim was elected to a third council 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are wrinkles to be ironed out as Los Angeles County's newest city 
gears up for its first birthday bash this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar is still waiting for Gov. George Deukmejian to sign a bill that 
would give the city $1.2 million in property tax revenues. Another bill that 
would redraw postal boundaries to conform with the city limits, so that some 
homes and businesses in Diamond Bar won't have Walnut mailing addresses, is 
making its way through congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
A barricade blocking traffic on Grand Avenue from San Bernardino County will be 
removed later this year, bringing even more cars to Diamond Bar streets. New 
roads need to be built and traffic signals installed. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, incorporation is being hailed as a success by those who 
fought for it. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has accomplished in 10 months what other cities in the San Gabriel 
Valley would be envious to accomplish in a decade," Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Phyllis Papen rattles off a list of accomplishments that, she said, 
topped anything the county did. Those include increased traffic patrols by the 
Sheriff's Department, tighter zoning controls and parks improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say, 'I don't see a lot of changes,' " she said. "There have been 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
The differences are subtle. Although cityhood proponents last year campaigned 
heavily on a slow-growth platform, most of the 8,000 acres of rolling hills are 
already covered with homes and retail strips. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of what's left has been subdivided and is continuing to attract 
new residents. Diamond Bar's population is climbing toward 70,000, making it 
one of Southern California's fastest-growing communities. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the challenge comes in trying to attract more quality development, a 
buzzword for candidates in this year's election. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not have country living in town any more but what we have now is a 
dynamic Diamond Bar," Forbing said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar has had some disappointments and embarrassments since 
incorporation. First, there was the violation of the Brown Act, California's 
open meetings law. The San Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune sued Diamond Bar after 
a reporter was asked to leave a meeting during which council members-elect 
chose a mayor and mayor pro tem and hired an interim city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the incorporation election in March, 1989, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge slapped the City Council-elect with an injunction 
prohibiting meetings behind closed doors. The court ruling surprised city 
officials, who thought they were exempt from the law until they were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a few months after incorporation, Diamond Bar officials learned that 
three council members were not guaranteed two-year terms, as originally 
expected. Because Diamond Bar's incorporation election was in March, 1989, 
state law required a municipal election in April, 1990, even if that meant 
shortening the terms of council members. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they heard the bad news, city officials turned to the county for 
help in postponing the election, but to no avail. Then, they lobbied Republican 
Assemblyman Frank Hill, who promised to look into legislation but later 
abandoned the effort after being criticized by several council members. 
</P>
<P>
But Diamond Bar faced a more serious problem: The loss of $1.2 million in 
property tax revenue that the city couldn't receive because it had incorporated 
too late. Again, city officials first sought assistance from the county, and 
were turned down. And again, they turned to Hill, who this time proposed a bill 
that would turn over the tax money to Diamond Bar. The bill passed both houses 
of the Legislature on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to conservative budgeting, Diamond Bar has a $750,000 surplus this year. 
Without the property tax money, the narcotics enforcement program and hiring 
more city employees might have to be postponed until next year, Van Nort said. 
</P>
<P>
Any chronicle of Diamond Bar's trials and tribulations would have to set aside 
a whole section for Hill, who has remained popular in a heavily Republican 
district despite being one of five elected officials targeted in an FBI 
investigation into alleged political corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hill soundly defeated Democrat Janice Graham to become state 
senator in the 31st District. He will be sworn in Monday, filling the seat 
vacated by the resignation of William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). 
</P>
<P>
For the majority of residents who have stayed out of city politics, though, 
there are other, more tangible signs of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Chavez worries about the barricade stretching across Grand Avenue, just 
a mile down the street from her apartment. More specifically, she worries about 
the cars and trucks from the rapidly growing San Bernardino County community of

chain-link fence and wooden barriers will be lifted as part of an agreement

For Chavez, that might mean an even longer wait at the intersection of Diamond 
Bar Boulevard and Grand, where her car engine putters for as long as 10 minutes 
to make a left turn to the grocery store. "Between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. I just 
don't go out there anymore," she said. "I make early appointments with the 
doctor."

GROUP SEEKS BONE MARROW DONORS TO SAVE 23 LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As many as 23 Ventura County residents with life-threatening blood diseases are 
in need of bone marrow transplants, said the head of the county branch of 
Life-Savers Foundation of America. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Life-Savers branches nationwide, the group is stepping up efforts to 
find compatible matches for the residents whose lives may be saved by a 
transplant if donor matches can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Lynnette Chandler, who runs the county's Life-Savers branch from her Camarillo 
apartment, said many patients and their families prefer to keep their search 
private because of the burden of coping with illness. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as Tim Steinmetz of Thousand Oaks, have turned to the public 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
Steinmetz worked as a mechanic until two days before his 25th birthday in 
March, 1989. Then, after a trip to the emergency room for what seemed to be a 
severe backache, he learned that he had acute lymphatic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
After chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Steinmetz's leukemia went into 
remission for nine months, but the disease eventually returned. In February, 
doctors at the City of Hope in Duarte told Steinmetz, now 26, that he needs a 
bone marrow transplant to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
After unsuccessfully seeking a bone marrow match among family members, 
Steinmetz's family and friends, joining an increasing number of patients 
seeking donors nationwide, are knocking on doors, handing out flyers and 
seeking help from the public to find a donor match. 
</P>
<P>
"They all enjoy it," Steinmetz said, "but I think it's a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
A committee made up of Steinmetz's family and friends is holding a series of 
fund-raisers to help pay for the blood tests, which cost $75 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Steinmetz said, his appeal will help increase the number of 
prospective donors in a nationwide blood marrow registry, perhaps eventually 
finding a match for him or for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
But the first step is to "educate the public about the process, Steinmetz said. 
"It's not a big deal, it doesn't involve surgery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow donors must be in good health and between the ages of 18 and 61. 
The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. About 3% to 5% of the 
body's marrow is extracted from the hipbone through a non-surgical procedure. 
The procedure usually requires an overnight hospital stay, and the donor is 
able to resume normal activities within a day. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Nelson, a member of Steinmetz's fund-raising committee, said the group 
has several fund-raisers scheduled through May to pay for donors for Steinmetz. 
The list of events includes an effort by 2-for-1 Photo Shop on Avenida de los 
Arboles in Thousand Oaks, which will donate $2 per roll of film developed on 
Monday and Tuesday; a May 5 swap meet at the Albertson's market at 1736 E. 
Avenida de las Arboles; and a concert at the Newbury Park Holiday Inn on May 6. 
And April 22, blood tests will be held for Steinmetz from noon to 5 p.m. at the 
Holiday Inn in Newbury Park. Although his family is seeking to raise enough to 
pay for everyone who shows up for testing, those who can are urged to pay for 
their own tests. 
</P>
<P>
The Steinmetz family is working with Life-Savers Foundation of America, a 
Covina-based nonprofit group that serves as the recruiting arm of the National 
Marrow Donor Program, a national registry for bone marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 100,000 donors are registered, Life-Savers spokeswoman Susan 
Rafkin said about 250,000 donors must be registered before a bone marrow match 
can be found for everyone who needs one. 
</P>
<P>
For Steinmetz, who travels to the City of Hope several times a week for 
chemotherapy, time is a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I need something to happen real quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Ventura County residents with life-threatening illnesses have worked 
with Life-Savers in seeking bone marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Chandler, 10, the daughter of Life-Savers branch head Lynnette Chandler, 
was 6 years old and living in Ft. Worth when her aplastic anemia was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
To be closer to the advanced medical care available in Southern California, 
Chandler, 41, moved with her daughter to Camarillo 3 1/2 years ago and founded 
another group, Children for Tomorrow, in an effort to find marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Amanda has never been hospitalized for her illness, she still needs a 
bone marrow transplant to prolong her life, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler is an unemployed waitress who volunteers her time and has given over 
most of her two-bedroom Camarillo apartment to recruiting donors and raising 
dollars for Life-Savers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking a donor for Amanda, whose photograph adorns posters 
throughout the county advertising for blood donors, Chandler speaks to 
community groups and helps organize fund-raisers to pay for blood tests for 
prospective donors. 
</P>
<P>
"People call every day wanting to register or to see what they can do to help," 
Chandler said. "I go out and talk to service clubs, hold bake sales, speak to 
community groups. . . . I'm going after anybody and everybody that can help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The family of Thousand Oaks High School sophomore Dean Schmitt, 15, who has 
also worked with Life-Savers, is trying a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, a competitive swimmer who was found to have leukemia in May, is now in 
remission but is suffering from complications, said his father, Ralph Schmitt. 
</P>
<P>
After testing about 200 people -- including relatives and others -- to find a 
donor, the family has gone back into family history, researching tissue types 
and tracing family genealogy to narrow the search because of Dean's unusual 
tissue type, Ralph Schmitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the odds were about one in a million instead of one in 20,000" 
to find a donor, Schmitt said. "So we're looking at my family background 
because I have an unusual tissue type that makes the match hard to find. . . . 
It's kind of a trial-and-error-type game." 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt said family members are encouraged that they will soon find a match for 
Dean. 
</P>
<P>
What would make the search easier for all those who need donors, medical 
officials say, is if more potential donors come forward to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll get to the point one day where virtually everyone can find a 
match," said Charles Mathews, a spokesman for the City of Hope in Duarte, which 
expects to perform about 100 bone marrow transplants this year. 
</P>
<P>
Steinmetz's family said they hope he is among those who find successful 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Beverly Steinmetz, Tim's mother, "regardless of what happens, we're 
going to continue. Too many young people are dying every day needlessly because 
they need a transplant. Whatever happens, we're going to continue to work with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Steinmetz said he believes that if people are educated about the need and 
the simplicity of the blood-testing and donating procedure, more donors will 
come forward. 
</P>
<P>
"People have just got to be educated," Steinmetz said. "Then they'll save 
somebody's life." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County residents who wish to become donors may call Life-Savers at 
1-800-950-1050 or the National Marrow Donor Program at 1-800-654-1247. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo does blood tests. 
Hospital spokeswoman Carol Keochekian said the hospital donates staff time to 
draw blood samples, which are sent to a laboratory for testing. 
</P>
<P>
People interested in arranging for a blood test at Pleasant Valley Hospital 
should call Chandler at 987-6935.

STARVING BEES TO FEED FAR FROM HOME

<P>
When beekeeper Red Bennett looks out at Ventura County's parched hillsides, he 
sees the death of his colonies written on the missing wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Four years of below-average rainfall have wiped out native plants that provide 
nectar to bees, said Bennett, who keeps 1,500 hives and sells honey at a stand 
in Piru. This year, more than any other, Bennett and others in the apiary 
industry are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The extended drought is really hurting us," Bennett said. Without the 
wildflowers, the bees "could quite literally starve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Decimated by parasites and weakened by pesticides, the swarms will soon be 
moved out of state by the beekeepers in a desperate attempt to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
After the citrus and avocado bloom ends, bee colonies that normally feed in 
Ventura County will be shipped north in transport trucks to the San Joaquin 
Valley and the Midwest. They will return in the fall as eucalyptus trees come 
into bloom. 
</P>
<P>
But even that may not be enough to keep the bees alive year-round. Bennett and 
other apiary owners have begun supplementing the bees' diets with foods that 
the bees cannot gather for themselves when they come home to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to feed our bees large amounts of syrup. We've also had to provide 
the bees with pollen substitutes just to keep them alive through the winter," 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The drought has already cut into the beekeepers' profits by reducing the 
production of sage honey. And as summer progresses, beekeepers are unsure if 
there will be a sufficient quantity of other varieties, such as citrus, avocado 
and eucalyptus, to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Moisture-starved native plants have become more scarce each year. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he is seeing fewer native wildflowers, such as California wild 
buckwheat, rabbit brush and blue curl, which supply the precious nectar for 
honeybees. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have less wildflowers than we did last year, and less sage bloom," 
said Ron Basset, a ranger in the Ojai district of the Los Padres National 
Forest. "We're seeing in the vegetation stress from lack of moisture." 
</P>
<P>
Bees are responsible for the pollination of between 60% to 70% of the crops 
grown in California, from avocado and citrus and row crops in Ventura County, 
to cotton and alfalfa cultivated in irrigated soil in the San Joaquin Valley, 
said Don Strachan, president of the California State Beekeepers Assn., which 
represents about 600 commercial beekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
To make up for the loss in nectar from sage and wildflowers, beekeepers are 
offering bee pollination services to farmers at $30 a hive. But the fees will 
barely make up for the lost honey production, beekeepers say. 
</P>
<P>
Apiary owners say the drought is one of the primary reasons that Ventura 
County's honey and beeswax industry has been so unstable in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Beekeepers produced more honey and beeswax in 1989 than they did 10 years ago, 
but their total income has declined, according to Ventura County Agricultural 
Commission reports. 
</P>
<P>
While costs of transporting and maintaining beehives have risen during the past 
decade, the price of honey has remained relatively stable, about 55 cents a 
pound. The dollar value of honey and beeswax produced in the county declined to 
less than $875,000 last year after peaking at $1.3 million in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But Agricultural Commission biologist Ann McClure said that gauging the 
importance of bees by the dollar value of their products is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to come up with a figure for the value of pollination," McClure 
said. Bees are "important to all of agriculture because they pollinate, whether 
the beekeepers get paid for it or not. It's still a valuable service that they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 600,000 registered bee colonies around the state, or about 
24 million bees kept commercially for honey and wax, said Len Foote, chief of 
the control and eradication branch of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Two pests, the tracheal mite and the varroa mite, have become the two most 
dangerous enemies to bees, Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial operations statewide have been hurt by the combination of the 
drought, pests and bee boycotts, an industry official said. 
</P>
<P>
"I call honeybees the backbone of agriculture," Strachan said. "And it's being 
strained right now." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of beekeeping are growing grimmer each year, Strachan said. 
</P>
<P>
Beekeepers see a fifth of their colonies die off each year because of disease 
and pesticides, Strachan said. And the increasing cost of transporting bees 
around the country to feed them and make honey is cutting into profits, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
When beekeepers truck their bees hundreds of miles away to pollinate groves and 
farms in the San Joaquin Valley, the Dakotas and Minnesota, they pay a price 
for feeding their bees in out-of-state fields. 
</P>
<P>
At $10 per hive for a round-trip journey, many commercial beekeepers are 
beginning to take their chances in fields closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
Don Schram, who heads the Ventura County Beekeepers Assn., said he will send 
his bees to cotton and alfalfa fields in Kettleman City in the San Joaquin 
Valley during the summer, instead of trucking them out of state. 
</P>
<P>
However, cotton and alfalfa fields in the San Joaquin Valley are heavily 
sprayed with pesticides, and it is dangerous to keep colonies in those fields 
too long, Schram said. 
</P>
<P>
Schram, 50, started keeping bees as a hobby in 1970 and has seen his colonies 
grow to 2,000 hives. Five years ago, half of them began to die off, he says, 
because of pesticides and pests. He now owns about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Schram is in a better position than most because he sells his honey through 
the Sioux Honey Assn., a marketing cooperative based in Anaheim. Most of the 
other dozen beekeepers in Ventura County are not so lucky and will have to make 
it on their own, Schram said.

LEADERS PROTEST MENTAL HEALTH CENTER EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eastern San Fernando Valley community and church leaders spoke out Saturday 
against plans to almost double the capacity of a residential mental health 
facility in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we've already been inundated with this type of facility," said Fred 
Taylor, president of Focus '90, an organization that is working with the 
Ministers Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley to improve the area's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
"This area has become a slum, a dumping ground," said the Rev. James Wade, 
pastor of the Universal Church of the Valley in Pacoima. Wade told the group of 
20 civic leaders who attended the meeting that government officials have tried 
to locate dumps, mental institutions and prisons in the working-class suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the Foothill Health and Rehabilitation Center at 12260 Foothill 
Blvd. are proposing to expand the center from 220 to 420 beds. David Weiss, the 
head of the center, was invited to Saturday's meeting to discuss his plans, but 
did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss could not be reached for comment, but Katherine Barger, an aide to Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said Weiss told her he couldn't come 
to a meeting on a Saturday because of his religion. He is Jewish and it was his 
Sabbath. However, he does want to work with the community, Barger said. She 
offered to help set up another meeting between Weiss and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he has identified more than 15 facilities that provide residential 
care for the mentally ill in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more," he said. "They're putting them here because they don't want 
them in Encino or Woodland Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said residents already have problems with people who live at the 
rehabilitation center. "These people come and go as they please," he said. 
"These people are not being treated. They're just being housed." 
</P>
<P>
He and others at the meeting said that center residents loiter, sit and drink 
liquor on curbs, fall asleep on homeowners' lawns and often beg for money from 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"Our women are afraid to go to church at night," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
More than one speaker compared plans to expand the center to last year's 
ill-fated attempt by the nonprofit Phoenix House to establish a 210-bed 
drug-treatment center in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is another Phoenix House," said Bill McMillan, president of 
the Hansen Hills Homeowners Assn. "We fought Phoenix House and won. And we'll 
fight this." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House abandoned plans for the drug treatment center because of 
opposition from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said research 
into city files showed that a permit for the expansion was granted to the 
rehabilitation center in 1987. However, the expansion was not begun and the 
permit expired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said he would send a letter Monday asking that the Los Angeles city 
Planning Department inform Weiss that he must reapply for the permit. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, they will have to hold new public hearings on the expansion," he said. 
"We must fight this."

WOMEN FACE SPECIAL HARDSHIP: NO PLACE TO SPEND THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It was winter in Wilmington, and the waterfront was sour with the smell of 
brine and crude oil. A woman leaned against the chipped blue wall of a 
$13-a-night hotel, three dollars short of the price for a room. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, she mused, puffing on a Camel, she was a tariff clerk at Los 
Angeles International Airport with an apartment and steady pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I got evicted and laid off in the same week," she said, and her luck has 
been downhill ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Now she is a regular among those who sleep in junkyards and under derricks on 
this rusty edge of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
She is also among the most neglected of the hundreds of homeless men and women 
who wander the region's streets. 
</P>
<P>
According to local advocates for the homeless, there is only one shelter in the 
South Bay for women who are living alone on the streets, and that is a drop-in 
center in Wilmington that is open only during the day. Unless they are eligible 
for a specific program -- unless they are mentally ill, for example, or are 
battered wives or have children living with them on the streets or are actively 
trying to kick an addiction -- homeless women in the South Bay have no place to 
go at night. 
</P>
<P>
For the woman leaning against the hotel wall, who fits none of those 
categories, the only bed was a broken-down car parked near a convalescent home. 
It wasn't much, she conceded, but it was better than the castoff couch in the 
vacant lot where she had slept the month before. 
</P>
<P>
No one can say exactly how many people are homeless in the South Bay. Even 
countywide estimates have varied enormously, ranging from as low as 3,000 for 
all of Los Angeles County to as high as 50,000 or more. The first intensive 
effort to make a local head count of the homeless is being done this year as 
part of the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, educated guesses. United Way, for example, estimated in 
1986 that 35,000 people were living on the streets of Los Angeles County, and 
2,450 of them -- 7% -- were in the South Bay and Long Beach areas. The study 
also concluded that in the Los Angeles suburbs overall, the biggest gaps in 
service were for homeless women and homeless families, most of which are headed 
by women. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fenner of Crossroads, a Redondo Beach program for the homeless mentally 
ill that operates outreach programs throughout the South Bay, estimated that a 
third of the area's homeless are women. 
</P>
<P>
And in Wilmington, Jim Morrow, who launched the drop-in center on North Marine 
Avenue 16 months ago, said 65 to 70 single street women have come in since the 
center opened. 
</P>
<P>
"There are virtually no services for single (homeless) women in the South Bay 
area," said Morrow. He came up with the idea for the drop-in center in the 
course of his work as a drug and alcohol abuse counselor in Wilmington for 
Behavioral Health Services, a county-funded substance abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't start out as a women's center," Morrow said one recent afternoon in 
his small, spare headquarters in the heart of the waterfront. Initially, he 
said, his mission was to counsel the drug addicts and alcoholics, most of them 
men, who wandered among the dockside bars. 
</P>
<P>
"But during the day, I'd walk, and around the (dockworkers') union halls, I'd 
always see eight or nine women standing around," Morrow said. "Then I started 
driving, and at night, around Anaheim and the Pacific Coast Highway, there were 
more of them, working the street. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in really bad shape -- some seemed almost to be hallucinating," he 
said. Through his work with the Harbor Coalition of Food and Shelter Providers, 
a local advocacy group for the homeless, Morrow got donations of clean shoes, 
clothes and underwear and boxes of food, and eventually expanded his counseling 
program to include the drop-in center. 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Morrow and his team of counselors 
and local volunteers offer the women of the waterfront a place to shower, 
change clothes, get a free meal and, if they're ready, seek help and a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
What the women tend not to get -- from society, at least -- is compassion, 
Morrow said. Nearly all of the women who live in the streets near the center 
are addicted to some sort of drug, typically crack, he said. Most support their 
habits by either dealing or by selling themselves to dockworkers and passers-by 
for $10 or $20 a time. Few have managed to retain the mainstream social skills 
that would make it easy for them to return to the working world. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not the usual, sympathetic picture of the poor homeless person," 
Morrow said. "The world doesn't have much empathy for a chronically homeless 
prostitute." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, said Betsy Barnhart of the Harbor Coalition, "regardless of their 
problems, they're human beings who need love and attention. If you're all by 
yourself out there, it's pretty scary. Of course, drugs have aggravated the 
problem. But for some of these women, drugs are part of their survival 
mechanism. I don't know what I'd do, if it were me out there." 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of the women who filter in and out of Morrow's center are 
testimony to the danger and despair inherent in homelessness. In January, for 
instance, counselor Barbara Mayer said, she arrived at the center to find one 
of the regulars already standing at the door. The woman was agitated. Her 
friend, with whom she had been living in a graffiti-covered garage nearby, had 
miscarried during the night. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer rushed to the garage and found a woman huddled in a dark corner of the 
concrete room. Weak and filthy, she was hemorrhaging on a bed of oily rags. 
Mayer bundled the woman into her car and off to the emergency room at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Last autumn, Mayer said, she witnessed another unforgettable scene. Each 
morning, a woman had been bringing her children, ages 5, 3 and 2, to the center 
to shower and eat. "But apparently, it got to be too much for her, and she 
couldn't take care of them anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, as dusk bathed the waterfront in shades of gray, the woman brought 
her children to a vacant lot across the street from the drop-in center. Knowing 
Mayer was watching from the window, she abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
And there have been other memorable women and children: a 17-year-old who was 
living in a van with her father and brother, who were selling her for drug 
money. A 14-year-old prostitute who walked the streets in a school uniform, 
passing her earnings to her homeless drug-addicted mother. A pair of women who 
lived for a time in an abandoned taco wagon parked in an alley. An elderly 
woman suffering from cancer and rheumatoid arthritis whose home is a bright 
orange car. A cheerful alcoholic with a thick, ropy scar that runs from ear to 
ear, a souvenir of an attack on the street. 
</P>
<P>
For some, there is only survival, and sometimes not even that. In November, a 
28-year-old homeless woman was found murdered, burned to death in the van where 
she had been living in a storage yard a few blocks from the center. 
</P>
<P>
But for others, there is hope. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Rose, a 35-year-old crack addict who until recently eked out 
a life on the street as a "strawberry" -- a prostitute who trades sex for 
cocaine money. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in San Pedro, with my husband and kids. Then my brother-in-law 
turned me on to cocaine," she said. "I smoked for a week. I couldn't put the 
pipe down. And that was how it started. My life slowly just went down, down, 
down." 
</P>
<P>
She lost her car and her job behind a supermarket deli counter, she said. She 
stole rent money from her husband's wallet and pants pockets. Eventually, she 
said, her family was evicted and had to move to a hotel. Even then, she was 
unable to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend told me how I could get money," she said, and so she began 
prostituting herself around the docks, $20 a trick. On a good night, she said, 
she could make $150 -- enough money to keep her wired for up to three days. 
</P>
<P>
When she was high, she said, she stayed on the streets because she didn't want 
her three children to see her under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was doing coke, I didn't care what happened to me," Rose said. One 
night, for example, she went to Terminal Island to buy a $20 rock of cocaine. 
The dealer, a dockworker, took her money and instead of giving her the drugs, 
raped her, beat her and stole her car keys, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Morrow said, Rose showed up at the center, refusing to tell 
the counselors who had battered her and why she was so upset. As she sat 
quaking in the center's modest sitting room -- a comfy area with clothes racks 
and a sofa on one side and a microwave oven and coffee pot on the other -- the 
dealer came to the door looking for her, brandishing a golf club, Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow and Mayer managed to push him out onto the street while the women inside 
called the police, Morrow said. They were eager to turn the man in, Morrow 
said, because, as it turned out, Rose was not the only street woman he had 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
"He had raped probably seven or eight girls," Morrow said. "One had even come 
in before Rose's encounter with bloody bruises across her belly and breasts 
where he had whipped her with a chain." 
</P>
<P>
That woman, Morrow added, had been five months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
A rail-thin gamine, Rose has dark cropped hair and soft brown eyes that shifted 
nervously as she spoke. She bit her lip and fidgeted constantly, crossing and 
uncrossing her legs, compulsively munching fistfuls of caramel popcorn. She 
herself ended up under arrest after soliciting sex from an undercover vice 
officer four months ago. The offense landed her in a drug diversion program, 
and now, although she is back together with her family, she comes to the 
drop-in center when she feels the urge to use drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
It has only been a few weeks since her last binge, she said, and though she is 
back with her husband, the financial toll of her habit has been enormous. Her 
family, she said, is living at a single-room-occupancy hotel down the street 
from the drop-in center until they are back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is as close as the center gets to a happy ending, and she admits her 
new-found stability is precarious. 
</P>
<P>
"I want cocaine all the time. All the time," she said. "Like when I get upset, 
I think, I'll just buy a rock, calm my nerves down. If I get a job and keep 
busy, it'll keep my mind off it, but I don't know if I'm ready to handle a 
paycheck yet." 
</P>
<P>
And there are problems, she added, beyond drugs, for which addiction is only a 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
"These girls," she said, gesturing around the room, "these girls are big girls, 
but they need love. They need family, someone to tell them, 'C'mon, you don't 
need to be out there on the street.' 
</P>
<P>
"They look in the mirror and say, 'I'm nothing.' I was lucky. I looked in the 
mirror and saw myself changing. You get proud of yourself when you change. So 
that's what's keeping me going. The mirror." 
</P>
<P>
She shivered and glanced out at the street. She needed to get busy, she 
muttered, needed to put the craving aside. Cocaine could be like that -- one 
false move, and you're back in its grip. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the vacuum, Jim?" she asked briskly. "Got to vacuum this place." 
</P>

POLITICS: FEDERAL DOCUMENTS DISPUTE THE GOP CONGRESSMAN'S CLAIM THAT HE NEVER 
FILED COMPLAINTS AGAINST 4 FBI AGENTS LATER CLEARED OF WRONGDOING.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the FBI investigated four Los Angeles agents in 1987 and 1988 for 
allegedly threatening Rep. Elton Gallegly and conspiring to thwart his 
reelection, the Simi Valley Republican maintained that he had never registered 
a complaint against them. 
</P>
<P>
But documents recently released by the FBI say the internal inquiry was indeed 
conducted because Gallegly made repeated accusations against the agents to 
high-ranking FBI officials. The records also disclose that the agents were 
cleared of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the FBI documents quote Gallegly asking the agency to time its 
inquiry so as not to interfere with his 1988 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly prompted a yearlong probe when he called the Los Angeles FBI office 
after three agents visited him to seek his support for a bill to increase 
overtime for some federal employees. Gallegly's remarks during that phone call, 
and during subsequent calls, letters and interviews over the next eight months, 
have become the subject of intense dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said publicly that he initially called only to inquire whether the 
agents reflected the FBI's official position on the overtime bill. The FBI 
record, however, says he complained that the agents had been intimidating and 
unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also say that an irate and accusatory Gallegly later contacted 
top FBI officials at least seven times in 1988 to assert that a fourth agent, 
Gregory L. Mercier, and unidentified other FBI agents were conspiring to 
prevent his reelection. About the same time, Gallegly stated publicly, "I have 
never filed a complaint against any FBI agent." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI concluded there was no evidence to support Gallegly's claim that the 
agents had acted improperly or had violated a law prohibiting federal employees 
from working to influence the outcome of an election. The agency determined 
that the veteran agents had exercised their right to free speech as private 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The flap, which caused outrage in national law-enforcement circles when parts 
of it were revealed in 1988, is contained in FBI investigative files obtained 
by The Times through the Freedom of Information Act and other sources. The 
voluminous record sheds considerable light on the bitter controversy, 
particularly on the conduct of Gallegly, 46, a former Simi Valley mayor and 
real estate broker in his second term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
It also provides a behind-the-scenes look at a rare occurrence in an agency 
that strives to remain apolitical and is mindful that Congress controls its 
purse strings: a spat between a congressman and FBI agents in his district. "It 
just doesn't happen," said one bureau veteran not involved in this case. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, Gallegly stood by his original statements. He said he 
had never filed a complaint or made allegations that FBI agents had behaved 
improperly or engaged in a conspiracy to prevent his reelection. The FBI 
documents, he said, were not correct. 
</P>
<P>
"The only complaint I had was with the bureau for allowing this thing to get 
out of control," Gallegly said. "I ended up the victim." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly was renominated by an overwhelming margin and easily won reelection in 
his suburban 21st District, which includes southern Ventura County and parts of 
the western and northern San Fernando Valley. He is seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
It was midway through Gallegly's relatively uneventful first year in office 
when three FBI agents came to see him on Sept. 4, 1987. They were seeking his 
support on a bill to raise overtime pay for federal law-enforcement officers, 
including 9,600 FBI agents. Gallegly refused to support the measure, which he 
called "an open checkbook" that could cost taxpayers $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was subsequently passed and signed by President Bush in November. The 
Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost $80 million a year; the 
White House Office of Management and Budget puts the figure at $101 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the men, Larry Langberg, then a 19-year FBI veteran, and Brent Braun, an 
agent for 10 years, had known Gallegly socially. Langberg's wife had been a 
paid Gallegly campaign staffer. The third was John Callaghan, a 22-year 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly later publicly described the meeting in his Thousand Oaks district 
office as cordial. But six weeks after it occurred, he telephoned Richard T. 
Bretzing, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. Gallegly 
asserted that the agents had been threatening and unprofessional, said 
Bretzing, who filed a memo on the Oct. 16 phone call. The call and a follow-up 
letter from Gallegly prompted the initial inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Such an administrative review by the FBI's Office of Professional 
Responsibility can result in a range of punishment, including dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters to Newspapers 
</P>
<P>
When the matter became public seven months later, Gallegly said in a letter to 
newspapers in his district that he had contacted Bretzing "to learn if the 
agents were speaking for the bureau." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Gallegly's version changed. He said the agents "did represent to me 
they were there with the agents association, not the bureau." He said he 
telephoned Bretzing because Langberg had called Paula Sheil, a Gallegly 
congressional aide, at her home to inform her that many agents were unhappy 
that Gallegly was not supporting the overtime bill. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really wanted from Bretzing was an opportunity to communicate with all 
the agents my position on the issue," said Gallegly, emphasizing that this was 
his chief concern throughout the controversy. "I wasn't sure that more than one 
side was being expressed." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said Bretzing asked whether the agents had visited him on their own 
time or bureau time and whether they had come in their own cars. Gallegly said 
he was unable to answer these questions but, from that point on, he felt that 
he "was being used by some people in the FBI to break up" the agents 
association. "That was Richard Bretzing's goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bretzing, who has since left the FBI, called Gallegly's assertion "absolutely 
ridiculous." He said he had asked a series of routine questions after Gallegly, 
"who was very upset," called to complain that the three agents had made 
"demands and threats." 
</P>
<P>
"He felt the visit to his office by the agents was inappropriate," Bretzing 
said. "That was why he was calling." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, FBI investigators preliminarily concluded each of the men had 
taken the day off from work and driven his own car to the session. The inquiry 
found that the agents' visit constituted "no misuse of authority or bureau 
property on the part of these agents or inappropriate behavior. . . . This was 
a legitimate exercise of their constitutional rights as citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Only the first chapter of the probe was closed, however, and the agents were 
not told of this recommended finding. 
</P>
<P>
The issue flared again on May 10, 1988, a month before the June 7 primary 
election. Angered by what he maintained was Gallegly's unfair treatment of his 
colleagues, Mercier, a 12-year FBI veteran from Newbury Park, returned 
Gallegly's campaign leaflet with a note scribbled on it: 
</P>
<P>
"Here is your flyer. Keep it!! I wouldn't vote for you again in a million 
years!! I am a Special Agent with the FBI, and as far as we are concerned, you 
are worthless!!" 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly promptly called John E. Otto, the bureau's executive assistant 
director in charge of law enforcement, the FBI records say. Gallegly said he'd 
been told that Mercier and other agents, whom he did not identify, planned a 
letter-writing campaign against him because he did not support the overtime 
bill, according to Otto's memo about the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Now Public 
</P>
<P>
Otto wrote that Gallegly told him "he does not want to preclude anyone's 
exercise of their constitutional rights; however, he does not want to see 
federal government employees attempting to get around the Hatch Act in a 
conspiratorial manner." 
</P>
<P>
The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 to prevent elected officials from recruiting 
federal workers to campaign for them. It prohibits government workers from 
participating in certain kinds of political activities, including campaigning 
for or against a candidate for office. 
</P>
<P>
It does not, however, prohibit federal workers from expressing their opinion 
about a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In a May 10 memo, Otto wrote that, during a second conversation that day, 
"Gallegly also asked if it was at all possible the bureau could promptly 
conduct this administrative inquiry in view of the potential damage to his 
campaign that might be caused" by Mercier and others. 
</P>
<P>
Otto noted that Gallegly said he was opposed in the Republican primary by "a 
Korean immigrant who has spent an estimated $400,000 on his campaign so far." 
Real-estate developer Sang Korman, who also is running against Gallegly this 
year, spent $391,591 on the 1988 race. Korman won 13% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Otto "reassured the congressman that our administrative inquiry would begin 
immediately," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when the matter became public and was the subject of several newspaper 
stories, Gallegly denied that he had complained about Mercier. He told The 
Times that he had only mentioned the returned flyer in jest when FBI officials 
asked whether he had received any communication from agents. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no investigation on this letter that I know about," the now-defunct 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner quoted Gallegly as saying. Gallegly reiterated last 
week that he was unaware of any official probe. 
</P>
<P>
FBI records say Los Angeles bureau investigators interviewed Mercier and 
Langberg, who denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of a conspiracy. The 
investigators concluded on May 16: "There is no evidence of a conspiratorial 
act" by the agents to defeat Gallegly; those who vocally opposed him "have done 
so individually and as private citizens." 
</P>
<P>
On May 26, the friction spilled into public view. A letter by Pam Mercier, 
Gregory's wife, appeared in the Camarillo Daily News blasting Gallegly for 
opposing the overtime bill and for his ostensible role in triggering the 
investigation of the four agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that Rep. Elton Gallegly should be reelected," Mercier wrote. 
"Mr. Gallegly is not a friend of the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly called the FBI that day, the agency's records say. Deputy Assistant 
Director David G. Flanders, who took the call, reported in a memo that Gallegly 
"was obviously upset. His first words were, 'It's very difficult for me to be 
objective in this matter.' " Gallegly said Pam Mercier's letter was "evidence 
that FBI agents had conspired against him." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker was particularly disturbed by her assertion that he had filed a 
complaint against the four agents, according to the FBI records. "I never filed 
a complaint with the FBI," Gallegly is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Flanders reported that he told Gallegly that the lawmaker had indeed called the 
FBI to complain about the lobbying by the three agents and the purported 
conspiracy against him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discloses Source 
</P>
<P>
"It was pointed out to him," Assistant Director William A. Gavin wrote in a 
memo summarizing the conversation, "that, in essence, these two contacts of the 
FBI were complaints against FBI personnel, which were handled as such." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly then asked "that nothing be done for 10 days, until after the 
election," the memo says. 
</P>
<P>
During the May 26 discussion, Gallegly refused, as he had before, to disclose 
his source of information about the alleged conspiracy, the records say. 
Although the term "conspiracy" is attributed to him repeatedly in the 
documents, Gallegly denied last week that he ever used the word; he said that 
was the FBI's allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Gallegly's refusal to reveal his source as well as his request that no 
action be taken before the June 7 primary, Gavin recommended that nothing 
further be done. He also wrote that any FBI contact with Pam Mercier "would 
give the appearance of infringing on her freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly later publicly denied that he had complained to the FBI about Pam 
Mercier's letter. "How can you complain about a wife?" he told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said last week he did not recall asking the FBI to refrain from taking 
further action until after the election. But if he did so, he said, it was 
because he was frustrated that his role in the events was being misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're just going to continue doing this baloney, don't do anything," 
Gallegly said he recalled feeling at the time. "I don't have to fool with it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The day after his conversation with Flanders, Gallegly launched a public 
counteroffensive. 
</P>
<P>
He sent a three-page letter to newspapers throughout his district 
characterizing himself as "the target of a bitter and politically motivated 
attack by a handful of FBI agents." He cited Pam Mercier's letter as an 
example. 
</P>
<P>
And, he wrote, "I have never filed a complaint against any FBI agent." 
</P>
<P>
Following his June 7 primary victory, Gallegly continued to press the matter. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16, at the lawmaker's request, Otto and another FBI official met with 
Gallegly in the congressman's Washington office. Gallegly said he had waited 
until after the primary to have the meeting because "he did not want it 
interpreted as being connected with his campaign efforts," according to the FBI 
report of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Here, apparently for the first time, Gallegly revealed his chief source of 
information about the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said that Thomas E. Sheil, a former FBI agent and longtime friend, had 
told him that various agents, possibly including Gregory Mercier, had called 
retired agents in Gallegly's district and urged them not to vote for the 
congressman. Gallegly said Sheil told him that two ex-agents in Thousand Oaks 
had received calls from members of the FBI Agents Assn. asking them not to put 
up campaign signs for Gallegly in their front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sheil's wife, Paula, is employed in Gallegly's Thousand Oaks district office 
and had worked in Gallegly's real estate business for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Gallegly telephoned Otto again to inform him of a call 
Gallegly received from a Herald Examiner reporter who had spoken to Gregory 
Mercier. A half-hour later, Gallegly called Bretzing at the FBI's Los Angeles 
office and told him he believed that Mercier was on a "self-destruct mission" 
because the agent, a lawyer, had told the News Chronicle of Thousand Oaks that 
he was sick of the FBI and was going to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspected Leak 
</P>
<P>
On June 20, Gallegly reached Otto again when the executive assistant director 
was traveling on business in Louisville, Ky. The FBI deleted much of the record 
of their conversation from documents released to The Times but did disclose 
that Gallegly said he believed someone within the FBI was talking to the press 
about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this conversation, Otto directed investigators to ask Mercier if 
he was the source of information given the Herald Examiner reporter about "the 
FBI's sweeping for electronic eavesdropping devices" in Gallegly's office. 
Gallegly said last week that such a sweep took place, apparently due to a 
threat, but he said he could not recall the details. 
</P>
<P>
FBI investigators, meanwhile, were uncovering information contradicting 
Gallegly's account. 
</P>
<P>
They interviewed two retired agents whom Gallegly said Sheil had approached 
about the lawn signs, Richard D. Rogge and James G. Keenan. Each said he had 
not been contacted by representatives of the FBI Agents Assn. or anyone else 
about opposing Gallegly's reelection, the FBI records say. 
</P>
<P>
Rogge told investigators he had declined Sheil's request to put a Gallegly 
campaign sign on his lawn without giving a reason. He said the only pressure he 
received regarding Gallegly's reelection campaign came from Sheil. 
</P>
<P>
Rogge, a financial contributor to Gallegly's campaign, said Sheil was so 
insistent that, had Sheil persisted, Rogge "would have placed the sign in his 
yard against his own wishes." 
</P>
<P>
Keenan told investigators he was aware of the FBI agents' disagreement with 
Gallegly on the overtime issue. But he, too, said he had declined to display 
the sign of his own volition. Sheil provided a similar version of the events. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not Tom Sheil who told the congressman that Messrs. Rogge and Keenan 
would not place the campaign signs in their yards because of a concerted effort 
on the part of current agents" to thwart Gallegly's reelection, the 
investigative report said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, "it was probably assumed by Mrs. Paula Sheil that there was an adverse 
effort afoot," the investigators wrote on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, no one "has offered any knowledge of efforts of agents directed 
against Congressman Elton Gallegly," the investigators concluded. "No concerted 
effort is afoot to oppose Congressman Gallegly's bid for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to close the inquiry gradually worked its way through the 
FBI hierarchy. Mercier said he was informed orally in October, 1988, that he 
had been cleared. The other three agents were reportedly told on Jan. 9, 1989 
-- more than a year after the investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the flap had provoked outrage in the ranks of the FBI Agents 
Assn. nationwide. Craig Dotlo, former association president, said 160 to 170 
members of Congress had been contacted about the overtime pay bill by agents in 
their districts "and there has not been this kind of controversy" anywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue Called 'Political' 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said last week that the entire issue amounted to "pole-vaulting over 
cow pies." 
</P>
<P>
He said the matter was political when it arose in 1988, and its re-emergence 
less than two months before this year's June 12 primary is politically 
motivated as well. He said any suggestion that he had sought to restrict 
anyone's freedom of speech was "poppycock." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokeswoman said the bureau will not discuss the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan and Braun declined to comment on the new disclosures. Braun has since 
left the bureau for reasons unrelated to the Gallegly matter. 
</P>
<P>
Langberg, 47, who is now president of the 4,800-member FBI Agents Assn., said: 
"There's a thing in this country called freedom of speech. I feel not only a 
right but an obligation to let my elected representatives know what I think on 
issues, which is precisely what this group did."

A SLOW ROAD TO PROGRESS FOR A NARROW PASS IN THE VALLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been called the Fremont Pass, the San Fernando Pass, the Cuesta Vieja and 
the Old Newhall Grade. 
</P>
<P>
But for hundreds of years, travelers have called it a pain in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
The Newhall Pass -- its modern name -- is best known today as the junction of 
the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
A steep and narrow route linking the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, 
the Newhall Pass has been a challenge to engineers and an irritant to commuters 
since the days of the Spanish conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case on Wednesday, when a trailer overturned in the pass at the 
height of the evening commute, backing up traffic on the Golden State almost to 
the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It may be no comfort to the motorists who sat in traffic that evening, but 
their distress and frustration were as old as the pass itself. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the northwest end of the San Fernando Valley, the rocky pass 
separates the Santa Susana and San Gabriel mountains. 
</P>
<P>
People have tried crossing it by foot, by horse, by car and even by camel. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs from the late 1800s collected by the Santa Clarita Valley 
Historical Society show a long line of flatbed wagons waiting to cross from one 
valley to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The wagon masters look bored, grumpy and remarkably like the truckers and 
commuters stuck on the Golden State last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't seem to be progressing," said Jerry Reynolds, a Santa Clarita Valley 
historian. "They had problems back then, too." 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Newhall Pass is filled with creative, enterprising and 
occasionally kooky attempts to find a better route between the two valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Its story has been chronicled in books, magazines and government reports 
collected by the historians, Caltrans and the Santa Clarita Valley Historical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
The first European expedition to cross the Newhall Pass was led by Spanish 
explorer Don Gaspar de Portola in 1769. 
</P>
<P>
The explorers followed a rocky Indian trail located northeast of the present 
day freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The trail was improved over the years but remained so treacherous that 
stagecoaches were moved up and down the mountain by ropes and pulleys, Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1854, however, Phineas Banning, a brave and foolhardy Army major, 
tried to prove that a stagecoach could make the crossing without special help. 
</P>
<P>
The stagecoach passengers sensibly said they would rather walk than ride, and 
the intrepid Banning set off alone. 
</P>
<P>
The stagecoach and horses tumbled down the mountain, a jumble of splinters, 
chains and panicked animals. 
</P>
<P>
Banning emerged from the wreckage and, according to accounts at the time, 
declared: "Far easier than I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
A rough path west of the Indian trail was opened in 1855, but storms washed it 
out six years later. 
</P>
<P>
The strangest crossing during the brief history of the path was attempted by 
camels, part of a misguided U.S. Army experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale had persuaded the Department of War that camels 
might make ideal beasts of burden in the harsh southwestern United States, 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Beale was mistaken. Camels, good for long treks over desert sands, had 
difficulty managing the steep, rocky grade. 
</P>
<P>
Beale, undaunted, returned to the old Indian trail in 1862 and supervised the 
excavation of Beale's Cut, a narrow, 90-foot-deep gash in the mountain that 
opened trade between Los Angeles and the north during the heady days of the 
California Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
In 1875, engineers and stonemasons brought to California from China slowly 
carved a 6,976-foot-long railroad tunnel through the heart of the Santa Susana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, still used today, passes directly below the freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel enabled Los Angeles to be linked to San Francisco and is credited 
with spurring Los Angeles' development. 
</P>
<P>
Foot and horse traffic, meanwhile, continued to use Beale's Cut. 
</P>
<P>
The cut was an improvement over the Indian trail but was located at the end of 
a steep grade. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that when automobiles arrived in California at the turn of the 
century, Northern Californians who purchased cars in Los Angeles would only 
accept them if they could make it through Beale's Cut in the vehicle unaided. 
</P>
<P>
Cars had to traverse the 13-foot-wide cut in single file. 
</P>
<P>
Finally in 1910, the 434-foot-long Newhall Tunnel was cut through the mountains 
about a quarter-mile west of Beale's Cut. 
</P>
<P>
But the tunnel was only 17 1/2-feet wide, barely enough room for two trucks to 
pass, and it quickly became a bottleneck as notorious as Beale's Cut and the 
Indian trail. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, the Newhall Tunnel was replaced by a giant cut in the mountain wide 
enough for a four-lane roadway. 
</P>
<P>
It was an engineering feat that required the removal of 300,000 cubic yards of 
soil and rock. 
</P>
<P>
The new roadway became the Sierra Highway and state highway officials predicted 
that the road would solve the chronic traffic congestion at the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers said the road would handle tremendous amounts of traffic, and 
according to a 1938 publication by the state Department of Highways and Public 
Works: "Using conservative estimates of 4,000 cars per day as average for 365 
days during the year, we have 1.46 million car trips over this highway per 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Little did they know that the Newhall Pass would have 194,000 trips per day in 
1988, or 70 million trips a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the low estimate," said Pat Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman. "By 
now, 1990, it's even more than that." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways finally provided a smooth link 
between the valleys, but the 1971 Sylmar earthquake sent parts of the 
interchange crashing to the ground and the Santa Clarita Valley was once again 
cut off from it's neighbor to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway was rebuilt, but it remains a fragile link between the valleys, 
susceptible to auto wrecks and quirks of weather. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a real big snow up in here in 1974," Reynolds recalled. "It was several 
inches of real live snow." The Newhall Pass was closed for days.

ARTICLE ON THACHER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "In the Valley of the Private Schools" (March 17), the Thacher 
School and college preparatory boarding schools in general are inaccurately 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
In today's society the unfortunate truth is that any person that seeks a higher 
education is engaging in a brand of elitism. The students that choose to come 
to Thacher do so because they wish to attain an exceptional education. By 
making such a decision the students must focus themselves on the school and the 
work that they have chosen and not on establishing a new community of friends 
throughout the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to understand the school within its frame of reference. I 
accept that the Thacher School, by providing preparation for higher education, 
is, in a sense, an elitist institution. It must be selective in the students it 
accepts to preserve a strong academic community. 
</P>
<P>
But we at Thacher do not perceive ourselves as elitists. In fact, 25% of 
Thacher's student body receives financial aid from the school and each year 
$500,000 is given in grants for student aid. There is a clear commitment on the 
part of the school to attract a diverse student body, both ethnically and 
demographically . On the Thacher campus what one's parents do or earn is not a 
topic of discussion. The students that do come from wealthy backgrounds take 
great steps to downplay their family affairs. Many Thacher families struggle 
and make sacrifices to provide for their children what they believe is a 
tremendous opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Your reporter, Bob Pool, seemed to arrive with preconceived notions of what 
life at Thacher and Thacher students are like. He chose to see only what he was 
looking for and consequently represented Thacher as a school for arrogant, rich 
children. I am disappointed that his impression was seemingly supported by a 
quotation attributed to me. The context in which Mr.Pool presented my statement 
was questionable. I stated that I did not believe Thacher students were at all 
deficient for living in a semi-closed community. Unfortunately this was 
presented as if I thought we did not want to know the students at other Ojai 
schools, which is simply not the case. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the students at Thacher love the Ojai community and interact as much 
as possible outside of the demands made by the school curriculum. Contrary to 
the perception of some students at other schools in the valley, I have never 
observed animosity towards Ojai students. Ojai is viewed as a unique community 
and a wonderful place to be. Yet the students recognize that they have made a 
decision to come to Thacher for what it offers in the way of education and not 
just to socialize in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Many Thacher students go to weekly community service jobs. Students assist in 
elementary schools, convalescent homes, the Humane Society, Head Start day 
care, the Santa Barbara Braille Institute, and a therapeutic riding program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year an anti-apartheid festival was presented specifically for the public 
of Ojai and the other schools in the area. Thacher welcomes the public to the 
campus frequently for art exhibitions, speakers, and special events or 
performances. It is clear that the Ojai community is not excluded from the 
campus, nor the students from the community. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know what interaction Mr. Pool believes is normal between schools, but 
in examining the personality of each school he has not realized that the 
schools are different and cannot be expected to have clambakes together every 
weekend. I am always open to meeting and working with others in the Ojai 
Valley, but Mr. Pool asks the unreasonable and the unjustified of a school with 
established priorities. In so doing he fails to present Thacher as a nationally 
renowned specialized institution, and instead reduces it to a local school 
serving non-specialized needs. The comparison is analogous to that of an apple 
and an orange.

2 ARRESTED IN COCAINE SALES AT HERMOSA PUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bartender at a popular Hermosa Beach pub and a sometime maintenance man at 
the establishment were arrested last week by the state Alcoholic Beverage 
Control Department for allegedly selling cocaine in the bar to undercover 
agents, the department confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest Wednesday of Mark Alan Winsborough, 36, of El Segundo and Rogelio 
(Jesus) Gutierrez Reyes, 46, of Hermosa Beach capped a six-month investigation 
by the ABC and local authorities of alleged drug dealing at Besties bar, ABC 
Investigator Phil Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said the department has outstanding arrest warrants for at least four 
other suspects in the case, and plans to file an administrative action against 
the bar owner, Robert McAlinden. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so blatant that everybody knew what was going on," Henry said. "And it 
couldn't have gone on without the owner's acquiescence." 
</P>
<P>
McAlinden, however, denied he knew anything about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe it's happened," he said. "This is a very well-liked 
establishment. This is shocking news. Mark is a trusted employee. He's worked 
for me for 10 years. If I'd had any inclination he was doing anything like 
that, his feet wouldn't have touched the floor. This is a million-dollar 
business that I built myself. I'd never allow anything to jeopardize it." 
</P>
<P>
Henry said the investigation was launched by the ABC's 2-year-old Drug 
Enforcement Narcotics Team after it was tipped to the suspected drug dealing by 
local authorities and by an anonymous letter in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the six months (of the investigation)," he said, "there were 12 incidents 
of hand-to-hand purchases of cocaine," each involving less than an eighth of an 
ounce of powder.

SOUP KITCHENS PROVIDE RARE, HOT MEALS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After meticulously cleaning a plastic tray of its spaghetti, bread and salad on 
a recent sunny afternoon, Troy Tutt sat back on a bench outside the House of 
Yahweh, a Lawndale soup kitchen, and summed up one of the problems facing the 
hungry and homeless around the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't remember -- I don't have a house, so I don't have a 
refrigerator, or a stove, or even silverware and a can opener," said Tutt, a 
homeless man wearing a cast on his arm. Tutt said he lost his job and home 
after he was hit by a car and was unable to work. "That's why I come here." 
</P>
<P>
Tutt's observation echoes what homeless advocates say about the problems 
homeless people face when it comes to finding food: Dozens of South Bay 
churches, volunteers and government agencies dole out tons of flour, canned 
goods and other foodstuffs to poor people with places to prepare the food, but 
only a handful of agencies serve prepared food. 
</P>
<P>
For many homeless people, receiving a bag of groceries can be as frustrating as 
it is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to another place I heard about in Torrance where they gave out 
groceries. But that was hard, because I had nowhere to fix the food," said a 
man at the House of Yahweh who asked to be identified only as Howard. "If I 
don't get it here, I can sometimes go to stores where they are throwing out. If 
not, I just go hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Though many South Bay organizations began feeding poor and homeless people in 
the early 1980s, some have closed their doors in recent years because of crime 
problems or because the numbers of volunteers began to drop. Others have 
refocused on more time-consuming counseling and referral services, forcing them 
to reduce the numbers of people they feed. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Yahweh, which serves about 150 people every day, is one of only 
three agencies in the South Bay that regularly serves hot meals. The Crossing 
in San Pedro feeds about 150 people four times a week. And the Beacon Light 
Mission in Wilmington feeds up to 80 people nightly. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates estimate there are hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of 
homeless people in the South Bay, but operators of soup kitchens do not know 
how many of their clients fall into that category. Although firm numbers are 
elusive, social workers say the need for food is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people come in here on Thursday and say they have not eaten since 
they were here last Saturday," said Edwin Kise of The Crossing, a group 
composed of volunteers from 16 San Pedro churches that feeds and ministers to 
the poor and homeless every Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Soup kitchens face a host of obstacles: inadequate facilities to serve 
increasing numbers of people, few volunteers willing to make a long-term 
commitment and complaints from neighbors that they attract unsavory elements to 
the neighborhood. Those pressures have forced many groups to end or curtail 
feeding programs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's Table in Wilmington, which opened four years ago and at times fed 
more than 100 people a day, gradually scaled back operations to two days a week 
because of a string of robberies and security problems. Early in March, two 
more robberies left the program without cooking utensils, forcing it to end the 
meal service altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really disheartened. There is still a great need for this kind of 
service in Wilmington," said Carol Smetzer, who coordinated the soup kitchen's 
activities for Catholic Charities. Smetzer said the agency is evaluating 
whether to reopen the kitchen, but that it may not be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief workers say they do not have enough volunteers to handle the work 
entailed in preparing food for increasing numbers of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Community interest is hard to maintain," said Carolyn Olney, program 
coordinator for Food Partnership, a Carson group that trucks donated food to 
shelters and soup kitchens. "It is very difficult to keep up private sector 
support. What was once considered an emergency food problem has now become a 
chronic problem." 
</P>
<P>
Olney said a decrease in government donations of foodstuffs such as cheese and 
butter has also placed more of the food supply burden on private citizens, who 
often cannot keep up donations over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Many groups, sensing the impossibility of feeding all the homeless in their 
areas, have begun to focus their efforts on specific populations of homeless, 
such as the mentally ill and women with children. 
</P>
<P>
Crossroads in Redondo Beach, a branch of the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center 
in Culver City, distributes sandwiches and coffee two days a week to mentally 
ill homeless people who gather at local sites such as Alondra Park and Lennox 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fenner, program coordinator for Crossroads, said providing food gives the 
agency a way to contact such people so they can direct them to established 
medical and social service programs. Despite the focus on the mentally ill, 
Fenner said, staff workers find it hard to ignore other homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting distracted by the general homeless population in the South Bay. 
It is very hard to pull up in the van and say, 'Sorry, we can't give you 
anything because you are not mentally ill,' " Fenner said. Volunteers generally 
do not turn away someone who is obviously hungry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups have turned to a more comprehensive approach after deciding that 
their soup kitchens were doing little to strike at the roots of homelessness, 
including poor education, drug and alcohol abuse and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
The FISH Emergency Center, once an independent organization known as 
Harbor-Peninsula FISH (Friends in Service to Humanity) and now a part of the 
Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro, is one such group that abandoned the 
feed-and-let-be approach. Volunteers used to provide groceries to homeless and 
needy people without attempting further services. The group now interviews food 
recipients to help volunteers direct them to government programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer see ourselves as primarily a distributor of food as we once did. 
It seemed ridiculous for us to give them groceries for two or three days. We 
decided it was much more sensible to sit down with the homeless and assist them 
with the process of getting more help," said David Christiansen, executive 
director of the shelter.

PAGLIARULO LEAVES BENCH, LIFTS PADRES IN THE 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name is Mike Pagliarulo. His teammates call him Pags. Heck, even Pags calls 
himself Pags. Who can pronounce Pagliarulo, much less spell it? 
</P>
<P>
It didn't even irritate him in the slightest when he came to Candlestick Park, 
only to find his name misspelled above his locker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," he shrugged. "I didn't even know how to spell it until I was 13." 
</P>
<P>
That's Pags. Every scout can tell you the book on him: Great guy . . . leader 
in the clubhouse . . . gets along with everyone . . . . . . strong arm . . . 
and, uh, weak bat. 
</P>
<P>
It's the bat that has left Pagliarulo on the bench this season. You're talking 
about a guy who has the lowest career batting average (.227) among all active 
players with at least 2,500 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Padre Manager Jack McKeon had every intention of providing Pagliarulo 
the opportunity to win the starting third base job this spring. But when you're 
watching a guy bat .107 (three for 28), you're not exactly lying awake 
contemplating your decision. 
</P>
<P>
So, as you can imagine, when left-handed hitting Pagliarulo came to the 
ballpark Saturday morning, it hardly came as a surprise to see his name missing 
from the lineup. With a left-hander starting, and the Giants' top middle 
reliever being left-handed, it appeared Pagliarulo would get more exercise 
walking along Fisherman's Wharf in his sandals than he would at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
For 8 1/2 innings, Pags just on the bench with the rest of the reserves, until 
all of a sudden his name was being called by McKeon to go onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was the 10th, and the public-address announcer was calling his name as 
he stepped to the plate with one out and the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few minutes later, he was encircled by reporters calling his name, 
wanting to know all about his heroics in the Padres' 5-3, 10-inning victory 
over the San Francisco Giants in front of 24,846. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have scored 14 of their 17 runs in the eighth inning or later, 
won their fourth in a row. They were just one out away from defeat in the ninth 
when shortstop Garry Templeton tied it with a bloop single to left, scoring Joe 
Carter, who had reached base on third baseman Matt Williams' error. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only break the Padres would need. In the 10th, Roberto Alomar walked 
on four pitches, and Tony Gwynn followed with a double over the head of 
Williams, advancing Alomar to third and chasing reliever Jeff Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Quisenberry, who was scorched by the Padres in their 8-3 victory Friday, 
came on. His first act was to intentionally walk Jack Clark, loading the bases 
for a potential easy force out. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who ended his hitless drought Thursday in this same situation, strode 
to the plate ready to win the game with one swing. Instead, he lofted a fly 
ball to center, too shallow even to allow Alomar an attempt to score from 
third. 
</P>
<P>
That, as Quisenberry would later say, was supposed to be the tough out. Now, he 
was dipping into the bottom of the order, and the next batter was Pagliarulo, 
whose 1990 repertoire consisted of three strikeouts and an infield pop-up in 
four plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo walked to the plate, taking a peek over his shoulder to make sure 
McKeon was not sending up a pinch-hitter. Pagliarulo has managed to maintain 
his confidence, anyway, but Quisenberry was a guy he always loved to face. In 
fact, of his eight previous at-bats against Quisenberry, five resulted in hits. 
</P>
<P>
So even though he missed badly on a sinker thrown by Quisenberry, evening the 
count at 1-1, Pagliarulo remained undaunted. The next pitch was a slider, and 
Pagliarulo stayed back, swung and sent the ball soaring toward the right field 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Butler raced over to the warning track, making an over-the-shoulder catch 
and robbing Pagliarulo of at least a double. But no matter. Alomar tagged up 
and scored easily from third, and Gwynn advanced to third. Benito Santiago 
provided the insurance run when he laid a bunt down the third-base line, 
allowing Gwynn to score. 
</P>
<P>
The rest was left up to Craig Lefferts, the reliever who departed San Francisco 
at the end of last season for a $5.25-million free-agent contract with the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark opened the inning with a blooper to center field . . . snagged by a 
diving Carter. Kevin Mitchell, who hit his first homer of the season in the 
fourth inning, followed with a screaming line drive . . . snared by a leaping 
Pagliarulo. And the game ended with Matt Williams looking at a called third 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo was mobbed by his teammates, who know the anguish he's had to endure 
as a backup player for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the first question asked of him by a Bay-area reporter? 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think of that Giant bullpen, it's pretty beat up, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo winced and said: "They got Joe Carter out, didn't they? It's not 
hurting that bad. He (Quisenberry) had to get three outs in a row. That's tough 
for anybody. He was trying to get a ground ball out of me, and it just didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, exasperated by the question, sat back in his locker and rolled his 
eyes. But he knows that when you're hitting the way he has, even sacrifice 
flies must be blamed on someone. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can still go out there every day and hit 20 home runs," Pagliarulo 
said, "I just know I can do that. I've done it before. I mean, it's one thing 
to question a guy who's never done it before, but I've done it. I'm just not in 
that situation now to show it." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo allowed some of his frustrations to seep out while talking about his 
new life on the bench. He's eligible for free agency after the season, and of 
course could shop his services to someone who will make him a starter. But he 
wants to stay put, he says, just hoping the Padres will give him that chance to 
show he can once again be an everyday player. 
</P>
<P>
So just how tough is it now for him to be sitting on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Pagliarulo said, "I haven't strangled my family or anything yet, if 
that's what you mean. Sure, it gets me down, but there's really nothing I can 
do right now but wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I just get tired of people seeing me play once a week, and I don't get a hit, 
and they say, 'Hey, he can't hit any more.' If I had 500 at-bats, it'd be a 
different story." 
</P>
<P>
But the statistics don't lie. Pagliarulo's batting average has plummeted each 
of the past four seasons, and after hitting 32 homers and driving in 87 runs in 
1987, he has since hit just 22 homers with 98 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He reads the papers and hears the talk that he's washed up. His response: "To 
hell with them." 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the paper (statistics), my sister could say that, but so 
what? Those people aren't general managers. Screw 'em. Let the second-guessing 
. . . say whatever they want. All that does is inspire me." 
</P>
<P>
It's really quite similar to the way Lefferts was feeling Saturday. The fans at 
Candlestick taunted and booed him when he came onto the field in the ninth 
inning, and that was all the inspiration he needed to pitch two hitless innings 
without yielding even a walk. 
</P>
<P>
So, does he at least feel the least bit of sympathy for the Giants over their 
bullpen problems, knowing that he could have rectified them by staying? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not at all," Lefferts said, breaking into a smile. "It feels great to 
pitch against them. They wouldn't give me the opportunity I wanted, and now 
they're paying the price." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago, who ended Friday's game by picking off Robby 
Thompson at second base and threw out Thompson trying to steal second Saturday, 
now has thrown out four of the four base-runners who have attempted to steal, 
including two pickoffs. "The way I'm feeling this year," Santiago said, "I tell 
them, 'Just go ahead and try. I dare you.' No one's going to steal off me this 
year. If they steal, it'll be off the pitcher." Santiago, who had an extensive 
workout program during the winter, said his arm feels the best it has in years. 
He also is off to the best start in his career, batting .364 (eight for 22) 
with three RBIs. "He's really busting his butt," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "He's really a different player this year. He's happy, he's smiling, it's 
great to see. I've really been impressed." The Padres' new road jerseys had one 
minor flaw Friday night -- the name on the back of Santiago's uniform was 
misspelled. It was corrected for Saturday's game. . . . Former Padre infielder 
Tim Flannery, in town as a color analyst for today's game, was a bit surprised 
to see his name on the Candlestick scoreboard in the ninth inning Friday night: 
"Now warming up in the bullpen, Tim Flannery." But neither team had one, 
although new Padre reliever, Craig Lefferts, now wears Flannery's old number, 
11. Said Flannery: "I thought I was in Field of Dreams or something." . . . 
Former Padre President Chub Feeney was in attendance Saturday.

GORMAN WINDS UP WINNER IN DAVIS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT CALABRIA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big winner in the Davis Cup's second round wasn't Aaron Krickstein or even 
the United States. The big winner was Tom Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman's turbulent tenure as coach of the U.S. team has been marked by 
disagreements with John McEnroe and Andre Agassi, a hip injury that sidelined 
Michael Chang, and Gorman's decision to replace the long-standing doubles team 
of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso with upstarts Rick Leach and Jim Pugh. It hasn't 
been easy. 
</P>
<P>
But the Americans' victory over Czechoslovakia in Prague this month tightened 
Gorman's grip on a team that, at times, appeared to be trying to sabotage him. 
Despite the controversies, he and the squad have emerged stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman was willing to excuse McEnroe for not wanting to play in every round, 
given his commitment to Davis Cup in the past. But he was right in not 
surrendering to the demands of Agassi, who insisted on bringing an entourage of 
advisers and coaches to Prague before he would consent to play. The result was 
this: Gorman replaced Agassi with Krickstein, who won both his singles matches, 
while Agassi came off sounding like the spoiled brat he is. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the big loser of the Davis Cup match was not Czechoslovakia, but 
Agassi. He did not play in the Australian Open. He may again skip Wimbledon. He 
did not play Davis Cup. Bud Collins, that rascal in the broadcast booth, calls 
Agassi "The Duke of Ducking." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Agassi changes his mind and decides he wants to play for the United 
States in the semifinals against Austria in September, Gorman might not welcome 
him back. Krickstein deserves another chance to represent his country. Brad 
Gilbert wants to play again, too. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, if McEnroe becomes available and Chang stays healthy, Gorman will have an 
especially tough time deciding who should be selected. But that may be the 
biggest step toward establishing order on the Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
At least, the coach -- not the players -- will do the choosing. 
</P>
<P>
Tog team match: Martina Navratilova has signed a licensing agreement with 
Herman Geist Inc. to distribute her line of athletic clothing in the United 
States. Zina Garrison is one opponent who is already wearing Navratilova's 
designs on court. "I had to play Zina at the Virginia Slims of Washington," 
Navratilova said. "It's strange to play someone wearing your own clothes." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone call, Navratilova also had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On her play this year: "The last few years, I wasn't focused on being No. 1 
because I either didn't have the mind or body to do it all. Now I feel I have 
both." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On her decision to skip the French Open because it's too close to 
Wimbledon: "Playing on clay and then playing on grass is crazy. You might as 
well play golf on cobblestones." 
</P>
<P>
Lofty beginning: Leftovers from Jennifer Capriati's loss to Navratilova in the 
final of the Family Circle Cup last week: 
</P>
<P>
Capriati debuts on the Virginia Slims rankings at No. 25. Since 1986, when 
players were first required to play three tournaments before attaining a 
ranking, the record for the highest ranking had been held by Monica Seles, who 
two years ago debuted at No. 88. Before 1986 -- when six tournaments were 
required to attain a ranking -- Andrea Leand held the record by debuting at No. 
18. It's worth noting that among the players ranked ahead of Capriati are No. 5 
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, No. 11 Helena Sukova, No. 13 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 15 
Laura Gildemeister, No. 18 Natalia Zvereva, No. 22 Helen Kelesi. Capriati has 
beaten all of them. Former U.S. Open champ Hana Mandlikova is ranked behind 
Capriati at No. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Seles' ranking of No. 4 is a career high. She has jumped over Sanchez and No. 6 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
Austin is suing: Tracy Austin, whose comeback was derailed after an automobile 
accident in Short Hills, N.J., last year, has filed a lawsuit seeking 
unspecified damages from the Boss Glass Company and Steven Reynolds, who was 
driving the firm's van when it collided with Austin's car in a hotel parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Austin, 27, has undergone a bone graft in an attempt to 
repair a broken right leg suffered in the crash. William O'Day, Austin's 
lawyer, said: "We don't know yet if this is a career-threatening injury." 
</P>
<P>
Austin, who won the 1979 U.S. Open at 16, unofficially retired in 1984 but 
returned two years ago to play a limited doubles schedule.

PRIDE SPURS WHITBREAD'S ROUND-THE-WORLD SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BAKER, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Southeast 17th Street causeway over the Intracoastal Waterway, many 
worlds meet. To the southwest, cruise ships dock, chop-a-block with 
multinational clienteles. From the northwest, charter fishing boats rumble away 
from hotel marinas and private piers toward Port Everglades Channel and the 
fishing grounds offshore. 
</P>
<P>
To the northeast stands Pier 66 Resort and Marina, all spit and polish, fern 
bars and waterside cafes, and primary layover facility for the fleet in the 
Whitbread Round the World Race. 
</P>
<P>
To the southeast stands a lesser hotel and a flamingo-pink shopping center. At 
the lesser hotel, the Best Western Marina Inn, part of the Whitbread overflow 
will dock this week. At a small, smelly bar tucked away in the pink shopping 
center, an ersatz treasure hunter named Dick Vogel was holding court late one 
night last week. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel's tales of treasure were nonsensical; his admiration for the Nazi 
infantry in World War II was vocal and comparable in zeal only to his distaste 
for the Whitbread race. 
</P>
<P>
"Whitebread, who cares about the Whitebread?" Herr Vogel said. "Bunch of slimy 
limeys and (assorted other racial epithets) chasing each other around the 
world. Who cares? What's the point?" 
</P>
<P>
In the bar that night while Vogel presided was a knot of journalists in town to 
cover the Whitbread. The correspondent from Britain's The Independent sat 
quietly while Vogel railed about gold coins, emeralds and the Wehrmacht ("an 
Englishman is never unintentionally rude," he said several times), but Vogel's 
assessment of the Whitbread set him off. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is -- quite exactly, really -- the point," said the correspondent 
from The Independent. "Slimy limeys, Italians, Swedes, Dutch, Finns, Americans, 
Kiwis, Australians and Germans racing around the whole bloody world. Not for 
money -- for a chance to win a few silly, plated trophies and the privilege to 
be able to say they have done it." 
</P>
<P>
The point seemed quite lost on Vogel. Treasure, after all, to many is something 
you can pick up, rub between your fingers and admire or sell. Perhaps the point 
is lost on many other Americans as well. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some who notice that Steinlager 2 and Fisher &amp; Paykel, each a 
multimillion-dollar campaign with major corporate sponsors, are neck and neck 
over the past four legs of the race. Others may have taken note that there is 
no American entry and there is one all-woman crew. But few will be able to tick 
off the ports of call, the large or small tragedies and triumphs in 33,000 
miles of racing. 
</P>
<P>
To many of the crew, being there at all is treasure in itself. 
</P>
<P>
On the top boats, in Division A, crew members are paid about $30,000 a year. 
Going down through the other classes, Division C, D and Cruising Class, some 
crew are paid, but most pay their own way -- including owning interests in the 
boats they sail. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the top boats, the yachts are secondhand, perhaps veterans of 
previous Whitbreads, perhaps only the best available under their financial 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
La Poste, sponsored lightly by the French post office, is the smallest boat in 
the race, with an IOR rating of 40.46 feet. The boat is last in the standings 
and not due in until Monday, a week after the leaders. But its crew list, made 
up entirely of postal workers who pay their own way and change after each leg, 
has been filled for years. 
</P>
<P>
Schlussel Von Bremen is owned by the Wappen Von Bremen Sailing Club and its 
crew schedule is arranged to allow participation of as many club members as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Liverpool Enterprise, an English entry, is set up as a trust fund and is a 
training ship for young people. Its crew is either unpaid or paying. 
</P>
<P>
With Integrity, one of two boats in the all-British Cruising Class, has been 
sailed in each of the Whitbreads and won the 1973-74 and 1977-78 races as Great 
Britain II. Its skipper, Andy Coghill, sold his house so he could sail this 
race. His crew is partly paid and partly paying. 
</P>
<P>
Creightons Naturally, another recycled English entry, had been stored in a 
boatyard since the 1981-82 race. Several members of its crew have a financial 
interest in the yacht, which they personally rebuilt. The yacht also is a watch 
craft for International Dolphin Watch and records all sightings as they race 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all good people involved. They're all go-getters," said Steinlager 2 
skipper Peter Blake. "They're not namby-pamby at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they win or come in second or come in 10th in the race, what's 
important to them is that they are out there having a go. It's the fact that 
they got round at all." 
</P>
<P>
That Creighton's Naturally still is in the race perhaps typifies the dedication 
of the sailors and the interest and understanding of the Europeans who 
passionately root for their men and boys as they go round. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Nov. 12, while Creightons Naturally was running heavily 
before a full gale across the bottom of the world, the yacht gybed unexpectedly 
and two crew were thrown overboard. Both were recovered, but one, Tony 
Phillips, could not be resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, with the permission and blessing of Phillips' parents, he was 
buried at sea and Creightons Naturally raced on.

IT'S A NEW YEAR FOR JOCKEY KENT DESORMEAUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NELSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux was a record-setting jockey last year, at the top of his 
profession and basking in the warmth of a spotlight that rarely left him. He 
admits it: It got too easy back in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he's just another kid jockey, trying to make it big at one of the 
biggest tracks in the world, and it's not so easy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"In Maryland, we were big fish in -- well -- not a small sea, but a 
middle-sized sea," Desormeaux said. "Now . . . " Now, at 20, he's trying to get 
good horses while competing against one of the toughest groups of jockeys at 
any race track in the world, Santa Anita. He's been bumped and shoved and 
abused -- treatment generally accorded newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
He's served out two suspensions, one for a bumping incident that happened in 
New Jersey, another for a similar incident at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
From Feb. 14, when he first rode at Santa Anita, through the end of March, he 
had 27 winners, well off the pace of the track's leading jockey, Gary Stevens, 
who was in the 90s. And, well off the pace that saw him ride a record 597 
winners last year, mostly at Pimlico and Laurel race tracks in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's surviving. 
</P>
<P>
"In Maryland, I was getting kind of lackadaisical," Desormeaux said. "I was 
riding the best horses, and it was getting kind of easy. I'm riding a lot of 
bad horses here, and I'm getting some of them home. When I get some ammo, we'll 
be as hard to handle as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get some more of these bad horses home, get out in the mornings 
and work hard and get some more good horses to ride. I know I've turned some 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
At the Hollywood Park meeting starting later this month, Desormeaux believes he 
can crack the top four. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made a believer out of a lot of negative people," trainer D. Wayne Lukas 
said. "He's going to make a big impact on the local scene." 
</P>
<P>
When Desormeaux arrived at Santa Anita in early February, he began serving a 
10-day suspension for a bumping incident at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of slowed things down," he said. "I went back to zero, and I 
couldn't wait to get my feet in the irons." 
</P>
<P>
He used the time to get to know the track, the other jockeys and the trainers, 
"so I got to meet people on the backside instead of introducing myself in the 
paddock." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in March, he was suspended again for a similar incident and sat out the 
first week of April. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody out here pretty much took their shot at me, to see if they could 
throw me off stride," Desormeaux said. "I realized that we'd have to earn each 
other's respect. I already respected them. Now, I think we're settled down and 
everybody pretty much has welcomed me home." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, a Louisiana native, took a vacation in January, got married and 
moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision to leave, but there wasn't much more to accomplish in 
Maryland," he said. "I'm a go-getter. I'm always looking for tasks to overcome. 
Pride was going to take me somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Out here, the money's best, the weather's the best, I'm riding in the best 
company. I don't have to ship to Florida in the winter, and you add up all 
those things -- here we are." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux broke Chris McCarron's 1974 record of 546 wins on the last day of 
November at Laurel. That earned him the Eclipse Award as the nation's top 
jockey, only two years after he was voted the country's top apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
He needed 11 victories in the final two days of the year to reach his goal of 
600. He got five on Dec. 30, twice finishing ahead of Hall of Famer Bill 
Shoemaker during the Maryland stop of his farewell tour. On Dec. 31, though, he 
rode only three winners, falling three short of his goal. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux has not been quite as successful racing at Shoemaker's home track, 
but there have been flashes of brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a riding little devil," fellow jockey Julie Krone said. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Desormeaux rode Solar Launch to his second straight featured-race 
victory at Santa Anita. And, on March 24, he rode three straight winners. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux has become a favorite of Santa Anita trainer Craig Lewis, and for 
good reason. Lewis had a horse, Light The World, who was 0-for-20 until 
Desormeaux rode him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he has proved his worth," Lewis said, and offered half his stable 
to Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux also has ridden for Lukas, the nation's leading trainer. In his 
first trip back to Maryland, he rode the Lukas-trained Bright Candles to a 
third-place finish in the Pimlico Oaks on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't expect to come over here and win four or five races a day, twice a 
week," Desormeaux said. "It just wasn't going to happen. I'd be overwhelmed 
with one victory a day." 
</P>
<P>
With one victory a day, he'd also be making more money than he did in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already made more money in half as many races as I could make in 
Maryland," he said. "If I can be in the top four here -- I don't have to be a 
the leading rider to destroy what I earned in Maryland."

DEBATES OVER MVP AREN'T HARD TO FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BARNARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it Magic? 
</P>
<P>
Or Sir Charles? 
</P>
<P>
Or Michael, the Admiral, Akeem, Larry, Patrick, Clyde or Karl? 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a couple of writers get together at an NBA game, it doesn't take long 
for the Most Valuable Player discussions to start. 
</P>
<P>
Last names hardly need to be mentioned. Everyone knows who everyone else is 
talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Three media members from each of the 27 NBA teams, plus 11 national writers, 
make up the 92-person panel that will vote for the MVP in the next few days 
before the regular season ends next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The league delights in the idea that there is no criteria for the voting, which 
creates discussion and controversy about the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is there little agreement about who should win, but there also is 
little agreement about what a player has to do to win. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, who have combined to win five of the last six 
MVPs, impress the segment of voters who believe in "intangibles" and "players 
who make their teammates better." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also benefits from playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, who have the 
league's best record, while Karl Malone of Utah and Charles Barkley of 
Philadelphia are the stars on probable division winners. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some great performances throughout the season by a lot of 
people," Boston coach Jimmy Rodgers said. "I suppose if you're looking at a 
true MVP, you've got to look at the record of the team, that would give Magic 
the edge since the Lakers have the best record." 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a hard time voting against Magic," Sacramento's Dick Motta said. 
"There's no question in my mind that if there was a draft before each season 
that he would be the No. 1 pick. He's the best who ever played this game." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, along with the 76ers, is finishing strong, recording season-highs in 
scoring in three of four recent games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking for an MVP, Barkley should win it," Atlanta's Doc Rivers 
said last Saturday after Barkley scored a season-high 39 points for the second 
consecutive game. "Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan are great too, but they 
don't cause all the havoc that Charles does." 
</P>
<P>
"If Philadelphia keeps on winning, Barkley probably will win it," New Jersey 
coach Bill Fitch said. "He's taken the 76ers to a level that wasn't expected. 
Everybody was saying they were going to finish third in the division." 
</P>
<P>
"You can always say Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, but Charles Barkley's 
having a great year," Bird said. "Finally, his team is winning and that makes a 
big difference, so he should get some consideration. But I think every year, 
always, there's Michael and Magic in there. Give it to both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan might lose support because Chicago always seems to be chasing Detroit, 
but he has charisma and the statistical hook -- the NBA's leading scorer -- 
that attracts voters. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon leads the NBA in rebounding and blocked shots, and his Houston 
supporters remind everyone that he has MVP-quality numbers despite a blood 
disorder that hampered his offseason conditioning. But the Rockets might not 
even make the playoffs, seriously damaging his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing has some of the best of both worlds: getting high marks for 
leadership and scoring statistics that earn him the label of "unstoppable." But 
the New York Knicks' late-season slide almost certainly will cost him votes. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, after a two-year layoff in the Navy, needed no time to be 
mentioned with Ewing and Olajuwon in the front rank of big men. His team, San 
Antonio, probably won't catch Utah in their division, but the Spurs will become 
the most improved team ever if they can win their 54th game this week, a jump 
of 33 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Nelson of Golden State compares Robinson to former teammate and Hall 
of Famer Bill Russell. Nelson doesn't hesitate in naming his MVP favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"David's been terrific," Nelson said. "The way he's turned around that team has 
been amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler of Portland is another darkhorse candidate who gets support from 
the coaching fraternity because of the way he's helped turn around his team's 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"Drexler's had a great year on a team that's made great strides," Cleveland's 
Lenny Wilkens said. "In picking the MVP, you have to take everything into 
account. The Trail Blazers have come so far, and Drexler has been the big 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone has been spectacular for Utah, trailing only Jordan in scoring, but 
he has the same problem that Johnson had before finally winning the MVP in 1987 
-- having a teammate who's almost as good. 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton of the Jazz is leading the NBA in assists by a wide margin over 
Johnson and is virtually certain to set a single-season record. Everyone seems 
to wonder if Malone would be so successful if Stockton wasn't around, and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Bird have long been acknowledged as having the best all-around 
games in the NBA, but they don't really have the statistical "hook" they 
impressed voters with during their previous MVP years. Both, however, have been 
solid down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, whose increased scoring totals gave him the impetus to win in 1987 and 
1989, has had seven recent games with 28 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought for MVP is Magic Johnson," Denver coach Doug Moe said. "He 
keeps the Lakers at championship level every year."

DRIVING NO. 12 WITH PRIDE; 
</P>
<P>
A LOVE OF PEOPLE MAKES FOR A SMOOTH ROAD FOR HONORED BUS DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Slightly behind schedule because a wheelchair rider had to be loaded, the 
crowded bus hissed to a stop in front of a blue bench in Belmont Shore. Several 
passengers forgave the driver for being three minutes late and got on. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey ya, lady, good morning. How are things?" said Joe Catalano, the Long Beach 
Public Transportation Co.'s driver of the year, to a woman whose two quarters 
and dime were being noisily digested by the coin box. 
</P>
<P>
Catalano maneuvered back into traffic. He held the steering wheel with both 
hands, one tattooed with the Marine Corps insignia. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy my job," he said. "I enjoy people, and now that I'm driver of the 
year, people look up to me. It makes my day go by good." 
</P>
<P>
He beamed at the thought of that honor, bestowed last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We love him," said Debbie Lewis, who sat at the front of the No. 12 East Ocean 
bus that Catalano captains on five round trips from downtown to Cal State Long 
Beach. "He has a million jokes. Believe me, I've heard them all." 
</P>
<P>
Catalano, snappy in his tie and blue shirt with the company patches on one 
sleeve, admitted: "They're usually the same ones over and over. Sometimes I get 
some new material." 
</P>
<P>
He has been driving the bus since the fare was 7 cents 26 years ago. Now a man 
of 60 with gray sideburns, a curled-up mustache and eyebrows that rise like 
church spires, he approaches each day as if still an excited rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Another regular rider, Madeline Pratt, appreciates that spirit. "In the evening 
we don't have Joe, so I car-pool home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver-of-the-year award, instituted two years ago, is based on safety and 
attendance records and, most importantly, how well a driver serves the 
customers, said Guy Heston, assistant manager of the 335-driver transit 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a lot of patience," Catalano said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say a little old lady gets on. Well, she's going to take forever, but 
you can't say, 'C'mon lady, hurry up.' And you have to accept that people will 
be grouchy sometimes. If you can't control your temper, you're in the wrong 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Boston, Catalano left that city after only 16 years but has retained 
its accent in his voice. He spent a dozen years in the Marines, serving in the 
Korean War as a staff sergeant, then became a bus driver in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard at first," he said, "but I stuck it out. You have to learn 
the tricks of the trade." 
</P>
<P>
His job is easier now. "We have more safety equipment, bigger windows, a 
comfortable seat, directional signals on the floor," he said. "We used to have 
to use a changer, and we had to punch transfers. Now we have an automatic 
transfer machine." 
</P>
<P>
Viewing yachts out the huge windshield as he crossed a bridge, Catalano 
assessed drivers of cars: "Fair, they don't signal." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a Volkswagen and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who drive little cars dart in and out of traffic," he said. "They 
think they have all the room in the world." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has had one accident, a fender-bender when he first started. And one 
ticket for speeding, also long ago but still vivid in reminiscence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going 35 miles an hour in a 30-mile zone and had a load of sailors who 
wanted to go on liberty. I told the policeman, 'Can you hurry up and give me 
the ticket? They want to go into town.' " 
</P>
<P>
The No. 12 first rolls at 5:18 a.m. Because he walks 3 1/2 miles to work, 
Catalano rises at 3:30 a.m. If he goes to a track after work, he is home early. 
"I like to have a beer once in a while, but not during the week," he said. "No 
way. My job is too important for that." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the horses is a passion of this man who has never married but claims to 
be still looking for a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer Squall" was the tip of one man who got on the bus downtown that recent 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll check it out," Catalano said. 
</P>
<P>
His bus is almost like a tour bus. He points out new ships in the harbor and 
the house on Ocean Boulevard in which Clark Gable used to live. 
</P>
<P>
"If I only had one or two passengers the whole eight hours, I would still see 
something interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the terminus of each half-hour trip, either at the university or Catalina 
Landing, there seemed a sadness. 
</P>
<P>
The bus would be empty, and Catalano would search it for newspapers and lost 
belongings. In all the years he has never found anything of value to turn in. 
</P>
<P>
He would get a cup of coffee, return and sit alone in the big bus or stand 
outside it. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver of the year gets chrome wheels," He said, pointing to a hubcap. 
</P>
<P>
He got back on and sat in one of the blue passenger seats. He could not get 
that company dinner last December at the Lakewood Country Club off his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was filming the festivities with his video camera when the 
announcement was made that he was driver of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I go, 'Oh my God,' and I hit my head against a wall," he said. "I'm shaking, 
the camera's shaking. They're all yelling, and I'm kissing the women. That was 
really a surprise."

COUNCIL'S FIRST LATINOS FACE LIST OF VOWS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO WHO MADE HISTORY IN HUNTINGTON PARK ARE POISED TO CARRY OUT 
CAMPAIGN PROMISES. BUT FIRST THERE ARE FENCES TO MEND.

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raul Perez and Luis Hernandez acknowledge that they have plenty of work ahead 
of them as the first Latino councilmen in the history of this overwhelmingly 
Latino city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to produce," said Perez, a 47-year-old loan officer. 
"We're going to have to show something for the election." 
</P>
<P>
There are several campaign promises to fulfill: 
</P>
<P>
* Increase civic participation in a city where council meetings are routinely 
attended by fewer than 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase citizenship among the city's large immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase the number of Latino commissioners and move Latinos into management 
positions in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
* Fight crime in a city where gang-related incidents are becoming increasingly 
common. 
</P>
<P>
* Ensure that the city remedies financial problems that forced 25 layoffs last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But those pledges hinge on how well Perez and Hernandez get along with each 
other and veteran Councilmen William P. Cunningham, Thomas E. Jackson and Jack 
W. Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial analyst, has been at odds with the 
incumbents for months. He has attacked them at council meetings, blaming them 
for the city's financial problems and accusing them of being part of a "good 
ol' boy" network that is out of touch with the majority of Huntington Park's 
59,000 residents. More than 90% of those residents are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham and Parks said last week that they are confident they will be able 
to work with Perez, and that they will try to work with Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't sat with him (Hernandez) on the council yet," Cunningham said. "I'd 
rather not have him there." 
</P>
<P>
Parks said: "He's just one vote. He may be boisterous but he's not going to 
control everything. Majority rules." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, Hernandez's most frequent target, declined to comment. Hernandez 
called for Jackson's resignation several months ago, saying that the councilman 
had received discounted trash service for his local business from a garbage 
company that once operated in the city. Jackson has admitted he received the 
discount, but said he didn't know he was receiving the price break and put a 
stop to it once he found out. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he still would like to see Jackson resign, but added that he 
will try to cooperate with his new colleagues. "I'm going to talk to each and 
every councilman and try to bury the hatchet so we can move forward," Hernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their common goals, Hernandez is just about as much at odds with Perez 
as he is with the incumbents, partly because of their contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
Perez sees himself as a team player who has more than paid his dues. He had run 
for City Council and lost five times before winning a seat in last Tuesday's 
election. Political representation for Latinos was a cornerstone of his 
campaign. He said he spent about $8,000 on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez grew up in and around the Huntington Park area, but moved to the East 
Coast after graduating from USC in 1985. He moved back into the area in 
mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he spent about $30,000 in winning his first campaign for City 
Council. He has not filed his campaign disclosure statements as required by 
state law and is subject to a $200 fine. Hernandez said he did not turn in the 
statements because some of his contributors feared retaliation from the 
incumbents. He said he would turn in the statements next week. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Perez, Hernandez downplayed the issue of Latino political 
representation, focusing instead on the city's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the differences between the two were aggravated considerably after a 
pro-business political action committee -- the Southern California Caucus -- 
put out a mailer the Saturday before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the mailer accused Hernandez of falsely telling voters he 
was a Vietnam veteran. It urged residents to vote for Perez and the two 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Hispanic community feels very betrayed by what Raul had done in 
his attack on me," said Hernandez, who denied that he ever claimed he was a 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Perez acknowledged that some alarmed voters had called and questioned his role 
in the mailer. He said he had applied for the support of the PAC months before 
the election but hadn't heard anything since. He said he did not give 
permission for his name to be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew this thing was going to come out," Perez said. "Sometime down the 
road we're going to have to be able to talk. I think we have the same goals in 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Carey, the executive director of the Southern California Caucus, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he has started making arrangements to hold several neighborhood 
meetings next month to get more local residents involved in city government. He 
envisions working on a citizenship drive. The 1980 Census indicated that 54% of 
the city's Latino residents were not citizens. Perez said he also plans to 
visit local schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important now that Hispanics are elected that they show up (in the 
community)," Perez said. "We need a lot of role models." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also talks of organizing a citizenship drive for city residents and 
entering the schools to deliver a message against gangs and drug abuse. He 
talks of giving Latinos opportunities to fill more key positions in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
None of the city's top nine administrators are Latinos, and only two of the 
city's 18 appointed commissioners are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like that have to change," Hernandez said. "This is a new era." 
</P>
<P>
Perez was the top vote-getter with 1,775 votes, followed by Cunningham, who 
received 1,500 votes. Hernandez finished with 1,366 votes, 27 votes ahead of 
Councilman Jim Roberts, who lost the seat he had held since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of the city's 7,604 registered voters turned out in last 
Tuesday's election compared to the 32% who voted in the last council contest in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The new councilmen are scheduled to be sworn in on Tuesday.

MORE MAKING CHOICE TO CAST VOTES BY MAIL IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, there were so few absentee ballot applications that City 
Clerk Shelba Powell handled them by herself. This year she hired 22 temporary 
election workers to process the flood of absentee requests received by her 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk's office sent out 13,345 absentee ballots for last week's municipal 
elections, a record number for an April election in Long Beach and 5,355 more 
than the office sent out for the last citywide municipal election in 1988. 
Voters returned 7,557 absentee ballots, representing 4.3% of the total voter 
turnout Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The growing numbers reflect a statewide trend in the use of absentee ballots 
that this year prompted the secretary of state's office to warn city clerks to 
be prepared for a last-minute onslaught of the ballots that would slow counting 
on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, bleary-eyed election workers were still tallying the last of the 
absentee ballots at 3 a.m. Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should begin to call it vote by mail," joked Sid Solomon, 
political action chairman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, a citywide 
political group. 
</P>
<P>
Absentee vote counts have been climbing since 1978, when state law was changed 
so that voters no longer needed an excuse such as illness or travel to request 
an absentee ballot. Now anyone who would prefer not to make the trek to the 
polls on Election Day can use an absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cerritos council races, one candidate, Charles J. Kim, received more 
votes by absentee balloting (1,135), than he did in the polling booth (802). 
The number of absentee ballots cast in the Cerritos elections was three times 
greater than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The absentee vote continues to increase in California, I think for a couple of 
reasons," said Jeff Adler, a political consultant who is helping run Mayor 
Ernie Kell's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Candidates are more and more turning to them as an effective campaign tool to 
spread the message and try to motivate voters," Adler said. "Secondly, voters 
like them because it makes it easy to participate." 
</P>
<P>
In last Tuesday's election, Kell received 3,416 absentee votes -- more than 
twice the number of absentee ballots cast for all the candidates running in the 
1984 council races. 
</P>
<P>
In an era of dismal voter turnout -- only 25% of Long Beach's registered voters 
bothered to vote last week -- absentee ballots are seen as a way of nudging 
people to the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
"Well listen, they got to do something to increase the voter turnout," Solomon 
said. "I'm in favor of the whole system going by mail. They aren't going to the 
polls." 
</P>
<P>
A number of candidates in the Long Beach election sent out absentee ballot 
applications as part of their campaign mailing. In Kell's case, the 
applications came with prepaid return postage, with the name of the voter 
printed on the application. The only thing the voter had to do was sign the 
application and pop it in the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Absentee ballots are not only a way of encouraging a vote, but they can 
encourage a vote in favor of a particular candidate. "You're making it easier 
to vote for your candidate or your issue," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much standard in any reasonably well-organized campaign," said 
mayoral candidate and Councilman Tom Clark, who routinely woos the absentee 
vote in his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, Clark added, it will force candidates to step up their 
campaigns earlier in the election season to reach voters before they send in 
their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes more work for the clerk's office, which accepts absentee ballots 
in a given election until the polls close on Election Day. Workers must then 
process the last-minute arrivals, matching the absentee signatures with the 
voter registration records before they can be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy campaign promotion of absentee applications has raised criticism in some 
races. In one recent state Assembly contest in central California, the 
Republican Party caused a stir when it hired temporary workers to walk 
precincts and collect absentee ballot applications. 
</P>
<P>
But Adler says he sees nothing wrong with getting campaign workers involved in 
absentee applications. "I don't think they're involved in the process any more 
than when a campaign goes out and registers voters."

'GROW YOUR OWN' TEACHER TRAINING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LONG BEACH SCHOOLS WILL OFFER A SPECIAL CLASS TO ENTICE MINORITY 
STUDENTS INTO TEACHING.

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to match the ethnic diversity of its student population, the 
school district will offer a special class this fall to encourage students to 
return to their schools as teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very positive mix of students and we would very much like to 
increase the racial and ethnic mix of our teaching staff," said Helen Z. 
Hansen, an assistant superintendent for personnel services in the Long Beach 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The class will show students how to develop lessons, select teaching materials 
and allow them to play the role of teacher at elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Williams, district programs specialist, calls it a "grow our own" plan 
that will guarantee students a teacher-training position while they are in 
college and a priority for a full-time job once they receive their teaching 
credential. 
</P>
<P>
Of the district's nearly 69,000 students, less than 31% are white. But almost 
81% of its teachers are white. As a result, students are deprived of role 
models in their own ethnic groups and there are few people who can communicate 
with them in their own languages, school officials said. One of every four 
students in the district cannot speak English proficiently. 
</P>
<P>
The district has a serious shortage of bilingual teachers. About 300 teachers 
have been given waivers to teach on the condition that they will learn Spanish, 
according to Felice Strauss, president of the Teachers Assn. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them really aren't qualified to be teaching what they're teaching," 
Strauss said. She hailed the district's new program, which she hopes will also 
fill the critical need for special-education teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect an ethnically mixed group to enroll for the new class at 
Millikan, Poly and Wilson high schools. If successful, the yearlong program 
will be expanded to the district's two other high schools, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe these perks could be the incentive for kids to get into our 
program," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Unified officials are working with Long Beach City College and Cal 
State Long Beach, where administrators say they want minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach City College, there are plans to form a Teachers of Tomorrow 
Club, said Minnie Douglas, affirmative action officer.

And at Cal State Long Beach, there is a new program called Impact TEACH, aimed 
at helping minority students interested in education with test preparation, 
tutoring and some scholarships, according to Michael Grant, the project's 
co-director. Subsidized by a $64,000 grant from the state, the program also 
will provide support through a career help center and workshops, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of success so far, which is amazing because our numbers have 
been so low," Grant said. "However, I see a reversal. Minority students are 
saying, 'We're interested in teaching, but we need proper guidance.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least 85% of the students at Cal State Long Beach recommended for education 
credentials in 1988 were white, according to university spokeswoman Toni Beron. 
</P>
<P>
About 89% of the 803 students graduating responded to the survey, and of those 
who responded 1.3% were black and 6.4% were Latino, Beron said. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are grim across the nation as minority college students go to other 
professions that lured them with promises of higher salaries and more status. 
The number of black college graduates receiving teaching certificates, for 
example, declined from 12,992 in 1977 to 5,456 in 1985, according to the 
National Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
To reverse the trend, school districts are trying a number of approaches. The 
Long Beach plan is modeled after a similar program at Gardena High School. The 
neighboring Los Angeles Unified School District has a 5-year-old magnet program 
at Crenshaw High School called Teachers Training Academy, which is described by 
educators as a model program in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, future teacher clubs have been revived at the five high schools 
within the last two years, Williams said. "The clubs were the first step," she 
said. The class this fall is the next step, she continued. The course will give 
students "a little taste of what it feels like to be a teacher."

Robert Nebel, 51, happily believes he has a split personality. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for instance, he walked around dressed as a parrot to advertise an 
Anaheim nightclub called Crackers. On weekend nights he worked there as an 
X-rated stand-up comedian. 
</P>
<P>
His risque act made even hardy audiences wince, so he assumed another persona: 
Garbi the Hobo Clown, who specializes in children's birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a different person in my day-to-day ordinary life," said Nebel, who lives 
in Anaheim and has a night job at a printing company in Commerce. "The guys 
would ask me to tell jokes, but I told them I don't mix the two jobs." 
</P>
<P>
It is a different story when Nebel puts on his hobo clown costume and makes 
kids giggle, often using magic to make doves and rabbits appear and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out there to make people happy," said Nebel, an Air Force veteran who has 
spent much of his life as a drive-in theater manager. 
</P>
<P>
His entrance into show business came eight years ago, when "an agent friend of 
mine was looking for a monthlong clown act in Japan and I said I could do it, 
so I put together the hobo clown outfit." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Japanese were not interested in that kind of clown. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Nebel, "since I invested a lot of time and money on the hobo 
character, I started doing it on my own. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a great source of happiness for me. Once a little girl came up, put 
her arms around me and said, 'Mr. Clown, that was so nice.' I'll never forget 
that moment." 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, he said, "the three things I wanted most in life was my own 
home, a nice car and a family." He has the house and car, "but my marriage 
didn't work out, and I never had a family." 
</P>
<P>
But he has clowning and magic to make him happy. "I enjoy it, and it helps me 
carry on my life." 
</P>
<P>
Nebel is a member of the Magic Castle in Hollywood and, he says, "one of these 
days I'm going to be a performer there." 
</P>
<P>
However, he already has something like it at his home in Anaheim. One room is 
decorated with photographs of hobo clowns, a pool table and a make-believe 
electric chair from a film studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was used in the movie 'Bird Man of Alcatraz,' " Nebel said. It 
makes an electrical buzzing sound when someone sits in it.

BOYS' SCHOOL TO ADMIT GIRLS IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major break from tradition, Junipero Serra High School in Gardena is 
planning to add pink tiles to one of its locker rooms, romance novels to its 
library and, most important, girls to its all-male student body. 
</P>
<P>
"Serra Men," as the more than 4,000 graduates of the 40-year-old Roman Catholic 
school are known, will become "Serra Men and Women" after the school enrolls 
its first female students in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Principal James Crowell, himself a 1970 Serra graduate, began pursuing 
coeducation about two years ago when the school's enrollment began declining 
significantly and it became clear that Serra was losing potential students to 
coeducational parochial schools in Torrance and Playa del Rey. From 1986 to 
this school year, Serra's enrollment has dropped from 520 to an all-time low of 
266. 
</P>
<P>
"An all-boy school is really a holdover from the past," said Crowell, who spent 
14 years at Serra as a teacher and dean before becoming principal last year. 
</P>
<P>
Serra's boys are enthusiastic about the change. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys are in favor of it," said Kenny Davis, student body president and a 
star Serra basketball player. He said it will be strange to return to Serra 
after graduating this year and "see young ladies walking around." 
</P>
<P>
Serra already has three all-girl sister schools in Compton, Inglewood and Los 
Angeles, which provide cheerleaders for Serra games and whose students are 
invited to Serra dances. But the boys said that having girls on campus all day 
will be different. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give us a chance to mingle a little bit and not just look at other 
guys," said Christopher Rogers, 16, a junior who will graduate before the girls 
arrive. "I think the guys may be more mature. You can't act like a fool in 
front of a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the change. 
</P>
<P>
"There is enough time after they graduate from high school to start mingling 
with girls," said Shirley Smith, who heads Serra's parent-teacher organization. 
"They'll be doing that for the rest of their lives. I guess I'm a little 
old-fashioned about that." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she supports the move only because Serra's future may be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The new shower tiles and reading material are just a couple of the ideas 
Crowell has to prepare the school for coeducation. Serra will also renovate 
four bathrooms for the female students and hold special workshops for teachers 
and current students to help them adjust to the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Archdiocesan officials have not yet determined whether Serra will admit girls 
gradually over four years, starting with the freshman class next year, or 
completely integrate all four grade levels at once. The former option, school 
officials said, might lessen the impact on area all-girls schools, which could 
lose students to Serra. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a girl's school and we stress that," said an administrator at St. Mary's 
Academy in Inglewood who declined to discuss Serra's change to coeducation. "If 
this is the kind of education they want, they'll go here."

REAL ESTATE Q&amp; A: NOT ALL PROCEEDS FROM HOME SALE NEED TO BE USED FOR 
REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a problem I haven't seen in your column before. Due to 
illness and unemployment, we must sell our home to pay overdue bills and avoid 
foreclosure. Our home should sell for at least $175,000 and we only owe about 
$92,432, so we will receive enough cash from the sale to pay our bills and have 
enough left over for a down payment on another house. 
</P>
<P>
But we are receiving conflicting information from the IRS and a tax preparer as 
to our tax situation. We called the IRS and were told we must reinvest all our 
cash from the sale into another house of equal or greater cost if we are to 
avoid tax on our profit. But our tax preparer says all we need to do to avoid 
tax is buy a house costing at least as much as the net sales price of our 
current home. Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your tax preparer is right. The IRS is wrong. The government's own 
surveys show the IRS gives out incorrect information to at least 30% of the 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
The roll-over residence replacement rule requires total profit tax deferral 
when you sell your home and buy a replacement principal residence of equal or 
greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
However, contrary to the information you obtained from the IRS, Internal 
Revenue Code 1034 does not require you to reinvest all your sale proceeds into 
your replacement home. If you wish, you can sell your old home for cash, spend 
it as you wish and defer your profit tax by buying a replacement home for 
nothing down (such as with a VA mortgage) if its cost equals or exceeds your 
old home's net (adjusted) sales price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Is Better to Inherit Than Receive by Gift 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 72 and am thinking I should give my real estate away now to my three 
adult children to get it out of my estate. But my wife is opposed to the idea. 
Our net equity is about $2 million. Our children are very devoted to us and 
they would continue to give us the net rental income from these properties. We 
are comfortably well off. Do you think we should divide up our properties now 
while we are still in good health? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. With careful estate planning, you and your wife can exclude at least 
$1.2 million of assets from federal estate tax. Giving your properties away now 
would hurt your children, because they will take over your low basis in the 
properties. However, if they inherit the properties they will receive a new 
basis, stepped-up to market value on the date the last spouse dies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Advantageous to Invest as Partnership 
</P>
<P>
Q: Three of us want to buy land as an investment and include a buy-out 
agreement in case one of us wants to sell the property. Also, we want to 
specify what happens if one investor can't pay his share of the property 
expenses, such as property taxes. We contemplate a 10-year holding period. One 
investor wants a tenancy in common but my lawyer suggests holding title in 
partnership. Which do you think is best? 
</P>
<P>
A: The big advantage of holding title in a partnership is the partnership 
agreement can provide for many contingencies such as a buy-out agreement among 
the partners. A major disadvantage of a tenancy in common is one or more 
unhappy co-owners could bring a partition lawsuit to either force the division 
of the property or its sale. In my opinion, partnership ownership is much more 
flexible than holding title as tenants in common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Is the Best Time to Refinance Property? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have about $70,000 equity in my house. My fixed-interest rate is 10.25%, 
so I wouldn't save interest by refinancing now. However, I could use the extra 
cash for an investment. When do you think I should refinance? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't see any reason for you to refinance your existing mortgage because 
today's fixed-interest rate is about what you are now paying. A better 
alternative might be to add a home-equity credit line mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the interest rate will be a little higher than 10.25%, the credit line 
flexibility allows you to pay interest only on the money you actually borrow. 
The money can be borrowed and paid back at your convenience. Home-equity credit 
lines are very advantageous. Shop around for the best deal among banks and 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Down Payment on a Home Is Not New 
</P>
<P>
Q: In reply to a reader who criticized you for suggesting home buyers make a 
small down payment you said, "Uncle Sam makes me do it." Then you explained the 
1987 Tax Act makes it smart for home buyers to make the smallest possible down 
payment and obtain the largest available mortgage. My question is, before this 
tax law change, how much down payment did you advise home buyers to make? 
</P>
<P>
A: Last week I had occasion to review some of my old columns. Way back in the 
dark ages of June 1977, in answer to a question, I replied: "Always invest as 
little cash as possible when buying property. Get the biggest mortgage you can 
afford." That advice hasn't changed, but now I can blame it on Uncle Sam's tax 
law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Apartment Loan Is Not Easy 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to buy the 23-unit apartment building where my mother resides. 
The owner and I have agreed on the price that, I think, is a bargain. I will be 
making a 25% cash down payment. But my problem is finding a lender willing to 
make a 75% fixed-interest rate mortgage. I can't find such a loan, even at an 
interest rate up to 12%. All the lenders want to make is adjustables, and I 
think they are too risky. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: Be thankful. Buying apartments today is usually not a good idea because the 
net income is rarely high enough to produce a decent yield on cash invested. 
Mortgage lenders realize this, so most don't want to make apartment loans. 
Single-family residence loans are far safer mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
I hope your purchase offer has a finance contingency clause, so you can get out 
of the purchase if you cannot obtain the specified loan. But if you really want 
to buy that apartment building, consult a mortgage broker who is experienced 
placing apartment loans. The best mortgage brokers can find a lender for 
virtually every situation, although the cost often is not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Agent Remove Sign When House Sold? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I recently bought a house. We have removed all the 
contingencies, have arranged our mortgage and are waiting for the sale to close 
early next month. But the realtor still has a "For Sale" sign on our house and 
there is even a lockbox on the front door. 
</P>
<P>
I asked a friend to phone the agent and he was told the house is sold, but the 
brokerage has a similar house for sale nearby. The agent is obviously using the 
sign to "bait and switch" prospective buyers to other listings. She says it is 
her company's policy. Don't you think it is unethical to leave a for sale sign 
and a lockbox on a house long after it is sold? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. But some realtors will argue that the house really isn't sold until the 
deed is recorded. However, it would be virtually impossible to sell your house 
a second time, unless you canceled your purchase contract and the seller 
released you from further obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate firms rush to put up a "Sold" sign because that is their best 
advertising to get more listings in the neighborhood. Other firms prefer a 
"Sale Pending" sign, but that is very acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
However, if a "For Sale" sign stays up a long time on a house that indicates 
the agent may not be doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Your friend's report of the bait-and-switch tactic of the realty agent confirms 
the agent's deception. As for leaving the lockbox on the front door, I don't 
understand why the seller allows that, since the house is sold. After your sale 
closes, I suggest you report the matter to both the local Board of Realtors and 
to the state real estate commissioner for investigation and possible discipline 
against the agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agent Protected If Home Sold by Owner 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our home was listed for sale until the listing expired at the first of last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to take the house off the market while we paint and recarpet. But a 
prospective buyer who saw the house while it was listed called last night to 
ask if we were still interested in selling. We said we were, so he and his wife 
are coming over in a few days for a second look. Then it occurred to me we may 
have to pay the agent a sales commission because she gave us a list of 
prospects who saw the house and this couple's name is on the list. What should 
we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Reread your listing contract. I'll bet it has a "savings clause" that says 
if a prospective buyer who registered with you during the listing term buys the 
house within 90 days after the listing expires, then you owe the listing agent 
a sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
Such a clause is intended to protect the realty agent if a registered buyer 
gets together with the seller to work out a sale after the listing expires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Owner Bears Risk of Any Damage 
</P>
<P>
Q: In mid-January we contracted to buy a house. But just a week before the sale 
was supposed to close, a fire damaged the house very badly. We obviously don't 
want the house, even though the seller has offered to give us the fire 
insurance proceeds. However, the seller refuses to refund our $10,000 earnest 
money deposit, which is being held by the real estate broker. What should we 
do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Destruction of the subject matter is grounds for canceling a real estate 
purchase contract. In other words, the property seller bears the risk of loss 
until the house is deeded to you. If necessary, retain an attorney to get your 
money refunded quickly.Should Agent Sue Over Canceled Listing? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a real estate agent with a big problem. About four months ago, I took a 
six-month exclusive right listing on a large elegant home. My broker spent a 
small fortune advertising the house, printing brochures, holding weekend open 
houses and doing everything possible to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
But the seller is very difficult. He wants a price that is considerably higher 
than market value and we told him so. We obtained two purchase offers, but he 
didn't accept them and he wouldn't make any counteroffers. Last week, the 
seller canceled the listing for no reason. 
</P>
<P>
My broker thinks we should sue the seller for canceling the listing. The seller 
said he just changed his mind about selling. Our listing contract says the 
seller owes the full sales commission if he cancels the listing without cause. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You seem to have spent considerable time and money to sell this 
listing. The seller's unjustified listing cancellation entitles you to the full 
sales commission as specified in the listing contract. You and your broker have 
nothing to lose and much to gain by suing for the sales commission.

SPEAKING OUT: WOULD LICENSING IMPROVE APPRAISAL QUALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON MARTIN, Martin is a former Texas real estate appraiser now employed 
as a review appraiser for a major Southern California financial institution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former civil servant, I have often been witness to the ineffectuality of 
the federal government in its response to problems of national importance. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, as a combatant in the "War on Hunger," I worked under the 
political appointee who proclaimed ketchup to be a vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a real estate appraiser facing federally mandated licensing and 
certification requirements, I am again witnessing what promises to be an 
impractical, ineffectual response to a national problem. 
</P>
<P>
The "problem," as described by "The Barnard Report" of the House subcommittee 
on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, is this: 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of savings and loans . . . have been severely weakened or declared 
insolvent because faulty and fraudulent real estate appraisals provided 
documentation for loans larger than justified by the collateral's real value. . 
. . Of greatest concern is 'client advocacy appraising,' wherein large numbers 
of appraisers willingly agree, or otherwise succumb to pressure brought to bear 
by lenders, borrowers, and others involved in the loan origination and 
underwriting process." 
</P>
<P>
More simply, our system has been operating without the checks and balances to 
guarantee objective and accurate appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and mortgage loan borrowers put pressure on appraisers to increase 
the appraised value of their collateral so they can borrow more. What has 
evolved is a group of "developer's darlings" who manipulate appraisals to hit 
target values. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision now counteracts this by requiring thrift 
institution appraisals to be solicited by lenders, not borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have not yet been required to do the same, although such a 
rule has been proposed. One bank's chief review appraiser confided to me that 
about 80% of the borrower-solicited appraisals he reviewed were biased. 
</P>
<P>
Lenders too can corrupt appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage lending business has become fiercely competitive, with loan agents 
required to make ever more loans or face loss of income, employment or career 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
Loan agent compensation based on commissions exacerbates the problem. Hefty 
loan origination fees can also be collected before selling a bad loan to a 
third party. Herein lies the pressure on appraisers to produce values that 
"support the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem besetting the appraisal profession is "assembly-line 
appraising," in which appraisal reports lacking adequate research and analysis 
are hastily assembled by otherwise competent appraisers or their subordinates 
so as to maximize turnover and profits. 
</P>
<P>
This form of negligence is often mistaken for "incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
Given this unsatisfactory status quo, the federal response is that each state 
"register, license, and . . . certify" real estate appraisers, requiring 
appraisers to demonstrate competence by passing examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "The Barnard's Report's" central concern seemed to be appraiser misconduct 
rather than incompetence. Extensive testimony divulged that many appraisers 
involved in thrift failures held the highest credentials recognized by the 
appraisal profession. 
</P>
<P>
Many acts of appraisal incompetence, too, are actually acts of negligence or 
laziness by qualified appraisers who could easily pass an examination. 
Examinations will thus require all fraudulent and negligent appraisers to 
demonstrate competence before they can continue their destruction of our 
nation's financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The other advantage of licensing, we are told, is that licenses can be revoked 
for misconduct. This fear of revocation will supposedly give appraisers the 
same incentive to behave as properly as other licensed professionals, such as 
real estate agents, securities dealers and attorneys. God help us all! 
</P>
<P>
Many forget that some of the states hardest hit by appraiser misconduct, such 
as Texas and Florida, have for years required appraisers to have real estate 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Wall Street Journal article focusing on Texas appraiser corruption 
noted that the abuses were not curbed until federal regulators successfully 
prosecuted or sued some appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
The reported consensus among Texas appraisers was that the federal actions have 
now made them "extremely conservative in their estimates." It was the fear of 
fines or incarceration, not the loss of a license, that cleaned up the 
profession in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, state licensing law enforcement would actually divert scarce 
enforcement resources away from the prosecution of appraisal fraud. In Florida, 
appraisers have been jailed, not for fraud, but for practicing without a 
Florida real estate license, even if they had licenses from other states. 
</P>
<P>
Does occupational licensing work? 
</P>
<P>
The American Enterprise Institute for Policy Research reported in 1980 that the 
consensus of scholarly literature on the subject was that the public interest 
defenses for occupational licensing were generally of questionable merit, and 
the improvement in the quality of service was debatable. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of licensing extended mainly to licensees by raising the cost of 
entry into a profession, restricting the supply of professionals, thereby 
increasing their earnings. Licensing systems end up protecting the profession 
rather than the public. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing was also found to stifle professional innovation, something 
appraisers need to respond to an increasingly complicated and sophisticated 
real estate investment marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of appraiser certification, the next step beyond licensing, envision 
a system similar to the public accounting profession, wherein "certified 
appraisers" would have status akin to CPAs, not necessarily ideal role models. 
</P>
<P>
Recent scandals have shown the limitations of "Big Eight" auditors in 
uncovering and reporting unsound corporate financial conditions. The same 
weakness of the proposed appraiser regulatory system parallels that of the 
public accounting profession, namely the conflict of interest stemming from an 
agent-client relationship. Accounting firms often find it difficult to bite the 
hand that feeds them. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with regulating appraisers is who will do it. Can each state 
come up with impartial and effective licensing/certification boards, or will 
politics prevail? 
</P>
<P>
Special-interest lobbying and discord has already been intense. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors' associations particularly want to rule appraisers so as to provide 
employment opportunities for their own members, but can realtors provide 
objective opinions of value while simultaneously selling, leasing or managing 
their clients' properties? 
</P>
<P>
Although this conflict of interest already exists at many full-service real 
estate firms, why put foxes in charge of the henhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, appraiser licensing/ certification is not harmful, either, but it 
is also not the panacea it is envisioned to be by its congressional architects, 
because it does not provide sufficient incentives for appraisers to be honest 
and diligent. 
</P>
<P>
As the eyes of the nation are upon Texas with respect to appraiser misconduct, 
so can we observe a more effective solution to the problem -- increased federal 
investigation and enforcement -- which has already scared the Texas appraisal 
community into good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the two emotions prevailing in the real estate business are greed 
and fear. The latter goes far in combatting the former.

YOUR MORTGAGE: HOME SELLER CAN BE GOOD SOURCE OF FINANCING; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND MORTGAGES: WITH THE MARKET SLOWDOWN, MORE SELLERS ARE OFFERING TO CARRY 
BACK LOANS TO HELP BUYERS CONSUMMATE THE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When most home buyers go looking for a loan, they visit the usual places: 
banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage-brokerage firms and the like. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes their best source of financing is right under their nose -- the 
seller himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the buyer and the seller can benefit from seller-financing," said Larry 
Arman, a broker and owner of the Re/Max office in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"The buyer gets the financing he needs to close the deal, while the seller gets 
to collect monthly payments at an interest rate that's better than he'd get if 
he put his money into a bank." 
</P>
<P>
Seller-financing typically involves the use of a second mortgage, usually 
called a seller "take-back" or "carry-back." 
</P>
<P>
A typical seller-financing deal might work like this: 
</P>
<P>
Buyer Baker wants to purchase a $150,000 home with a 10% down payment of 
$15,000. But the bank will only lend him $125,000 at a 10% interest rate, which 
would leave him $10,000 short. 
</P>
<P>
To close the deal, Seller Smith could agree to take back a $10,000 second 
mortgage at a 12% annual rate, with interest-only payments due each month and a 
lump sum "balloon" payment of $10,000 due and payable in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Buyer Baker would make a payment of about $1,097 to the bank each month for his 
first mortgage loan. He would also write a second check to Smith for $100, 
representing interest on the second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Baker would have seven years to come up with the $10,000, or could eventually 
refinance to pay Smith off. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement helps Baker because he gets to buy a house even though the bank 
wouldn't finance the entire purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, meantime, makes $100 a month in interest earnings -- much more than he 
would make if he put $10,000 into a savings account -- and has the security of 
knowing that he can foreclose and get the home back if Baker doesn't repay all 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
Many realtors say that finding a seller who is willing to provide some of the 
financing has become easier over the last several months, thanks to the sales 
slowdown that has affected many areas in California and across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There really wasn't any seller-financing going on a year ago because the 
market was so incredibly hot that nobody really wanted to carry back a second," 
said Tom Williams, a senior vice president with Coldwell Banker Residential 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that sales have settled down a bit, we're seeing more sellers offer to 
provide some financing because it makes their home a little easier to market." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers who are willing to help out with the financing usually say so in their 
newspaper advertisements, Williams said. The ads often use the initials OWC for 
"owner will carry." 
</P>
<P>
People who have had their home on the market for several months are also 
sometimes willing to provide seller-financing, as are workers who are being 
transferred out of town and need to sell their home fast. 
</P>
<P>
Older sellers who own their homes free-and-clear and don't need the sales 
proceeds in one big chunk are also good candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd get a lump sum payment as soon as escrow closes, and then collect 
payments on the mortgage they took back to supplement their monthly retirement 
income," said Arman, the Re/Max broker. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are a few drawbacks to financing a purchase with the help of a 
seller carry-back. You'll have to make two payments each month instead of one, 
and the rate on the carry-back will likely be at least two points higher than 
the rate on the first mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
More important, most lenders will consider the payment on the carry-back when 
they're determining how big of a first mortgage you can get. As a result, the 
bank may decide to reduce the size of the loan that it will give you -- and the 
seller would have to increase the size of his carry-back. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some financial institutions simply won't loan money to borrowers who 
will also be paying on a carry-back, in part because lenders have trouble 
selling the loans on the secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the bank will have to keep the loan on its books for years 
until you refinance, sell or pay off your mortgage -- and many lenders don't 
like to tie up their cash for that long.

HOME IMPROVEMENT;

DOING WALL DETECTIVE WORK: FINDING STUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, thousands of people, especially children, are seriously injured by 
improperly mounted objects falling off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you own or rent your home, sooner or later, you will have the need to 
anchor a heavy picture, mirror, bookshelf, wall unit or other item on a 
plaster, wood panel or drywall surface. 
</P>
<P>
To do it safely, the mounting hardware should be secured to the vertical lumber 
(studs) inside a plaster, wood panel or drywall surface. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the studs can sometimes be tricky because they are hidden inside the 
wall. One sure-fire but undesirable way to find a stud is to drive a nail into 
the wall at one inch intervals along a horizontal line in the area where you 
want to hang the heavy object until you feel the resistance of the nail 
penetrating solid wood. 
</P>
<P>
This method is both time consuming and damaging to the wall. Here are some 
ideas for making stud finding a lot easier: 
</P>
<P>
Use an electronic stud finder. Another terrific spin-off of the electronic 
revolution for home improvement is a device called an electronic stud sensor. 
This tool is battery powered and operates by sensing changes in the wall 
density that indicate the presence of a solid object inside the wall. 
</P>
<P>
This instrument is about the size of a pocket calculator and works by slowly 
moving it across the wall surface in the mounting area until a row of lights 
illuminate, indicating the stud location. It is sold under the brand name 
Studsensor and is manufactured by Zircon International Inc. Most hardware 
stores and home centers carry it; prices range from $10 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
Measure from known studs. Although the electronic stud sensor is the best 
device on the market for stud finding, it is not 100% accurate. Sometimes 
non-standard wall construction or other obstructions in the wall result in 
either false readings or no reading at all. That's where the old-fashioned 
method of measuring from known wall studs is handy to know. 
</P>
<P>
During construction of a home, wall studs are normally placed 16 inches apart. 
Since room corners and door and window edges are always framed by studs, try 
measuring out horizontally from these points. Odds are that you will find studs 
at about 16-inch intervals. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you have a door and a window on a wall that are 8 feet apart, 
studs will normally be found between the door and window at 16, 32, 48, 64 and 
80 inches. 
</P>
<P>
When you have noted the multiple of 16 inches from the known wall stud in the 
desired mounting area, drive a thin nail into the wall to determine your 
accuracy. If you miss the stud, try the nail again one inch left or right of 
the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
Another variation on this technique is to measure laterally on the wall from 
the edge of light switches, electrical outlets or heating/air conditioning 
registers because these are always mounted on wall studs during construction. 
</P>
<P>
When measuring from a heat/AC register, hold the end of the tape at either the 
left or right of it, as there are studs on both sides. When measuring from an 
outlet or switch, try either side first since they attach to only one stud. If 
your first attempt is incorrect, try measuring from the opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
Knock on the wall. Still another method of stud location is to literally knock 
on the wall several times at the desired mounting location, and then left and 
right of it. A hollow sound means there is no stud, while a solid sound means 
you have probably hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Try the nail test at the spot where you hear the solid sound to assure that you 
have indeed found the stud. 
</P>
<P>
Look for dimples on the wall. The least consistent, but often successful stud 
finding technique to try on a drywall surface is to look for depressions or 
"dimples" on the wall that indicate nails. 
</P>
<P>
During construction the drywall sheets are nailed to every wall stud, and then 
the nails are covered with a thin layer of compound to give a smooth, finished 
surface. Sometimes, though, the finish work on the wall is not as good as it 
should be, and with very close examination, slight dimples can be seen where 
the nails penetrate the drywall into the studs. 
</P>
<P>
If you find such an irregularity in the mounting area, you can be almost 100% 
certain it indicates a stud. 
</P>
<P>
When looking for wall studs behind a wood panel wall, look closely for colored 
nail heads in the grooves of the panels. Any nails you find probably penetrate 
a wall stud behind the paneling.

OLD REFRIGERATORS COST COLD CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My old refrigerator/freezer has required several service calls 
lately and I should get a new one. Is there much difference in the 
energy-efficiency of refrigerators and what should I look for? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: An old refrigerator/freezer can be the energy-hungry appliance in your 
home. There is a tremendous variation in the energy-efficiency of 
refrigerator/freezers. The electricity savings from replacing your old 
refrigerator/freezer with a new, efficient one can pay back its purchase price 
over its lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Energy-efficient refrigerator/freezers use smaller motors and compressors that 
run less. Therefore, they should be virtually maintenance-free and quiet. Also, 
since they have more insulation, food stays colder for longer periods during 
power outages. 
</P>
<P>
The most efficient design has the freezer above the refrigerator. This design 
provides the most efficient flow of cold air throughout the unit. It also 
requires the least amount of door gasket length, an area of great energy loss. 
</P>
<P>
A typical side-by-side refrigerator/freezer uses about 25% more electricity 
than a comparable freezer-on-top model. It is inefficient and difficult to keep 
a tall vertical freezer cold enough, and there's more door gasket area. 
</P>
<P>
Select the smallest refrigerator/freezer that is an adequate size for your 
needs. A larger one loses more energy through its greater wall surface area. 
Also, a reasonably full refrigerator uses less electricity than a more-empty 
one. 
</P>
<P>
A manual-defrost model is most energy-efficient. In order to automatically self 
defrost, electric heaters come on inside your refrigerator and freezer several 
times a day to melt the frost. In addition to using electricity for the 
heaters, the compressor must run longer to cool it down again. 
</P>
<P>
A model with separate temperature controls for the refrigerator and freezer 
sections saves energy. Particularly, if you plan to keep frozen foods for 
extended periods, you can set the freezer section colder without needlessly 
lowering the temperature of the refrigerator section too. 
</P>
<P>
Some new energy-efficient models have a small door within the large 
refrigerator door. You can put frequently used items there so you won't have to 
open the large door as often. An exterior ice dispenser saves energy. This 
greatly reduces the loss of cold air and any frost buildup. 
</P>
<P>
You should select a model that has an energy-saver switch. There are small 
heaters near the door gasket area to reduce sweating. This switch turns these 
heaters off when sweating isn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 267 showing model numbers of 
100 of the highest-efficiency refrigerator/freezers from 12 to 28 cubic feet, 
capacities, and estimated annual electric operating costs for each. Please 
include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to

Leveling Insulation in Attic Good Idea 
</P>
<P>
Q: I looked up in my attic and the blown-in insulation was high in some spots 
and low in others. Is it worthwhile to take a rake and level it better? 
</P>
<P>
A: It would probably be a good idea to inspect it closer. Leveling it will 
reduce the overall energy loss through your attic floor. Wear a breathing mask 
and goggles when handling the insulation. Also, make sure that the insulation 
did not settle over the soffit vents and block them.

<P>
A grass that was rare is becoming more available, now that one of the largest 
wholesale growers, Hines Nurseries, produces it. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese blood grass, Imperata cylindrica 'Rubra,' looks like broken shards of 
stained glass when back lit in the garden. Each blade is green, turning to 
translucent red, and it is most dramatic planted in front of the sun. It 
spreads very slowly in Southern California to make small, 18-inch tall clumps 
and goes completely deciduous in winter. It takes ordinary watering. Robert

CAN NON-MARRIED COUPLE GET HOME MORTGAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My friend and I have lived together for the last three years and are 
now considering buying a house. She has a better credit record and more job 
security than I do, since I am a free-lancer with a pretty ragged income flow. 
We are worried about how a lender will consider such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You wouldn't believe how lenders attitudes have changed, compared to, 
say, 30 years ago. At that time, they not only didn't want to talk to you if 
you weren't a conventional, married couple but they could, and frequently did, 
deny credit to two-income families if the wife were in her child-bearing years. 
Questions about birth control measures were considered quite proper. 
</P>
<P>
The law, as well as our attitudes, have changed drastically. Today's lender, 
for instance, knows full well that non-married relationships have every bit as 
much longevity as many marriages. Today's divorce rate is about one in two. 
</P>
<P>
No, you shouldn't have any trouble with your lender on that score. By combining 
your cash and monthly incomes, you should be able to swing the deal even though 
one partner's clout is heftier than the other's. Each of you will sign the loan 
documents and assume responsibility for the debt -- if one fades out, the other 
is responsible for the whole. 
</P>
<P>
What you must do, however, is approach it as a legal partnership, with a 
written agreement that would cover the provisions for selling, the right of 
first refusal of the sale by one partner and how expenses are to be shared. 
Don't draw it up yourselves, though. Bring in a lawyer and have it done right. 
</P>

Coping With Lost Value of Townhouse 
</P>
<P>
Q: You had a column recently where a woman had bought a townhouse for $67,000 
that now has a market value of $49,000. You suggested that she turn it into a 
rental property. I would like to know how one can take a tax loss on the 
townhouse unless the selling price is below $49,000, plus depreciation. The 
adjusted basis for the rental should be $49,000 because it is lower than the 
purchase price -- according to the tax books I have read. 
</P>
<P>
A: There's nothing wrong with either your math or the books you've read. The 
only problem is that you missed the point I was making -- which was not to 
convert it to a rental for the purposes of taking a tax loss. 
</P>
<P>
I suggested, instead of laying out the $18,000 difference to the lender, that 
she convert it to a rental for a couple of years so that as income property, 
she can minimize her negative cash flow and take advantage as far as taxes are 
concerned, of the depreciation, maintenance, management, property taxes and 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
After two or three years, one of two things will have happened -- it will 
either have appreciated in value from that present market value of $49,000 or 
it will have held steady, or dropped in value even further. 
</P>
<P>
If it has appreciated, well and good. If it has dropped even further then, 
taking the depreciation into account, she may indeed have a tax loss that she 
can't claim now as a personal residence. I wasn't saying that the original 
value of the property, bought as a residence, would be the cost basis in 
computing any future loss as an income property. 
</P>
<P>
But converting it for the tax loss, if any, was the furthest thing from my 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Firms for Absent Home Lessors 
</P>
<P>
Q: My family and I will be moving out of the country for about three years. 
Rather than sell our house, we would like to rent it. I am at a loss about how 
to go about this since there is no family to oversee the property in our 
absence. I assume there are companies that do this, but how does one find them? 
Are there any pitfalls to be wary of? Who is responsible for any minor repairs 
while rented? 
</P>
<P>
A: Property management is a well-established business, and that's how you'll 
find it listed in your Yellow Pages. Any good, well-regarded real estate 
brokerage should be able to recommend two or three for you and in many cases, 
the realtor himself may have a subsidiary engaged in this activity. 
</P>
<P>
You might check the management company out with the local Better Business 
Bureau and before signing an agreement, get at least three references and check 
them out, personally. They should be people the management firm has worked for 
at least three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
The common arrangement calls for the absentee owner to keep a certain number of 
dollars in reserve with the property management company from which it will pay 
for minor repairs without even bothering you. Of course, if the furnace blows 
up and a major expense is faced (set a limit here), then the company will have 
to contact you for approval -- distance or no distance.

CALARTS AT 20: IT SPRANG FROM A DISNEY FAMILY GIFT AND HAS GROWN FROM ITS 
EUPHORIC BEGINNINGS TO RESPECTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pee-Wee Herman tap-danced across cafeteria tables and Ultra Violet worked the 
school switchboard. Theater students rehearsed Chekhov in a cow pasture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Juilliard on drugs," recalled one student. 
</P>
<P>
The professors were avant-garde artists who threw conventional training out the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"No grades, no degrees, no institutional hours," a music teacher said. "I told 
my students, 'Why should we meet every Thursday at 9:30 in the morning? Why not 
meet at my house at 5:30 in the afternoon when I've had a Scotch-and-soda and 
you can pick my brain.' " 
</P>
<P>
CalArts opened in 1970 as a daring experiment and a joyously chaotic scene. 
Physically, it looks much the same today. The Valencia campus, celebrating its 
20th anniversary, is marked by strange artwork everywhere. Dogs run loose. 
Students dance and drum and recite out loud in the halls. CalArts, largely 
because of its unconventional bent and the success of many of its alumni, is 
one of the most respected art schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But prominence has not come easily. This institute that grew out of the 1960s 
and sought to make its own rules has often been troubled by self-doubts. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years after the doors opened, reports of sex, drugs and nude 
swimming on campus overshadowed artistic exploits. Later, administrators 
complained that the unstructured approach had careened out of control. 
According to newspaper reports, members of Walt Disney's family, who founded 
CalArts, grew so frustrated and embarrassed that they offered USC, and then 
Pepperdine, $10 million to take the institute off their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say that a history of struggle has made CalArts strong and 
determined in its goals. Others insist that conflict has scared administrators 
and teachers away from the tradition-be-damned attitude that made the school 
revolutionary in the first place. They argue that CalArts has grown 
increasingly sedate over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the history of CalArts," said current president Steven 
Lavine, "there is the continual drama of change." 
</P>
<P>
The drama began with Walt Disney who, during his last years, drew initial plans 
to found a futuristic "Caltech of the arts." He envisioned a place with no 
walls between the various arts. Students would invent new forms of creation by 
blending the old ones -- music with painting, film with dance. Disney died in 
1966, but family and friends kept "Walt's dream" alive. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt's death was such a shock to all of us and our sense of loss so great, 
that we all latched onto the school as an outlet to express our appreciation 
for all that Walt meant to us," Donn B. Tatum, former director of the Walt 
Disney Company, said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Some $36 million was spent to begin construction on a starkly modern campus 
amid barren hills north of Los Angeles, at McBean Parkway and the Golden State 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the family had little idea how to proceed. Neither did the people 
enlisted as CalArts' board of trustees. The board hired two educators and gave 
them free rein. Robert Corrigan, dean of the art school at New York University, 
was chosen president. Second-in-command was Herbert Blau, who had quit the 
Lincoln Center Repertory Company after a brief and stormy tenure as 
co-director. Both men were liberal and disillusioned with traditional 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest challenge facing the arts and education," Corrigan said at the 
time, "is how to navigate the perilous course between adventure and 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
CalArts' course steered nearer to adventure as Corrigan and Blau assembled 
their faculty: Mel Powell, the jazz whiz kid and campus rebel at Yale's 
electronic music studio; Allan Kaprow, inventor of the hippie events called 
Happenings; John Baldessari, a leader in the Conceptual Art movement; and 
radical sociologist Maurice Stein. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Disneys giving their conservative money to an institute with an 
avant-garde agenda," said Blau, now an English professor at University of 
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Corrigan and Blau tried to hire Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, but the 
Disneys threat 
</P>
<P>
ened to withdraw their bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
If that incident foreshadowed trouble, no one took much notice. A more pressing 
dilemma was at hand. Labor strikes and bad weather had delayed completion of 
CalArts' 60-acre campus. The maiden class of 659 students arrived to no 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
So the institute raised camp at Villa Cabrini, an abandoned Catholic girls 
school in Burbank. The scene was Bauhaus mixed with '60s-radical and 
California-crazy. Barefoot students and babies. Blue-jeans and tie-dye. Opera 
and Indian ragas. 
</P>
<P>
Classes included tai chi, basic auto repair and sutra meditation. Some faculty 
and students saw no sense of order to CalArts, no evidence of teaching or 
learning, and some quit in the first months. 
</P>
<P>
"No hard feelings," Mel Powell said, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneys felt differently. "They were saying, 'What kind of monster have we 
created here?' " recalled Harrison Price, then chairman of the school's board 
of trustees. Blau and Stein were fired at the end of the first year. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts' second year began with excitement as the Valencia campus opened. But 
troubles soon continued. A faculty member who supported nude bathing on campus 
disrobed in front of the trustees. Another board meeting was visited by 
students dressed as giant penises. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people really pushed us to the brink," said Patty Disney, wife of Walt's 
grandson, Roy Jr., in a recent interview. "They were enormously insulting to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
More important, the institute was running up a huge deficit and the 
administration, comprised of artists, had little idea how to manage money. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to giggle a lot, because we'd be making decisions about things we knew 
nothing about," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
No one could have known that, amid all of this chaos, CalArts was nurturing a 
promising student body. 
</P>
<P>
John Baldessari's art classes included Matt Mullican, Ross Bleckner, David 
Salle, Kate Ericson, Eric Fischl and James Welling -- all of whom have since 
earned national reputations. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Baldessari would come back from Europe with a suitcase full of art 
books and magazines," Mullican said. "He'd empty the suitcase in the middle of 
the room and we'd all devour the stuff. We were learning the language of the 
art world. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that we thought we were all going to become famous," Mullican 
said. "All I can say is that we worked hard. It was tremendously competitive. 
We pressured ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In the theater department, Paul Reubens (better known as Pee-Wee Herman) 
rehearsed with Laraine Newman, Katey Sagal of "Married With Children" and David 
Hasselhoff of "Baywatch." Ed Harris, who went on to star in "The Right Stuff" 
and "The Abyss," arrived in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Other departments harbored students who are now successful film makers, 
dancers, animators and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether its graduates are actually more thoroughly schooled and 
self-conscious, or whether the art world has wanted to accept a CalArts degree 
as a badge of intelligence, students have swarmed over both coasts like a pack 
of elite professional soldiers," wrote Richard B. Woodward in the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about such success, CalArts alumni speak of the school's 
cross-pollination of the arts, its free-form structure. Leda Siskind, a theater 
graduate, recalled a performance where the ushers were nude. Robert Fernandez, 
a music graduate, told of a percussion concert that lasted until sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we did an experimental 'Macbeth' with African dancers and music," 
Harris said. "It was fairly embarrassing but, what the hell, we had nothing to 
lose. We were there to give anything a try." 
</P>
<P>
Institutes, however, cannot survive solely on promising students and 
experimental work. By 1972, enrollment had fallen from 1,000 to 650 and money 
woes threatened to close the place. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneys, who couldn't pay anyone to take their school, stepped in again. 
</P>
<P>
Corrigan was fired and replaced by William Lund, a 40-year-old economist and 
Walt's son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Lund arrived amid a "bushy-headed, bra-less and barefoot student body," 
according to a story in The Times. As temporary president, he promised no major 
changes. A month later, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to become more traditional in our approach," Lund said, using words 
like "weirdo" and "X-rated" to describe the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five of CalArts' 325 faculty and staff were fired. Structured schedules 
were introduced. Classes were trimmed back with one exception -- the Disney 
studio was having trouble finding qualified animators so CalArts established an 
animation department. Within a year, the institute was operating on budget. 
</P>
<P>
Some credit Lund with saving CalArts. Others see his tenure as the end of an 
idealistic experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"It really became an uninteresting school without the freedoms that were there 
before," said Robert Blalack, an alumnus who won an Academy Award for special 
effects in "Star Wars." "The school fell way short of its vision." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reubens: "The only damage that was done by the nude swimming and wild 
parties and long hair was that it reflected on the Disney image. With a 
well-placed publicist, they could have deflected the bad publicity rather than 
changing the school." 
</P>
<P>
For good or bad, CalArts persevered. In 1975, Robert Fitzpatrick took over as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious and only 34 years old, Fitzpatrick had been a Baltimore city 
councilman and dean of students at Johns Hopkins University. Time magazine 
listed him among the country's "200 rising leaders." CalArts was calm when 
Fitzpatrick arrived, but he quickly stirred things up with his trademark 
combination of bluntness and idealism. 
</P>
<P>
At a trustees meeting -- held on the corner of Mickey Avenue and Dopey Drive at 
Disney headquarters -- the new president delivered a do-or-die ultimatum: 
either pour $10 million into the institute or shut the doors. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a bluff," Fitzpatrick said in a recent phone interview from Paris 
where he now heads Euro Disneyland, a $2-billion resort project under 
construction outside Paris. "I told them that if CalArts could not do what it 
does well, then it should cease to exist." 
</P>
<P>
CalArts got the money. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick then persuaded several board members to resign and brought on names 
like wealthy businessman Jon Lovelace and Edie Wasserman, wife of MCA chairman 
Lew Wasserman. And he did the unthinkable -- he told teachers to start giving 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it as the Reagan years at CalArts," recalled Cathey P. Edwards, a 
film school alumna. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fitzpatrick: "I'm sure those early years at CalArts were a wonderfully 
euphoric period. But it couldn't have lasted and it shouldn't have lasted. At 
some point, faculty has a responsibility to teach and students have a 
responsibility to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Fitzpatrick turned his sights outward. 
</P>
<P>
On any given night, he would show up at two or three parties around town to 
"carry the word" about CalArts. He was famous for working a room. When he 
attended theater or concerts he would arrive at the very last moment so the 
entire audience witnessed his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been notorious for my humility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of 13 years, Fitzpatrick raised $58 million for the institute. 
He recalls courting Wasserman, who agreed to donate $100,000 if Fitzpatrick 
wouldn't smoke during their meeting. He immediately put out his cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Having arranged scholastic and financial matters to satisfaction, Fitzpatrick 
accepted directorship of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. Such festivals had 
traditionally run a disastrous second to the athletic events, but Fitzpatrick 
turned Los Angeles' festival into a rousing success. His image was boosted 
immeasurably, and CalArts rode the coattails of that success. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice coincidence of timing because a lot of things happened at once," 
Fitzpatrick recalled. "John Baldessari began to become well-known. A lot of 
earlier students, the Matt Mullicans and David Salles, began to have a 
startling impact on the art world." 
</P>
<P>
Some students and faculty contended that Fitzpatrick neglected his duties on 
campus while seeking acclaim elsewhere. Nevertheless, in a relatively short 
time CalArts had risen to financial stability and prominence. And in 1987, 
Fitzpatrick left for Euro Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"For 13 years I had one of the most interesting jobs on the face of the earth," 
he said. "I was the orchestra conductor, if you will. . . . what an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, CalArts has hosted a series of anniversary events, including a 
950-person dinner last month. Celebrations and commemorative performances will 
continue to the end of April. Looking back, Patty Disney sometimes wonders why 
the family kept the institute going. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who would start an arts school in the late '60s had to be crazy," she 
said. "But, damn, Walt wanted that school. I guess we stuck with it because of 
Missouri stubbornness and because it was such a wonderful idea." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the family can boast of its creation. CalArts is respected and, 
more important, respectable. The likes of Barry Diller and Michael Eisner are 
trustees. Enrollment again approaches 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half into his presidency, Lavine has received high marks from 
faculty and people outside CalArts, such as MOCA's Richard Koshalek, for his 
ambitious project to expand the school's Euro-American traditions by inviting 
Latin, Asian and African artists to teach on campus. He is quieter and more 
scholarly than Fitzpatrick, but people seem to have taken to this persona. 
</P>
<P>
Despite CalArts' growing success, or perhaps because of it, alumni from the 
early years continue to worry that the institute has sold out -- what with 
regularly scheduled classes and grades and structured curriculums. 
</P>
<P>
"The idealism is still there," Lavine argues. "But now it's underpinned with a 
kind of realism about how to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who has been with the school since its first day, believes that early 
ideals still resonate through the campus. The founding concepts of social 
consciousness and mentorship -- students working closely with accomplished 
artists -- remain intact. CalArts continues to turn out artists wary of mass 
media and popular modes. 
</P>
<P>
And predictably, there are still rumblings of discontent. Some students and 
faculty complain that Lavine's intercultural program is nothing more than 
expensive window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Struggle and discontent are perhaps inseparable from artistic creation. If so, 
it's fitting that these elements remain a presence on the campus that Walt 
Disney wanted so badly to be, if nothing else, an artists' community. 
</P>
<P>
"CalArts has, built into its bones, the necessity for upheaval and change," 
Lavine said. "CalArts will always have that."

L.A. FILM FESTIVAL COMES OF AGE; 
</P>
<P>
FROM FRIEDKIN TO DONEN AND THE WHOLE WORLD IN BETWEEN, THE FEST LIST INCLUDES 
200 FILMS FROM 40 COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If passion and enthusiasm are life's blood for true movie lovers, there's 
something to get passionate about in Los Angeles, beginning next week. The 
4-year-old American Film Institute/Los Angeles International Film Festival -- 
conceived in turbulence, born in confusion, weaned on controversy -- has 
finally come of age. 
</P>
<P>
Gone for now are the days of Icelandic documentaries on servicemen's wives, of 
Czechoslovakian horror films about vampire automobiles, of Finnish fairy tales, 
Yugoslavian message movies. In the past, AFI / L.A. FilmFest, at its worst, has 
seemed like a kindly uncle who let every wide-eyed relative and vagrant into 
the door -- tolerating almost any kind of misbehavior, especially from 
independent American movies without distributors. But the kindly uncle has 
grown more selective. At the same time, paradoxically, he's opening up more 
rooms and lengthening his guest list. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 200 films from 40 different countries are on the bill this year, 
beginning with the gala Thursday opening of William Friedkin's new movie, "The 
Guardian," and ending May 3, with Stanley Donen's great 1957 Fred 
Astaire-Audrey Hepburn-George Gershwin musical, "Funny Face." So far, after 
more than 50 press screenings, the ardor is undampened. Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened? There's been a radical alteration in the old format AFI / 
L.A. FilmFest inherited from its 15-year predecessor, Filmex. Gone almost 
totally are some of the elements that often made Filmex delightful: the classic 
revivals and historical programs, the Hollywood hoopla, the 50-hour marathons 
of musicals, Westerns, horror movies. In a period of dwindling revival houses, 
this is a sad loss. But director Ken Wlaschin and his fellow programmers are 
finally beginning to realize their dream: to make Los Angeles' local film 
festival, in the back yard of Hollywood itself, a gathering place and forum for 
the rest of the world's cinema. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, AFI / L.A. FilmFest is holding seminars with the Eastern European 
filmmakers, with local independent and with independent black filmmakers based 
in Los Angeles, while at the same time staging tributes to some revered 
industry figures: musical legend Donen, producer David Wolper and cartoon 
pioneer Walter Lantz. 
</P>
<P>
Serendipitously, the theme of this year's festival is Hollywood Glasnost: a 
celebration of the new democratic reforms and movements in the old Eastern Bloc 
countries and of the new, less circumscribed cinema they've helped generate. 
Several films on the Glasnost program -- Jiri Menzel's "Larks on a String," 
Hungary's "The Agitators," Czechoslovakia's "Pictures of Old Times," Romania's 
"The Reenactment" -- have been banned in their own countries for decades. And 
while the new outpouring isn't uniformly good -- freedom can breed chaos and 
license as well as creativity -- we get startling glimpses of a Russia and 
Eastern Europe not much seen until recently: gray, sad, riddled with social 
inequities. 
</P>
<P>
Positives, unfortunately, sometimes have negative inspirations. If AFI/L.A. 
FilmFest has had a number of excellent, unseen foreign films to choose from 
this year, it's because foreign film distribution is collapsing in the United 
States -- a sorry situation not even one excellent festival can cure. 
</P>
<P>
How does the current festival cope in an era of vanishing screens, timid 
distributors, of college students who are apparently too sapped or dizzy to try 
to read subtitles? The following wrap-up, which partially covers the event's 
first week, is an attempt to summarize its riches. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of The Times reviewing staff -- including Sheila Benson, 
Kevin Thomas, Peter Rainer, Chris Willman and this writer -- leads off each 
category. All Eastern European films are shown at the Cineplex Odeon Fairfax; 
all others at the Cineplex Century Plaza. Information: (213) 480-2323 or 
856-7707.

<P>
Theo Angelopoulos Retrospective 
</P>
<P>
Highly Recommended: "The Travelling Players.""Landscape in the Mist," "Days of 
'36," "The Beekeeper," "Alexander the Great," "Journey to Cythera." 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: "The Reconstruction," "The Huntsmen," 
</P>
<P>
Last year, my pick as the best of AFI / L.A. FilmFest was Theo Angelopoulos' 
"Landscape in the Mist," a spellbindingly beautiful Greek "road" movie, which 
went on to win the Felix as the best film released in Europe in 1989. This 
year, the festival brings back "Landscape," and all of Angelopoulos' other 
seven features -- including his 1976 modern classic, "The Travelling Players," 
selected in an Italian Critic's poll as the best film of the 1970s, and in a 
British poll as the best film of the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Angelopoulos may be the greatest living filmmaker still relatively unknown and 
unseen in the West. Despite the many international awards they've won over the 
last 22 years, no Angelopoulos film has received widespread U.S. release -- not 
even his 1986 "The Beekeeper," which starred Marcello Mastroianni. It would be 
a wonderful irony if Angelopoulos, 54 and at his creative peak, made his major 
U.S. breakthrough in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A great "road" director, he has a predilection for oblique, despairing views of 
Greek history and politics; he's also a master at conveying modern alienation. 
But the most striking elements of his style -- other than his bewitchingly 
beautiful landscape scenes, usually shot near dawn or dusk in a wintry 
countryside -- are his obsessions with minimal dialogue and the long take. "The 
Travelling Players" is over four hours long and contains only 80 shots, about 
one every three minutes. Despite this seeming austerity, the films bristle with 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
Angelopoulos' three masterpieces are probably "Landscape in the Mist" (April 
27), the 1972 "Days of '36" (April 21, 22) and "The Travelling Players" (April 
22). "The Travelling Players" is obviously his magnum opus. In it, a rag-tag 
Greek theatrical troupe criss-crosses the countryside from 1940 to 1952, 
experiencing all the social upheavals of World War II and its turbulent 
aftermath. Their play, Spiridonos Perisiadis' hackneyed but popular pastoral 
romance, "Golfo the Shepherdess," never changes -- but offstage, their lives 
begin to take on the shape of a Sophoclean tragedy. "Days of '36," centering on 
a prison hostage crisis which helps bring on the rise of the Metaxas 
dictatorship, is one of his most overtly anti-Fascist statements. "Landscape" 
is a seemingly simpler story in which two runaway children travel through 
modern Greece in search of their absent, far-off father: a father as 
mythological as the Greek gods. All of Angelopoulos' previous work echoes 
poetically through it; the Travelling Players themselves reappear in one 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
The other films, if not quite as perfect, are often equally fascinating: 
</P>
<P>
"The Reconstruction," (Friday) , Agelopolous' 1970 debut film, is a hard-edged, 
black-and-white true-crime story the seems to mix neo-realism, Brecht and the 
Hawks-Huston-Wilder gangster tradition: movies Angelopoulos loved as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Huntsmen," (April 23) a rebel Communist guerrilla, killed in 1949, is 
found frozen in the snow by a 1976 party of hunters; as his body thaws so does 
the entire history of an era. 
</P>
<P>
"Alexander the Great" (April 24), a Grand Prize winner at Venice, is a 
dance-like fable of rebellion turning to despotism, set in a breathtakingly 
picturesque Macedonian mountain village. 
</P>
<P>
"Journey to Cythera" (April 25) is an almost freezingly austere portrayal of a 
situation that might seem booby-trapped with sentimentalism: an old radical, 
returning to his mountain home after years of political exile in Russia, finds 
that he's still a rebellious anachronism, that his world will cast him out 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beekeeper" (April 27), another road film and Antonioni homage, starring 
Mastroianni, is a definitive poetic portrait of an aging man, facing 
disillusionment and youth, becoming consumed and destroyed. Like all 
Angelopoulos, it's hauntingly sad, mysteriously beautiful.

Krzyzstof Kieslowski Retrospective 
</P>
<P>
Highly Recommended: "The Decalogue, Pts. 1-10," "A Short Film About Killing," 
"A Short Film About Love." 
</P>
<P>
Like Angelopoulos, Kieslowski has been a consistent international award winner. 
Like Angelopoulos, he has won the all-European Oscar equivalent, the Felix, in 
1988 for "A Short Film About Killing." Like Angelopoulos, he remains virtually 
unseen in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Angelopoulos, whose uncompromising approach can alienate unsympathetic 
viewers, Kieslowski's virtues are more obvious and immediate: great ensemble 
performances, compelling visual style, dramatic immediacy, deep emotional and 
intellectual content -- all wrapped up in taut narrative structures worthy of a 
first-class director of movie thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
Kieslowski's masterwork is the "Decalogue," a 10-hour, 10-part Polish TV 
series, each part based on one of the Ten Commandments. In each story, 
Kieslowski and co-scenarist Krzysztof Piesiewicz examine a specific "sin" 
committed among the inhabitants of a drab, forbidding high-rise in Warsaw. 
Their conclusions vary; so does the tone. Some stories are tragic, some 
poignant, some seemingly moralistic. Some are unabashedly comic. 
</P>
<P>
Decalogue 10 on "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods" is a hilarious 
portrayal of two knuckleheaded brothers, a punk rock star and a "square," who 
became obsessed with their late father's stamp collection. Decalogue 6, about a 
voyeur and his obsession, is a near variation on Hitchcock's "Rear Window." 
Decalogue Five, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," is a crime story of hair-raising force, 
perhaps the most powerful argument against capital punishment the movies have 
ever given us. 
</P>
<P>
In sick, twisted green-gray perspectives, Kieslowski shows us a pointless, 
brutal murder; then, in equal terrifying detail, the murderer's execution. In 
both cases, the victims, initially repellent, become sympathetic by virtue of 
their plight. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 films are an interlocking whole: major characters from one episode 
appear in minor roles or as passers-by in the others, and one common character, 
a mysterious, silent observer, appears in all of them. The film proves that 
great art and television are not incompatible. It also proves that the wages of 
sin are never predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"A Short Film About Killing" and "A Short Film About Love" are expanded 
versions of Parts 5 and 6 of the "Decalogue." 
</P>

Western Europe 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: "3 Seats for the 26th," "A Handful of Time." 
</P>
<P>
"Three Seats for the 26th" (April 20), a return to the musical for French 
director Jacques Demy and composer Michel LeGrand ("The Umbrellas of 
Cherbourg") is, in many ways, a pretty, foolish little movie. Yves Montand 
returns to Marseilles for a stage show that presents his biography in song; 
Demy tries to reprise the era of MGM musicals, Donen and Minnelli. By 
comparison, Demy's dances are wispy, his tunes frail, his colors cartoonish and 
his climax tasteless: it's briefly suggested that Montand is seducing his own 
illegitimate daughter. Yet "Three Seats" so unabashedly loves musicals and 
Montand is so effortless a show-stopper, that there's something giddy and 
delightful about it all. It's like champagne in a plastic flute. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Benson found Martin Asphaug's "A Handful of Time" (Friday) "an extremely 
assured Norwegian film" with "gorgeous exteriors" about a guilt-ridden old man 
coming to terms with harsh nature: inner and outer. Peter Rainer, on the other 
hand, thought Pupi Avanti's "A Story of Boys and Girls" (Saturday) a comedy, 
set in 1936 at a 30-course family dinner, was allegedly "life-embracing" but 
actually "tedious." 
</P>
<P>
Andi Engel's British-West German "Melancholia" (April 25) seems bent on 
producing the same feeling in its audience. Jeroen Krabbe, looking unhappy, is 
torn between a melancholy life as an art critic, mulling over joyless 
seductions, and another career as a melancholy man of action, conducting glum 
assassinations. It's a dispirited movie. Benson considered West German director 
Bernhard Wicki's "The Spider's Web" (April 25) "big, opulent, almost operatic," 
"played to the hilt" by Klaus-Maria Brandauer and Ulrich Muhe . . . but 
ultimately short of the mark. She and I were disappointed with Karl Francis' 
"Angry Earth" (April 26), a Welsh social drama about the rise of the Labor 
Movement, recalled by a 110-year-old woman through a slow haze of bawdy joy, 
battered heads, bright sermons and labored sentiment.

Recommended: "Standoff," "Time of Violence," "That Summer of White Roses," 
"Elysium," "The Reenactment." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Gyula Gazdag makes surreal dramas and hilarious documentaries. 
"Standoff" (April 22) is a thriller, shot with the immediacy of life. In it, 
two Hungarian macho punks hold a girl's dormitory hostage, demanding free 
passage to the West. The machinations around them, painfully plausible, drive a 
ridiculous situation toward realistic catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"Time of Violence" (April 24), shot by the director of the Bulgarian film 
industry may arouse intense political and religious controversy. It's a 
brutally effective historical epic about Christian mountain people under siege 
by fanatical janizaries bent on forcibly converting the entire village. Lyudmil 
Staikov has the temperament for this kind of epic; he likes big gestures, broad 
vistas, bold strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Thomas says Rajko Grlic's "That Summer of White Roses" (Saturday), set 
during the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, has "one of Tom Conti's best roles." 
Erika Szanto's "Elysium" (April 24) focuses sensitively on the dramatic 
turbulence around a children's concentration camp and the fantasies that reign 
inside. Szanto's other film, "Mission to Evian" (April 24), also has a 
Holocaust theme: it's about a Jewish doctor's desperate attempt to convince the 
Allies to ransom Jews after Austria's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Lucian Pintille's "The Reenactment" (April 24) is a long-banned Romanian film, 
a darkly jovial absurdist comedy about the charades of totalitarian justice. 
Ivan Nichev's "Ivan and Alexandra" (April 22) parallels Bulgaria's descent into 
repression with a fitfully sprightly coming-of-age romance. According to Peter 
Rainer, Karen Shaknazarov's "Zero City" (Saturday) has a "creepy 'Twilight 
Zone' premise" that leaves us "caught in a Stalinist time warp." Another Soviet 
film, "Commentary on an Appeal for Mercy" (April 26), directed by Sergei Primak 
and Inessa Tumanian, is a "walk" film, a kaleidoscopic and over-obvious tour of 
modern Moscow by a bureacratic criminal on his last day and night of freedom.

</P>
<P>
Hou Hsai-hsien's "City of Sadness" (April 23), the first Taiwanese film ever to 
take a major festival award -- grand prize at the Venice Film Festival -- is 
remarkable in many ways. It has the density of a good novel, compressing years 
of frenzied social history -- from the end of World War II to the Chinese 
Revolution -- into the experiences of one family. Involved in the local 
underworld, this family slides dizzily down to disaster; meanwhile, their 
country careens through one social convulsion after another. The movie's view 
is calm and ironic, even during the most horrendous events. It's so packed with 
life, incident and rich detail, it can barely be assimilated on a single 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"Birth" (April 22), the story of an old villager waiting in vain for the return 
of a son arrested in an anti-government rally, marks the directorial debut of 
noted Indian cinematographer Shaji. Sheila Benson worries "that harried 
Americans can't (won't) slow their pulses down to the tempo of this fine, 
moving and heartfelt film." Peter Rainer consider's Satyajit Ray's first film 
in four years, "An Enemy of the People" (April 21), adapted from Henrik Ibsen's 
play about plague and principle, "a beautiful transcription . . . one of the 
most cinematically expressive 'filmed plays' ever made." 
</P>
<P>
From Hong Kong, where they know how to make action movies, "A Terra Cotta 
Warrior" (April 21), directed by Ching Siu Tung, is the slambang 
fantasy-romance of your dreams: an Indiana Jones-style adventure about a 
faithful 3,000-year-old warrior. The major pure-fun movie of the festival, it 
features unusual collaborators: the special effects are by Tsui Hark, director 
of "Peking Opera Blues," and the male star is Zhang Yimou, mainland Chinese 
director of 1988's arthouse hit, "Red Sorghum." 
</P>
<P>
After a 17-year absence, Japan's Hiroshi Teshigahara, director of "Woman in the 
Dunes," returns to fiction features with "Rikyu" (April 24), in which the 
legendary Buddhist priest and master of the tea ceremony clashes with his 
hot-tempered warlord employer. Kevin Thomas finds it "an exquisite historical 
tragedy . . . reminiscent in theme of 'A Man for All Seasons.' " Thomas also 
recommends Turkish director Tunc Basaran's "Don't Let Them Shoot the Kite" 
(Friday, Saturday), a film about a little boy incarcerated with his mother in a 
women's prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Island" (May 3), by Australian director Paul Cox ("Man of Flowers," 
"Vincent"), is about three women of different nationalities philosophizing 
about life on a Greek isle. It's a beautifully shot, but enervated drama, 
enlivened mostly by the fiery performance of Irene Papas. 
</P>
<P>
The South African "Jobman" (Friday, Saturday), directed by Darrel Roodt, is an 
exciting, unsurprising action fable in which a mythical black hero and his 
white boss and former playmate head toward inevitable, murderous collision. 
</P>
<P>
Eros Djarot's "Woman of Courage" (April 23), based on the Dutch wars and the 
career of rebel-heroine Tjoet Nja 'Dhien, is one of the most lavish productions 
in Indonesian history. That money has bought a lot of nobility, sacrifice, 
betrayal, capering clowns, scowling villains, cynical go-betweens, stirring 
sermons and glorious defeats. It still wasn't well-spent.

This section, usually one of the strongest at AFI / L.A. FilmFest, gets no 
recommendations from Times reviewers. Kevin Thomas considered the Brazilian 
"Better Days Ahead" from Carlos ("Bye Bye Brazil") Digues "a major 
disappointment," and its tale of a Rio actress dreaming of Hollywood stardom 
"too wan for us to take seriously any of the implications, cultural, political 
or otherwise." Chris Willman, thought Arturo Ripstein's cynical romance, "White 
Lies" (April 22) a "nicely shot and utterly bleak Mexican psychodrama...strong 
stuff, but mostly for diehard anti-romantics." Peter Rainer found Beda Docampo 
Feijoo's Argentinian "Loves of Kafka" (April 22) a "dreary oddity" and thought 
Jorge Marrale, the actor playing Kafka, bore "an unfortunate resemblance to 
Albert Brooks."

scripted by Burnett, is a sympathetic Cassavetes-style look at lower-class 
black family life in Watts. Wendell Harris' "Chameleon Street" (Friday), a film 
about an agile, amoral impersonator, won the grand prize at the U.S. Film 
Festival in Park City, Utah, but Sheila Benson demurs: "It overreaches fatally, 
in direction, writing, in the director's egocentric central performance and in 
the film's erratic tone."

</P>
<P>
Pat O'Neill's "Water and Power" (April 25) is a genuinely inventive film: 
chockful of ideas, witty, surprising, occasionally poetic. It's a many-leveled 
portrait of Southern California, that uses multiple images, 
"Koyaanisqatsi"-style time-lapse photography, snatches of TV shows and 
Sternberg movies, a bright jazz score and ironically fractured wisps of 
narration to drag us onto a floating tour of the state's body and soul.

Highly Recommended: Seminar with Michael Moore and "Roger &amp; Me." (AFI Mark

Recommended: "I Went to the Dance," "The Long Way Home," "Berkeley in the 
'60s," "Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer," "Hollywood 
Mavericks." 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of this strong section is an appearance by Michael Moore, 
with his controversial "Roger &amp; Me" (Saturday.) Les Blank's "I Went to the 
Dance" (April 22) is so rich you can taste it, a flavorsome gumbo of a movie 
that spreads out a host of joyous Cajun music makers, zydeco stylists and such 
geniuses as late accordionist Clifton Chenier. Michael Apted's mordant "A Long 
Way Home" (April 26, 27) has a priceless subject which it reveals with 
dispassionate skill: the rocky road of the idolized underground Leningrad band, 
Aquarium, after well-meaning Americans sign them to record in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Benson believes Kenneth Bowser and Todd McCarthy's "Preston Sturges" 
(Saturday), about the great Hollywood comedy writer-director, "captures the 
savor of the man for everyone not fortunate enough to know him, or his work, 
well." Benson, who lived just across the Bay at the time, found "Berkeley in 
the '60s" (April 25, 27) "outstanding . . . a careful, balanced job on a 
complex, many-layered period," but thought "To Protect Mother Earth" (April 21, 
24), with Robert Redford narrating the plight of Shoshones theatened by 
government encroachment, "unthrilling, dogged stuff . . . no matter how good 
its heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Mavericks" (Friday) is probably only for hard-core movie buffs, but 
they'll enjoy the chance to hear people like Martin Scorsese and Alan Rudolph 
talk about John Ford, Erich Von Stroheim and Orson Welles. Chris Willman was 
sympathetic to the intentions of "Teatro" (April 21,22), about a Honduran 
acting troupe directed by an American Jesuit, but thought it was ultimately, 
"an interesting subject, haphazardly handled." Two more competent but 
uninspired works are Jeff B. Harmon's "Afghan Trilogy" (April 26, 27) and Adam 
Horowitz's "Home on the Range" (April 25, 26). The first follows the bizarre 
attempts of the old residents of the Kwajalein Atoll, now a nuclear test 
center, to reclaim their island. The second takes an idiosyncratic look at the 
participants in a surprising war, including the local Ismaeli Defense Chief, 
whose favorite song is AC / DC's "Highway to Hell."

CAPTURING JAZZ LEGENDS ON BLACK AND WHITE PRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Herman Leonard has, through the years, made his bread and butter capturing the 
likenesses of such celebrities as Marlon Brando, Jane Russell, Norman Mailer, 
Christian Dior and Charles Aznavour -- both in personal portraits and for such 
magazines as Life, Playboy and Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
But photographing such jazz greats as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Art 
Tatum, Nat (King) Cole and Dexter Gordon was the sweet jam atop the bread and 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
From 1948-60, Leonard spent a good deal of his time in the jazz clubs of New 
York and Paris, shooting musicians in their milieu. The results were dramatic, 
mostly back-lit, black-and-white photos that captured not only the musicians 
but also the experience of being inside the smoky clubs. Leonard complemented 
the work done in the clubs by photographing musicians in his studios. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, very few people saw Leonard's black-and-white shots. True, some 
of them made it to album covers, magazines and books, but mainly they stayed 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped shooting jazz people about 1960 because I couldn't make any money at 
it," Leonard, 67, said from his home in San Francisco. "And as I moved around 
(Europe, where I moved in 1956), I kept schlepping a box full of these 
photographs with me." 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time in the United States, an exhibition of 40 of Leonard's 
original photographs of jazz greats is traveling to 10 cities. The exhibition, 
"Images of Jazz," sponsored by Gilbey's Gin, debuted at the G. Ray Hawkins 
Gallery on Melrose Avenue and runs through April 28. A different set of 
photographs is being shown simultaneously in galleries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard's jazz photographs and his classic style of portraiture have made him 
one of the world's top commercial photographers. His work has been utilized in 
magazines from Elle to Life to Paris Match. He is renowned for his crisp lines, 
his clarity of image and his meticulous printing, qualities that can be found 
in the work of the famed portraitist Yousuf Karsh, who became a major influence 
when Leonard served a one-year apprenticeship with him in Ottawa, Ontario, in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz has been one of Leonard's loves almost as long as photography, which he 
took up as a teen-ager in his hometown of Allentown, Pa. "I got a lot of 
happiness out of listening to people like Nat Cole, Louis Jordan and Louis 
Armstrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't begin to photograph the players until the late '40s, after he'd 
completed a master's degree in photography at Ohio University in Athens and had 
spent his year with Karsh. 
</P>
<P>
His duties were to set up the equipment and handle all the lighting under 
Karsh's direction. "I learned by watching him work with famous people and 
seeing how he handled them psychologically." 
</P>
<P>
Two renowned subjects that Karsh and Leonard photographed together were 
President Harry S. Truman and Albert Einstein, both in early 1948. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his year with Karsh, Leonard moved on to New York, where be-bop 
caught his ear. He frequented clubs like Minton's and the Royal Roost, soaking 
up the new music. 
</P>
<P>
"Be-bop was innovative, it was daring, and I wanted to photograph these guys 
simply because I liked their music, no other reason than that," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with his camera, chiefly a 4x5 Speed Graphix, and with help from club 
owners and entrepreneurs such as the late Monte Kaye and Pete Kameron 
(currently an Angeleno), Leonard was able to get into rooms before show time to 
set up his lights. His backlighting style came about accidentally. One night, 
an off-the-ceiling light functioned, but the flash on his camera didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked (backlighting) because I was able to get a dark background, which was 
what the mood of the club was like," he said. "(It also allowed me) to show the 
shape, the form without an excess of detail, so it's easy to read, visually." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke is another element that is a hallmark of many a Leonard photograph, often 
because more than a few of the musicians -- and club-goers -- he shot, such as 
Parker or Dexter Gordon, were non-stop smokers. "The smoke was part of the 
atmosphere of those days, and it dramatized the photographs a lot, maybe 
over-stylized them a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among musicians he photographed during his New York years were Tatum, Parker, 
Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday and 
Count Basie. In the early '50s, Leonard built the foundation of his commercial 
reputation by working for magazines such as Life and Cosmopolitan and 
photographing Lena Horne, Robert Wagner and Donald O'Connor for clients such as 
MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking Paris might prove a pleasant change of pace from the hustle of New 
York, Leonard moved there in 1956 after he had served as Brando's personal 
photographer on a Far East tour. "He looked over my stuff on the jazz albums 
and hired me on the spot," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Leonard thrived in Paris. He worked for the Barclay Record 
company, shooting album covers of Aznavour and Jacques Brel; he was Playboy's 
chief European photographer, taking shots of Mailer and Jean-Paul Sartre as 
well as handling such projects as "The Prostitutes of Paris" and "Girls Behind 
the Iron Curtain;" and he entered the world of fashion, shooting designers 
Christian Dior and Yves St. Laurent, initially for clients such as the 
International Wool Bureau and later for major magazines. 
</P>
<P>
And though Leonard's commercial work took priority, he still remained 
fascinated by jazz, shooting Art Blakey, Duke Ellington, Bud Powell and Kenny 
Clarke at such rooms as the Club St. Germain. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years, Paris no longer dazzled Leonard. "I burned out and decided to 
move with my wife and two children to Ibiza, off the coast of Spain in 1980," 
he said. "I wanted them to have some contact with earth and sky." He stayed 
there seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in a farmhouse that rented for 40 bucks a month and I didn't work," 
he said. "I took pictures of that life, spent a lot of time with the peasant 
people. It was paradise for a while until I got so bored, I nearly went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard moved to London in 1987. The year before, his jazz photos appeared in 
"L'oeil de Jazz" (Editions Filipacchi), issued by Daniel Filipacchi, a friend 
of Leonard's who publishes Elle, Paris Match and other magazines. The book, 
available only in France, was "an expected success" and was released with 
English text by Viking Press as "The Eye of Jazz," in January. 
</P>
<P>
Due to response to the book, Leonard looked for a London gallery to show his 
jazz photos. Last spring his works were shown at the Special Photographer's 
Company, and Gilbey's decided to sponsor a European tour, with its American 
counterpart backing the U.S. leg. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard figures he did all right when he chose photography as a profession. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best, the best," he said. "I'm not talking about being stuck in the 
studio, I'm talking about the people out in the streets, doing stories about 
people. It's so enlightening."

District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry said that he has not adhered to the 
strict regimen of counseling sessions and other meetings that medical experts 
say are critical to his recovery from alcohol and substance abuse. In an 
interview with the Washington Post, Barry also said that until last week he 
mistakenly believed that he could substitute attendance at church services for 
the counseling sessions and alcoholics' group meetings. The mayor added he 
would no longer do that.

Five million American children under the age of 6 -- almost one out of every 
four in the nation -- recently have been in families living below the poverty 
line, according to a report by the National Center for Children in Poverty, 
which is affiliated with Columbia University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
This makes young children the poorest of any age group in American society, 
with 23% -- more than double the number of adults -- living in poverty, the 
report said. The study, based on 1987 data, found that while 42% of all U.S. 
children living in poverty were white, the percentage of poor among whites 
overall was 13%. That compares to 48% for blacks and 42% for Latinos.

Gang violence that erupted throughout Los Angeles starting Friday evening has 
left four people dead and two injured, including one bystander critically 
wounded during a drive-by shooting, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Martinez, 24, of Los Angeles, a suspected gang member, was killed by an 
unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting early Saturday as he walked down a 
street near downtown, according to Sgt. John Wickham of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Martinez at 1:18 a.m. lying dead on the sidewalk at the northwest 
corner of 9th Street and Westmoreland Avenue, Wickham said. Police say they 
have no suspects or motive. 
</P>
<P>
In another gang-related slaying, police said Tony Deloa, 21, was killed shortly 
after 10 p.m. Friday in Southwest Los Angeles. Officers said Deloa was sitting 
with friends on a cinder-block wall at the corner of 25th Street and Magnolia 
Avenue, when a group of youths in a car drove by, yelled gang slogans and fired 
one blast from a shotgun. Deloa was taken to California Medical Center, where 
he died a short time later, according to Police Sgt. J.J. Reese. 
</P>
<P>
In a drive-by shooting Friday night, in the 900 block of West 41st Street, 
police said Jose Martinez, 20, a suspected gang member, was wounded. He was 
reported in good condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bell Gardens area late Friday, suspected gang member Jesus Guerrero, 19, 
was shot and killed and a bystander critically wounded during a drive-by 
shooting on Ira Avenue, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Dean Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville said Guerrero was shot in the chest by two youths who drove by in a 
dark sedan and yelled gang slogans before firing several times. Officers would 
only identify the bystander as a 31-year-old man. They said he was hit in the 
neck and shoulder and is in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, Ronald Pena, 29, was killed during an apparent drive-by 
shooting Friday evening. Pena was found lying on South Eastman Avenue and was 
pronounced dead at Doctor's Hospital shortly before 7 p.m., police said.

ACTIVIST DON JACKSON, 10 OTHERS ARRESTED AT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in riot gear arrested 11 people, including anti-police brutality 
activist Don Jackson, during a demonstration Saturday against apartheid and 
racism in front of the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was arrested when he tried to talk to club managers about allegedly 
racist membership policies, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Nelson 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He was with 100 protesters representing the Los Angeles Student Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said 10 others were arrested when demonstrators blocked the Wilshire 
Boulevard entrance to the club and surrounded vehicles trying to enter while 
screaming "profanities at the occupants." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said police closed Wilshire between Comstock Avenue and Santa Monica 
Boulevard to clear the area of demonstrators who had "spilled onto the 
westbound lanes of Wilshire Boulevard, causing traffic to swerve." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was arrested by private security officers at the club and was taken to 
West Los Angeles jail, where police booked him on suspicion of trespassing, a 
misdemeanor. The other 10 people arrested, including four juveniles, were 
booked on suspicion of blocking traffic, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The four juveniles arrested were booked and released to the custody of their 
parents," Anderson said. Bail for the adults was set at $250. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of the Los Angeles Country Club could not be reached for comment.

REFLECTIONS: 'IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF GOOD FEELING, LIKE I'M DOING SOMETHING 
WORTHWHILE, CREATING SOMETHING NOT EVERYONE CAN DO' 
</P>

For many, Easter egg decorating brings to mind a simple process: dipping 
hard-boiled eggs into different colors of vegetable dye. But, when Lucy Sermak 
was a teen-ager, she learned of a 2,000-year-old technique that combines the 
batik artistry, symbolism and folklore of the Ukraine. It's called pysanky. 
</P>
<P>
 In pysanky, derived from the word pysate, which means "to write," designs are 
written on the egg with wax and the entire egg is dipped in dyes. A single egg 
can take anywhere from 30 minutes to eight hours to complete, depending on the 
intricacy of the design. 
</P>
<P>
 Sermak, now 47 and living in San Carlos, has admittedly become addicted to the 
craft. She has gone from creating a dozen pysanky eggs during Easter for her 
family and friends to making 100 to 150 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 She has had her crafts on display at libraries, at the Ukrainian Festival in 
San Diego and at the Southern California Exposition, or Del Mar Fair, where she 
has won several awards. She also teaches classes in the ethnic craft for 
children and adults with her partner, Cynthia Barbat. Sermak spoke with Times 
staff writer Terry Rather and was photographed by Teresa Tamura. 
</P>
<P>
Pysanky egg decorating started out as an Easter tradition because the egg was a 
symbol of life. And, of course, spring is also the start of new life after 
winter. A long time ago, young girls would make them in secret to surprise 
their boyfriends. They would make a special egg, which would take weeks of 
labor, and present it to their boyfriends as an Easter morning gift. 
</P>
<P>
The basic technique used is the batik method, using melted beeswax and a stylus 
with a tiny hole which lets the wax flow onto the egg, forming the design. You 
dip the raw egg in a light color. Another portion of the design is covered with 
wax, which will preserve the design. 
</P>
<P>
The egg is then dipped into the next color, which is darker. You always work 
light colors to dark, until the design is completed. The wax is then removed by 
melting the wax and wiping it with a soft cloth and the entire design is 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
These eggs are not to be eaten. They are strictly ornamental. Traditionally, 
they just left the eggs inside, and they just dried out naturally through the 
years. Today, eggs are more fragile, so most times the eggs are blown out. 
</P>
<P>
The eggs were originally created with certain meanings. For instance, a horse 
or a deer was put on as a symbol of wealth and prosperity; wheat designs of 
harvesting, drops of tears of Mary and, of course, crosses are symbols of 
Christianity. Most have lines going all the way around the egg in some way, 
which represents everlasting life. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite symbol is the star because it's so fun to draw. There are so many 
variations to it. You can do probably 50 of them, and each one will be 
different. I also love the geometric designs. It's not as traditional, but 
blues and purple are my favorite colors. Purple means royalty; it's a symbol of 
richness. Blue represents the sky. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of mine taught me how to do the eggs when I was 17. She showed me how 
to make a simplified version of pysanky. About 11 years later, my husband and I 
joined a Byzantine church, which is Greek-Catholic. The priest showed us how to 
do these. After I picked up these styles, it took hold of me, and I fell in 
love with decorating eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Pysanky egg decorating brings out the creative side of me because I have this 
need to create. It's also a means of relaxation. I have my "egg table" set in 
one corner in my house. I can work whenever and however long I please, and it 
doesn't interfere with anything (my kids) do. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I don't want to go to bed at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning because I 
get so involved and enthusiastic in the designs I'm making. It satisfies that 
creative urge I have. I see a picture I like, and I try to see if I can put 
that on the egg. It gives me a sense of good feeling, like I'm doing something 
worthwhile, creating something not everyone can do. 
</P>
<P>
Spring is the rebirth of nature. We don't feel it so much here as they do in 
other parts of the country because the weather is so warm and we don't feel 
this closed-in, dark feeling. The winter can get so severe and cold and all of 
a sudden the snow melts and grass starts sprouting, and you just feel this 
surge of energy and this rebirth of life. I try to keep some of that feeling 
when I'm doing the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'm hooked. Egg decorating is something I am doing more in winter and 
spring, not just for Easter. I enjoy creating, and I end up giving so many 
away. There's always a new design I want to try. I also like to share the 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing something you enjoy doing and having someone else generate the same 
enthusiasm gives you a good feeling inside. It's something wonderful and 
beautiful.

WHO ARE THE HOMELESS?

<P>
JASON, 28, was born in Torrance, graduated from Carson High School and lived 
for a while in Lawndale and Wilmington. He would have liked to remain in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But then he lost his job, and he and his family were evicted from their 
Wilmington apartment when they couldn't pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jason and his 30-year-old wife, Ann, decided to try their luck 
elsewhere. They stopped at Alondra Park to pick up some free groceries as they 
prepared to drive to Palmdale with their four small children, ages 4, 2, 1 1/2 
and 8 months. 
</P>
<P>
For the last few nights, they had stayed with a friend in Lawndale. Before 
that, the family of six lived in their battered 1968 Chevrolet van for a few 
nights after being evicted. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and my wife have been together seven years in four different homes and 
we've never been down this low before," Jason said. "I know I'm getting ulcers 
over this. I'm worried about my kids. I've never been through anything like 
this before." 
</P>
<P>
Using $40 from the sale of Jason's motorcycle that morning, the family had 
purchased enough gasoline to get the van to Palmdale, where Jason had heard 
that a dry-wall installation job might be waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Even if that job fell through, however, Jason figured his family would be 
better off in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear there's this place where you can move into an apartment for just $475, 
no security, no last-month (deposit)," he said. "I've got a friend who said 
she'd put us up for two weeks. I know I can work hard enough to get $475 in two 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
His father, who lives in Colorado, once helped the family out of a tight 
financial situation, but not this time, Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks I ought to learn the hard way, take some knocks the same as he did," 
Jason said. Four-year-old Trisha, munching on a banana given her by some church 
workers, tugged insistently on his pants leg. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not the same," he said, smiling wanly at the child. "It's not." Janet

BICHETTE FOILS TWINS' STRATEGY IN 12TH, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three times he saw fastballs from Rick Aguilera, and three times Dante Bichette 
fouled them off. The game between the Twins and Angels was two outs into the 
bottom of the 12th inning, but the mind game between hitter and pitcher was 
just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"After the third, I figured he thought I was looking for a fastball," said 
Bichette, who was batting after Johnny Ray had singled and gone to second on 
Wally Joyner's groundout, and Chili Davis was intentionally walked. "Then he 
gave me a breaking ball, up a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette sent it over the center-field fence by more than a little bit. His 
three-run home run gave the Angels a 7-5 victory that was sweeter for being so 
unlikely and so late. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to pull this one out with all the opportunities we had to win it in 
the first place," said shortstop Mark McLemore, whose fielding error in the 
eighth inning had put Al Newman on base with the eventual tying run. "To win -- 
and to win like this, especially after they walk Chili to get to Dante -- is 
real nice." 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom dictates against putting the winning run on base as the 
Twins did in walking Davis. Rader disagreed: "That's baloney. In that 
situation, you pitch to the guy you think you can get out. One time in Boston 
(when Rader was managing Texas), I put the winning run on to pitch to (Wade) 
Boggs in the ninth. I thought they were going to run me out of town, but we got 
away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starting pitcher Bert Blyleven went six innings against his former 
teammates, allowing three runs and striking out one. The winning pitcher was 
Bryan Harvey, although he had allowed Minnesota to take the lead in the top of 
the 12th on a single by Newman, a walk to Kent Hrbek and an RBI single by Gary 
Gaetti. Aguilera (0-1) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never faced that guy before, and, from what I knew, he was a fastball 
pitcher," Bichette said. "A couple of guys said he threw a fastball and slider. 
I just wanted to get a pitch that was out over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette was hitless in his first four at-bats Saturday and had singled in the 
11th, only to be stranded at third base when pinch-hitter Donnie Hill struck 
out. But Bichette had made his mark in the 10th, throwing Kirby Puckett out at 
the plate to preserve a 4-4 tie and earn his fifth assist of the young season. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett had led off the inning with a walk and moved to third on Hrbek's single 
to short center. Gaetti flied out to medium-deep right field, and Bichette, who 
had started the game in left field but was moved to right before the ninth 
inning, caught the ball on the run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I worked on, the quick release and getting the ball on target," 
Bichette said. "He made it close because he can run. After I let it go, I 
didn't know if we had him." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had him by a step or two, as Bichette's one-hop throw found Lance 
Parrish's glove and Parrish administered the tag to Puckett's left hip. 
</P>
<P>
"If he stays in the lineup he's got a legitimate shot at being the first 30-30 
guy," Rader had said before the game. "I know what you're saying -- that's been 
done before. But not 30 homers and 30 assists." 
</P>
<P>
The Twins jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a double and home run by 
Hrbek, the 400th hit off Blyleven in his career. That moved him a notch up on a 
dubious all-time list: he has given up the seventh-most home runs in baseball 
history. But that mattered little to him later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very thankful that we won. That's the main thing," said Blyleven, who had 
gone only five innings in his opening day loss last Monday. "This is a good 
omen. We were down by a run and just kept battling back." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got one run back in the first on Wally Joyner's first home run of 
the season, but the Twins took a 3-1 lead in the third on Puckett's RBI 
groundout. A two-run home run in the fourth by Parrish made it 3-3, where it 
stood until Jack Howell doubled and scored on Ray's double in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seeing his club in action for a week has not moved Angel General Manager Mike 
Port to make a move. He continues to talk with peers but said he is not close 
to a deal. He also debunked the rumor that the Angels would acquire Boston 
closer Lee Smith, saying the Red Sox might be reluctant to trade Smith because 
Jeff Reardon has back problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kicked a lot of things around with other clubs, but at this point it's 
just general," Port said. "It's identifying other peoples' needs and interests 
and keeping them advised of our interest. Sometimes these things take a lot of 
spadework." 
</P>
<P>
Port reiterated that he's satisfied with his personnel. "Unless or until 
something achievable comes along, we're still very, very comfortable with the 
cast we've got," he said. "We're determined not to do anything unless it's 
right and the circumstances permit. If we have a surplus of pitching, it might 
be a case of utilizing all our pitching and defense and building from that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mike Witt believes he's headed elsewhere, Port would not be 
definitive. "His last three or four times out, going back to the Freeway 
Series, he's shown great improvement in terms of velocity," Port said. "I see a 
lot of things there of Mike Witt in his prime. He's well on his way to being 
the Mike Witt we know he can be. What the rest of the season holds, it's 
day-by-day." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Anderson, who committed two errors Friday, wasn't in Saturday's lineup. 
But Manager Doug Rader said it wasn't because of the misplays, but because he 
wanted to play Mark McLemore at shortstop Saturday and Anderson there today. . 
. . Rader has yet to use the same lineup twice this season . . . Shortstop Dick 
Schofield, who won't come off the disabled list as scheduled Monday, won't take 
ground balls again until Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen the Angels commit six errors in their first five games and their 
opponents commit 11, Rader believes the shortened spring training is to blame. 
. . . Told that Minnesota third baseman Gary Gaetti thinks the infield grass at 
Anaheim Stadium is too high, Rader laughed. "He's not cutting it," Rader said. 
"Our groundskeepers get pooped out and we can't keep them out there. I think 
theirs is too short." The Twins, of course, play on artificial turf . . . An 
error charged to Chili Davis in the seventh inning Friday was rescinded. 
Instead, Brian Harper was credited with a double and an RBI for driving in 
Kirby Puckett.

IT'S ONE MORE STRIKE AGAINST WETTELAND, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dodger pitcher John Wetteland faced Houston last season, his fielders were 
insurance risks. The Astros scored 12 runs in 9 2/3 innings against him -- an 
earned-run average of 11.21. 
</P>
<P>
"You better believe I knew all that," Wetteland said late Saturday afternoon. 
"I studied all of it. And that's the only reason I studied all of it. Because I 
knew it. And I didn't want to let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
But it did. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland entered Saturday's game in the seventh inning with the score 3-3. He 
retired the first two batters and got two strikes on Craig Biggio. But then he 
lost it, giving up four runs in the next five minutes as the Dodgers lost, 7-3, 
in front of 21,736 at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Biggio's hit -- a line-drive single to center field -- that bothered 
the Dodgers as much as how hard it was hit. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, in general, when a guy hits a two-strike pitch with that much 
authority, you've made a terrible mistake," said Ron Perranoski, Dodger 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrible," Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
After Biggio stole second, Wetteland then made a worse mistake to Bill Doran, 
who had misplayed a grounder at second base that helped the Dodgers tie the 
score in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland again got the count to two strikes before Doran lined a single to 
right field, driving in Biggio. Biggio leaped over catcher Mike Scioscia and 
knocked aside his glove as Scioscia was attempting to catch Hubie Brooks' 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could have been more down during the time between my error and 
that hit," Doran said. "I needed some way to react, and I got it." 
</P>
<P>
After intentionally walking Glenn Davis after Doran had gone to second base on 
Brooks' throw, Wetteland gave up a third consecutive two-strike hit -- a 
three-run homer to Glenn Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Astros' first home run of the season. A couple of innings later they 
had their first victory this season. But it was not the first time the Dodgers 
have questioned Wetteland's judgment this season. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in San Diego, he gave up a two-strike home run to Tony Gwynn, who 
had gone 84 games without one. Two days earlier, on opening day in Dodger 
Stadium, he gave up a two-out single to Benito Santiago and an RBI double to 
Garry Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Wetteland, 23, was removed from the rotation. The way things are 
going, he will be lucky if that's the only thing that happens to him this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game is, when you get the other guy down, you make him hit 
your pitch," Perranoski said. "This isn't happening here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wetteland: "Yes, I guess they might be losing confidence in me. I guess 
that giving up blasts and two-out hits might cause them to wonder. What would 
you think? 
</P>
<P>
"But I know I haven't lost confidence. And I know I'll get out of this. I will 
get out of this." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Orel Hershiser left the game after six innings, trailing, 3-1. 
But with two out in the seventh, Jeff Hamilton singled and Alfredo Griffin 
reached first when Doran muffed his grounder. Chris Gwynn's pinch-hit double 
tied the score and took Hershiser off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of a weird day," Hershiser said. "It started out OK, but turned into a 
comedy of errors. I threw just average . . . and (Astro starter Mike) Scott was 
just not as dominant as he used to be. One of those kinds of days." 
</P>
<P>
The strangeness began immediately for the Dodgers. They drew three walks, stole 
three bases and hit three fly balls. And they didn't score. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel led off by drawing a walk off Scott, who gave up only 2.4 walks per 
nine innings last season. Samuel has averaged one walk every four games. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel then stole second, and one out later, Kal Daniels walked. Then he and 
Samuel pulled off the team's first double steal of the season, moving them to 
second and third with one out and Eddie Murray batting. 
</P>
<P>
Murray popped up to shallow left field for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks then drew the third walk of the inning to load the bases for 
Scioscia. But Scioscia popped out to second base to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We had him, and we couldn't bury him," Hershiser said of Scott. 
</P>
<P>
And as Wetteland knows, it is either bury or be buried. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland's position as the team's long reliever seems safe until either 
Jim Gott or Pat Perry return from off-season surgery. Both will throw off a 
mound again today and might begin rehabilitation in the minor leagues within 
two to three weeks. Before they return, the Dodgers might give Tim Crews a 
chance at that role. Crews was the only healthy Dodger reliever who didn't 
appear in Thursday's 8-6 loss at San Diego. "I swear, I don't know what's going 
on, they haven't told me anything," said Crews, who has pitched two scoreless 
innings this season after going 0-1 with a 3.21 ERA last season. An ERA above 
3.00 for a relief pitcher is not considered great. He added, "It's just hard 
for me to watch a game like (Saturday's) slip away like that. I keep thinking, 
'I'm ready, I could be in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton stayed in a slump, fouling out on reliever Dave Smith's first 
pitch with two outs and the bases loaded in the eighth inning. "I got the pitch 
I was looking for, and I still couldn't hit it. That's when it really gets 
upsetting," Hamilton said. Although he had one hit to raise his average to 
.130, he still looks uncomfortable at the plate and has been icing a sore right 
shoulder after games. The Dodgers might give him a rest in favor of Lenny 
Harris, although Hamilton said he doesn't want one. "I am going to be running 
and swinging every day anyway, so why not do it in a game?" he said. "I know 
I'm better than this." Hamilton said the shoulder soreness had been diagnosed 
as a form of tendinitis, and although it doesn't appear to have affected his 
throwing, he says it might be hurting his hitting. "Compared to when I got to 
spring training, before it started to hurt, I am not swinging the bat as well 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gwynn was thrilled to get his two-run pinch double Saturday, even if it 
was a blooper that bounced past a diving Gerald Young in center field. "I 
needed that hit in my position," said Gwynn, who is trying to establish himself 
as an effective pinch-hitter. It didn't help that he blew an important 
hit-and-run play against the Padres. "The good thing is, at least for the next 
couple of games, I'll only be thinking about that hit," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph was especially glad to see Mike Scott leave the game shortly 
before Randolph came to the plate to start the sixth inning. By going hitless 
in two at-bats against Scott Saturday, Randolph is hitless in 16 at-bats 
against Scott in Randolph's two National League seasons. . . . Saturday marked 
the 40th wedding anniversary of Tom and Jo Lasorda.

<P>
PLAYER (65) HAS A BIG LEAD ON THE BIG TWO 
</P>

<P>
Gary Player takes a five-stroke lead into the final round of the PGA Seniors 
Championship today, but he's not anticipating having a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a very nerve-racking day," Player said after posting the low score 
of the tournament, a seven-under-par 65 Saturday on the Champion course at PGA 
National Golf Club. "It's a very difficult golf course. It won't be my idea of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
But with longtime rivals Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino in the final group, it 
should be an enjoyable day for the spectators here and a national television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Player is at eight-under 208, but Nicklaus, the first-round leader, moved back 
into contention with 67 and 213, followed by Trevino at 70-214. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's probably Player's tournament to lose, despite his protests. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel at all confident with a five-stroke lead," he said. "I would feel 
better if I was eight strokes behind." 
</P>
<P>
Said Trevino: "I don't see anyone but the three of us winning. For anyone else 
to have a chance, all three of us would have to play poorly, and that's not 
going to happen, not all three of us." 
</P>
<P>
No one else was under par heading into the final round of the $450,000 
tournament, a major championship on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Miller Barber, the 1981 winner of the PGA Seniors, was alone in fourth at 
68-216. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Player could have made it all academic had he been able to maintain 
his early pace Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the day tied for the lead with fellow South African Harold Henning at 
one-under-par 143, Player eagled the third hole, birdied the fourth, then made 
five birdies in a row from the sixth through 10th holes. 
</P>
<P>
He made the turn at seven-under 29 and through 10 holes, he led Nicklaus and 
playing partner Trevino by eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Player refused to look ahead. "There is so much water on the back nine 
here, you could make four double-bogeys in a hurry and not play poorly," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Player made only one, misjudging the wind at the par-four 14th hole. "From the 
tee, I thought the wind was right-to-left, so I hit my drive down the right 
side of the fairway. But it was left-to-right and it blew my ball into the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
He birdied the short 15th and parred the last three holes. "I had 36 on the 
back, and I'm just as excited as I could be about it," Player said. 
</P>
<P>
On the front nine, he hit two drivers to the third green and sank a five-foot 
putt for eagle. His six birdie putts over the next seven holes ranged from 
three to 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Player's early performance got Nicklaus' attention. "When I walked up to the 
12th tee, I looked at the leader board and saw he was eight under par (for the 
day)," Nicklaus said. "I figured it was time to get myself in gear." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus birdied the next three holes, on putts of 14, five and 25 feet, then 
parred in. 
</P>
<P>
After Trevino made the turn in 36 with one birdie and one bogey -- during which 
"I was just keeping score for Gary," he said -- Trevino had four birdies and 
two bogies on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be fun tomorrow, win or lose," Trevino said. "The last time the 
three of us were 'paired' together was during the last round of the Tournament 
Players Championship in 1980, and I won." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Beard of Palm Desert remained the low Southern Californian with 76-221, 
tied for ninth. Jerry Barber of Los Angeles moved up to a tie for 15th with 
71-223. Harlan Stevenson of Bonsall slipped back into the pack at 236 after an 
82.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOME PROMOTERS INTO HYPE, BUT KING JUST HYPERVENTILATES

Don King pulled out all the stops, and then some, at a news conference to 
promote the upcoming fight between Azumah Nelson and Pernell Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
King: "The true reality is we are African Americans. But this young kid 
Whitaker has only the seed of the heritage. He's running up against a real 
animal out of the bush -- a terrible warrior from Ghana. Azumah's running 
through the jungle right now with a loin cloth. He's wrestling tigers. Azumah 
will eat him up like a well-done steak or a raw piece of meat." 
</P>
<P>
Tigers? In Ghana? Maybe he wrestles them in the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Get the shovels: When Jack Nicklaus faced an impossible bunker shot during the 
PGA Seniors, USA cable analyst Peter Kostis said, "This situation might cause 
Jack to re-design this bunker." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus designed the course. 
</P>
<P>
Limited warranty: Said TBS analyst Kevin Loughery as the ball came to Detroit's 
Isiah Thomas in the final seconds against Atlanta Friday night: "I guarantee 
Isiah will shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Isiah passed the ball. Dominique Wilkins picked it off and Atlanta won. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When John Long of the Atlanta Hawks came into the NBA, he played 
for the same coach he did in college. Who was it? 
</P>
<P>
Funny guy: From Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, revealing he won a 
$100 bet from George Steinbrenner on when the lockout would end: "He sent me 
400 quarters in a jar of honey. I've got to figure a way to get the quarters 
out of the jar." 
</P>
<P>
Add Steinbrenner: Bob Quinn, the general manger of the Cincinnati Reds who 
served in the same capacity for the New York Yankees, told the Philadelphia 
Inquirer he used to start the day with the Serenity Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn: "It goes, 'God, grant me the serenity to to accept the things I cannot 
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the 
difference.' 
</P>
<P>
"When I was with Steinbrenner, I started the day with serenity. I made up my 
mind I didn't give a damn what he said to me. He could call me a no-good dummy 
every day. Hey, if I could survive him three years without drinking, the rest 
is downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy: Now that Tom Niedenfuer has signed a minor league contract with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, how's this for a scenario: In a National League playoff 
game between the Dodgers and Cardinals, John Tudor and Niedenfuer combine for 
the win as Pedro Guerrero hits the game-winning homer for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Cliche city: Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun, on the debut of ESPN baseball 
analyst Bill Robinson: "Robinson said of a line drive to the outfield, 'You 
could hang clothes on that one for about a week and a half.' And Robinson could 
hang that kind of hackneyed description right alongside the laundry."

GOODEN NO PROBLEM FOR EXPOS IN 6-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being hammered for the second start in succession Saturday at Montreal, 
it was only natural to wonder if his right shoulder was still bothering Dwight 
Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
The shoulder problem forced the New York Met pitcher to miss much of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Santovenia's bases-loaded double highlighted a five-run second inning 
against Gooden, and the Expos went on to edge the Mets, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden gave up five runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings in a loss to 
Pittsburgh on opening day and the same in three innings Saturday. He is 0-2, 
with an earned-run average of 11.75. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no pain in the shoulder," Gooden said after the opener. "I am 
pitching freely. I just needed a longer spring, especially after missing so 
much of last season." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden was not available for comment after his second pounding. He left for 
Florida, where his daughter was born Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson said he didn't think there was a problem with the 
shoulder. "One of his problems is he's throwing too many pitches in the middle 
of the plate," Johnson said. "He also may be tipping his pitches. He had that 
problem last spring." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos batted nine men in the second inning. Tim Wallach, Andres Galarraga 
and Larry Walker singled before Santovenia cleared the bases with a bloop 
double down the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Bob Rodgers of the Expos wouldn't say whether Gooden was tipping his 
pitches. "All I know," he said, "is that we were hitting shots. He was throwing 
hard, but his ball wasn't moving." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines of the Expos stole his 586th base in the fifth inning, tying Maury 
Wills for 10th on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Dennis Martinez (1-0) wasn't much sharper than Gooden. In his 
second start, Martinez gave up eight hits and four runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Mike Harkey knows he will be in the Cubs' pitching 
rotation only until injured Rick Sutcliffe returns. The rookie from San Diego 
intends to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey, a 23-year-old right-hander in his first start since late in 1988, gave 
up five hits and a run in six innings at Pittsburgh to earn his first major 
league victory. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Sid Bream made an error that contributed to the three-run third 
inning that made Harkey a winner. Harkey was 0-3 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey, who starred at Cal State Fullerton and was a first-round choice (fourth 
player chosen) in the 1987 draft, spent most of last season on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs are 4-1. Mitch Williams has four saves. He pitched a scoreless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 -- The Padre bullpen, after the loss of Mark 
Davis, was supposed to be suspect. But in the last two games, the Giant 
relievers have faltered. 
</P>
<P>
After Eric Gunderson pitched six impressive innings and Kevin Mitchell hit his 
first home run of the season, the Giants had a 3-1 lead going into the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres got a run in the eighth inning, then tied the score on Garry 
Templeton's two-out single in the ninth. They won it in the 10th on Mike 
Pagliarulo's sacrifice fly off Jeff Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night the Padres came from behind to tie on Jack Clark's home run, then 
won it with five runs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, St. Louis 2 -- Tommy Herr, who had hit only 22 home runs in 10 
seasons, hit a two-run home run in the seventh inning at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Bruce Ruffin gave up six hits and two runs in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati-Atlanta -- The unbeaten Reds took a 9-4 lead in the fourth inning at 
Atlanta, but the game was called because of rain. DAN HAFNER

The San Francisco Giants have granted indefinite leave to pitcher Steve 
Bedrosian, whose 2 1/2-year-old son, Cody, has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to him and his family when he comes back, however long," Manager Roger 
Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve should take as much time as he needs with his family before coming back, 
as those concerns are so much more important than baseball," General Manager Al 
Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
The child suffered from a fever and pain in his right shoulder and on Tuesday a 
lump was found on his forearm. He underwent tests Wednesday and Thursday and 
his condition was diagnosed as leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Will Straw, the team physician, said chemotherapy will probably start 
immediately. Bedrosian left the team Tuesday in Atlanta and flew home to the 
Bay Area.

SABERHAGEN, DAVIS ADD AURA TO ROYAL WIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Bret Saberhagen doesn't know this is a year ending in an even number. 
Or maybe, with Mark Davis around, it won't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
With Saberhagen starting and Davis finishing Saturday at Kansas City in the 
Royals' 3-1 victory over Toronto, major league history was made. It was the 
first time a team had both reigning Cy Young Award winners figure in the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, the American League winner for the second time with a 23-6 record 
last season, gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings to win it. Davis, who had 44 
saves at San Diego to win the National League award, pitched a perfect ninth to 
save it. In three appearances after signing as a free agent with the Royals, 
Davis has retired all seven batters he has faced. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who has had problems in even years and pitched brilliantly in 
odd-numbered years, is off to a 1-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie in 1984, Saberhagen was 10-11. In 1985, he was 20-6 and won the 
award for the first time. The next year he was 7-12. But, in 1987, he bounced 
back to 18-10. In 1988, he fell to 14-16. 
</P>
<P>
With that record, it would figure he might be in store for a below-.500 season 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong," Saberhagen said. "This year, things are going to be different. I 
really worked hard over the winter. I am in great shape and having Mark, the 
best reliever in the game, can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"He should get plenty of opportunities like this. With Monty (Jeff Montgomery) 
setting him up, Mark will get the chances." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery was the finisher last season, getting 18 saves. When Saberhagen 
faltered in the eighth, Montgomery came in to get the last two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson scored two runs and had three hits, two of them doubles. In the 
second inning, he singled off Todd Stottlemyre (0-2), stole second and scored 
on Willie Wilson's double. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Jackson hit what appeared to be a routine single in front of 
Toronto center fielder Mookie Wilson and legged it into a double, then scored 
on Jim Eisenreich's single. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 8, New York 4 -- Throughout his career, Nolan Ryan has probably lost more 
well-pitched games than just about anyone. So, the 43-year-old power pitcher 
wasn't about to turn down his 291st victory just because of a mediocre 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who pitched five hitless innings to win on opening day, gave up 10 hits 
and four runs in seven innings at New York. He is 6-0 against the Yankees since 
losing to them in Anaheim for the Angels in May, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have my good stuff today," Ryan said. "But some days you get the 
breaks. My fastball wasn't as good as it was the other day, but my control was 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly, usually a slow starter, had three hits off Ryan and is six for 
12 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Roger Clemens is throwing hard again and so is Lee 
Smith. That means the Red Sox are off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens struck out 10 batters for the 39th time in his career in this game at 
Boston. He gave up eight hits and three runs in 6 2/3 innings and the Red Sox 
won for the 7,000th time. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy bailed out Clemens in the seventh and Smith got the last four outs 
for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bosio blanked the Red Sox with two hits in five innings. He left with a 
2-0 lead. The Red Sox jumped on Don August for all their runs in the sixth 
inning. A suicide squeeze by Luis Rivera drove in the go-ahead run and Wade 
Boggs singled home the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 7, Detroit 4 -- Two years ago, the Orioles were the doormat of the 
American League. Last year they were the big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Detroit, the Tigers, who lost 103 games last season, most 
resembled a doormat. They made five errors to present the Orioles with three 
unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson gave up eight hits but only two runs in 5 1/3 innings to win it, 
and Gregg Olson, the rookie bullpen sensation of last season, pitched two 
scoreless innings to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Seattle 2 -- Dave Stewart continued to be nearly perfect in April. 
He held the Mariners to two hits in 6 2/3 innings at Seattle to win his second 
in a row. He is 16-0 in April the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson and Mike Gallego homered for the Athletics (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, going after his fourth consecutive 20-victory season, is 12-0 against 
the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, Cleveland 4 -- Sammy Sosa led an extra-base barrage at Chicago with 
two triples in a romp over the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox pounded out 15 hits, six of them for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
Melido Perez needed help in the seventh, but posted his first win. Greg 
Swindell was the loser. DAN HAFNER

Aaron Krickstein shocked an erratic Ivan Lendl Saturday, beating the top-seeded 
player, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, to reach the men's singles final in the Japan Open at 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded American faces defending champion Stefan Edberg of Sweden. 
Edberg, seeded second, beat third-seeded Brad Gilbert, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), in the 
other semifinal match on the hard courts of the Ariake Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, had 18 aces but lost to Krickstein for 
the first time in five matches. 
</P>
<P>
"He played very well and he served extremely well," Lendl said of Krickstein. 
"I made a lot of errors and when I had the chances I just threw them away. I 
hadn't been doing any training, and I was basically looking forward to the 
grass and getting ready for Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Said Krickstein: "I've played well here and against Stefan it should be a good, 
close and tough match." Krickstein has beaten Edberg three of the four times 
they have played. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, who had six aces, hit 61.8% of his first serves in, compared to 
Lendl's 47%. 
</P>
<P>
The women's singles final will pair top-seeded Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden 
with Australia's Elizabeth Smylie, seeded sixth. Lindqvist beat Eva Sviglerova 
of Czechoslovakia, 6-1, 6-2, and Smylie beat Japan's 17-year-old Naoko 
Sawamatsu, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Steffi Graf split a pair of tiebreakers, then took advantage of 
Natalia Zvereva's exhaustion in the final set to complete a 7-6 (10-8), 6-7 
(7-4), 6-1 victory in the semifinals of the Bausch &amp; Lomb tennis 
championships at Amelia Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated defending champion Gabriela Sabatini, 6-4, 
6-0, in the other semifinal and said, "I feel very confident I can win the 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The triumph was the 56th in a row for Graf, who is trying to win this $350,000 
tournament for the first time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini beat Graf in the semifinals two years ago and in the final last year. 
</P>
<P>
Graf improved her record to 4-0 against Zvereva, but the Soviet fared much 
better than in their first meeting -- a 6-0, 6-0 blowout in the 1988 French 
Open final that lasted only 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador powered past Andrei Chesnokov, 6-3, 7-5, 
to advance to the final of the 38th Count of Godo tournament at Barcelona, 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez earned the right to defend the title he won last year against Argentina's 
Guillermo Perez-Roldan, who upset third-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain. The 
10th-seeded Argentine held off the error-prone Spaniard, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Jim Peterson of Orange defeated J.J. Jackson of Hendersonville, N.C., 6-2, 6-2, 
to win the boys' 16 title at the Easter Bowl tournament in Miami.

NUNN MADE GRADE, NOT WEIGHT

Michael Nunn is not his own worst critic. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a majority 12-round decision over Marlon Starling Saturday night 
in a bout that lived down to expectations, the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight champion was asked to grade his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I give myself an A," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
What the crowd of 3,896 at the Mirage Hotel had given him mostly, though, were 
boos. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't satisfy everybody," Nunn said. "The fans don't take any punches." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the fans who paid anywhere from $100 to $300 to watch in person and those 
who tuned in on HBO were spoiled by the recent wars between Buster Douglas and 
Mike Tyson and Julio Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But all three fights had something in common -- inconsistent scoring. 
</P>
<P>
This time one judge, Gary Merritt, scored it even, and the other two -- Glen 
Hamada and Art Lurie -- had Nunn by eight and six points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Neither fighter revealed his card. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that they raised my hand when it was done," Nunn said. 
"I'm happy to get it over with. I got a little lazy thinking about my manager 
problems and it took me a couple of rounds to get going. But after that, I was 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
After walking into the interview room, Starling embraced Nunn at the head 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Starling said something about Nunn getting away with one, but then seemed to 
concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a better day, Michael," said Starling, the World Boxing Council 
welterweight champion. "He was a little busier than me, a little more elusive. 
I take my hat off to him. He stole the middle rounds. I thought my performance 
was subpar." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, there were fears expressed in the Nunn camp that their 
fighter would be subpar. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn had trained the last three weeks without his longtime conditioner, Joe 
Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the fight, Nunn asked Goossen to work his corner. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the first time, Nunn came in over the contracted weight for a fight. 
Only after a visit to the men's room did he scale the middleweight limit of 160 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has gone wrong," said Bob Surkein, the adviser who has worked with 
Nunn since his amateur days. "He's never had trouble making weight. It worries 
me no end." 
</P>
<P>
"Coming in heavy for a title fight is inexcusable," said Angelo Dundee, who did 
analysis on international TV. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Nunn did have an excuse. "On the other scale that I used before the 
weigh-in, I weighed 158," he said. "Then I drank a lot of orange juice." 
</P>
<P>
Weight was still on his mind after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a thousand pounds is off my back," Nunn said.

The cynics who said Mike McCallum's legs would let him down were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican-born New Yorker, who admits to being 33, bounced around the ring 
at the Royal Albert Hall for 10 rounds on Saturday, then demolished British 
challenger Michael Watson, eight years his junior, with a right hand that ended 
the fight late in the 11th round. 
</P>
<P>
The knockout punctuated McCallum's 11th world title bout and enabled him to 
retain his World Boxing Assn. middleweight title in a most convincing way. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great fight," he said. "Michael Watson came to fight tonight and gave 
it everything, but I had too much for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew exactly how to take him out. To his credit, he came out to show me that 
he wanted to fight and he showed great heart and determination. But I was not 
going to let him have any glory. It's my title and I was determined to keep 
it." 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, well ahead on points, cornered the challenger in the final minute of 
the next-to-last round and sent him sprawling to the canvas with a right hand 
to earn his 38th victory against one loss. McCallum was on course to win his 
fifth consecutive decision before the knockout at 2:20. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum kept Watson, 25, off balance throughout with a variety of punches. But 
Watson (22-2-1) kept coming forward despite swelling around his right eye.

RUSH FOR TV, RADIO STATIONS LOSING STEAM; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: STATIONS ARE NO LONGER SUCH HOT PROPERTIES DUE TO AN AD SLUMP, DISARRAY 
IN THE JUNK BOND MARKET AND COMPETITION FROM CABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, during the height of investor interest in acquiring television 
and radio licenses, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer put three of his TV 
stations up for sale for a reported $82 million. This year he finally sold 
them. The price? Just $52 million. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a television or radio station license, the oft-stated observation goes, 
used to be like owning "a license to print money." But in the wake of a 
nationwide advertising slump, disarray in the junk bond market and competition 
from the rapidly growing cable television industry, the clamor for television 
and radio stations has suddenly lost some of its steam. 
</P>
<P>
"The bloom is beginning to fade," says media analyst Paul Kagan, who estimates 
that the $4.37 billion in proposed television and radio station transactions in 
1989 was the lowest dollar amount since 1984. And with new media ventures on 
the horizon that may eventually siphon off even more advertising dollars -- 
such as the $1-billion satellite-to-home Sky Cable video service announced in 
February by Hughes Communications and three other companies -- broadcast 
stations could become even less attractive investments, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite softening in sales prices; I'm seeing deals today that 
I would have killed for two years ago," said Frank D. Osborn, president of 
Osborn Communications, a New York-based company that operates 18 radio stations 
and five television stations. A broadcast license, Osborn added, is "no longer 
a license to print money; you can screw up and lose a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Glazer would not comment on his sale of three stations to a group of investors 
headed by former ABC television executive I. Martin Pompadur. But many analysts 
say that, like Glazer, other station owners are lowering asking prices or 
canceling deals altogether as they find that their broadcast licenses aren't 
fetching as many eager buyers as they once were. 
</P>
<P>
"The bidding frenzy for stations has disappeared," said Pompadur, who is chief 
executive of privately held RP Cos., which brought WRBL in Columbus, Ga.; WTWO 
in Terre Haute, Ind., and KQTV in St. Joseph, Mo., from Glazer. "People are 
basically disappointed in station properties due to (their poor) cash flow" and 
sluggish advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although some experts estimate that as many as 30% of the nation's more than 
9,000 radio stations and 1,169 television stations lose money each year, 
commercial broadcast stations have been viewed as lucrative investments because 
of their relative scarcity. Much like vacant real estate in rapidly 
appreciating neighborhoods, radio and TV stations can rise greatly in value 
despite not having huge or rising profits or income. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, unlike a manufacturing concern whose material costs jump along 
with increased production, broadcasters' costs are largely fixed. It's no more 
expensive to air $1 million in commercials than it is to broadcast $100 million 
worth; thus, a station's pretax profit margin can run as high as 40%. And 
despite the increased competition for advertising dollars from cable and other 
media, broadcasting is one of the few enterprises that can reach a broad 
audience efficiently. Meanwhile, radio touts its unique ability to reach 
listeners while they commute to work. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, Pompadur said he believes that broadcast ownership "remains 
a very good business. There are very high profit margins. It's not 
labor-intensive, and there's no foreign competition." He also noted that TV 
seller Glazer "still is making a very nice capital gain" on his three TV 
stations despite getting $30 million less than his asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Glazer might have gotten more had TV revenue continued rising at 
its previous double-digit rates. But TV revenue, nearly all of it advertising, 
has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
While total revenue for all media has risen in the past decade, it has risen 
fastest for cable system operators, according to a study by Bortz &amp; Co., a 
Denver-based media consultant. Between 1980 and 1988, cable revenue jumped 
21.4% to $13.7 billion. Meanwhile, total network TV revenue grew just 7.9% to 
$9.4 billion and radio revenue rose 9.6% to $7.7 billion during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, brokers say that TV station owners who once asked buyers to pay as 
much as 16 times cash flow for a network affiliate have recently scaled back 
their asking prices by as much as half. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, station trading expanded dramatically as changes in federal tax 
laws, broadcast regulation and the emergence of more creative financing 
motivated buyers and sellers to make deals on broadcast properties, especially 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission set the stage for increased activity in 
1984 when it liberalized rules that had restricted station ownership to seven 
FM radio stations, seven AM radio stations and seven television stations. The 
agency, which regulates the communications industry, voted to allow most 
companies to own as many as 12 stations in each category. 
</P>
<P>
But the market did not take off until 1985, when a proposed increase in capital 
gains taxes touched off an explosion in station trading. Total station 
transactions jumped 448% to $14.8 billion in 1985, according to Kagan, as 
sellers rushed to complete deals before the tax increase took effect. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the 1980s, station trading received an additional boost as a 
nascent junk bond market spurred bigger and bigger media deals. 
</P>
<P>
The second-largest radio station leveraged buyout in history occured in 1989, 
for instance, when the Group W broadcast division of Westinghouse Electric Co. 
paid $368 million to acquire 10 radio stations from two broadcast companies 
controlled by New York investor Robert F. X. Sillerman. As a condition of the 
sale, Sillerman brought back $144 million of junk bonds from one of his 
companies, Metropolitan Broadcasting, before the deal was consummated. 
</P>
<P>
But with the collapse of the junk bond market and the national advertising 
slump, the heady days of feverish station buying and selling appear to be over. 
</P>
<P>
Total station transactions in 1989 fell to $4.1 billion from $5.6 billion the 
previous year, or less than one-third the total of the peak year of 1985. 
Television sales, which had soared as high as $12.2 billion, have been 
especially hard hit, declining last year to just $1.8 billion in transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors peddling stations in the current depressed station market lament 
the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four television stations for sale; each one is profitable with 
multimillion-dollar cash flow, but the market just isn't what it was four years 
ago," mused Ray Timothy, senior managing director at Furman Selz Mager Dietz 
&amp; Birney, a New York investment banking firm that is trying to sell the 
four TV stations on behalf of Beam Communications. Although Timothy says he's 
asking only $50 million for all four stations, he's found "a jittery financial 
climate. There's a lot of pent-up money on the sidelines waiting for the 
situation to clarify." 
</P>
<P>
A less-pronounced slump has occurred in radio, although Southern California has 
remained strong, with sellers still managing to get top dollar for their radio 
stations because of the robust advertising climate here, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In car-crazed Southern California, said Walter R. Sabo Jr., a New York-based 
consultant who was once general manager of the ABC Radio Network, "one of best 
ways for advertisers to reach most people between 9 and 5 is through radio. 
That's why the radio business in Los Angeles has been so strong." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some Southern California broadcasters have nevertheless had to spend 
heavily to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Westwood One reported losses of $22.7 million on revenue of 
$130.6 million for the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1989. Norman Pattiz, chairman 
of the Culver City-based radio network, said the company's losses stemmed 
mainly from start-up costs associated with the purchase of a Los Angeles radio 
station as well as the $39-million purchase of WYNY-FM in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Pattiz was criticized by some experts for paying too much, $56 million, to 
acquire his Los Angeles radio station early last year. But Pattiz said the 
station, relaunched last March as KQLZ-FM "Pirate Radio," was "a bargain." 
</P>
<P>
"The last radio station to sell in L.A. was KJOI-FM, and that went for $87 
million," Pattiz said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Viacom International Inc. paid $101.5 million to purchase KJOI-FM 
and two Denver stations from Command Communications. It was the third sale of 
KJOI in five years and solidified that station's reputation as the priciest FM 
station in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The station's repeated change of hands was made possible by the FCC dropping 
its so-called anti-trafficking rule, which used to require owners to hold on to 
stations for three years before selling them. The rule change was one factor 
that contributed to the spurt in station sales between 1985 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But deals the size of the Viacom purchase are usually highly leveraged. And in 
recent years some broadcasters that have gone deep into debt to acquire 
stations have later found themselves in financial straits. 
</P>
<P>
SCI Television Inc., a Denver-based owner of six network-affiliated TV 
stations, narrowly escaped bankruptcy proceedings in late January. It entered 
into a new debt structuring agreement Feb. 4 after defaulting on its junk bond 
debt when revenue did not meet projections. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest Spanish television network, Univision, is facing similar 
prospects after missing interest payments on $270 million of junk bonds. A year 
ago, Univision, which owns eight U.S. television stations, including KMEX in 
Los Angeles, had projected 1989 cash flow at $62 million. In September, the 
figure was lowered to $52 million. The actual year-end figure was just $40 
million, according to a repurchase offer for Univision's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcaster Osborn thinks that things may get worse before they get better. 
</P>
<P>
"Station sale prices haven't reached fire-sale levels yet, but I think they 
will in the next six to 12 months," Osborn said. When they drop to that level, 
however, Osborn said his company will be among those in line to buy. 
</P>

Communications Commission. A small percentage of these deals are either never

MONEY TALK: UTILITY SURCHARGES FOR NEEDY AREN'T DEDUCTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: There are some minor charges on two of my utility bills that I do not 
understand. My gas bill has a "state regulatory fee" and a "low-income fund 
surcharge." My telephone bill has various fees and surcharges, including one 
for communication devices for the deaf and disabled. Who gets the income from 
these charges? Also, are any of these fees considered "other taxes" by the 
Internal Revenue Service and therefore deductible? -- W.C.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: The funds generated by the fees you mentioned are administered in a variety 
of ways, according to Pacific Bell and Southern California Gas Co. And, to 
answer your second question, none are deductible on state and federal tax 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
California residents currently pay a 0.3% surcharge on all telephone calls made 
within the state to provide free telecommunication devices for the deaf. The 
money is administered by a trust fund that was established when the levy was 
approved. Similarly, funds generated by the 0.69% surcharge on intrastate calls 
for emergency telephone systems are funneled into a special trust fund that 
supports 911 service throughout the state. Californians also pay a 2.5% 
surcharge on all long-distance calls made within the state to help provide 
low-cost telephone service to the needy. The state regulatory fee on telephone 
bills goes toward supporting the state Public Utilities Commission, the 
government agency charged with regulating all utilities in California. 
</P>
<P>
Moving on to your gas bill, the "low-income fund surcharge" is levied by all 
gas companies throughout the state at the behest of the Legislature. Funds 
generated by the fee are used to provide subsidized gas service for needy 
families. Gas companies administer the fund and provide low-cost service to 
households meeting minimum income standards. The regulatory fee, like the one 
charged by phone company, goes toward supporting the PUC's operations. 
</P>
<P>
According to spokesmen for both utilities, these levies are not considered 
taxes deductible by the IRS. Why? The gas company said it was because the 
low-income families that it serves with its subsidized gas program are not "an 
IRS-defined charitable group." And a phone company spokesman said its fees were 
considered "sales or excise" taxes, which are no longer deductible. Our tax 
experts agree: The levies -- nickels and dimes that add up to dollars by 
year-end -- are not tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Determining Taxes on Stocks, Dividends 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have participated in a dividend reinvestment program since 1982 and expect 
to sell all the shares I hold in this company sometime this year. During the 
past seven years, I have paid income taxes on the dividends I received, even 
though they were reinvested in additional stock. How do I determine my tax 
obligation on the gain I received from the sale? -- J.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: If your records are complete and up to date, you should have no problem 
determining your tax bill. The price you paid for the stock you purchased with 
your reinvested dividends becomes your tax basis in these shares. To calculate 
your taxable gain, simply subtract the basis from your sales price. For 
example, an admittedly simple one, let's say you had reinvested $100 and had 
purchased four shares. Because you would have paid income tax on the $100 
during the year in which the dividend was earned, each of the shares you 
purchased would carry a taxable basis of $25. If you sell those shares for $50 
each, your taxable gain is $25 per share, or a total of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Your calculations to determine gains on stock purchased over seven years will 
be more complicated than the above example, but the process will be eased 
considerably because you intend on selling all your shares at once. If you were 
selling only a part of your holdings, the situation would be far more 
complicated. In that case, our tax experts say, you would have to specifically 
designate the shares you intended to sell, identifying them by their purchase 
date and price. 
</P>
<P>
Most dividend reinvestment programs send their investors quarterly reports 
detailing the cash value of their dividends and the number of shares -- with 
their sales price -- credited to their accounts. If you have saved these over 
the years, you should know exactly the tax basis of every share you are 
selling. If you haven't saved them (tsk, tsk), you can still retrieve the 
information you need. The investor relations department of the company should 
be able to help you unravel your account and provide you with new copies of 
your purchase records. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, this is probably a good time to remind everyone who participates in 
a dividend reinvestment program that complete and thorough record-keeping is 
more than a secretarial chore; it's an absolute necessity. If you are audited, 
the IRS can make you prove the taxable basis of the shares you are selling, 
and, if you can't, you could be forced to pay tax on your entire sales 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
NOTE: Last week's column contained some erroneous information inadvertently 
provided by the Social Security Administration. A reader asked if her Social 
Security or Supplemental Security Income benefits would be reduced as a result 
of her marrying a man who also receives Social Security and a private pension. 
</P>
<P>
The response was that her Social Security benefits would not be reduced, which 
is true. However, it is not true that Supplemental Security Income benefits are 
reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of her husband's income. Because of a 
recent change in Social Security regulations, the reduction would be far less. 
In the hypothetical example we used, where the reader is receiving $250 in 
monthly SSI benefits, her payment would be reduced by just $6 if her husband 
had a monthly income of $400. Her SSI payments would be eliminated only if her 
husband's monthly income were $787 or more.

PERSONAL FINANCE: IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING FOR YOUR 1990 TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's almost over. Tax filing deadline is tomorrow. You won't have to worry 
about deductions and credits and those lousy forms until next year, you say. 
</P>
<P>
But that would be a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The best time for tax planning is now, when you've just finished reviewing the 
state of your finances in the course of doing your taxes. "Everything's fresh 
in your mind now," says William G. Brennan, tax partner at the accounting firm 
of Ernst &amp; Young in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Also, most tax-saving strategies are best put into effect early in the year, 
not when Thanksgiving or Christmas roll around. 
</P>
<P>
With that early-bird spirit in mind, here is a checklist of time-honored tax 
planning tips that you can put into use now: 
</P>
<P>
* Adjust your withholding. If you received or expect a big refund or paid a lot 
of additional tax, it's time to redo your W-4 form. Getting refunds may be fun, 
but what you're really doing is giving the government an interest-free loan of 
your money. 
</P>
<P>
* Organize your records. Resolve to spend a couple of hours each month to bring 
your files up to date. "A good time to do that is when you are reconciling your 
checkbooks and bank statements," says Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax 
attorney and author of "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies." 
</P>
<P>
* Make gifts to children. A bill is under consideration in Congress to curb the 
amount of assets you can give to your children, relatives or others each year 
-- exempt of gift taxes -- to $30,000. Now, the limit is $10,000 in gifts per 
person, but there is no limit as to how many individuals you can give to. 
Accordingly, if you were planning to give -- as this is a good way to reduce 
the amount in your estate that might be subject to estate taxes -- you might 
want to write checks or give that stock now instead of later. 
</P>
<P>
* Defer taxable income. If you earn a lot of taxable interest income from 
ordinary savings accounts or money market mutual funds, consider buying 
Treasury bills, Brennan suggests. Not only are they exempt from state tax (a 
real advantage in a high-tax state such as California), they are not taxable on 
the federal level until they mature. Thus, if you get a 12-month bill that 
matures next year, you won't owe tax on the interest until you file your 1991 
tax return in early 1992 -- two years from now (although you might have to make 
estimated tax payments in the interim). 
</P>
<P>
* Fund your IRA early. Waiting until April 15 of next year to make your 
contribution for this year will mean you'll miss out on several months of 
tax-deferred interest earnings. Over the years, the buildup in additional 
earnings from funding your IRA early each year can amount to thousands and 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
* Review your retirement plans. Is the investment mix in your IRA, Keogh, 
401(k) or other retirement plan appropriate for your risk-tolerance, age and 
investment outlook? Most people are inadequately diversified, having put too 
much of their retirement eggs in the same basket. 
</P>
<P>
* Review employee benefits. You may be missing out on some tax breaks in 
company benefit plans out of ignorance or neglect. For example, many employees 
don't enroll in flexible-spending accounts that allow them to use pretax money 
on medical or child-care bills. Savings from these accounts can be quite 
substantial, because you are using funds to pay bills that otherwise would have 
gone to Uncle Sam in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider savings bonds. Series EE bonds are now exempt from federal tax if 
used to fund college education and if you meet certain income and other 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
* Review your appreciated stocks. Instead of selling any stocks, bonds or 
mutual funds on which you have a large capital gain, consider transferring them 
to your children aged 14 or older, Brennan suggests. Thus the gains will be 
taxed at their presumably lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
* Update your beneficiaries. You may be unaware that the persons you named as 
beneficiaries of your insurance policies or retirement plans automatically 
acquire ownership of those assets upon your death independently of your will, 
Block says. So if you have remarried and the beneficiary of your insurance 
policy is your former spouse, you might want to update the policy. 
</P>
<P>
* List your assets. If you haven't already done so, make a list of all your 
assets, Block suggests. This can be useful for many things, including helping 
the executor of your estate or other fiduciaries. That will save expense in the 
administration of your estate. Keep a copy at home so your spouse or children 
can find it. 
</P>
<P>
* Educate yourself. YMCAs, community colleges and others offer good adult 
education courses on tax and financial planning, Block suggests. But be wary of 
courses sponsored by brokerage houses, insurance companies and others that may 
be pushing a specific product, he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay off personal debt. This is the last year you can deduct interest on 
credit card and other non-mortgage debt, and that writeoff is only 10%. Next 
year you get nothing.

MUTUAL FUNDS: TAX-EXEMPT FUNDS AREN'T ALL EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WERNER RENBERG, WERNER RENBERG is co-author of Making Money With Mutual 
Funds and author of a forthcoming book, The Bond Fund Advisor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's too late to cut the taxes you'll pay on 1989 income. But now is a good 
time to figure out how to keep more of your 1990 income. One option is a 
tax-exempt mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
To call itself tax-exempt, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires one 
of two things: A fund must earn at least 80% of its income from securities 
whose interest payments are exempt from federal income tax, essentially bonds 
and notes issued by state and local governments, or 80% of the fund's assets 
must be invested in such securities. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-exempt bond funds invest in securities with lives of more than a year: 
bonds for long-term projects such as schools and highways. Tax-exempt money 
market funds invest in securities with lives of less than a year -- for 
example, IOUs issued by a state government anticipating the receipt of tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 tax-exempt bond funds and more than 200 tax-exempt money market 
funds are monitored by Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 tax-free bond funds and 30 money market funds invest only in 
California. For state residents, these funds offer a double tax exemption: 
Their dividends are free from state as well as federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're considering tax-exempt funds, try to answer some questions: Will a 
tax-free fund actually leave you with more money than a taxable fund? Should 
you invest in a tax-exempt money market fund or a tax-exempt bond fund? 
</P>
<P>
You can usually get the highest income from general, insured and high-yield 
municipal bond funds. These invest in bonds with long maturities, meaning their 
principal becomes due and payable many years into the future. (Long-term bonds 
can have maturities has long as 40 years, but the average in long-term mutual 
fund portfolios is about 15 to 25 years.) 
</P>
<P>
Long-term tax-exempt bonds are the most volatile, with values rising sharply 
when rates fall and falling sharply when rates rise. Of course, the shares of 
mutual funds that invest in these bonds behave the same. As a result, these 
funds are best for investors who have a long-term perspective or can afford the 
market risk. The alternative is to invest in bonds with shorter maturities or 
in money market funds, whose prices don't fluctuate at all. 
</P>
<P>
Just because you can save on taxes doesn't mean a tax-exempt bond fund is the 
best way to go. Key factors are your tax bracket and the difference between 
rates on taxable bonds and those on tax-free bonds. (See the accompanying table 
comparing tax-free and taxable yields.) 
</P>
<P>
If you're comparing the yields of a national municipal bond fund and a 
California fund, remember that Sacramento wants a share of your income from 
other states' securities even if the federal government doesn't. (You are 
entirely exempt from California tax only if a fund is 100% invested in 
California tax-free securities.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition to potential income, consider the credit quality of a fund's 
portfolio; that's the risk that issuers may default on interest or principal 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
General long-term funds, the biggest category of tax-exempt funds, typically 
invest in "investment-grade" securities -- those rated in the top four grades 
by Moody's Investors Service (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) and Standard &amp; Poor's (AAA, 
AA, A, BBB). More aggressive ones may be more heavily invested in A and Baa/BBB 
bonds to earn more income, while more conservative ones may avoid Baa/BBBs. 
</P>
<P>
There is minimal credit risk when a fund invests in securities for which 
interest and principal payments are covered by municipal bond insurance. 
Insurance usually raises bonds' ratings to Aaa/AAA, reflecting the credit 
quality of the insurance companies that write the policies. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are high-yield municipal bond funds. These bear little or no 
resemblance to the taxable high-yield -- or junk -- bond funds that recently 
have performed so poorly. Unlike the taxable funds -- which are concentrated in 
corporate bonds whose credit ratings have been lowered and new, low-rated 
issues -- tax-exempt funds hold relatively few sub-investment grade municipal 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
There are two key reasons for this: 
</P>
<P>
* Few municipal bonds are given low ratings. Of 16,117 state and local 
government issues rated by Moody's -- excluding those enhanced by bond 
insurance or letters of credit -- only 163 are rated below Baa. 
</P>
<P>
* The difference between yields on investment-grade bonds and lower-grade bonds 
has narrowed significantly. Whenever this happens, fund managers upgrade the 
quality of their portfolios, feeling that they're inadequately compensated for 
credit risk. 
</P>
<P>
If high-yield tax-exempt funds aren't concentrated in speculative securities, 
how can they earn high yields? It's not easy. They may load up on Baa/BBB bonds 
and securities whose issuers didn't have them rated. Benham's California 
High-Yield Portfolio, for example, is 40% invested in non-rated securities, 
many of which are bonds backed by special assessments and whose quality may be 
comparable to investment grade. 
</P>
<P>
When assessing a fund that invests in tax-exempt securities of only one state, 
diversification is especially important. Check that a fund is invested in a 
large number of securities issued by a wide variety of government agencies that 
are spread geographically across the state. 
</P>
<P>
In California, even such diversification may not be enough, notes Ian 
MacKinnon, head of Vanguard's Fixed Income Group. The reason: earthquakes. 
Almost every major city sits on a fault line. So his company, like some others, 
offers an insured fund in California. "Insurance provides an extra layer of 
protection," MacKinnon says.

HUGE PROTEST AT ABORTION CLINIC TURNS VIOLENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS and NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 242 people were arrested Saturday after militant abortion protesters 
descended on a Los Angeles women's clinic during a violence-marred, seven-hour 
siege that capped a week of abortion rights protests in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, organized by the national anti-abortion group Operation 
Rescue, failed to shut down the Mid-Wilshire clinic. As hundreds of abortion 
rights activists cheered them on, police cleared a path to the entrance and 
security guards escorted staff and patients inside. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, abortions were conducted inside the Family Planning 
Associates Medical Group clinic while an estimated 1,200 demonstrators 
representing both sides of the emotional issue waved signs, chanted, sang and 
prayed. 
</P>
<P>
More than 340 police officers, including 14 on horseback, worked to control the 
crowd and make the arrests, drawing allegations of brutality from abortion 
protesters. Several people at the protest suffered cuts and bruises, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Operation Rescue demonstrators, including Southern California 
leaders Joseph Foreman and Jeff White, were booked on suspicion of felony 
conspiracy charges after they allegedly instructed others to block doorways. 
Others were booked on misdemeanor trespassing charges. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the drama was a re-enactment, on a smaller but more volatile 
scale, of the massive protest at the clinic on March 25, 1989, that resulted in 
the arrest of 768 people. Just as last year's demonstration capped a weeklong 
wave of protests in Southern California, Saturday's demonstration concluded 
what anti-abortion organizers called a "Holy Week of Rescue" in commemoration 
of Easter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no greater violence than the violence that goes on inside the clinic," 
said Susan Odom, an Operation Rescue organizer from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Activists representing both sides of the abortion debate described two violent 
clashes. The first occured about 7:30 a.m. when abortion foes tried to break 
through a defensive ring formed by the clinic's security guards and abortion 
rights activists around the clinic's back parking lot and entrance. The 
abortion protesters "rushed" the perimeter, clinic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of abortion rights advocacy groups said the clinic was expecting the 
protest because "spies" for the Clinic Defense Alliance, a network of 
organizations formed to counter abortion protesters, had infiltrated Operation 
Rescue rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't prepared for them to jump the fence and start swinging on our 
in-house security," said Michael Monji, associate administrator for Family 
Planning Associates, which operates 30 clinics in Southern California. 
Previously, Monji said, "they just sat down." 
</P>
<P>
Security guard Jim Russell suffered a puncture wound in his arm that he said 
required six stitches. He said one protester pulled his arm down on the 
chain-link fence and another climbed over it. Another guard's face was bloodied 
in the melee, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue organizers acknowledged that protesters scaled fences to get 
near the clinic doors. Dave Conrardy, Southern California field director for 
Operation Rescue, said at least three protesters were beaten by the clinic's 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing our people were doing was crawling over a fence," Conrardy 
said. "Out of 80 people who tried, maybe 40 got over." 
</P>
<P>
The second clash occurred when police moved in to separate hundreds of opposing 
protesters outside on 6th Street. "The two factions were pushing and shoving," 
said Police Capt. Robert Riley, commander of the Rampart Division. Suddenly, 
Riley said, "there were groups of individuals who were pushed away that surged 
toward the officers." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police responded by jabbing protesters with batons and moving in 
with mounted patrols. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference later outside Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, 
where their comrades were jailed, Operation Rescue leaders decried police 
tactics and said they plan to sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Al Howard of a North Long Beach congregation called His Nesting Place 
said he was jabbed in the groin by a police baton. Another protester said his 
hand was still numb from thin plastic handcuffs. One jailed protester was said 
to be wearing a cast where police had applied a nunchuka, a plastic martial 
arts device used in so-called pain-compliance holds. 
</P>
<P>
As in the protest last March, scores of anti-abortion demonstrators went limp 
as police made arrests, prompting officers to use the nunchukas to force them 
into waiting buses. As video cameras operated by the media, protesters and 
police rolled, scores of protesters grimaced, gasped and yelped in pain as 
officers applied the nunchukas around their arms and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Police refer to such techniques as "come-along holds" and said they would be 
unnecessary if protesters agreed to walk on to the bus. Brutality complaints 
were expected, said Lt. Fred Nixon, a police spokesman. "We get those every 
time we police one of these things," he said. "It's why we welcome the 
videotapes and media coverage." 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation capped weeks of formulating strategy. Organizers for both 
sides patrolled the protest area, communicating by two-way radios. Activists 
from as far away as San Diego and Ventura counties had been mobilized by each 
side.

PLANET WORSE OFF SINCE FIRST EARTH DAY IN 1970; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: GAINS HAVE BEEN MADE IN 20 YEARS BUT WORLD'S PROBLEMS NOW ARE 
POTENTIALLY MORE DEVASTATING.

<P>
In the 20 years since the first Earth Day, nature has proved itself to be 
surprisingly resilient. Witness the comeback of the American bald eagle after 
the banning of the pesticide DDT or the cleaning of the once-inflamed Cuyahoga 
River in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But the progress the world will celebrate next Sunday on Earth Day 1990 has 
brought little respite. New, potentially more devastating threats to the 
environment have emerged, forcing the world to recast its environmental agenda 
for the remainder of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the environmental movement 20 years ago worried about an individual dam 
or a single highway, the world today is facing the loss of its tropical forests 
and the extinction of half of its species within the next few decades, as well 
as a potential warming trend that could forever change the climate of the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, we were accelerating as we headed toward the cliff," said Carl Pope, 
conservation director of the Sierra Club. "We applied the brakes during those 
20 years and now we're maybe half-way there." 
</P>
<P>
New controls on vehicle emissions have improved air quality over many cities, 
including Los Angeles, but the very fabric of the atmosphere is shredding 
because of an ozone-destroying pollutant not even recognized two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Erie, which was so polluted by sewage in 1970 that many conservationists 
considered it "dead," has been cleaned up and now has a $600-million fishery. 
But not far away, Lake Michigan is believed to be so contaminated by airborne 
pollutants and industrial chemicals that some conservationists say women of 
child-bearing age should not eat its fish. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the nation today has far more legally designated wilderness areas 
than it had two decades ago, there is far less actual wilderness. Lands that 
were spared the rush of development by government protections instead are being 
ravaged by acid rain produced by burning coal. 
</P>
<P>
"By every major environmental indicator, the Earth is worse off today than it 
was in 1970," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, a 
Washington-based environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
Just as many of today's environmental problems differ from those of 1970, so do 
the recipes for resolving them. There is more emphasis on preventive measures. 
Instead of focusing on saving a single bird or plant species, the conservation 
movement has turned toward saving lands that contain a diversity of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of just asking for more smog-control equipment, conservationists are 
pushing for alternative-fuel vehicles, new strategies for getting people out of 
their cars as well as energy-efficient buildings and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of requiring that contaminants be cleaned up after industry has 
disposed of them, the push now is to find alternatives in the industrial 
process. Instead of just urging people to recycle, the nation's 
conservationists want less waste to be generated in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The fight against global environmental threats also has spawned a flood of 
proposed remedies, but they require a will to act not yet demonstrated by much 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
If the planet is to save its tropical forests, repair the ozone layer and head 
off global warming, industrialization may have to be slowed in developing 
countries and their economies altered. Industrialized nations will have to find 
substitutes for fossil fuels and ozone-depleting chemicals and improve their 
energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at putting on the brakes on population growth . . . phasing out 
fossil fuels, reversing the deforestation of the Earth," said Brown of 
Worldwatch. "Any one of these things would thoroughly challenge any generation 
in history. We've got a half dozen of them. We've got to do all at once." 
</P>
<P>
Many of these global threats went unrecognized on April 22, 1970, when the 
environment first was celebrated in a kind of national teach-in called Earth 
Day and the nation awoke like a latter-day Rip van Winkle to discover that 
pollution was rampant and getting worse. For the rest of that decade, America 
saw unrivaled environmental action. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, President Richard M. Nixon opened the doors of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. Congress passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean 
Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act, which regulates the disposal of hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this occurred in a presidency not sympathetic to environmental 
concerns. William D. Ruckelshaus, whom Nixon appointed to head the new EPA, 
said in a recent interview that his former boss considered the environment 
unimportant, never seemed curious about it and traced environmental activism to 
a "softness" in Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I had several conversations with him," said Ruckelshaus, now an executive with 
a waste management company. "He never once asked me, 'Is anything wrong here' 
(with the environment)?" 
</P>
<P>
But public pressure to take action was strong and many of the reforms launched 
under Nixon produced results. Dramatic progress was made in cleaning surface 
water. San Francisco Bay, for example, is far cleaner today than it was 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So is the Potomac River. "The Potomac stunk to high heavens in the summertime," 
recalled Brent Blackwelder, chairman of the board of the League of Conservation 
Voters, who grew up in Washington. "It was so foul you wouldn't want to get 
near it. Now it's a beautiful river." 
</P>
<P>
Air quality also improved in the densest urban settings. Although the pace of 
growth in some cities overcame the benefits rendered by smog-control 
technology, "air quality in this country would be a disaster" today without the 
Clean Air Act, said Rafe Pomerance, senior associate of the World Resources 
Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the two most successful single strokes by policy-makers and 
conservationists were the banning of DDT and the phasing out of lead in 
gasoline in the early 1970s. DDT causes birds to lay eggs with shells so thin 
they break before hatching. Lead exposure in children can permanently impair 
their intellectual abilities. With the phasing out of those contaminants, 
endangered birds began to reproduce and lead levels in the blood of average 
Americans dropped substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we discovered was that when we did something bold, nature bounded 
back better than we had anticipated," Pope said. "When we have taken 
half-measures, the system hasn't responded." 
</P>
<P>
One of the "half-measures" cited by Pope was the Endangered Species Act, which 
protects wildlife only after it is already dangerously close to extinction. The 
bald eagle is multiplying and the once imperiled American alligator has been 
taken off the endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, such success stories are rare. Many species on the federal list 
continue to decline in number, and others, such as the dusky seaside sparrow, 
already have become extinct. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever their individual failings, the environmental laws of the 1970s 
represented the traditional American impulse to preserve, to leave the land 
better than it was found. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s showed yet another side of the American character, the fervor to push 
back the frontiers, to exploit seemingly inexhaustible resources. Some 
environmental activists now dismiss the 1980s as "the lost decade," a time of 
missed opportunity. Environmental research, from the testing of pesticides to 
the development of non-polluting energy sources, significantly slowed. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, who was not an advocate of environmental 
regulation, is largely blamed for attempts to unravel, or at least ignore, laws 
put on the books in the previous decade. Early in his first Administration, 
Reagan tended to put "marginally competent" administrators in the EPA and other 
agencies that "he didn't care that much about," said Ruckelshaus, whom Reagan 
brought in to reform the EPA after the President's first choice resigned in 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan gave the environmental movement "the back of the hand," infuriating 
environmentalists by treating them with indifference, Ruckelshaus said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Reagan had a curiosity about the environment. "(Reagan actually) was 
more interested in the environment than Nixon," the former administrator said. 
"He often would ask me . . . about the science of it. He wanted to know if 
there was any substance to it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Reagan's poor environmental record, some progress was made during his 
years. The Food Security Act of 1985 allowed for the recycling of land, the 
conversion of as many as 40 million acres of cropland -- about 11% of the 
nation's total -- into grasslands or woods. Conservationists say much of this 
land should never have been plowed and, without the law, it might have turned 
to wasteland. The law already is credited with reducing erosion by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
In areas where government failed to act, consumers did. After a report last 
year about the possible health hazards of Alar, a chemical used to improve the 
appearance and prolong the shelf life of apples, the nation's consumers began 
demanding pesticide-free produce at their markets. 
</P>
<P>
Public anxiety about the thinning ozone layer also prompted many corporations 
to phase out voluntarily their use of some ozone-destroying chemicals. Other 
companies are starting to promote their products based on their conservation 
merits. The H. J. Heinz Co., for instance, recently publicized the production 
of a new plastic ketchup bottle that can be more easily recycled than most 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Market forces may even make recycling a permanent fixture of the American 
lifestyle. With communities running out of places for dumping rapidly 
proliferating waste and with disposal costs escalating, more and more cities 
are launching curbside recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Legislatures have passed laws requiring deposits on bottle purchases and other 
recyclable goods. California will require communities to reduce garbage by 25% 
by 1995 and 50% by 2000, primarily through recycling, composting and reducing 
the sources of waste. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations may be prodded into further environmental action under a proposal 
by environmental activists to award "green seals" of approval to products that 
meet certain conservation criteria. The seals could be given for anything from 
an energy-efficient manufacturing process to packaging that can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nation has come up with answers to some of its environmental ills, 
there are no such easy fixes for combatting global threats like overpopulation 
and deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
When Paul Ehrlich warned of an overpopulation disaster in his 1968 book, "The 
Population Bomb," there were 3.5 billion people on Earth. Today, there are 5.2 
billion and the number is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reverse the upward trend have succeeded in some countries. Fourteen 
European countries, with about 5% of the world's population, have reached zero 
population growth and Japan, France and Finland are among others headed in that 
direction. Population growth fell by half in Japan from 1948 to 1955 and in 
China from 1970 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
But if death rates do not rise worldwide, birth rates will have to be reduced 
62% to stabilize the planet's population, according to Brown of Worldwatch. The 
populations of India, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Mexico are expected to double or 
even triple before they flatten out late in the next century, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is whether we check population growth or nature checks 
population growth," Brown said. "If we don't, nature will." 
</P>
<P>
Population pressures have contributed to the loss of the world's forests and 
the rise in gases blamed for the greenhouse effect. Forests shield a diversity 
of wildlife and absorb gases that otherwise trap heat in the atmosphere much 
like the panes of a greenhouse. If the greenhouse effect is not checked, sea 
levels could rise, droughts and hurricanes could multiply and more forests 
could vanish. 
</P>
<P>
Progress in persuading Third World countries to conserve their forests has been 
scant, although Brazil recently responded to international pressure by removing 
tax subsidies for forest clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts are being made to reforest, but South Korea remains the only Third 
World country to do it successfully. Some industrialized countries, including 
Australia and the United States, have launched tree-planting programs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the forests are spared and more trees planted, global warming still 
could be accelerated by burning such fossil fuels as oil and coal. Most 
scientists agree that slowing down climate change will require a major shift 
from the world's dependence on fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases, to 
less polluting solar, geothermal and other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Although international discussions to curb greenhouse gases are under way, some 
conservationists concede that sweeping actions may not be embraced until there 
is a greater scientific consensus on how soon the Earth's climate may change. 
</P>
<P>
The phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, chemicals used in refrigeration 
and in a variety of industrial processes, will ease the greenhouse threat as 
well as protect the ozone layer. Although industrialized countries have pledged 
to curtail or even eliminate their use, some developing countries are planning 
to raise production on a scale that would offset the progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've lost a great deal," said David Brower, a pre-eminent 
conservationist who once helped lead the Sierra Club and later founded Friends 
of the Earth and the Earth Island Institute, a nonprofit environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're far worse off than we were in the '70s," Brower said. "Since 1912, we've 
used four times as many resources as in all previous history, and that can't 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
Brower and other conservationists are pushing for wholesale changes over the 
next two decades that normally would evolve over several generations. 
Recognizing that worldwide cooperation is essential, the organizers of Earth 
Day 1990 have enlisted the participation of 140 countries in this week's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"History would teach you to be pretty pessimistic because people don't change 
fast," the Sierra Club's Pope said. "But if you look at Eastern Europe over the 
past year -- sometimes they do." 
</P>

AGONY FOR A CAMPUS: GO CO-ED?; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW WAVE OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IS DEBATING WHETHER TO ADMIT MEN. FOR OAKLAND'S 
MILLS COLLEGE, AND OTHERS, THE CHOICE MAY BE TO ADAPT OR FAIL.

<P>
The elegant bell tower at Mills College survived the earthquakes in 1906 and 
1989, chiming with soothing regularity on the leafy campus. The bells still 
ring at what many educators consider to be the finest women's college on the 
West Coast, but some people now hear the tolls as mourning the end of beloved 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Facing declining enrollment and financial worries, Mills' trustees next month 
are expected to decide either to admit undergraduate men for the first time in 
the school's 138-year history or to begin a strong push for part-time and older 
women students. Either way, Mills will change a lot, symbolizing the situation 
of many women's colleges nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We must either become more attractive to a greater number of women or we must 
admit men," Mills' President Mary S. Metz said. The school wants to increase 
the number of undergraduates from the current 777 to 1,000 without dropping 
standards. In the mid-1970s, there were more than 900. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of coeducation is causing much debate and anxiety at Mills, a 
beautiful 135-acre campus that has 5,500 trees and is cut off from the 
surrounding Oakland neighborhood by a barbed-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very overwhelming, very emotional issue," explained Robyn Fisher, 
student body president, who said most students want Mills to remain a women's 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may be of little consolation to those students, Mills is not alone 
in its dilemma. Over the last 30 years, the number of women's colleges in the 
United States has dropped from 298 to 94, according to the Women's College 
Coalition, a Washington lobbying organization. Most of those changes -- 
campuses either going co-ed, merging with men's schools, or closing -- took 
place in the late 1960s and early '70s as previously men-only colleges also 
went co-ed. Such women's schools as Vassar and Sarah Lawrence in New York state 
changed at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a second, smaller wave of conversion to coeducation is occurring. Wheaton 
College in Massachusetts, Goucher in Maryland, Marymount in Virginia and 
Colby-Sawyer in New Hampshire have admitted men over the last three years. 
Mills and Chatham College, a 121-year-old school in Pittsburgh, are considering 
doing so for the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Mills, only two women's colleges still exist west of the Rockies: 
Mount St. Mary's in Los Angeles and Scripps in Claremont, both of which say 
they have no plans to change their mission. Mount St. Mary's is a Catholic 
school; Mills is nondenominational. And Scripps is part of the Claremont 
college system, allowing its students to regularly take classes with men. 
</P>
<P>
If Mills goes co-ed, it would be the end of a tradition dating back to the 
founding of the school as a genteel refuge for daughters of Gold Rush 
prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Some students are threatening to transfer and are wearing T-shirts bearing the 
slogan: "Better Dead Than Co-Ed." Professors argue about how the presence of 
men in the classroom might affect teaching and whether the school might 
actually raise its academic stature nationally by admitting men. 
</P>
<P>
"If we become co-ed like other schools, we will not necessarily be successful," 
said Barbara Li Santi, associate professor of math and computer science at 
Mills for nine years. "I don't know of students who are beating the doors down 
now to come to Mills College. To lose our distinction could make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she and many other teachers at Mills worry that even a small number 
of men will dominate classroom discussions and campus activities. They cite 
scholarly research showing that young women at co-ed schools tend to defer to 
men in intellectual debate while women at single-sex colleges are more likely 
to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools. Words like 
"nurturing" and "empowering" are used regularly by students, alumni and faculty 
to describe a Mills education. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Routsong, senior class president at Mills, explained: "I would not like 
to see Mills College go co-ed because I feel it's very important in the 20th 
Century for women to have a place to study without being intimidated in the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Some students and teachers contend that before enrolling males, the college 
should put five years or so of added effort into recruiting female transfer 
students and older women who are resuming their educations. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of coeducation point to mixed results among former women's 
colleges that have gone co-ed. While some of those institutions show a general 
pattern of enrollment growth and stronger finances, some have encountered 
extreme social and academic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
However, others think a co-ed Mills could carve out a niche as the best small 
private nondenominational college on the West Coast north of Occidental in Los 
Angeles and south of Reed in Portland, Ore. Mills, they say, could build on its 
strong reputation in music, art, dance, English, education and history and 
expand into new areas such as environmental studies while attracting students 
who want an intimate campus and much faculty attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be a Swarthmore of the West," said Ted Thomas, a sociology professor at 
Mills for 26 years, referring to the highly regarded liberal arts college in 
Pennsylvania. Thomas would prefer that Mills remain a women's college if 
demographics were running in its favor. But he says switching to coeducation 
now appears "the least risky option." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Thomas added, "intellectual vitality" is at stake. Many classes at 
Mills have 15 or fewer students, some as few as five. "It's nice to have small 
classes, but when some are getting down to four or five (students), it's too 
small for a good exchange of ideas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem for women's colleges is that, according to various surveys, 
only between 3% and 10% of women who graduate from high school even consider 
enrolling at a women's school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is difficult to convince 17-year-olds that this is an environment 
that will educate them better," said Zina Jacque, Mills' dean of admissions and 
financial aid. "Their perception is that it's like coming to a nunnery." 
</P>
<P>
(In fact, there are 50 men among the 264 graduate students at Mills and 
undergraduates can ride a shuttle bus to take courses in the extremely social 
atmosphere at UC Berkeley. More than a third of Mills' professors are men.) 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting has been more difficult in the last few years with the decline in 
the overall college-age population, a trend expected to last until the 
mid-1990s when children of baby-boomers start to reach college age in large 
numbers. In California, the situation is especially difficult because of price 
competition from UC and Cal State. Excluding room and board, tuition and fees 
at Mills total $12,700 this year, compared to $1,700 for a state resident at a 
UC campus. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Women's College Coalition, full-time undergraduate 
enrollment at women's schools is up 3.6% over five years ago and part-time 
students have increased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, such women's schools as Smith, Mt. Holyoke and Wellesley are doing 
fine and a few campuses such as Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., recently 
decided to remain single-sex by more aggressively recruiting older women. 
</P>
<P>
"We know (women's colleges) are viable. We know they can market themselves. We 
are absolutely confident of that," said coalition spokesman Peter Mirijanian. 
"When things like Chatham and Mills happen, it is a distraction we have to deal 
with. But the day we don't have a case on the merits is the day we have 
problems. I don't think we have those problems." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research on Higher 
Education at the University of Pennsylvania, disagrees. "The sort of question 
you ask is: Is the conversion of women's colleges to co-ed going to be fast 
enough that those who remain single-sex colleges retain a good share of the 
market?" Zemsky said. "Nobody's got any data to say the market will go to zero, 
but it is very difficult marketing." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, F. Warren Hellman, the prominent San Francisco 
investment banker who is chairman of Mills' Board of Trustees, declined to 
state his position on coeducation in advance of the May 3 meeting when a 
decision is scheduled to be made. But many on campus believe Hellman is tilted 
toward going co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
Mills is not in a dire financial crisis, Hellman explained. In fact, its 
endowment is now about $72 million, a respectable amount for a small school and 
nearly triple what it was a decade ago. In addition, Mills has had much success 
in seeking donations to build a new library and to fund scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
But with declining enrollment, Hellman said, the school is dipping into the 
endowment too much to meet operating costs. Last year's budget was balanced by 
eliminating 17 non-teaching jobs. This year, four full-time faculty jobs are to 
be cut from the teaching staff of 167. Mills also needs $7 million to repair 
its administration headquarters, a grand Victorian building that was damaged in 
last October's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's the feeling of the board that we have to make some changes while 
we are still strong in terms of a substantial endowment, a fine faculty, and 
providing a fine educational experience, rather than waiting until the college 
is in very severe financial difficulty," Hellman said. 
</P>
<P>
His critics contend that Hellman ignores the philosophical benefits to 
single-sex education. "I keep being beaten about the ears with moral issues," 
Hellman said. "But isn't another kind of moral issue whether you have some 
unbelievable asset in a jewel of a campus and you under-utilize it? Is it 
better to have no campus at all? . . . The trustees are trying to act in 
long-term interests of the college and if students want to get mad at anybody, 
they should get mad at high school students for not wanting to come to a 
women's college." 
</P>
<P>
No one expects that changing to coeducation would be easy. Zemsky, of the 
University of Pennsylvania, likened such conversions to "stepping off a 
six-foot-high diving board, knowing there is a swimming pool below you but not 
knowing how deep the water is." Other experts say it takes at least 10 years to 
work out problems and approach enrollment parity between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years after going coeducational, women still outnumber men 70% to 
30% at Sarah Lawrence, while at Vassar females have a smaller edge, 55% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think success or failure should be based on those numbers," said 
Marilyn Katz, dean of studies and student life at Sarah Lawrence. "You should 
base it on the experience of the men, and the men here overall have had a good 
experience. I don't think we've ever been sorry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1954, said coeducation has created 
"a more charged" social atmosphere than when she was a student there. "There's 
a low level of spring fever all year long," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Goucher College near Baltimore began to enroll men two years ago. "I would be 
lying to tell you the first year was sunshine and roses," said spokeswoman Judy 
Phair. "There were some pretty tough times because some women students were 
unhappy and let the male students know it." About 30% of current freshmen there 
are men. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., had a court fight with alumni donors angry 
that the school began to admit men in September, 1988. In an out-of-court 
settlement, the school returned a total of $127,000 to donors from a 
$26-million fund-raising campaign. On the positive side, applications to 
Wheaton reportedly have doubled over the last three years and enrollment has 
grown 15%. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate men, who are outnumbered 5 to 1, Wheaton is building a new 
sports facility and buying longer beds. But the school balked at what 
administrators jokingly call "the great bathroom question." Stand-up urinals 
are not being installed in dormitory bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life at Mills remains tense as the campus awaits the May 3 meeting. 
Counselors are planning so-called "grief therapy" sessions for students if the 
trustees vote for coeducation. The alumni office has been trying to defuse 
anger among potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, on the steps of the tea shop, which is the center of campus 
social life, student government treasurer Lisa Kosiewicz was selling T-shirts 
and sweat shirts. "These may soon be a collector's item," she explained. On the 
front of the shirts was the school motto -- "Mills College: Not a Girl's School 
Without Men, but a Women's College Without Boys." 
</P>
<P>
Business was brisk.

HARRIS' DEFENSE NEVER RESTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: ATTORNEY CHARLES SEVILLA, WHO WON STAY OF EXECUTION FOR THE CONVICTED 
MURDERER, STANDS OUT AS AN EXAMPLE OF DEDICATION, HIS PEERS SAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorney Charles M. Sevilla started smoking again last month, just the way he 
did in 1982, the last time his client, Robert Alton Harris, faced an execution 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla hadn't puffed on even one cigarette since Harris was spared -- with 
four days to go -- eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But by the week before April 3, the day the state of California had announced 
that it would execute Harris for two murders, Sevilla's office turned into what 
he called a "smoke chamber." That week, he and three others in his office 
pulled three all-nighters, pumping out fat legal briefs for federal courts in 
San Diego, San Francisco and Washington in bids to save Harris' life. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they have to do the lawyering, they had to field relentless phone 
calls from the media, suffer crank calls from the public, and cope with death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crazy, crazy experience," Sevilla, 45, said. "I felt, 'This is 
insane. This is not the way a law system should work.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla, who is in private practice in San Diego, said he was left exhausted 
from an "emotional roller coaster" ride -- and yet he was back at it again last 
week, filing another lengthy brief Friday on Harris' behalf with the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The latest filing was made possible by the last-minute reprieve Sevilla earned 
for Harris just two weeks earlier from 9th Circuit Judge John T. Noonan. That 
reprieve, as well as the diligence that helped bring it about, have already 
enhanced Sevilla's formidable reputation as one of the best appellate lawyers 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
But in standing up for Harris, Sevilla has performed another service, his 
attorney peers say. In an era of lawyer-bashing -- and in the face of public 
opinion that is overwhelmingly against his position -- his zealous advocacy 
stands out as an example of dedication to the profession and commitment to the 
client, according to other lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best appellate lawyer I know, that I've ever had contact with -- on 
the other side, that is," said Louis R. Hanoian, a deputy attorney general in 
San Diego, who has been matched against Sevilla in the Harris case. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla's successes include a win in the U.S. Supreme Court just six years out 
of law school. In that 1975 case, Sevilla successfully argued that the federal 
Constitution requires U.S. Border Patrol officers to have probable cause -- or 
a strong suspicion that a crime is afoot -- to search a car at the San Clemente 
checkpoint on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Harris, Sevilla's current clients include Roger Hedgecock, the former 
mayor of San Diego convicted of campaign financing violations. His appeal, 
which centers on a claim that the verdict was tainted by a bailiff's alleged 
jury tampering, is pending before the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to lawyers around town, saying, 'Who would you recommend for appeal 
work on my case?' " Hedgecock said last week. "To a person, they recommended 
Chuck Sevilla." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, he was listed as one of the most respected lawyers in California in 
a statewide survey published by California Lawyer magazine. And he has been 
named one of the best lawyers in the country by Town &amp; Country magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"What he is extremely gifted at is weaving facts into legal arguments and 
getting the absolute most impact he can out of the facts he is dealt," said 
Hanoian. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing, said Michael McCabe, one of the two other lawyers who have been 
working with Sevilla on Harris' behalf, is that Sevilla "has absolutely no 
concern for his own time. None whatsoever. He'd rather work than eat or sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla, said San Diego criminal defense attorney Elizabeth Semel, "epitomizes 
what law is about." 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I get calls from parents, the prominent parents of some 
young person who's gotten into some horrendous trouble -- conservative, 
law-abiding people -- and when their son is in trouble, they don't look for Joe 
Sleaze," Semel said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said. "They want Chuck Sevilla. They want the best advocacy for their 
child. All of those derogatory comments they may have made in general terms 
about technicalities, all those criticisms, are thrown to the wind when someone 
close to them is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what the public has to remember. That today it's Robert Harris, 
tomorrow it may be someone they love." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla is uncomfortable with praise for his skills. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I can say about myself is I hope I strive to be competent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, he said, he'd rather be a basketball star. His office 
sports two photos of him playing pickup hoops with former UCLA and professional 
star Bill Walton, one of which displays Sevilla getting off what he calls his 
"awesome three-quarter-inch jump hook" in front of Walton. 
</P>
<P>
There won't be any basketball for a while, however. The day the U.S. Supreme 
Court declined to overturn Noonan's ruling, Sevilla -- racing for the phone -- 
ripped knee ligaments he had stretched during a playground game. 
</P>
<P>
He needs surgery but, until there's a window in the Harris case, he doesn't 
have time for it. Meanwhile, he said, "It hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla was reared in San Jose. He vividly remembers the day in 1960 when he 
was a sophomore in high school and Caryl Chessman was put to death at San 
Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
"My English teacher, who I liked a lot, the day Chessman was executed, he had a 
radio on," Sevilla said. "I could see it affected him a lot and I got this idea 
that, hey, this hurts people. It hurt him and he didn't even know Chessman." 
</P>
<P>
After going to San Jose State, Sevilla earned his law degree in 1969 from Santa 
Clara University, then took an advanced legal degree in urban law in 1971 from 
George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
For the next five years, he worked at Federal Defenders of San Diego Inc., an 
agency that represents poor people charged with crimes in federal court. He 
moved to Los Angeles in 1976 to work for the state public defender, which 
handles appeals in the state courts for indigents. 
</P>
<P>
After a few years, he and his wife, Donna, returned to San Diego. Sevilla 
joined his former boss at Federal Defenders, John Cleary, in a private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
When he was with the state public defender, he said, he began helping McCabe 
with Harris' case. By 1983, when Sevilla joined forces with Cleary, he "had a 
commitment to (Harris)" and "never seriously considered staying out of the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
The reprieve that was earned for Harris, Sevilla insisted, is as much the work 
of the two other primary attorneys on the case -- McCabe and Michael Laurence 
of San Francisco -- and his office secretary, Cindy Campbell, all of whom 
worked with him through the nights. "It's truly been a team effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the whole thing is a waste, he said. "If they took a tenth of the money we 
spent on the death penalty and channeled it into helping the surviving members 
of the family of the victim with care to make the transition -- if a 
breadwinner is gone, to help out with sustenance -- that makes a lot more sense 
to me than what we're going through now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another money issue -- how much he is getting paid for representing Harris -- 
has been filled with misunderstanding, he said. He makes $75 an hour on the 
case -- that's up, as of last fall, from $40 an hour. He said it is hardly a 
"moneymaking operation" in the inflated universe of lawyer salaries, commonly 
$100 to $200 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that if (representing Death Row inmates) was a moneymaking 
operation, you'd have lawyers . . . lined up out the door of the (California) 
Supreme Court looking for those appointments," he said. "Instead, we have, 
what, 40 or 50 people who are up on Death Row without counsel." 
</P>
<P>
There are "so many reasons" to be opposed to the death penalty, Sevilla said. 
For one, the "fact that (politicians) are so gung-ho for it and use it as a 
sales technique to sell their candidacies is a wonderful reason for people to 
have some suspicion about what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
"Second, the fact that government administers this ought to terrify anybody out 
there about the fairness of a system in which the government is so instrumental 
in selecting who's going to get it and who's not." 
</P>
<P>
The Harris case itself points out "the advantage of these things winding their 
way and taking some time," no matter how much that frustrates the public, he 
said. The case shows that "we have an imperfect system and if you're going to 
have a penalty which requires perfection, like the death penalty, you'd better 
give it time to work out." 
</P>
<P>
Until the case is over, one way or the other, Sevilla said he expects it to 
continue to produce the same mix of "rewarding" and "nightmarish" moments. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said he had been confident that Harris would prevail in his latest 
appeal -- that he would win a hearing on the new claims that various mental 
disorders played a part in the 1978 killings of two San Diego teen-agers and 
should have been put before the jury that sentenced Harris to die. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he won the chance to try for that hearing -- on April 2, when the 
U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Noonan's reprieve -- Sevilla quit smoking.

INDIA'S LEADER WARNS OF AN ATTACK BY PAKISTAN; 
</P>
<P>
WAR FEARS: TROUBLE IN KASHMIR AND TERRORISM HAVE RAISED TENSIONS. INTERNAL 
POLITICAL UNREST IN BOTH NATIONS COULD PUSH THEM TOWARD CONFLICT.

<P>
The rhetoric of war between India and Pakistan continued to escalate Saturday 
as a weekend wave of terrorism left dozens dead in India, and analysts began 
speculating that internal political unrest in both countries could push them 
into their fourth major war in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh said 
Saturday that Pakistan is preparing to launch an attack across India's western 
border, where he asserted that Pakistan has deployed new armored regiments and 
sophisticated radar. 
</P>
<P>
Singh added that Pakistan's army and air force were on "red alert" along the 
cease-fire line that divides the Himalayan region of Kashmir, where a crackdown 
by India on an Islamic secessionist movement has heightened tensions between 
the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmiri militants, who accuse Hindu-dominated India of reneging on agreements 
giving the region broad autonomy, attacked an Indian police convoy with 
grenades Saturday, killing a paramilitary officer. On Friday, five Kashmiri 
protesters were killed by security forces. The conflict has taken more than 325 
lives since the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Muslim militants, who call themselves moujahedeen, or Islamic holy 
warriors, killed three hostages, among them a Hindu businessman and the two top 
officials of the government university in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. 
</P>
<P>
Unidentified terrorists have struck elsewhere in India, as well, blowing up 
commuter buses and trains and strategic bridges in the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
At least six passengers were killed late Friday when a bomb ripped through a 
bus in New Delhi. Two dozen died in the insurgency-torn state of Assam when 
militants blew up the only rail and road links to India's northeastern 
territories. And, in the financial center of Bombay, scores more were seriously 
injured when a bomb exploded on a suburban commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
Singh insisted Saturday that the attacks are part of a coordinated terrorist 
plan to destabilize India, possibly in preparation for an attack by Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's comments were the latest in a series of official outcries that began 
Tuesday, when the Indian prime minister startled even this nation by calling on 
its 850 million citizens to prepare "psychologically" for war. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to an earlier declaration by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
that her nation "is prepared for 1,000 years of war with Hindu India," Singh 
returned the implied threat in a speech to Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"I warn them (that) those who talk about 1,000 years of war should examine 
whether they will last 1,000 hours of war," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he does not believe that Pakistan, smaller and less powerful 
than India, actually wants all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
"In my perception, Pakistan's strategy is to avoid armed conflict, yet continue 
to fan insurgency within India," he said. "Their strategy is to achieve the 
territorial goals without the price of war." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in subsequent public statements, Singh asserted that Pakistan appears to be 
preparing for war. Its air force, he said, has reactivated border air bases and 
moved artillery to forward positions along the frontiers of Kashmir and the 
adjacent state of Punjab, where India faces another secessionist movement from 
the Sikh religious minority. 
</P>
<P>
Both Indian and Western military analysts in New Delhi confirmed that there has 
been a strategic buildup on both sides of the border but that the military 
movements do not appear to be a preamble to war. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see the possibility of an all-out war," said Bharat Wariavwalla, 
a senior Indian strategic analyst. "The risks are too high for both sides, and 
certainly for Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care who runs Pakistan -- whether it's Benazir or the military -- the 
force equation is so much in favor of India. And for India, no one in the 
military wants war. Looking simply at logistics, there are anti-government 
insurgencies in both of India's key, front-line states, and the army couldn't 
count on domestic support within their own staging grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even skeptics say that in the present atmosphere of heightened rhetoric 
and tension, a small spark could ignite a crisis that would make rational 
military calculations invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the Indian military professionals say they are dead-set against war," 
one Western military analyst in New Delhi. "But they add that, if there is a 
war, it will be because of the politicians and their domestic compulsions." 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Bhutto's 16-month-old civilian government is convulsed by dissent. 
In Karachi, the financial capital, sectarian violence forced the Pakistani army 
last week to send tanks into the streets to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian crackdown in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, whose pro-Indian 
leaders chose to join India when the British-ruled subcontinent was partitioned 
in 1947, also has spawned angry protests throughout overwhelmingly Muslim 
Pakistan, particularly in the Pakistani-controlled region that Islamabad calls 
Free Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Kashmir has soured India-Pakistan relations for years -- and led to two wars 
between them. Officially called Jammu and Kashmir, the area is predominantly 
Muslim, a legacy of Muslim control centuries ago. The British installed a Hindu 
ruler when they pacified Kashmir in 1846. When the subcontinent was partitioned 
in 1947 into predominantly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, the Muslims in 
Kashmir rebelled. The region's Hindu ruler placed Kashmir under India's 
dominion. Indian troops fought the Kashmiri rebels and their Pakistani backers. 
The fighting ended with a U.N. cease-fire in 1949 and a division of Kashmir. 
The southern section was absorbed as India's state of Jammu and Kashmir. The 
northern part remained under Pakistani control. Calls for a plebiscite on the 
people's preferences were ignored by India. Serious fighting broke out again in 
1965 and in 1971. Sporadic clashes between Indian and Pakistani troops along 
the cease-fire line, and charges by the Indian government that Pakistan is 
fomenting rebellion in the region, keep the Kashmir issue bubbling.

JARUZELSKI PAYS TRIBUTE TO SLAIN POLES AT KATYN

Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski went to the Katyn Forest on Saturday and 
paid tribute to the thousands of Polish army officers killed and buried there 
by the Soviet Union's secret police during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
His visit came one day after the Soviet government reversed nearly 50 years of 
official denial and admitted committing the massacre. The Soviet Union had long 
blamed Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth was said about Katyn, and the truth is healing the wounds," 
Jaruzelski said in Russian, his voice soft and wavering with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it will be easier for us to understand each other," he told Soviet 
reporters. The Katyn massacre has long been a strain on relations between the 
Soviet Union and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the Polish army at the memorial 
site in the forest near the western town of Smolensk as he honored the more 
than 4,000 officers killed in 1940 by Stalin's secret police, the Polish PAP 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
A "roll call of the dead" was intoned -- a ceremony in which the names of 
victims were read, PAP said. 
</P>
<P>
In footage broadcast on Soviet TV's evening newscast "Vremya," Jaruzelski, 
wearing a green army overcoat, green scarf and military cap, stood ramrod 
straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath of red and white carnations and 
laid it in front of a memorial to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The monument reads in Russian: "To the Polish officers fallen in Katyn." 
</P>
<P>
Polish radio reported Saturday night that the wording on the monument was 
changed three days ago, removing the words that blamed Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
PAP added that Jaruzelski wrote in the visitor's book: 
</P>
<P>
"They fought for an independent Poland. They died innocently, far removed from 
their families and homeland. They were faithful to Poland and to military honor 
until they breathed their last. In tribute and in lasting memory to Polish 
officers, victims of the cruel Stalinist crime." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski also went to the town of Lenino in the nearby republic of 
Byelorussia and laid wreaths on the graves of Soviet and Polish soldiers at a 
memorial there, the Soviet news agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union on Friday admitted that the NKVD, Stalin's feared secret 
police, was responsible for the murders 49 years ago of the Polish officers who 
had been captured at the start of World War II.

SENATORS CONDEMN KREMLIN THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: ECONOMIC ACTION AGAINST LITHUANIA -- EVEN THOUGH IT IS NONVIOLENT -- 
IMPERILS TIES WITH WEST, DELEGATION SAYS.

<P>
A delegation of U.S. senators, just back from talks with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, condemned Moscow's threatened economic blockade of 
Lithuania on Saturday and warned that repression in the Baltics, even if it is 
nonviolent, would have grave consequences for U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"An act need not involve direct violence to be wrong," Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said on behalf of the seven-member delegation. "The 
(blockade threat) was wrong. We condemn it." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the United States must act forcefully even though the senators, 
all Democrats, were told repeatedly by Soviet officials that Gorbachev's reform 
program, and perhaps his political life, are on the line. He said the officials 
cautioned Washington against taking "any action that might result in him not 
remaining in office." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) added that Gorbachev told the group that 1990 
is "by far the most critical, the most crucial" year of his five years in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Daschle said the Soviet president "left an impression on me that he felt the 
Lithuanian situation was a gift to his hard-liners," who could exploit the 
crisis to cripple economic and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mitchell said the United States should not tailor its response to 
Gorbachev's domestic political problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible for us, of course, to be in a position to precisely assess 
internal Soviet politics. . . . And while it is American policy to be 
supportive of perestroika . . . that cannot be construed as a policy which 
disregards any action taken by that government," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're strongly supportive of our relationship with a number of other nations 
around the world, but no government can or should construe that support . . . 
as a blank check for any action they might or might not take," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The senators spoke at a news conference at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside 
of Washington, shortly after they completed the 15-hour flight from Moscow. 
They said they had no chance to talk to Gorbachev directly about the threatened 
economic boycott of Lithuania because the Kremlin did not issue the ultimatum 
until after their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the senators repeatedly warned Gorbachev against the use of force 
in the Baltics, a theme that President Bush and Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III also emphasized during Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze's visit to Washington earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell brushed aside a suggestion that the Americans may have left 
Gorbachev with the impression that Washington would not object to an action, 
such as the threatened economic blockade, that stopped short of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"By describing force and violence as unacceptable, we do not thereby sanction 
in advance everything else," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker told a television interviewer in Hamilton, Bermuda, that the 
economic threats were "certainly an escalation of tension" but that the United 
States should wait to see whether the threat is carried out before deciding on 
a response. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, in Bermuda with Bush for talks with British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, said implementation of the blockade would have "an adverse impact" on 
U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply not going to tell you or speculate with you about what actions or 
options or measures the U.S. might consider," Baker told the Cable News 
Network. "What we have to do is wait and see whether or not this threat is 
carried out. . . . So far it's only a threat." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Gorbachev's internal difficulties are complicating relations with 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Does Mr. Gorbachev have major problems? You bet your life, a lot of them," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell declined to suggest specific steps the U.S. government should take if 
Gorbachev imposes the blockade. He said the senators plan to meet soon with 
Bush and "it would be unappropriate for us to comment on any specific 
alternative before we've had a chance to discuss it with him." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government's Tass news agency reported Thursday that Gorbachev told 
the senators not to lecture him about Moscow's policy toward the Baltics.

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT'S HELP IN FINDING SUBWAY GUNMAN

Detectives searching for the gunman who killed an assailant on a Brooklyn 
subway train sought help Saturday in identifying the shooter from a teen-ager 
charged in the mugging. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Kirkland, 17, was arrested Friday night after being questioned about the 
shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland was the first to be arrested from among the group of men who had been 
on a Manhattan-bound express Thursday night when the mugging victim pulled out 
a gun and fired. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Pickett, 25, the son of a retired bus driver, died from a single shot to 
the heart, police said. Detectives said Kirkland gave them a silver .25-caliber 
semiautomatic handgun, which is believed to be the weapon that was passed among 
the gang on the subway car before the shooting. It was not known whether the 
gun was brandished during the mugging, although police said one of the suspects 
displayed a razor knife. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said detectives had questioned at least two other members of the group. 
Detectives also questioned one passenger who remained on board the train after 
the shooting until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses initially told police Kirkland had fled the train with the gunman's 
wallet, but police said Saturday they were uncertain whether a wallet was taken 
at all. Nor have detectives been able to establish that a watch with a broken 
clasp found inside Pickett's pocket belonged to the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland was later charged with second-degree robbery and second-degree assault 
in connection with the attack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
But the public debate that erupted in the aftermath of the shooting continued 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago we would have said, 'Turn yourself in,' " said Lisa Sliwa, a 
leader of the Guardian Angels, a civilian anti-crime group. "Now we say: 'Don't 
show your face. If you do, your whole life will be ruined.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roy Innis, head of the civil rights group Congress of Racial 
Equality, offered to help the shooter if he decides to come forward.

NASA opened Discovery's payload bay doors Saturday to remove the Hubble Space 
Telescope's batteries for recharging and to replace a faulty part in 
preparation for an April 25 launch. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians took out a faulty auxiliary power unit responsible for grounding 
the shuttle last week. 
</P>
<P>
A new unit was being installed to be tested today and fired up briefly later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't run into any problem," said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "We're looking good for the 
25th." 
</P>
<P>
Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries will be recharged for 5 1/2 days in a 
laboratory at the Vehicle Assembly Building. NASA decided to take the batteries 
there because they can be recharged at a cooler temperature and thus retain 
more power. 
</P>
<P>
The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from the 
shuttle's power system during deployment until its energy-collecting solar 
panels are unfurled. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery was poised for launch Tuesday, but the mission was scrubbed four 
minutes before liftoff when the auxiliary power unit failed. 
</P>
<P>
NASA was not sure how long it would take to replace the 88-pound unit because 
the procedure had never been performed before at the launch pad. The work went 
smoothly, Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
The defective power unit was returned to the manufacturer, Sunstrand Corp. of 
Rockford, Ill., for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the hydraulic system, 
which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and 
steering systems. 
</P>
<P>
NASA planned to close Discovery's payload bay doors today as soon as the 
lengthy process of removing the batteries was completed. The chamber will 
remain sealed to reduce the risk of getting too much dust on the telescope's 
94-inch mirror.

A wild mushroom reportedly capable of restoring virility and enhancing 
fertility is causing quite a scramble among tourists in western Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of foreign visitors, mostly men, are tramping through fields and 
forests in search of the morel, or Morchella Esculanta, which grows in the 
region around Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Romanija in the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Yugoslav news 
agency Tanjug said.

Villagers tell visitors of the wife of a retired woodcutter who had 12 
children, the last one when she was 57. Or there's 101-year-old Zada Smajic, 
mother of 10, whose husband died a few years ago but was "full of vigor until 
his last day." 
</P>
<P>
The fungus grows mostly around the village of Preljubovici -- the name 
translates as "adulterers" -- and is named after a Turkish governor several 
centuries ago who is said to have discovered the mushroom's powers.

A young man was struck and injured by a car Saturday as authorities braced for 
the final onslaught of party-minded spring break vacationers who annually 
converge on this desert community. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was the latest serious incident involving high school and college 
students who flock to the Southern California desert as part of the annual rite 
of spring.

BIOMED FIRMS RACE TO IMPROVE PAP SMEAR TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Sealander was relieved with the results of her Pap smear. 
</P>
<P>
For several months in late 1985, the 26-year-old Baldwin Park woman had 
suffered from heavy vaginal bleeding and irregular menstrual periods. She went 
to her gynecologist fearing that she had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor took a Pap smear, a test used to detect cervical cancer. It came 
back negative, as had two previous tests. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sealander's symptoms didn't go away. Four months after the last 
lab test, Sealander consulted another physician. He found that she had cervical 
cancer. The effect of the disease was so severe that it was visible to the 
naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
"He just looked at her and said, 'You have cancer,' " recalled William 
Sealander, Robin's father. "He knew right away." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months later, Robin died. 
</P>
<P>
"She was my only girl," Sealander said. "It's something you never get over." 
</P>
<P>
What's shocking about Sealander's story -- and thousands like it -- is that Pap 
smears often fail to detect cervical cancer, which can be cured if caught in 
time. The industry's average error rate is an alarming 5%, and recent federal 
and state inspections revealed that some labs misdiagnose nearly 20% of the Pap 
smears they examine. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 years after the Pap smear was invented by Greek immigrant George 
Papanicolaou, the computer age has finally caught up with the test. Scientists 
and entrepreneurs, prompted by growing concerns among women and publicity about 
problems plaguing the Pap smear industry, are joining forces in an effort to 
improve the Pap smear's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Biomedical companies around the United States have spotted opportunities. By 
year's end, companies will be selling computers that they claim can immediately 
detect cancer cells, kits that can spot a new virus that may cause cervical 
cancer and improved swabs designed to collect hard-to-reach cervical cells. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this is way overdue," said Tenny Tse, co-owner of Medscand, a Florida 
medical supply company. 
</P>
<P>
Pap smear diagnosis still requires a technician to stare through a microscope 
at hundreds of thousands of cells per slide to find a handful that might 
indicate the presence of cancer. Consequently, mistakes are frequent, and only 
recently has the government begun to impose quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, National Cancer Screening Laboratories was dropped from the 
Medicare and Medi-Cal programs after federal inspectors determined that the 
Fullerton lab had misread 19% of the slides in a sample survey. The company has 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
And a year ago this week, the state Department of Health Services shut down the 
nation's largest Pap smear lab, Central Pathology Services Medical Group in 
Tarzana, after a survey team reported that its error rate was 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60,000 women in the United States develop cervical cancer every year, 
and 7,000 die from it, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a cupboard full of cases of women who were diligent and went back for 
Pap smear after Pap smear and still died," said Dr. Dorothy Rosenthal, chief of 
cytology at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of a Pap smear typically ranges from $20 to $50, and the market 
worldwide is tremendous. Fifty million women in the United States and 75 
million in Europe spend billions of dollars a year getting Pap smears. About 
125 million more smears are processed in Japan, South Africa and parts of South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, laboratories used the Pap smear as an inexpensive loss-leader 
to attract new business from doctors. Some labs charged as little as $1 per Pap 
smear -- even though the test is done manually and requires heavy staffing -- 
in return for orders for much more expensive tests, such as urinalyses and 
histologies. 
</P>
<P>
Although some states require laboratories to bill patients directly, others, 
including California, still allow doctors to mark up laboratory tests. 
Physicians can boost their profits by seeking out a low-cost provider and then 
charging a higher price to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"Gynecologists have an incentive to shop around for the cheapest market," said 
Mark Rutenberg, co-inventor of a computerized Pap smear system named Papnet. 
"They buy laboratory services like they buy their carpeting or lights: It has 
to be inexpensive but look good." 
</P>
<P>
Fewer and fewer labs, though, are using the Pap smear as a carrot. Federal 
regulations now place an 80-slide limit per day on a lab technician's workload. 
This has increased the demand for cytotechnologists -- individuals trained to 
read Pap smears -- at the same time that there is a growing shortage of such 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Cytotechnologists reports that the number of vacant 
positions has ballooned from 19 in 1988 to 150 last year. There are only about 
1,000 cytotechnologists in the state, mostly because few people are interested 
in a job that can be tedious. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for qualified people have soared from about $20,000 two years ago to 
as much as $50,000 in the Los Angeles area. The cost of a Pap smear has risen 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a crackdown on medical costs, few people think that patients or 
insurance companies will object to a slight rise in price for new products if 
those products yield better Pap smear results. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time (doctors) are willing to pay more to get an accurate Pap 
smear. In the past, the cheapest was the best," said Rosenthal. "Now there is a 
realization that Pap smears are important. They are not dipstick tests." 
</P>
<P>
To many in the industry, automation appears to be the only solution to 
personnel shortages and the public clamor for accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Two tiny technology companies have emerged as the leading candidates in the 
drive to automate Pap smear diagnosis, and each is racing to finish first. 
</P>
<P>
Papnet, manufactured by Neuromedical Systems Inc. in Suffern, N.Y., is expected 
to be the first computerized system to be installed in labs, starting this 
summer. Using image processing technology pioneered by Jet Propulsion Lab in 
Pasadena, Papnet picks the 64 worst-looking cells out of the hundreds of 
thousands that appear on a typical Pap smear slide. 
</P>
<P>
Those suspicious cells are shown on a TV screen, which the cytotechnologist 
examines to make a diagnosis. Papnet eliminates eye strain and fatigue that 
result from trying to find the two or three abnormal cases out of every 100. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a needle in a haystack problem," said Mark Rutenberg, co-inventor of 
Papnet. "Right now, the cytotechnologist has to find as few as 10 bad cells out 
of 300,000. The job with our machine is to find those 10 cells out of 64." 
</P>
<P>
Neuromedical has notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of its 
intention to sell Papnet for research purposes. This is a step towards being 
able to introduce the machine commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham has announced that it will install 
Papnet in two of its labs this summer. And UCLA Medical Center has said it 
intends to get one within the next eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Neuromedical claims that during in-house tests, Papnet has never failed to 
identify a Pap smear containing cancerous cells. However, academic studies to 
confirm the machine's effectiveness are years away. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leopold Koss, one of the world's foremost experts on Pap smears and 
chairman of the pathology department at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 
the Bronx, has just begun reviewing Papnet's performance. "I wouldn't be 
wasting my time if the instrument were not promising," he said. I and my 
colleagues consider the machine very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Neuromedical, which plans to make a $20-million to $30-million public stock 
offering in a few months, expects to rent the machines commercially for $5 per 
Pap smear. 
</P>
<P>
"On a slow day, we get calls from 30 labs wanting the machine," said Rutenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal at UCLA confirms that laboratories are anxious to find an automated 
system that works. "People who have seen this and other machines have 
practically signed contracts," she said. "They say, even before (the machines) 
are ready, 'We'll take five.' " 
</P>
<P>
Neuromedical's chief competi tor is NeoPath Inc. The privately-held Bellevue, 
Wash., company is developing an image-processing system -- the AutoPap 300 -- 
that will automatically sort slides into two piles: normal and suspicious. The 
cost is projected to be under $1 per slide. The company expects to begin FDA 
trials by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say whichever company first succeeds in automating Pap smear 
diagnoses stands to strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no (automated) systems out there today," said Wayne Wager, a general 
partner with the venture capital firm Cable &amp; Howse. "The market is 
somewhere in the neighborhood of half a billion dollars in equipment for 
processing Pap smears." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Pap smear has successfully resisted automation because of the 
complexity of the cells on each slide. They come in various shapes and sizes 
and often overlap like pancakes. Humans can distinguish boundaries, but 
computers often can't. 
</P>
<P>
"Our eyes are more clever than the machine -- so far," said Karen Andersen, 
president-elect of the California Assn. of Cytotechnologists. 
</P>
<P>
Besides automation, biomedical companies are working on tests to detect a virus 
-- human papilloma virus (HPV) -- that some scientists think may be a precursor 
to cervical cancer. The tests are being used by researchers in conjunction with 
the Pap smear. 
</P>
<P>
Life Technologies in Gaithersburg, Md., a publicly held company traded over the 
counter, is the only company to date that has received approval from the FDA to 
sell such a test for diagnostic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The company has sold about $4 million worth of its ViraPap product since the 
test was introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Enzo Biochem in New York and Digene Diagnostics in Silver Spring, Md., are 
developing tests that they say are faster and easier to use than the ViraPap. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a lab forgoes a new computer or the HPV test, it can greatly improve 
its diagnoses by using advanced swabs that cost less than 50 cents each. 
Studies show that many cancers and abnormalities are missed altogether on a Pap 
smear because the doctor has failed to collect an adequate sample of cells 
while inserting the swab into the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
Two companies have introduced brushes that greatly increase the number of cells 
obtained during a smear, including hard-to-reach endocervical cells that are 
often the first to harbor cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Medscand's Cytobrush was developed by a Swedish cytopathologist and is 
considered a vast improvement over the cotton applicators and wood spatulas 
still used by many physicians. The Cytobrush received FDA approval six years 
ago, and some 20 million have been sold so far at 20 cents apiece, compared to 
about 2 cents for a spatula or cotton swab. 
</P>
<P>
Cytobrushes cost about 20 cents each, compared to about 2 cents for a cotton 
applicator or spatula. 
</P>
<P>
The April issue of the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology contains an academic 
study led by Dr. Paul J. Murata at UCLA that says the use of the Cytobrush 
increased the number of cancers accurately diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut-based Unimar has sold nearly a million of its Cervex-Brushes since 
it began marketing the product last year. The brush costs from 29 cents to 44 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
Poor sampling may have contributed to Robin Sealander's death from cervical 
cancer, according to a malpractice suit her father filed two years ago in U.S. 
Superior Court in Pomona against a medical lab and her former gynecologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Irene Davos, a pathologist at Cedars Sinai Hospital, examined Sealander's 
last Pap smear and testified that it "may have been an unsatisfactory specimen 
and (the lab) should have requested another test." 
</P>
<P>
The case was settled out of court last year. 
</P>
<P>
AIMING FOR BETTER PAP SMEAR ACCURACY 
</P>
<P>
PAPNET: an image processing computer that selects the 64 worst-looking cells on 
a Pap smear and then projects them on a high-resolution television screen for 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
AutoPap 300: an image processing computer that sorts Pap smears into two 
categories, normal and suspicious. Only abnormal slides are reviewed by a 
cytotechnologist. 
</P>
<P>
ViraPap: a DNA probe test used to detect the presence of human papilloma virus 
or HPV, which some scientists think may be a precursor to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Cervex-Brush: a special swab designed to collect hard-to-reach endocervical 
cells, which are then put on a Pap smear slide. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
IDENTIFYING ABNORMAL AND MALIGNANT CELLS 
</P>
<P>
A technician uses a microscope to examine thousands of cells on a Pap smear, 
searching for the relative handful that may indicate the presence of cancer. 
Below are cell samples, as they appear through the microscope, showing normal, 
abnormal but not precancerous, precancerous and malignant cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM CYTOLOGY LABS 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials have terminated the participation of several cytology 
labs in reimbursement programs because of a high level of errors, mostly on Pap 
smear diagnoses.

Foreign Aid Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 72 to 346, the House rejected an amendment to HR 4404 (above) 
shaving about $33 million from the bill's aid to Panama, Israel and Nicaragua. 
Sponsor James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) said: "I'm tired of foreign aid" at the 
expense of domestic needs. Opponent Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.) said the amendment 
would not lower spending but leave the money in the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Statistics on Hate Crimes 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 402 to 18, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 1048) 
requiring police agencies, including the FBI, to keep statistics on crimes 
motivated by prejudice against race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) said hate crimes "diminish the whole 
community in which they exist." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said it was wrong for the bill to 
"equate homosexuality . . . with the heterosexual lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Foreign Aid Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 72 to 346, the House rejected an amendment to HR 4404 (above) 
shaving about $33 million from the bill's aid to Panama, Israel and Nicaragua. 
Sponsor James A. Traficant Jr.(D-Ohio) said: "I'm tired of foreign aid" at the 
expense of domestic needs. Opponent Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.) said the amendment 
would not lower spending but leave the money in the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Statistics on Hate Crimes 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 402 to 18, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 1048) 
requiring police agencies, including the FBI, to keep statistics on crimes 
motivated by prejudice against race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) said hate crimes "diminish the whole 
community in which they exist." Opponent William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) 
said it was wrong for the bill to "equate homosexuality . . . with the 
heterosexual lifestyle."

RESIDENTS READY TO PAY FOR CLEAN ENVIRONMENT;

MOST OF THOSE SURVEYED ARE READY TO RECYCLE AND TO PAY MORE FOR MASS TRANSIT 
AND SAFER HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. THEY SAY INDIVIDUALS, NOT GOVERNMENT, ARE THE

<TEXT>
<P>
Pessimistic about the state of the environment, Orange County residents are 
ready to recycle bottles and cans, spend tax dollars on mass transit and buy 
household products deemed safer for Mother Nature -- even if they cost more, a 
new poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since the nation first celebrated Earth Day on April 22, 1970, 
the environment has gotten worse, both nationally and in Orange County, 
according to three-quarters of 600 residents randomly surveyed by telephone in 
a Times Orange County Poll. Nearly half said Orange County's environment will 
only go downhill in the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
And when asked how well county officials are doing in managing growth and 
protecting the environment, Orange County residents issued a 
less-than-exemplary report card. Overall, officials got a grade of about 
C-minus, with 34% saying they deserved a D or F. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to name the county's No. 1 environmental problem, 55% said air 
pollution. Next on the list were concerns about overpopulation (16%), water 
pollution (8%), oil spills (5%) and pesticides (3%). 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the poll reflects a new optimism that individuals -- not 
government -- can make a difference and reverse the ecological nose dive. "We 
can't wait for politicians to wake up and rescue us," said Telly Winston, a 
Tustin schoolteacher who took part in the poll. "It's up to us, the little guys 
down the block." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, a surprising 82% of those polled said they support passage of new 
laws making recycling of newsprint, glass bottles and aluminum cans mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Another 67% said they shop for items such as biodegradable disposable diapers 
and plastic trash bags promoted as "safer for the environment" even though such 
goods are generally more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
And 78% said they favor using tax dollars to build mass transit systems, with 
nearly half saying they would be "very likely" to commute to work on such a 
system if the stops were convenient. 
</P>
<P>
This apparent shift in attitude and behavior stems from heightened concern 
among residents about the myriad of threats facing the environment, the poll 
found. But that awareness -- and the optimism that individuals can somehow undo 
the harm done to the environment -- is tempered by a hefty dose of pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gloomy picture, and it appears to underscore how enormous people 
believe the problems really are," said Mark Baldassare, whose firm of Mark 
Baldassare &amp; Associates conducted the poll. "Because people are worried, 
they want to get involved. They want to take matters, in a sense, into their 
own hands." 
</P>
<P>
Only 5% of residents believe Orange County's environment is better today than 
it was in 1970, and as the nation prepares for the 20th anniversary of Earth 
Day with rallies and marches next Sunday, only 28% believe the situation will 
improve in the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration apparently is shared by a growing number of Americans. A USA 
Today poll found that 83% say they are concerned about the environment, and 
that 64% believe that each person's efforts can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, only recently seeing signs of environmental activism, new 
concern has arisen with the alarming sight of Alaskan crude oil washing up on 
sunbathing beaches and the window-rattling sound of helicopters attacking the 
Mediterranean fruit fly with aerial pesticide sprays. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll found 77% of the respondents said their own 
interest in the environment has increased in the past few. Yet only one out of 
10 said they belong to an environmental group, although more than 50 
organizations now exist locally. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, support for such groups is higher, with 46% of those surveyed in a 
recent Gallup poll for Newsweek indicating they have contributed money to an 
environmental group. Locally, personal involvement in specific causes has 
lagged behind because people focus more on their personal lives, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are concerned and they want a good environment," said Richard 
Kust, president of the 2,500-member Sea and Sage Audubon Society based in Santa 
Ana. "But they are busy, trying to making mortgage payments or raise families 
and they don't know how to connect with the (environmental) movement." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most visible signs of a "green wave" sweeping the county -- and the 
nation -- may be seen on a personal level, with nearly 50% of Orange County 
residents saying they always recycle newspapers, glass bottles and cans and 82% 
favoring mandatory recycling, despite the county's conservative, 
anti-government reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows the level of concern that exists," pollster Baldassare said. "People 
apparently are so worried that the environment won't improve that they are 
willing to accept more government to reverse the trend." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Strong, a 33-year-old hospital worker included in the poll, said she 
believes mandatory recycling is the only option if people won't voluntarily 
sort their trash. 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of weeks when we recycled it was an inconvenience," said 
Strong, a resident of Anaheim, one of six Orange County cities offering 
curbside pickup of recyclables. "But now it barely takes any effort. We're so 
used to separating glass, paper and cans. Even if they said we didn't have to 
do it anymore we still would." 
</P>
<P>
In most areas of the county, recycling is strictly voluntary and 30% of the 
residents said they set aside recyclables only "sometimes," and 21% responded 
they "rarely" or "never" recycle. 
</P>
<P>
Mary McDonald, a retired schoolteacher in San Clemente, said it has become too 
difficult to find a disposal site for her recyclable goods. She used to 
separate her garbage, but no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trash men didn't want them so we got stuck with the stuff," McDonald said. 
"There was a man who would come by for the newspapers, but I couldn't find 
anyone to come and pick up the aluminum cans." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Wilson, a Lake Forest housewife, doesn't recycle, but she is among the 
67% who said they shop for household products that are marketed as more 
beneficial for the environment. About 75% of those in the Newsweek poll said 
they too would spend more for such items, despite studies that question the 
products' environmental claims. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has three children, two of them still in diapers. Although concerned 
that disposable diapers can take years to decompose -- up to 500 years for a 
single diaper by some estimates -- she still buys them, but she now shops for 
the "biodegradable" brands. Washing and drying cloth diapers, she said, "would 
consume my entire day. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I try to buy the environmental ones," Wilson said. "I know they 
cost more, and some people question whether any of these 
'good-for-the-environment products' work, but at least I feel better. I'm 
trying to do something right." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say they understand the frustration, but argue that cloth 
diapers are reusable and generate a fraction of the trash. And diaper services 
can eliminate the inconvenience of laundering, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of county residents said they have not altered shopping habits in 
the name of the environment. Steve Holland, a Yorba Linda accountant, said 
that, in many cases, "nobody has proved conclusively" that such products work 
as advertised. "Until they do, it's a waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
However, money seems to be less of an issue when it comes to water quality. 
Seventy-three percent said they are concerned enough about the taste, 
appearance and safety of tap water to buy more expensive bottled water or home 
filtration systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Why take a chance? It seems like we read in the paper every day about polluted 
water. I've got a family and I'm worried," said Melanie Williams, a resident of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Mass transit, such as a monorail or light-rail train, also is something 
residents said they would be willing to finance in the interest of easing 
congestion on county roads and freeways and reducing vehicle emissions. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the respondents favored using tax dollars to develop such a 
system. Nearly half said they would use it "to commute to work or for other 
daily trips." Residents in North and central Orange County would be more likely 
to ride the system. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said there is an emerging link between public support for mass 
transit and concern over air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible we are arriving at a new awareness of just how bad pollution is 
becoming," he said. "People may be more willing than in the past to accept mass 
transit as the solution to both traffic and air quality." 
</P>
<P>
But even then, residents such as Troyetta Palmer are not sure they want to part 
with their vehicles, no matter how easy it is to ride some sort of people 
mover. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the freedom of my own car," said Palmer, a 33-year-old Santa Ana office 
worker who has lived in Southern California for two decades. "I know the smog 
is bad. I remember when you could go to the top of almost any hill on any day 
and see Catalina Island. Those days are gone, and my car is probably one reason 
why. But I love to drive." 
</P>
<P>
Finding solutions is frustrating, environmentalists say. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pessimistic about the ability of this county's leadership to grasp the 
need for ecological balance," said Tom Larson, a horticulturist and business 
executive who was the chief architect of the Orange County Guide to 
Environmental Restoration, a blueprint for reducing pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime activist Frank Robinson, a central figure for more than three decades 
in the effort to preserve the Upper Newport Bay wetlands, pointed to the 
residential building boom in the past decade and said the county "has worked 
itself into a 'building ethic.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The very thing that the county depends on for its economic life is causing the 
environmental problem," he said. "It's up to the elected officials to redirect 
our priorities. But can they?" 
</P>
<P>
But Don R. Roth, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said 
critics are too quick to blame government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The county has no way of controlling the real cause of much of region's 
problems: population growth, he said. Since 1980, about 400,000 new people have 
been born in the county or moved here, pushing the population over 2.3 million. 
And another 300,000 are expected by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it our fault that in the last year alone 43,000 new babies have been born 
in this county?" Roth asked. "Is it our fault that the federal government 
allows up to 10,000 new refugees a month to settle here? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we haven't done a good job with the environment. Maybe we should have 
put a fence around Orange County a long time ago. But I don't think people 
would let us."

How to Save Mother Earth 
</P>
<P>
Commitment to save the environment begins at home. Many Orange County residents 
are pitching in by recycling and making other conservation efforts. Here are a 
few things you can do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water your lawn at night. Set lawn mower blades high. Lawn grass should be 2-3" 
high, which encourages longer roots and enables the dirt to retain water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aerate your faucets. Water flows from your faucet at a rate of 3 to 5 gallons a 
minute. Attaching a low-flow aerator will cut that in half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use reusuable containers. Instead of plastic wrap or foil to store food. If 25% 
of American homes used 10 fewer plastic bags a month, 2.5 billion bags a year 
would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just wet and rinse your toothbrush; don't let the water run Otherwise, you can 
easily use 5 gallons each time you brush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop junk mail. The unwanted mail you get this year could equal 1.5 trees. To 
be taken off lists write to Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Assn., 11 
W. 42nd St. P.O. Box 3861 New York, NY 10163-3861 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use cloth diapers. Each year, Americans use 18 billion disposable diapers. They 
take up to 500 years to decompose, use up 1.26-million metric tons of wood plup 
and consume 1% of all landfill space. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumption 
</P>
<P>
The average Orange County household uses 326,000 gallons of water per year. 
</P>
<P>
Each man, woman and child produces 2.1 tones of trash per year-more per capita 
than in any other metropolitan area in the nation. Added up, Orange County 
generates 4.4 million tons of solid waste a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The average household uses 500 kilowatt hours of electricity per month. That is 
enough to burn 500 100-watt light blubs for 10 hours.

</P>
<P>
Reaction 
</P>
<P>
73% of Orange County residents say they are concerned enough about the quality 
of drinking water to buy bottled water ot filter their tap. 
</P>
<P>
78% say they approve of spending local tax dollars to build a mass transit 
system in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
49% say they always recycle their newspapers, glass and cans.

How Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted March 30-April 1 by Mark Baldassare 
&amp; Associates. The telephone survey of 600 adult Orange County residents was 
conducted on weekend days and weekday nights using a random sample of listed 
and unlisted telephone numbers. The margin of error for a sample this size is 
plus-or-minus 4% but would be higher for subgroups. All responses were 
anonymous, but some agreed to be re-interviewed later for news stories.

NEW DRILLING OPPOSED OFF O.C. SHORES; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: NEARLY SEVEN OUT OF 10 RESIDENTS FAVOR A COMPLETE BAN IN LOCAL WATERS, 
BUT HALF SAY THEY FAVOR MORE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE.

<P>
As President Bush ponders the future of offshore oil drilling in Southern 
California, the message from Orange County residents who suffered the effects 
of a major spill just two months ago rings loud and clear: no new oil platforms 
in our back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Huntington Beach spill, which dumped 394,000 gallons of Alaskan 
crude oil into local waters, fouled 20 miles of shoreline, killed hundreds of 
marine birds and has left a lasting impression on many county residents, a 
Times Orange County Poll on the environment has found. The accident has also 
fueled concerns about the safety of oil drilling and shipping in general, 
particularly off the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened really scared me," said Mary MacDonald, 65, a retired 
schoolteacher in San Juan Capistrano who participated in the poll. "I'd rather 
be producing our own oil than buying it from foreign countries, but we need to 
be careful about what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Eight in 10 residents believe the Feb. 7 tanker spill caused significant 
environmental damage and dealt a blow to the beach economy, according to the 
poll conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. Despite officials' 
pronouncements that the spill caused no lasting harm, one in four in the poll 
described the damage as "major." 
</P>
<P>
Two out of three Orange County residents are more concerned about oil shipping 
and drilling than they were before the Huntington Beach spill, according to the 
poll, while eight in 10 worry that history will repeat itself with another 
large spill off the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Huntington Beach oil spill had to do with shipping oil and not 
drilling, but the thing is, if those platforms are right out there, the chance 
of having another spill or something going wrong offshore is a lot higher," 
said Dawna Brady, 18, a receptionist in San Clemente. "I drive up the coast, 
see them (oil platforms) and wonder, 'now what's going to happen with those?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Baldassare said the results show that opposition to oil drilling 
appears to have reached a "high-water mark." 
</P>
<P>
"It's partly because of the spill off the coast of Huntington Beach," he said. 
"But there also appears to be a growing consensus that offshore oil drilling, 
at least off the coast of Orange County, may not be worth the environmental 
hazards." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment is reflected by the 66% of county residents who favor a complete 
ban on drilling off the Orange County coast, compared to 25% who support more 
drilling and 9% who are undecided. That does not translate into support for a 
ban on oil drilling elsewhere in the nation, however. Half say they favor 
increasing oil exploration and production elsewhere in the United States, and 
only 38% oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Don Gardner, 41, a hardware store owner in Stanton, called a local ban the 
"first step in being environmentally responsible." He said he fears that an oil 
spill "10 times the size" of the Huntington Beach spill could occur if federal 
officials allow full-scale oil and gas exploration in local waters. 
</P>
<P>
Not all county residents, however, agree that a permanent ban is the answer. 
Todd Mathewson, 29, an industrial equipment salesman from Fullerton, said such 
a move would "seal off" a crucial option for meeting rising fuel demands. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes offshore energy development should be a last resort. 
However, should the availability of oil become scarce, Mathewson said, he would 
support drilling off the county's coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer drilling on land first, but you can't be foolish enough to say 
'never' to offshore drilling," Mathewson said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the threat of oil spills, some residents such as Roy Ballard, 73, of 
Placentia, believe drilling is a necessary evil -- the price society pays for 
its addiction to oil. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do? Give up our cars, our electricity, our microwave 
ovens?" Ballard asked. "If we need that oil, let's drill for it." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, a local ban will remain in effect off the Orange County coast 
pending a decision from President Bush about whether to open up more of 
Southern California to offshore drilling. Shortly after taking office, Bush 
temporarily stopped lease-sale preparations begun during the Reagan 
Administration and ordered a task force to assess the environmental and 
economic impact of several proposed lease sales in California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Lease Sale 95, proposed off the Southern California coast, includes 6.7 million 
acres extending from the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis 
Obispo County. The presidential task force has laid out a series of options for 
each of the lease sales, ranging from allowing leasing to extending the current 
ban. Bush is expected to announce his decision sometime this summer. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, there is little debate on the matter among Orange County 
residents whose memories of the Huntington Beach spill are still fresh. The 
President, they say, should allow more drilling -- but elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's because I want it out of my back yard," said Ann DePriest, 40, 
of Garden Grove. "I know there is oil in other places and we ought to try as 
many of them as possible."

DEMAND FOR FOOD STAMPS PUTS BITE ON SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC AID: THE PROGRAM SAW AN ESTIMATED 14,000 PEOPLE ADDED TO ITS ROLLS IN 
THE PAST YEAR ALONE, AND THE BOARD WILL BE ASKED TO INCREASE FUNDS TO 
ADMINISTER IT.

<P>
With Orange County's ability to distribute food stamps being overwhelmed by the 
soaring number of residents who qualify for them, the Board of Supervisors will 
be asked this week to sharply increase money for the program. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the proposal would cost the county $23,000 for the remainder of 
this fiscal year, which ends in June. Another $158,000 would be set aside to 
cover the increased costs during the next two years, bringing the budget for 
distributing the stamps to $266,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Those are caps on the cost and officials are hopeful, but not certain, that the 
county will actually end up spending less. 
</P>
<P>
What seems indisputable, though, is that the number of Orange County residents 
seeking food stamps will continue to grow. Most of the new recipients are 
single women, many of them working part time or in minimum-wage jobs and 
struggling to pay for housing at the same time that they try make ends meet for 
themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
"As housing becomes harder and harder for people to get here, they're looking 
for every benefit they can find, and that's creating quite a marked increase in 
our food stamp cases," said Bob Griffith, chief deputy director of the county's 
Social Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting more desperate," he added. "There's a stigma attached to food 
stamps, but when you're desperate you'll put up with the comments you get in 
the grocery line from people standing behind you." 
</P>
<P>
Agency figures indicate that the county's food stamp recipients have grown from 
23,800 cases in March, 1989 to 29,400 in March, 1990. Cases, which include 
people who only receive food stamps as well as those also receiving Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children, usually represent a single mother with at 
least two children, so that figure suggests that Orange County has at least 
14,000 more food stamp recipients than it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, experts say, reflects a combination of federal government efforts 
to alert potential recipients that they may qualify for food stamps, as well as 
to the growing number of people in Orange County who are in need of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the growth in this county is coming from people who are more likely 
to be less advantaged," county demographer William F. Gayk said. "Orange County 
is picking up an awful lot of immigrants and refugees" and the county's 
birthrate is far higher for non-whites, many of whom are disadvantaged, than it 
is for whites. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez agreed that the county's fast-changing population 
is dramatically reshaping programs such as food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the demographics of Orange County are changing in a lot of ways, 
some of them very significant," he said, adding that he believes the 1990 
census will illustrate the depth of the changes during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration has played a significant part in the county's changing 
profile, but illegal aliens cannot receive food stamps. Under the federal 
amnesty law, aliens who apply for and receive amnesty become eligible for 
government assistance after five years, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Other immigrants, such as refugees, are immediately eligible, however. 
</P>
<P>
The food stamps themselves are paid for by the federal government, but a 
portion of the cost of distributing them falls to the county, which is 
obligated to participate and has to operate within certain constraints. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors will consider the request Tuesday, and some 
supervisors complain there is little they can do to control the cost of 
administering the food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have compassion, but it imposes a tremendous fiscal burden on the 
taxpayers of this county when state and federally mandated programs are not 
accompanied by full funding," Vasquez said. "It's a tremendous irritation."

THE HEAT'S ON IN BALBOA AS CHEFS VIE TO REACH STATE CHILI CONTEST

With the graceful sway of yacht masts in the background, chili connoisseurs 
dressed in everything from chaps and cowboy hats to bunny suits wandered 
Saturday afternoon from booth to booth at the American Legion hall parking lot 
on Balboa Island, hunting for a taste of the coast's finest chili. 
</P>
<P>
Clasping a glass of beer in one hand and stuffed bunny in the other, one woman 
sauntered up to the Climax Chili booth to taste their hottest version. Under 
the next tent, patrons of Costa Mesa's Stag Bar crowded around the chefs, vying 
for a nibble of the house specialty and cooing over the spicy red sauce. 
</P>
<P>
With every chef came a different recipe and a different secret, but all 23 of 
the contestants had one thing in common: They are members of the International 
Chili Society and were facing a last chance to qualify for the California state 
cook-off. 
</P>
<P>
The American Legion Chili Cook-Off in Newport Beach is among the last 
sanctioned opportunities to qualify for the state meet, scheduled for the 
Newport Dunes at the end of May. Although no one argues that the main goal of 
the cook-offs is to have a good time, chili is one thing these people take 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, good chili is good chili," explained ICS official scorekeeper Karen Ray. 
"But we're looking for some specifics -- no one spice predominating, and a 
consistency that is not too thick or too thin. 
</P>
<P>
Between 60% to 70% of the score goes to the general taste, she said. "Then you 
also have to look at the color of the chili, and the aroma. If it smells good, 
you know it's going to taste good." 
</P>
<P>
She also explained that although there are regional specialties -- such as 
extra-hot chili in Texas and sweeter chili out of Cincinnati -- society winners 
usually keep things to the basics of meat, vegetables and spices. In 
particular, no "fillers" are allowed, such as beans, rice, onions or cheese, 
which are sometimes served with the spicy specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old saying that the only thing you put in good chili is the spoon," 
one judge said. 
</P>
<P>
With a country band playing in the background, contestants had three hours to 
cook their masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. the judges collected samples from every group and lined them up on a 
long table. With a glass of beer and a plate of crackers, celery and carrots -- 
to clear the palate -- the judges got down to business. 
</P>
<P>
Like wine experts, they sniffed, gazed and swirled, letting the spices linger 
on the tongue. On final tally of the points, a Costa Mesa chili, Ruth Porter's 
"Margaritaville," took first place. Runner-ups included the "Horny Toads" chili 
made by Richard Breck of Bonita and "Rosie's Red," developed by Rosie Taylor of 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
For the chefs, however, working to perfect a chili recipe is sometimes better 
than winning. For Chuck and Diane Varney, who cook the Stag Bar's chili, the 
secret of a good chili is "a whole lot of TLC." (They also use oxtail, for a 
unique taste.) Several chefs mentioned a chili cook-off last year in which a 
contestant butchered a beaver for his "secret ingredient." 
</P>
<P>
But Jim and Karen Watson, who entered as the JK Coyote Chili Company, maintain 
that there is no one secret for making good chili, except enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"You just go out and have a good time and try and make it the best you can," 
explained Jim Watson. "Basically, you just hope everybody likes it."

TUNA BOYCOTT NOT OVER YET, ACTIVISTS SAY;

<P>
While most environmentalists cheered the decision by the nation's three largest 
tuna companies to stop buying or selling tuna caught in nets that also harm 
dolphins, Mark Lewis took a more cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 24, a Newport Beach resident and leader of the Orange County 
Environmental Assn., said he has heard promises from large corporations before 
and fears that without public pressure, the U.S. tuna industry may back down on 
its pledge. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Lewis and about a dozen other activists from Greenpeace and the 
Earth Island Institute held a protest at the Balboa Pier, asking the public not 
to buy tuna until fish that have not been caught in dolphin-harming gill and 
drift nets hit supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"I support them for their efforts, and I think it's fantastic what they're 
doing," Lewis said of the pledge by the makers of StarKist, Bumble Bee and 
Chicken of the Sea tuna. "We want Newport Beach to know that just because they 
say it, it doesn't mean they're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters at the midday rally carried placards reading "Stop Eating Canned 
Tuna" and "Why Trust Them Now?" They also passed out literature and asked 
beach-goers to sign a petition supporting the tuna companies' actions. 
</P>
<P>
The companies all cited mounting complaints from consumers as a major reason 
for the policy change. Company officials said tuna caught by means other than 
with the those nets will be clearly marked dolphin safe on the can. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have long protested that nets used to catch tuna also kill 
dolphins that school with tuna. The nets pull in the dolphins along with the 
tuna, often crushing or drowning the mammals. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of dolphins killed by the fishing method range from 
100,000 to 200,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the tuna manufacturers are changing because it is "the yuppie thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason they're doing this is because of all the postcards and letters 
people sent them," he said. "(But) how can they be the good guys now after 
being the bad guys for so long?" 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said foreign tuna companies, as well as many restaurants, still 
buy fish caught with the harmful nets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over yet," said Kathleen Siess, 27, of Newport Beach, a member of the 
Earth Island Institute. "There are thousands of dolphins still in danger."

CAMBODIAN COMMUNITY KICKS OFF 'YEAR OF HORSE'

Cambodian-born Marsida Yin, 14, sat on a straw floor-mat with her hands clasped 
together, praying in silence with her family and about 100 other people for 
their ancestors and gods Saturday morning to mark the start of the Cambodian 
New Year, the Year of the Horse. 
</P>
<P>
Four Buddhist monks, clad in saffron robes, chanted for more than an hour with 
prayers and blessings for the people in a community center amphitheater serving 
as a temple for the service. They sat cross-legged on a raised stage area 
surrounded by dishes of rice, fruit and vegetables given to them by the 
worshipers as offerings. 
</P>
<P>
They chanted for prosperity. They told their listeners to take care of their 
parents and grandparents and to treat them with respect and love. The monks 
also thanked the people for the food and wished them well with their goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian New Year, which is celebrated over a period of three days, Friday 
through today, is symbolic, said Rifka Harsch, executive director of The 
Cambodian Family, a nonprofit, community-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time for renewal," she said. "It's a time for all the bad to be 
forgotten and a time when all the work is finished. It's spiritual and social." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the ceremony, more people piled rice into four large bowls, one for 
each monk. Candles were also set into a separate bowl of rice to represent the 
dead. After taking off their shoes to show respect, every person spooning rice 
into the bowls said a prayer for their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women in attendance wore traditional native gowns called samput 
phamuong and lace or light-colored blouses called auv paks with scarfs called 
krama. 
</P>
<P>
Some people like to come dressed formally, but what matters is the 
acknowledgment of the new year, said Marsida Yin of Westminster, who wore a 
white and black modern dress. 
</P>
<P>
"We come here to say our thanks," Marsida said. "We come here and think of our 
ancestors, relatives and the dead. We are all part of this big family of 
Cambodians who come into this country." 
</P>
<P>
Marsida said she enjoys such gatherings because they bring the Cambodian 
community together. 
</P>
<P>
"This celebration gives us a chance to get to know one another," she said. 
"It's really important for us who do not want to lose our heritage. We want to 
remember it." 
</P>
<P>
The celebration, which attracted more than 400 people, was sponsored by The 
Cambodian Family and the Orange County Cambodian Buddhist Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, about 50 children kept busy with games, balloon-tossing and tug-of-war 
contests organized by the Cambodian Student Assn. of Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"According to our custom, (on) this day our people in our country are free from 
harvesting and collecting crops. This is the free season. At this time, if 
somebody committed a crime, the government will release prisoners or reduce 
their sentence," said Sophon Chhoeng, president of the Cambodian Buddhist 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The people believe this is a special time to be free. They also think the new 
year will chase the bad away," he said. "It starts a new life of forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Jumping excitedly after placing third in the balloon-tossing contest, 
12-year-old Phann Choy said he liked celebrating the Cambodian New Year because 
for him it meant plenty of dancing later. 
</P>
<P>
For 21-year-old Somnea Ngann, who came with six family members, the celebration 
was a significant cultural gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this kind of event is great because there are so many cultures here in 
America," said Ngann of Orange. "This is tradition and it reinforces the 
culture for the children." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Scanlan, a teacher for The Cambodian Family, said she took her husband 
and two boys to the center so they can learn from the Cambodian culture. 
</P>
<P>
"You have Anglos here, Vietnamese and Cambodians here," said Scanlan, who lives 
in Laguna Beach. "It's wonderful to maintain their culture as we mainstream 
them into our (American) culture." 
</P>
<P>
After the monks ate, hundreds of Cambodians who gathered at the Corbin 
Community Center and the Southwest Senior Center had their lunch and watched 
children perform traditional folk dances and some modern American rap dancing 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Chea Lim, organizer of The Cambodian Family Dance Group, said he wanted to have 
the children contribute to the event to help preserve the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally got involved with the kids because I wanted them to have a good 
influence. At the same time, we want them to be cultured and to see both 
cultures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vitthara Tan, a 20-year-old junior at Cal State Fullerton, said he believed it 
is a time for all Cambodians to come together. 
</P>
<P>
"In a spiritual and religious way, we celebrate it," he said. "But, it's not 
all purely serious. We want everybody to enjoy it and have parties." 
</P>
<P>
Inside a large community center room, between breaks from a live band 
performance, children of the family dance group performed traditional dances 
called the bopha lokay and the chhay yam. 
</P>
<P>
With the games finally over, Phann Choy finally got his opportunity to dance 
when he led three other boys as they boogied, jumped and kicked to their own 
rap song. After a round of cheers from the audience, the boys, clad in 
bright-colored pants and blue T-shirts with black and silver vests, came back 
out with two more boys to perform more dance movements in unison for the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, after their performance, the boys admitted not knowing much about 
the tradition of the new year but said it didn't matter that much. 
</P>
<P>
They were there for the fun, they said.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHERE IN TARNATION IS THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last wave of tar balls that rolled ashore in Huntington Beach two weeks ago 
triggered a flood of memories about another place that I once called home. 
</P>
<P>
Surf City has been my home since I moved to Orange County last September. And 
in many ways it resembles my home of 22 years -- Trinidad and Tobago, a 
twin-island nation perched seven miles above Venezuela in the southern 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
With a size of almost 2,000 square miles, Trinidad and Tobago is slightly 
larger than Rhode Island. Its population of 1.2 million people is about the 
same as New Mexico's. 
</P>
<P>
But the oil derricks that bob and flicker in the Pacific Ocean just three miles 
off Huntington Beach resemble the monstrous pieces of metal that comprise the 
oil platforms afloat in the Caribbean just off the coast of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
And like Huntington Beach, where oil was once king, Trinidad and Tobago's 
economic lifeblood are the remaining oil veins that spew out oil and gas from 
leagues beneath the ocean. The country's economic well-being is tied to the 
revenues of the handful of American oil companies that operate the wells. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the pristine Caribbean beaches have not been tarnished by an oil 
spill of the magnitude -- 396,000 gallons -- that fouled Huntington and Newport 
beaches in February. 
</P>
<P>
Or have they? 
</P>
<P>
During the cleanup of the Huntington Beach oil spill, a private company 
proposed spraying the slick with dispersants to sink the giant patches of 
floating crude to the bottom of the ocean. The Coast Guard vehemently opposed 
the proposal, saying dispersants are highly toxic and the submerged tar balls 
would inflict serious damage to the seabed and the delicate Bolsa Chica 
Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Now, wait a minute, I thought. Isn't it normal practice in Trinidad for the oil 
companies to attack a spill with dispersants before it reaches the beaches? 
</P>
<P>
The only fallout are the few dead pelicans, sporadic surfacings of dead fish 
and the annoying black dots of tar balls that stick to your feet. 
</P>
<P>
Beach-goers sometimes siphon gasoline from their cars or carry along bottles of 
kerosene to clean the gooey stuff from their skin. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the usual grumble, there are no major complaints. No one rushes off 
to sue the oil companies over the dead birds and fish. And the oil companies 
are never in a hurry to conduct damage control. Missing from these spills are 
the teams of public relations personnel who camp out on the beach and, of 
course, the army of workmen who wield their white pompons to dab away the gunk. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to a cleanup operation in Trinidad is always less expensive: 
wait until a few high tides wash ashore and swallow the goo back to sea. Total 
cleanup cost: nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But the disparate actions of large corporations in dealing with developing 
countries is not restricted to the cleanup of oil spills. Greenpeace, the 
environmental group, has recently been lobbying Congress to force several 
companies to halt the sale of banned pesticides to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The circle of poison is coming back to haunt us," Greenpeace spokeswoman 
Sandra Marquardt said. "Traces of never-registered pesticides sold (to 
developing countries) are making their way back to the United States in our 
coffee, fruits, vegetables and meat. We're banning the pesticides here, but 
eating and importing it in our food from elsewhere. It's coming full circle." 
</P>
<P>
My recollections of the tar balls and the flurry of Earth Day activities have 
brought home the point that environmental conservation can only be global, not 
local. Polluted air is not confined to polluted areas. The recent efforts to 
save the rain forests in the Amazon underscore the argument that only 
international action and cooperation could save the health of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Inaction is far too costly.

TOURISTS GET SPRAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caroline Taylor (Letters, April 1) quite correctly insists that the state 
should require that hotels/motels notify their guests at registration when 
spraying is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The position taken by the (state) Department of Agriculture is that they see no 
need for the state to require hotels/motels to notify their guests. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Department of Health Services takes the position of advising 
residents of communities to be sprayed that they should take some simple 
general precautions to reduce avoidable exposure to any potentially hazardous 
chemical. They ask you to stay indoors (great for tourists who have limited 
time and budget), remove clothing from outdoor lines and cover playground 
facilities. They should also be cautioning hotels to cover their swimming 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
So, why aren't tourists being warned? Their physiology is the same as ours. No 
doubt because it's bad for business, and the last thing the state wants is any 
more unfavorable publicity. The bottom line is that, once again, dollars are 
valued more than people as we slip further into moral bankruptcy.

IRVINE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local government may be the only echelon of our national system on which most 
of us can exert any direct influence, or with which we can feel any personal 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
But what is the cost of citizen participation? For 10 individuals (in Irvine) 
who were sued for signing the ballot arguments of Measures B and C, more than 
they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, hostility, anger and high levels of emotions can take its toll for 
citizens' participation in the political process -- but a lawsuit? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps these 10 individuals anticipated "lively" interaction between 
special-interest groups in hopes of resolution. But a lawsuit? 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that democracy is not a spectator sport. However, we realize 
that participating in the democratic process is not without responsibility. But 
certainly, it should come without a lawsuit.

THEATER VS. STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Story on "Fullerton OK's $4.7 Million for Theater Parking." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton City Council members (Don Bankhead, A.B. (Buck) Catlin, Molly 
McClanahan and Chris Norby) are spending $4.7 million for a parking structure 
for the Fox Fullerton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten is the other taxpayer garage on Wilshire -- empty most of the time. I 
was surprised to read that $1.1 million has already been spent on the theater. 
This should certainly improve the market value when the theater is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than spending money on projects the savings and loan industry wouldn't 
touch, the council members should find the means to improve Fullerton's street 
lighting and roads.

SENTENCED TO SCRUBBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's sort of like Dad making Junior wash the car for not keeping his room clean 
-- there's a certain neatness to it, both literally and figuratively. At the 
suggestion last week of Supervisor Gaddi A. Vasquez, Orange County is studying 
an ordinance to impose jail sentences and stiff fines on repeat graffiti 
scribes who practice their "art" in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
In a twin effort to counteract such defacement, the county is considering 
Vasquez's proposal to set up a program in which persons sentenced to jail time, 
including those convicted of besmirching property, could be assigned to a 
graffiti-abatement program. Already a local Municipal Court judge has praised 
the idea as a possible sentencing alternative to alleviate jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, minimum-security jail inmates are regularly assigned to work crews 
that clean up flood control channels and roadsides, including painting over 
graffiti. Vasquez's program would designate crews specifically for graffiti 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's 29 cities spend about $1 million annually to rid themselves of 
unsightly graffiti, using city crews, private contractors and volunteers. A 
county-run graffiti-removal program could be a less-costly alternative for 
cities. It also could provide an appropriate way to fit the punishment to the 
crime.

DENIAL OF EXEMPTION FOR CHEERLEADER WHO GOT 'F' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "One 'F' Leaves Girl Nothing to Cheer About" (April 4): 
</P>
<P>
I have been the pepster adviser and a teacher at Valencia High School for six 
years. At Valencia, the 2.0 GPA is a minimum standard, and any adviser or coach 
may elect to impose additional conditions as long as this fact is communicated 
to parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
In our pepster program, the students must maintain a semester GPA of 2.5 and no 
"F"s or "U"s to remain eligible or to try out for the squad. These higher 
standards are set because the pepster girls are in a position of leadership and 
responsibility. In addition, they may have to occasionally miss an academic 
class for their pepster activities and need to be above-average students to 
compensate for these absences. Melissa Fontes and her family are losing sight 
of two important points: 1) She must accept responsibility for her actions. She 
received the "F," not the pepster program. 2) The first priority of any student 
should be his or her academic grade. As a parent, I would be more concerned 
about my daughter's "F"than the fact that she was not eligible for the 
cheerleading squad.

DENIAL OF EXEMPTION FOR CHEERLEADER WHO GOT 'F'

<P>
Re "Prospective Cheerleader's Parents Fail to Win Her Exemption From 'No F' 
Rule" (April 7): Let me get this straight. The cheerleader's mother blames: 1) 
the school district, for discriminating against cheerleaders; 2) the school and 
its advisers, for allowing her daughter to take the class without the math 
prerequisite; and 3) the teacher, who didn't "interface" with Melissa when she 
was failing. 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't Mrs. Passy "interfacing" with her daughter when Melissa's grades 
dropped from a "C" to a "D" to an "F"? 
</P>
<P>
And, most importantly, why didn't Melissa seek help from her mother or her 
teacher before it was too late? I shudder to think of what kind of lesson 
Melissa is learning from this experience.

DOCTORS ARE FRUSTRATED, THWARTED IN THEIR EFFORTS AT HOUSECLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles Times (March 25), "in a rare punitive action" the 
Medical Board of California revoked the license of a longtime Orange County 
practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
The operative word here is rare. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most scurrilous lie promulgated against doctors is that they refuse 
to police themselves. Trial lawyers love to complain about how difficult it is 
to get a doctor to testify against another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Medical Assn. for 
over a decade, I can tell you that there are many misfits, incompetents or 
outright charlatans whom we have been trying for years to cleanse from our 
organization -- only to be frustrated and often totally thwarted by the legal 
delays and maneuvers that pass as "due process." 
</P>
<P>
Organized medicine is no more willing to see a responsible member of its 
community pilloried than the media were willing to be quiet when Andy Rooney 
was suspended from his TV job. 
</P>
<P>
But given the proper policing tools and protection from guerrilla attacks by 
the legal profession, the OCMA would tomorrow expel a dozen members whom it is 
ashamed to call colleagues.

BALLET BACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to James Jones' column (April 1) lamenting the lack of a classical 
ballet company in Orange County, I would ask anyone with similar concerns the 
following questions: 
</P>
<P>
1. What local ballet company has been performing for Orange County audiences 
for 25 years? 
</P>
<P>
2. What local ballet company performs 80 times a year with full subscriber 
series for both adults and children? 
</P>
<P>
3. What local ballet company did 30 lecture-demonstrations for Orange County 
elementary schools in the last 12 months? 
</P>
<P>
4. What local ballet company has the repertory, scenery, costumes and dancers 
to offer local audiences full productions of "The Nutcracker," "Sleeping 
Beauty," "Copellia," "Firebird" and other classics? 
</P>
<P>
5. What local ballet company was chosen to represent the western states at the 
International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss.? 
</P>
<P>
6. And finally, what Orange County ballet company did the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic ask to dance the pas de deux from "Romeo and Juliet" and a 
variation from "West Side Story" at the Beverly Wiltern last month? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the above questions is, Ballet Pacifica, which is a good example 
of a local dance company that could use support to hire its dancers full-time 
rather than have them come to class and rehearse after working an eight-hour 
day. Like Jones, a lot of us are tired of losing our local talent to ABT, 
Joffrey, San Francisco, and European dance companies. Let's just support and 
build on what we already have -- we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Turtles, teen-age mutant ninja or the real kind, are reptiles, not amphibians! 
In an otherwise fun article one of your writers (March 31) described the 
current craze about the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." While recognizing that 
they had shells, thus turtles, therefore making them reptiles, the writer 
refers to them as "awesome amphibians." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the writer is confused between non-amphibian and the adjective 
amphibious. While many amphibians are amphibious, some are aquatic and others 
are completely terrestrial. The same is true for turtles. While Ninja Turtles 
have smooth skin (after all they are "mutant turtles") they do have a shell 
with its scaly covering, hence are reptiles. Based on my observations of these 
mythical beasts, they are awesome amphibious reptiles!

'COUNTY PROBES ORANGEWOOD CHILD SHELTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "County Probes Orangewood Child Shelter," March 31: I write to trumpet 
absolute support of the purpose and services that epitomize the love and 
concern shown by staff for the 180-plus children who are sheltered at the 
Orangewood Children's Home, children who have been victimized by abuse, neglect 
and abandonment in their home environment. As one who is at Orangewood as a 
parachaplain and who volunteers time teaching poetry within the classroom, I am 
quick and firm to give voice to the truths of my observation that I have not 
seen the slightest evidence to remotely support allegations that staff is given 
to abusing the children. 
</P>
<P>
Quite the contrary to any connotation of wrongdoing, I have found Orangewood's 
administration and staff to be exceptionally sensitive in their support and 
care of each and every child at Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
The one key word that justly depicts the truth behind the supportive care given 
the children at Orangewood is sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
The complainants made much about a so-called paramilitary mentality and a stern 
regimentation that is claimed to be a detriment to the children. Any logical 
response to such a claim must be founded upon the rationale that in caring for 
180-plus children, ages newborn to 18 years, safety and order calls for a 
degree of regimentation, all to the benefit of the children individually and 
collectively. 
</P>
<P>
The behavioral structure is no less or no more than one would find in any 
public or private school, or decently run household.

BICHETTE'S HOMER TOPS TWINS IN 12TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dante Bichette hit a three-run home run with two out in the 12th inning off 
Rick Aguilara to give the Angels a 7-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins 
Saturday in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The home run drove in Johnny Ray, who had singled, and Chili Davis, who had 
been walked intentionally with two out to bring Bichette to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gaetti's single with one out in the 12th inning scored Al Newman to break 
a tie and give the Twins a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Newman had led off with a walk off Bryan Harvey and went to second when Kent 
Hrbek walked. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels mixed defensive gems with defensive generosity Saturday, and, 
predictably, got mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Bichette had saved the game in the 10th inning with his fifth assist 
of the young season, throwing Kirby Puckett out at the plate as Puckett tried 
to tag up on Gaetti's fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 4-3 lead in the seventh inning on doubles by Jack Howell and 
Ray sandwiched around Devon White's fielder's choice grounder. 
</P>
<P>
But the Twins tied the score in the eighth against reliever Willie Fraser. With 
one out, Fred Manrique reached when shortstop Mark McLemore erred on a 
grounder. Manrique scored when Puckett tripled into the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn relieved Fraser and got out of the inning. Eichhorn walked Hrbek 
-- who stole second -- but struck out Gaetti and got Randy Bush to fly to 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Max Venable, inserted into the lineup as a defensive replacement after the 
eighth inning, saved the game for the Angels in the ninth. While sliding on his 
stomach, he managed to catch Al Newman's sinking liner, with Greg Gagne and Dan 
Gladden taking off from second and first, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Bert Blyleven -- who gave up three runs in six innings and 
departed with the score tied, 3-3 -- climbed a notch higher on one of 
baseball's more dubious all-time lists. The first-inning home run he yielded to 
Hrbek was the 400th he has allowed in his career, the seventh-highest total in 
major league history. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the second run he allowed in the inning. Gladden led off with a 
double to left. He moved to third on Manrique's grounder to second and scored 
on Puckett's grounder to second. Hrbek, hitting cleanup, hit Blyleven's 
two-and-one pitch over the fence in right field for his second home run of the 
season. Right fielder Claudell Washington leaped and many fans thought he had 
caught the ball, but it was just beyond his reach. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels closed to 2-1 in the bottom of the inning when Wally Joyner hit a 
two-and-one pitch from Roy Smith over the fence in almost straightaway center 
for his first home run of the season. But the Twins rebuilt a two-run margin in 
the third inning on a double by Manrique, wild pitch by Blyleven on his first 
offering to Puckett and Puckett's run-scoring grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish tied the score with a two-run home run in the fourth inning. 
Washington worked a full-count walk and scored ahead of Parrish, who hit a 
two-and-one pitch into the family section in left field. Parrish had hit a 
two-run shot Friday off Allan Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven didn't retire the Twins in order until the sixth inning, but even 
then, he gave the crowd reason to hold its breath when White caught Hrbek's 
long fly ball a stride from the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth was Blyleven's last, and he was relieved by Willie Fraser. Blyleven 
allowed six hits and three earned runs while lasting an inning longer than in 
his opening day loss to Seattle last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seeing his club in action for a week has not moved Angel General Manager Mike 
Port to make a move. He continues to talk with peers but said he is not close 
to a deal. He also debunked the rumor that the Angels would acquire Boston 
closer Lee Smith, saying the Red Sox might be reluctant to trade Smith because 
Jeff Reardon has back problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kicked a lot of things around with other clubs, but at this point it's 
just general," Port said. "It's identifying other peoples' needs and interests 
and keeping them advised of our interest. Sometimes these things take a lot of 
spadework." 
</P>
<P>
Port reiterated that he's satisfied with his personnel. "Unless or until 
something achievable comes along, we're still very, very comfortable with the 
cast we've got," he said. "We're determined not to do anything unless it's 
right and the circumstances permit. If we have a surplus of pitching, it might 
be a case of utilizing all our pitching and defense and building from that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mike Witt believes he's headed elsewhere, Port would not be 
definitive. "His last three or four times out, going back to the Freeway 
Series, he's shown great improvement in terms of velocity," Port said. "I see a 
lot of things there of Mike Witt in his prime. He's well on his way to being 
the Mike Witt we know he can be. What the rest of the season holds, it's 
day-by-day." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Anderson, who committed two errors Friday, wasn't in Saturday's lineup. 
But Manager Doug Rader said it wasn't because of the misplays, but because he 
wanted to play Mark McLemore at shortstop Saturday and Anderson there today . . 
. Rader has yet to use the same lineup twice this season . . . Shortstop Dick 
Schofield, who won't come off the disabled list as scheduled Monday, won't take 
ground balls again until Tuesday or Wednesday.

MIKE PENNER: GARY GETS HIS CRACK AT BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland Gary, the Ram named after two cities, is now a man for two seasons. 
By fall, it's Anaheim and the NFL. By spring, at least on a trial basis, Gary 
is property of the Montreal Expos, beginning on the bottom rung of a ladder 
already ascended by Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
The question of the hour is why. 
</P>
<P>
Gary is closing in on his 24th birthday, making him honorary grandfather in the 
Expos' rookie-league training camp in Bradenton, Fla. He hasn't played the 
sport on a regular, competitive basis since 1984, when he started at third base 
for the South Fork (Fla.) High School varsity. And he had to play salesman 
before he could play ball, having to convince the Expos he was worthy of a 
tryout. 
</P>
<P>
A whim, one might call this. A lark. A pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Curt Warner doesn't play baseball, so maybe Gary knows what he's 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Gary is the Rams' tailback of the future, the Rams keep telling Gary. They made 
him the 26th pick of the 1989 NFL draft and they played him in eight games, 
watching him average 4.4 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
They said they liked what they saw and told Gary to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
Then they signed Warner, who also plays tailback and is 29. His future is now. 
And, at present, the Ram depth chart also lists two more tailbacks in Greg 
Bell, the incumbent 1,000-yard rusher, and Gaston Green, the 1988 first-round 
draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
In this backfield, things were getting mighty crowded. The Rams' tailbacks were 
to the wall. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
Road trip. 
</P>
<P>
In all probability, that's all this is. Cleveland Gary goes on spring break. A 
few weeks in Florida, just to get away from the traffic and congestion of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
He has already notified the Rams -- and, significantly, the Expos -- that he'll 
be back in Anaheim for next month's mini-camp and that his baseball season will 
end July 14, since the Rams' full camp begins July 15. 
</P>
<P>
But that still gives Gary and the Expos nearly three months together, enough 
time to determine if this 6-foot-1, 230-pound outfielder is more prospect than 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll play 45 games with Bradenton, which is basically our entry-level 
program," says Expo assistant general manager Dan Duquette. "That lasts until 
June 1. Then we'll send him to Jamestown in the New York-Penn League, where he 
will play about 30 games of Class-A ball. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, we should have a decent idea of where we're at. We'll see if he's 
shown some progress." 
</P>
<P>
Rookies come no rawer. Gary's first love always has been baseball, but the 
affair was interrupted by Jimmy Johnson, then Gary's football coach at the 
University of Miami, who forbade any of his players from participating in a 
second sport. 
</P>
<P>
Gary went on to win Orange Bowls for Johnson, but deep down, he wanted a crack 
at the College World Series too. For four years, the curiosity fermented -- to 
the point of Gary petitioning the Miami Miracles, an independent Class-A team, 
for a tryout once his college eligibility expired. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked out with the Miracles," Duquette said, "but they felt he lacked the 
experience it takes to compete in that league. The Florida State League has a 
lot of breaking-ball pitchers and, really, Cleveland hasn't seen that much live 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"So, he called us and asked for a job. Basically, Cleveland pursued us. He'd 
always wanted to try his skills on the baseball field, since he never could 
play baseball at Miami. We wanted to see him first, so we asked him to come 
down and try out." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend in Lantana, Fla., Gary auditioned in front of Duquette and the 
Expos' minor-league coaching staff. After three days, Duquette signed Gary to a 
Bradenton contract. 
</P>
<P>
"He has good speed and good power, the two main requisites to be a good 
outfielder in the major leagues," Duquette said. "He has good wrists, good 
strength. It's worth a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a project. That's why we sent him first to our extended minor league 
camp. Right now, he's getting an extended course in fundamentals. But he has a 
lot of desire and he's very coachable. He wants to develop." 
</P>
<P>
Gary isn't alone in his quest, grand illusion that it may be. Duquette said the 
night before he scouted Gary, he watched a game between Montreal's Class-A 
team, West Palm Beach, and the St. Lucie Mets. Among the hitters in St. Lucie's 
starting lineup: Minnesota Viking running back D.J. Dozier. 
</P>
<P>
"These football players are seeing how great athletes like Bo and Deion Sanders 
have succeeded in two sports," Duquette said. "They also see the longevity 
major league players have and they start comparing the financial rewards with 
that of football. 
</P>
<P>
"They see baseball as an attractive career and want to give it a try. That's 
what we're seeing with guys like Dozier and Cleveland Gary." 
</P>
<P>
So it's a long shot. Gary is used to them. 
</P>
<P>
On July 15, he will go from one to another, strapping on the horned helmet of a 
team that thinks it truly has a chance of keeping San Francisco out of the next 
Super Bowl.

ROBLES OVERTAKEN AT THE FINISH IN 1,600 METERS

Woodbridge High School's Amy Robles was looking forward to a nice stroll to the 
finish line of the 1,600-meter race during the Sundevil Invitational at Mt. 
Carmel High School Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Robles had been cruising along in first place from the outset, and along the 
back stretch of the final lap took a 15-meter lead. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Robles let that lead go to her head, but all of a sudden, some 
40 meters to the finish, Fallbrook freshman Milena Glusac kicked and began to 
overtake her. 
</P>
<P>
Glusac passed Robles and finished first at 5:17.48. Robles was second in 
5:18.32. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even hear her," Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was going so fast. She started her kick way before I started mine, and her 
kick was so much faster than my kick. There was no way I was going to catch 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Glusac originally was scratched from the race because she did not check in on 
time with the clerk of the course. However, after the Fallbrook coaches 
conferred with Dennis McClanahan, meet director, Glusac was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Robles was forced to run a race with which she was not all together 
comfortable. She would have preferred not setting the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could have gone faster if someone was out in front of me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robles was the only Woodbridge athlete to place in the top three of any event. 
She also placed fifth in the 800 meters at 2:24.03. Charity Stowell of Mt. 
Carmel finished first at 2:18.75. 
</P>
<P>
The top Orange County finisher in the meet was El Modena's Mike Terry, who 
placed second in the 400 to Dorsey's Lamont Warren (49.06) at 49.49. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, whose specialty is the 800, ran shorter distances in the Sundevil. He 
also placed sixth in the 200 at 22.85. Brian Jenkins of Lynwood won in 22.01. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena had one other second-place finisher -- Kristina Dahlberg -- in the 
3,200 meters. She finished at 11:47.03, behind Jenny Kemp's 11:40.06. Kemp is 
from San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's Mark Parlin placed third in both the shotput (53-6 1/2) and discus 
(166-10). Fallbrook's Brent Noon won both events (70-8 and 191-0).

BAYLOR, CROMWELL, TIMMONS AND CLEARY SET FOR INDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Baylor, Nolan Cromwell, Steve Timmons and Paul Cleary have been elected to 
the Orange County Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
They will be inducted July 19 at the Hall of Fame's 10th banquet at the 
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. Their induction will increase the Hall's 
membership to 48. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor, a coach with the Milwaukee Brewers, played for the Angels from 1977 
through 1982. He became the only Angel to win the American League's Most 
Valuable Player Award when in '79 he hit 34 home runs, had a team-record 139 
runs batted in, and led the Angels to the AL West title. 
</P>
<P>
Cromwell had an 11-year career (1977-87) as a defensive back with the Rams, 
with 778 tackles and 37 pass interceptions in 161 games. He was named four 
times to the Pro Bowl and was the NFC's Defensive Player of the Year in 1980. 
An All-American at Kansas, Cromwell lives in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons, who attended Newport Harbor High School and Orange Coast College 
before becoming a volleyball All-American at USC, was one of the key players on 
the U.S. Olympic team that won gold medals in 1984 and '88. He was the team's 
MVP in the '84 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary, elected to the National Football Foundation College Hall of Fame last 
year, was named Junior College Player of the Year in 1942. Cleary, an end, was 
co-captain at Santa Ana (now Rancho Santiago) College, the top-ranked team in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to USC, where he became a consensus All-American in 1947 and captain 
of the Trojans' 1948 Rose Bowl team. Cleary, now a businessman in Orange, later 
played for the New York Yankees in the old All-American Football Conference.

SON'S DEATH -- A SPECIAL ANGUISH; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLING: TEN YEARS AFTER OLYMPIC ASPIRANT PETER JENSEN DIED IN A MOTORCYCLE 
ACCIDENT, HIS FAMILY REMEMBERS -- AND GRIEVES. 
</P>

<P>
The couple had spent a day mingling with friends from another time, and 
bittersweet memories had flooded their minds. Now, they drove wearily homeward 
out of Camarillo and turned onto winding Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
They were returning last weekend from a cycling event, the Peter Jensen 
Memorial Race, named after former state cycling champion Niels Peter Jensen III 
of Simi Valley, who was killed 10 years ago at the age of 20 when his 
motorcycle collided with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles up Moorpark Road, amid the wildflowers and sagebrush and the bit 
of solitude that the area still offers, the couple were struck by the 
realization of exactly where they were. For the first time since the day that a 
world of unspeakable misery came crashing down on them, Niels and Jean Jensen 
were driving along the road where Peter -- their athletic, laughing, 
curly-haired son -- had died in one flashing instant. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither of us realized where we were until we had traveled a few miles on that 
road," Niels Jensen said. "Then it hit us. It was pretty spooky." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jensen excelled on a bicycle. He won dozens of races, including a state 
sprint championship in 1978, and was thought by some to have world-class 
potential. He turned down an invitation to race at the Olympic Training Center 
in Colorado Springs because he felt he wasn't ready. But he had, without much 
notice or fanfare, set a gigantic goal for himself: He would compete in the 
1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, when the best cyclists in the world gathered in Los Angeles in that 
summer of 1984, dozens of them rode in a warmup race, the first Peter Jensen 
Memorial Race. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted so badly to be with the Olympians that summer," said his father. "In 
a way, he was." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen brought a solid sense of humor into his world. Jean Jensen, sitting in 
the living room of the couple's home in Valencia, recalled the time a friend 
visiting from New Jersey insisted on seeing the graves of the Hollywood stars 
at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, then was shocked at how close the 
graves were. Peter had an explanation: 
</P>
<P>
"There's so many people here and things are so crowded and there's so little 
room left," he explained with much seriousness, "that they bury people upright, 
standing up. Saves space." 
</P>
<P>
The friend momentarily believed the young man's story, causing howling laughter 
moments later when she realized she had been fooled. 
</P>
<P>
The Jensens' younger daughter, Nancy, two years older than Peter, will always 
remember that sense of humor. Even when it was directed at her, she said, it 
was impossible not to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter always said I had fat feet," Nancy Jensen said. "He used to say to me, 
'Why don't you just forget the shoes and wear the boxes they came in?' " 
</P>
<P>
An older sister, Diane, said simply: "Peter spent a lot of time laughing." 
</P>
<P>
When a job beckoned Niels Jensen to North Carolina in 1979, his 19-year-old son 
opted to remain in Simi Valley where he would continue to race and train for a 
possible shot at the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
He visited his parents in Gastonia, N. C., early in 1980, staying for nearly a 
month. Then one night he hugged his parents and departed, heading west across 
the country in his car. 
</P>
<P>
When Jean Jensen returned home from work on July 8, a policeman was waiting at 
the door. Peter had been in an accident, he told her, handing her a Los Angeles 
telephone number to get more information. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Jensen bolted into the house and dialed the number, wondering how badly 
her son was hurt, wondering what had happened, wondering what hospital she was 
calling . . . 
</P>
<P>
"County morgue," said the voice on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember waking up that day," recalled Nancy Jensen, "and thinking, 'This is 
not going to be a good day.' I remember how strongly I felt it. It turned out 
to be worse than I ever could have imagined." 
</P>
<P>
Peter was headed to work that morning on his motorcycle. He was going to tell 
his boss that he was quitting, having accepted a job at a cycling store in Simi 
Valley. Halfway down Moorpark Road, he veered across the center stripe and 
slammed into an oncoming truck. 
</P>
<P>
"He died instantly," Jean Jensen said, an overpowering sadness in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
One month before his 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Some heartbreakers can be overcome as the years wash away the sadness. Divorce 
is usually in that category. Also the deaths of grandparents, after the 
realization that they had lived long and full lives. 
</P>
<P>
But for a parent, the death of a child has its own category. You don't come all 
the way back from that. Not in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Not ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Jensens have a close friend in New Jersey -- where they are from and where 
Peter was born -- who studies the world of psychics and spiritual mediums. 
Shortly after Peter's death, Jean Jensen got a call from the woman who said she 
received a message that day. 
</P>
<P>
The message, the woman said, was from Peter. And it was this: "Tell my mom I'm 
sorry. I was careless and I made a mistake. But I had a really good life. And 
tell her that I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
"This was something I never would have looked for, a message like this," said 
Jean. "It's just not me. But I know in my heart it was real. I know if there 
was any way Peter could have let us know that he is OK, he would do it. He was 
that kind of a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years. 
</P>
<P>
"You forget a lot," Jean said. "And the pain does get easier to bear. At first 
the grief is crushing and overwhelming. Then, it changes. It won't ever go 
away. It changes. 
</P>
<P>
"What I remember Peter for mostly was his thoughtfulness and his caring." 
</P>
<P>
In the days following his death, a friend wrote to the Jensens expressing her 
sorrow. In the letter she wrote this: "Peter had a gentle heart." 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, in the New Jersey cemetery where Peter Jensen is buried, a 
headstone with a picture of a bicycle racer chiseled in granite sits atop his 
grave. Below the picture are those same words: Peter had a gentle heart. 
</P>
<P>
Niels Jensen keeps the sorrow inside mostly. He smiles when he talks of his 
only son, of the boy he would pick up after school for a late round of golf, of 
the boy he spent countless hours with in greasy garages, fixing motorcycles and 
bicycles. Of the boy he gave his name to. 
</P>
<P>
But when he talks of the cemetery, the grief surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I went to the cemetery after the funeral, I saw the two 
headstones side by side," Niels Jensen said slowly. "Both of them said Niels 
Peter Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father and my son."

SUDDEN INJURY, SLOW HEALING JOLT GOLFER'S CAREER OFF COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: ENRICO MONTANO WAS EXPECTED TO BE CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS' MAINSTAY 
THIS YEAR. AN AUTO ACCIDENT HAS CHANGED ALL THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the split second when Enrico Montano decided to save a life, he may have 
sacrificed his golf career. 
</P>
<P>
Montano, known as "Mr. Clutch" on the Cal State Dominguez Hills golf team, has 
yet to swing a club for Coach John Johnson this season. Last December he 
swerved to avoid a small animal on a road in Bel Air, and his car hit a utility 
pole. A passenger was badly hurt, and Montano suffered torn cartilage and a 
severe sprain in his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
The elbow has been slow to heal, restricting Montano's swing. It has also been 
extremely painful for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran golf coach was counting on Montano, a junior, to be the team leader 
this year and shoot some of his patented sub-par rounds. Last year the 68 
Montano fired in a qualifying round of the NCAA Division II finals got the 
Toros into the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Montano then responded with a 72-hole total of 310, sparking Dominguez Hills to 
a 12th-place finish. Individually, he wound up 27th in a field of more than 350 
players. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this season, Johnson thought his team had enough experience 
to challenge for the national title. Only one player was gone from last year's 
team. But with Montano out, he said, "we went from a veteran team with him to a 
team of very inexperienced players without him." 
</P>
<P>
Montano was out for a cruise on a twisting road on a foggy night when the 
animal crossed in front of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"There were cars on the right. I couldn't turn that way, so I went left into a 
pole," he explained. "I was wearing a seat belt, and I still got banged up." 
</P>
<P>
The small car was totaled. Montano was hospitalized and released with his arm 
in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
A five-month layoff didn't help much. When he recently tried to hit a bucket of 
balls at a driving range for the first time since the accident, he felt some 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"This (comeback thing) should be interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, whose team has skidded after a good start, would like to have Montano 
back for the final two NCAA qualifying rounds later this month. However, he 
admitted, "I think that is unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Montano, whose specialty was booming tee shots, is equally glum about his 
chances. "I can't hit too many drivers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he knows better than to rush his return. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do play, I have to play well," he said. "Shooting an 80 or a 75 won't 
help anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Montano was caddying for his father, Henry, at the Rancho Park municipal course 
in West Los Angeles when he got seriously interested in golf. He took lessons 
from some of Southern California's best pros, including former UCLA Coach Ed 
Merrins. He joined the golf team at Beverly Hills High School, was a four-time 
letterman and was voted into the school's hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the game," Montano said. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, on a lark, he has tried to qualify for the Los Angeles Open. His best 
round was a 67 at Brookside in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Montano is a fiery competitor, according to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a team leader, not only from the standpoint of ability but from the 
standpoint of competition," the coach said. "The (NCAA) regional tournament 
wasn't the only time he came through for us." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson likes to tell a story about Montano. At last year's Southern California 
Intercollegiate at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Montano needed to birdie the 
par-five 18th hole to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit his (second shot) in the water (in front of the green) and had to take 
a drop (with a one-stroke penalty)," Johnson said. Lying three, "he took out a 
pitching wedge and chipped into the cup to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Montano is a much better player than his 78.9-stroke average last 
season would indicate, adding that he would score considerably lower if he ever 
regains his form. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will be all right," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Montano would like to think so too, but the nagging pain in his elbow reminds 
him to take it slow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of game where you have to put in a lot of time," he said. 
"Right now I can't do that. In this game, you have to know so many different 
shots. It's incredible. You have to put in hour after hour of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Montano said there has been one benefit to his layoff: He has had time to read 
books about golf and watch instructional videos. 
</P>
<P>
But will he be able to come back from his injury and reach his goal of playing 
on one of several amateur tours? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have as good a chance as anyone," Montano said. "I've proven to 
myself that I can shoot sub-par (golf). It's just a matter of the right day at 
the right time." 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that a return to his previous form won't come as suddenly 
as the split-second decision that got him into this situation in the first 
place.

4-HOMER GAME MAKES CULVER CITY CONTACT HITTER A BOMBER; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: TROY DUNLAP HAD NOT HIT A HOME RUN SINCE LITTLE LEAGUE UNTIL THE 
GAME WITH FAITH BAPTIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Culver City High School third baseman Troy Dunlap hit four home runs in 
one game on St. Patrick's Day to tie a CIF-Southern Section record, a lot of 
people were surprised, including Troy Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
"Till that day," he said, "I hadn't hit a home run since I played Little 
League. " 
</P>
<P>
Even then, he had only two homers, and one was in a practice game. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said that perhaps a little luck was involved in his recent power 
display. It came on March 17 -- St. Patrick's Day. "I had the luck of the Irish 
that day.". 
</P>
<P>
Playing an outclassed opponent may also have had something to do with the feat. 
The team he picked on, Faith Baptist in Canoga Park, has an enrollment of about 
200 boys and girls, compared to about 1,500 for Culver City High. Athletes at 
small schools have to spread themselves thin, competing in various sports. 
</P>
<P>
When Faith Baptist lost to Culver, 26-1, in the Redondo Beach High tournament, 
several of its players, including pitchers, had recently finished playing with 
the basketball team and hadn't practiced much baseball, said first-year Culver 
City Coach Bill Coates. So some of the five Faith Baptist pitchers who worked 
in the loss to Culver City that day were not in mid-season form. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said at first that Faith Baptist's pitching that day "wasn't as good as 
I've faced this season." Then he amended that estimate, saying, "Actually the 
pitching was about average." 
</P>
<P>
The fences at the Redondo tournament field may be shorter than some, said 
Coates, but at least three of Dunlap's round-trippers "would have been out of 
our park." 
</P>
<P>
So luck may have played a part in Dunlap's historic hitting output, but skill 
also seems to have been at work. Anyone who hits four homers in one day off any 
kind of pitching can't be just lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said that during the week before the Redondo tournament "I was hitting 
the ball hard, and that day I was hitting the ball hard." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed he was. He made only one out in five times at bat against Faith Baptist, 
and both Coates and Dunlap say the out -- a line drive speared by the left 
fielder with his glove above the fence -- was probably hit harder than his 
homers. In addition to his home runs, Dunlap batted in eight runs and walked 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
He was a .411 hitter last year, and this year he is leading his team at about 
.460. So he is no Troy-come-lately with a bat in his hand, even if he seems to 
have come late to hitting the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
He has not gone on a homer binge since his big day, but he has hit one other 
since then. His two-run fence-clearing blast late in the game gave Culver a 
come-from-behind, 5-4 victory over Notre Dame Sherman Oaks. And on another day, 
he smacked a two-run double off the right-field fence to give the Centaurs a 
1-0 win over Ocean League rival Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
He is probably hitting them longer because he is bigger and stronger than he 
was last year. He also may be hitting them harder because he has emerged from 
the shadow of two power hitters who graduated from Culver High last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap, a quarterback and defensive back on last year's Culver City football 
team, said Lou Lichtl pushed his players into doing more weight training after 
a losing season in 1988. As a consequence, he went from 160 pounds to 183, he 
said, and feels much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hit more than .400 last year, he did so while batting seventh in 
the order, behind the two heavy hitters, outfielder Todd Steverson, now playing 
for Arizona State, and first baseman Tim Mitchell, who signed with the Boston 
Red Sox organization. 
</P>
<P>
He probably was satisfied to leave the power hitting up to Steverson and 
Mitchell and just concentrate on making contact, something he did very well 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Steverson still has plenty of power. Recently he became only the ninth player 
in 16 years to hit a home run over the 30-foot-high center-field wall that is 
400 feet away from home plate at Arizona State's Packard Stadium in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said that he was moved to third base after the beginning of this season 
and that previously he had played mostly second base and a little bit in left 
field. He said that before this year, "I always characterized myself as a 
contact, line-drive hitter, but I felt that third base was more of a power 
position. I'm also batting third in the line-up, and I felt I had to get more 
RBIs." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap has not only worked on improving his hitting but is a strong believer in 
self-improvement in all areas of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He did not receive much notice from college and major league scouts last year, 
probably because they were more interested in looking over Steverson and 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
So on Sundays during the last football season he played in games between 
amateurs for the benefit of major league scouts. "I felt I got their attention 
because every time I came, I started." 
</P>
<P>
Last year he didn't receive many letters from colleges, so at the beginning of 
this year he wrote letters, each containing a resume and the Culver City 
baseball schedule, to 29 colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In his first attempt at taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test for entering 
college, he narrowly failed. So he took a class on preparing for the SAT, took 
the examination again recently and feels confident that he passed. 
</P>
<P>
Art Harris, who scouts for the Dodgers and was the coach of strong baseball 
programs at West Los Angeles College and Venice High School for years, said 
Dunlap works as hard in baseball as he does in other aspects of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids just practice," Harris said. "This is a kid who works hard in 
practice. If you're looking for improvement, that's how to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Has he improved enough to get drafted by a major league team this June? "The 
draft is somewhat of a gamble," Harris said. "All it takes is to get one 
organization to like him, but by the same token, there is no way to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's making normal progress. He's improved each year I've seen him and 
has a chance to get drafted." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Coates said Dunlap is capable of playing baseball either in college or 
the major leagues. "Troy is one of our quality athletes -- not only physically, 
but he is also a super person. I think he has the physical abilities, and he 
certainly is mentally into (baseball)."

OLDER IS BETTER; 
</P>
<P>
DIANA TRACY, 37, MOTHER OF 2, LEADS EL CAMINO DISTANCE RUNNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diana Tracy says being twice as old as most of her competitors isn't a problem. 
She has proven it by succeeding in both cross-country and track at El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
At 37, the 5-foot-5, 112-pound freshman is by far the Warriors' top distance 
runner. She was a star on the cross-country team in the fall, and this spring 
she's the Warriors' ace in the 3,000 and 5,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no hesitations about her age," said El Camino cross-country Coach Dean 
Lofgren, who is also an assistant track coach. "In 1987 and 1988 we had Mary 
Hazell, who was a 32-year-old mother of three, and she was a solid performer. 
We knew Diana would do well. We don't think her age is at all a limiting 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy says competing at a junior college simply feels like running with her 
20-year-old daughter, Lisa, a former cross-country runner at Mira Costa High 
who attends Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"People will say, 'How do you feel about running with the kids?' " Tracy said, 
smiling. "Well, I'll tell you: I feel like I'm with my daughter. It's like a 
big family." 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference, however. Tracy hardly acts like a mother around her 
teen-age competition. She's always out to win. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy is intense, dedicated and focused, despite a schedule that's probably 
twice as hectic as those of her fellow junior college runners. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone just sees her as an athlete," said Carla Swaim, a track and 
cross-country teammate of Tracy's. "Being married and having kids and all that 
stuff just makes it all more amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, a nursing major, is up at 5:30 every morning to study; then she feeds 
and bathes her 2-year-old daughter, Lindsay, before taking her to nursery 
school. 
</P>
<P>
After that, she goes to class all day, attends track practice in the afternoon, 
picks up her daughter from school, makes dinner and studies some more. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week she trains with Lindsay to avoid getting a baby-sitter. Tracy runs 
seven miles on The Strand in Hermosa Beach while pushing Lindsay in a baby 
jogger. 
</P>
<P>
"My life never stops," she said, sitting in the living room of her Hermosa 
Beach home. "I try to relax, but it's just not easy. Running . . . it's an 
addiction!" 
</P>
<P>
It has proven to be a positive addiction that turned her life around. Ten years 
ago, Tracy said, she was a completely different person -- a heavy smoker and 
drinker who occasionally jogged with an old boyfriend. She would run a couple 
of miles, and "as soon as I was done, I lit up and popped open a beer." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy married at 16 and had her first daughter a year later. Before her second 
marriage five years ago, Tracy lived with Lisa in a Hermosa Beach apartment 
near the house she lives in now. 
</P>
<P>
The time in between marriages, she said, was a wild period in which she did a 
lot of partying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not a healthy person," Tracy said, grinning. "I was such a disgusting 
smoker, my friends used to say: 'Diana, you smell like hell!' So I went to a 
clinic that guaranteed I'd stop for $600." 
</P>
<P>
That was nine years ago. The former Delta Airlines flight attendant said 
everything changed after she kicked her 13-year nicotine habit. 
</P>
<P>
Within four months, Tracy had intensified her workouts and finished two 
marathons, in Bakersfield and the Napa Valley. That launched her competitive 
running career, which includes several 10-kilometer race victories and a 
Redondo Beach 10-K baby-jogger division title. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that running was the only thing that gave me confidence," Tracy said. 
"The more I improve with running, the better I feel. I've never felt so good 
about myself." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy is so obsessed, she planned to run intensely up to the moment she went 
into labor with Lindsay. As it turned out, she had to stop five months into the 
pregnancy. But 10 days after giving birth, she went on a 3 1/2-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just driven," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
At El Camino, Tracy has been a sensation. She led the Warriors in every 
cross-country meet she entered after the first, in which she fainted toward the 
end of the three-mile Irvine course. 
</P>
<P>
She capped the season by leading El Camino with a third-place finish at the 
state cross-country meet in Fresno. She finished in 18:14, on the heels of San 
Diego City College's Donagh Bruni (18:08) and Sue Chek (18:11). 
</P>
<P>
Tracy was named the team's Most Valuable Player and received a large trophy 
that sits in her living room. 
</P>
<P>
"She has lots of ambition," Lofgren said. "She just has a lot of strive and 
initiative and a strong desire to succeed, to do well." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy credits Lofgren for her immediate success. "Dean is responsible for me 
doing so well," she said. "He always has new goals and he really motivates me. 
I wish he could run every race with me because I run so much better with him." 
</P>
<P>
Her solo act isn't bad either. Tracy has already qualified in both her events 
(5,000 and 3,000 meters) for the state track meet at Santa Barbara City College 
in May. Her 17:35.2 finish at the Bronco Invitational on March 17 broke a 
5,000-meter school record. That mark is also No. 1 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a stud," said Swaim, 20. "She's in a league all her own." 
</P>
<P>
Swaim was El Camino's cross-country star until Tracy came along a couple of 
meets into the season. Though she liked Tracy from the start, Swaim said it was 
difficult to see her No. 1 spot slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very likeable and we hit it off real well," Swaim said, "but at first it 
was frustrating because here I was working real hard and she just came in and 
did great. I learned from her that if you work hard, it pays off. She's 
definitely an example of that." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy says she'll continue running as long as her body holds up. She figures 
that will be a long time, even though she's much older than the competition.

I commend Edward Sorel's cover illustration of Feinstein. Like Feinstein's 
privileged background and personality, the illustration bears a striking 
resemblance to Leona Helmsley.

I can't tell you how infuriating it was to see the caricature of Feinstein on 
the cover. 
</P>
<P>
While San Francisco's former mayor may not be popular with some Southern 
Californians, that does not warrant such a display of contempt. 
</P>
<P>
Would you have dared to paint such an unflattering portrait of our two male 
gubernatorial candidates? I think not. Yet you chose to portray our one female 
contender in a pseudo-Leona Helmsley pose.

Regarding "Will Dianne Feinstein Play in Pacoima?" by Keith Love (Feb. 25): My 
father, who was a minister in San Francisco, died suddenly in 1979. He was 
prominent in the Bay Area, so there were politicians lining up to speak at his 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
My family did not want to see a three-ring circus, so we made it clear that no 
politicians would be allowed to speak or participate in the service. Although 
our wishes for the most part were respected, I can still remember seeing these 
elected officials standing conspicuously throughout the church. 
</P>
<P>
As my family and I sat waiting in the limousine after the services, a woman 
came to the car, leaned in, touched my mother's hand and spoke to her softly. 
She shared her experience of recently losing a husband. Even through 
tear-stained eyes I remember the look of true compassion and caring on Dianne 
Feinstein's face. We hadn't known until that moment that she was at the church. 
None of the other politicians even bothered to say anything to my mother. 
</P>
<P>
I could sleep easily at night knowing that there is a person in the governor's 
mansion who is not just a politician, but a real person.

TV GETS DOWN TO EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Global warming, deforestation, toxics, desertification, garbage overload, 
water pollution, ozone depletion." 
</P>
<P>
That's the alarming diagnosis for Mother Earth (played by Bette Midler) in "The 
Earth Day Special," a two-hour, all-star program scheduled to air next Sunday 
at 9 p.m. on ABC, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Among the myriad Earth Day documentary and entertainment specials airing in the 
next few weeks, this one is perhaps the most ambitious. Barbra Streisand, Meryl 
Streep, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Fonda, Robin Williams, Carl Sagan and Magic 
Johnson will participate, along with the casts of "The Cosby Show," "The Golden 
Girls," "Jeopardy!" and "Married . . . With Children," plus 300 extras and a 
high school marching band. 
</P>
<P>
The program, whose full title is "Time Warner Presents the Earth Day Special," 
will weave the performers into a narrative story in which Midler's Mother 
Earth, dressed in a spectacular gown of garbage designed by Robert Turturice, 
lies dying in a hospital in Anytown U.S.A. -- and it's up to the residents to 
save her. 
</P>
<P>
Armyan Bernstein, executive producer of the special with Richard Baskin and 
Paul Junger Witt, said he was inspired to create an environmental program when 
he and his girlfriend were watching news reports about hypodermic needles, 
vials of blood and other medical refuse washing up on East Coast beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend sat there and started to cry," Bernstein said. "I asked her what 
was wrong, and she said: 'I just feel so bad for the Earth.' So we decided to 
write a book called 'A Practical Guide to How You Can Begin to Help Save the 
Earth.' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead of writing the book, however, Bernstein decided to do a TV special: "We 
said: 'Let's talk to the whole world one night.' " Bernstein then teamed up 
with Baskin and Witt. Any profits from the show will be donated to the 
nonprofit People of the Earth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The three executive producers originally planned the special as a global 
simulcast, but found it would take three years to cut through the red tape 
involved in getting every station in the world to air one show at the same 
time. "The experts say we only have 10 years to save this planet," Baskin said. 
"We couldn't afford to burn three of those years on legal deals." 
</P>
<P>
The producers deliberately avoided imitating the "We Are the World" concert and 
other previous entertainment-meets-social-conscience events. "You cannot do 'We 
Are the World' better than they already did it," Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the best thing any show could accomplish would be to change people's 
consciences. If we just wanted to give information, we could write a book. But 
we thought people could get a better understanding from a story. That felt 
right to us." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said the producers decided to use celebrities only because they 
believe people will listen to them. "If they'd watch me, I'd do it," Bernstein 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
What they're asking, he said, is for people "to gather around the hearth -- the 
TV set is today's hearth -- and become part of an electronic town square 
meeting and contemplate where we are and where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody involved in this show has any pretensions that this show will save the 
Earth," he added. "You hope to empower people, so that they can make the 
difference. We don't own the Earth. We are of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
While ABC's star-studded program may be the most ballyhooed, it's not the only 
one to commemorate Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has two earth-related specials Friday. Peter Horton, model Elle Macpherson 
and Matt Biondi appear on "Dolphins, Whales and Us" at 8 p.m., with "Save the 
Planet," a late-night special, airing at 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Public television also has special programming this week and next, and will 
focus on environmental issues long after Earth Day is over. PBS' yearlong 
Operation Earth includes earth-related segments on series, locally produced 
programs on regional environmental problems, educational outreach to schools 
and community based activities. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up this week on PBS, "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" will offer ways to 
help children appreciate and conserve the environment, 11 a.m. Monday-Friday, 
KCET. 
</P>
<P>
"For Earth's Sake: The Life and Times of David Brower" profiles the 
environmentalist who founded the Friends of the Earth, 9 p.m. Monday, KCET and 
KPBS; 10 p.m. KVCR. 
</P>
<P>
Local stations are tuned into earthly matters as well. 
</P>
<P>
On KCBS, "Happy Earth Day 2 You" examines how global environmental issues and 
local efforts can come together, 9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 7 p.m., KNBC has Dennis Weaver hosting "Earth Day 1990: A User's 
Guide to Saving the Planet," a countdown of 50 actions every family can take to 
save the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-TV's "Project Earth," a three-hour special, will focus on how Southland 
residents can help the conservation movement, 3 p.m. next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cable television is involved as well. Here are some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
"Challenge of the Seas," a 26-part series on the role oceans play in the 
balance of ecology, debuts next Sunday on Arts &amp; Entertainment, 5 p.m. and 
9 p.m., with Ted Danson as host. 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Day Birthday" celebrates Earth Day with the help of Zwibble Dibbles, 
baby dinosaurs who want to save the planet from pollution, 9 a.m. next Sunday 
on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
"Attitudes" offers "How You Can Make the Earth a Better Place," 3 p.m. 
Monday-Thursday, Lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
MTV will highlight musical artists heavily involved in environmental causes 
between 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. next Sunday. MTV also will broadcast live 
reports from the Earth Day concert in Washington during that time period.

I am avid fan of the Academy Awards festivities and watch faithfully every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement and the glamour is always very intriguing. I thought the show 
run this year by Billy Crystal was very well done, except at the end, and that 
did it for me. When Diana Ross came out and sang the wonderful "Over the 
Rainbow," she ruined an otherwise terrific show. Why couldn't Judy Garland sing 
the song in the clip they were showing? Ross did nothing to enhance the song 
and had no business being there.

Three cheers to KTTV for showing "The Andy Griffith Show" twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
Fans like me tape the shows to keep. Unfortunately, the station must be 
desperate for commercial time. It edits the shows severely. The worst part is 
they don't show the end of the program. It's like listening to a wonderful joke 
with the punch line omitted.

As a fan of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," I discovered its March 24 program 
titled "The Offspring," by Rene Echeverra, to be a poignant fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The story in which Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) fathered and educated a child of 
his own creation with the hope that he could give something back to the 
Federation was done with a high degree of insight and joy. I do hope they bring 
back Data's daughter as this was an outstanding teleplay that should lead to 
another episode.

The telecast of "Why, Charlie Brown, Why?" was certainly television at its 
finest. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the usual frivolous and silly things for children, here was a 
half-hour of sensitivity and information done with the ever-popular Peanuts 
gang. Any family with a seriously ill child must be very grateful for this 
wonderful way to teach children, and all of us, not to shut out the sick. 
Congratulations to Charles M. Schulz, the CBS network, the sponsors and the 
medical advisers. We are all better for their caring efforts.

THE DRESSMAKER 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from a Beryl Bainbridge novel, beautifully acted, full of grimness and 
irony, this home-front British movie is set in Liverpool in 1944. It imprisons 
us in one of those terrible claustrophobic households we get in plays by Harold 
Pinter or Tennessee Williams: veined with dark secrets, buried hatreds and 
fears, where propriety battles sexuality and both lose. It's a bleak view made 
exhilarating by the acting, especially by Joan Plowright and Billie Whitelaw as 
very different sisters engaged in a moral war over their niece (Jane Horrocks).

Disney's beloved 1964 live-action/animation fantasy Mary Poppins returns on 
KNBC on Sunday at 7 p.m. Julie Andrews, of course, has the title role as the 
"practically perfect" nanny hired by the Banks family of Edwardian London. 
</P>
<P>
The Living Daylights (KABC, Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) introduced in 1987 a new James 
Bond, Timothy Dalton, who is splendid-provided you can put Sean Connery out of 
your mind-but after a quarter of a century of 007, it's pretty much the same as 
before, except for less casual sex in this AIDS era. 
</P>
<P>
Top Secret! (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) tries to send up-and update-the World 
War II spy adventure, a rather antiquated target. There's a nonstop barrage of 
gags, many inspired and hilarious in themselves but scattershot in effect. 
Dynamic Val Kilmer stars as an American rock 'n' roller who's a last-minute 
substitute for Leonard Bernstein at an East German cultural festival-and who 
winds up trying to help an imprisoned scientist escape to the West, along with 
his pretty daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzan, the Ape Man (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.), the delirious 1981 Bo and John 
Derek version,should've been called "Me, Jane." Silly, tedious and soft-pornish 
-- but surely tamed for TV -- Bo's virginal Jane invades West Africa alone in 
search of her great white hunter father (Richard Harris) and winds up saved 
from a lion by an equally virginal Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe). 
</P>
<P>
In Endangered Species (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's taut 1982 
political thriller, the cattle near a small Colorado town begin to be 
decimated, their carcasses peculiarly mutilated while their internal organs 
seem to have evaporated. The plot proves to be timely and chilling, but its 
unraveling is less than inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Two vintage adventures also air Friday: Robert Aldrich's 1954 Western Vera Cruz 
(KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.), with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and Michael 
Curtiz's classic 1938 The Adventures of Robin Hood (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.), 
with Errol Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1982 I Ought to Be in Pictures (KTLA, Saturday at 6 p.m.), Neil Simon 
wrote two of his most believable characters-a burnt-out screenwriter and his 
girlfriend, a studio hairdresser-and under Herbert Ross' direction, Walter 
Matthau and Ann-Margret are wonderful. Unfortunately, Matthau's obnoxious 
teen-age daughter (Dinah Manoff) turns up to become the film's center of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ian McShane stars in the 1989 Dick Francis mystery, In the Frame (KCOP, 
Saturday at 8 p.m.). 
</P>
</TEXT>

<P>
Photo, The late John Cassavetes' 1980 comedy "Gloria" (KCOP, at 8 p.m.) was his 
most accessible, likeable movie, in which the radiant Gena Rowlands plays a 
retired gun moll on the run with both a priceless underworld ledger -- and an 
unwanted but beguiling 6-year-old (John Adames.).

SERIES 
</P>
<P>
Jane Curtin will headline her own NBC sitcom, "The Jane Curtin Show," for the 
September television season, according to an NBC source. The show will explore 
the evolution of a romance between two divorced parents in the pressure-cooker 
of life in the '90s. Curtin was last seen on CBS' "Kate &amp; Allie." 
</P>
<P>
USA Network has acquired broadcast rights to 201 episodes of "Scooby-Doo," the 
popular children's animated series from Hanna-Barbera, starring a mumbling 
Great Dane. The series, which premiered in 1969, has been hailed as the 
longest-running animated series in television history. USA will air the 
cartoons on weekdays and Sunday, beginning September. 
</P>
<P>
MINISERIES 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Collins, the author of "Hollywood Wives," has written the screen 
adaptation of her best-selling novels "Chances" and "Lucky," combining them 
into a three-part, six-hour saga for NBC. The story is about the life of 
gangster Gino Santangelo and his strong-willed daughter Lucky. Production for 
the miniseries is getting under way now for broadcast in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Kerns from "Growing Pains" will star as a young seismologist who finds 
herself at odds with a city and her family when she comes to believe that a 
cataclysmic earthquake will strike Los Angeles within 10 days in "The Great Los 
Angeles Earthquake." In the four-hour NBC miniseries, scheduled to air in 
1990-91, the city's leaders fail to take action, Los Angeles is reduced to 
rubble and its population is decimated. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, creators of "thirtysomething," are the 
executive producers of the NBC movie "Home Video," a drama about a 15-year-old 
boy who, devastated by the accidental death of his mother, tries to make sense 
of his life by reviewing his childhood through home videos. The task brings him 
to the realization that his mother may have committed suicide. The movie, 
written by Herskovitz from a story he created with Zwick, is scheduled for the 
1990-91 season.

THE STATE OF THE SPOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Thornburg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designers are rethinking the traditional look of knife, fork and spoon. New 
cutlery pieces range from sleekly sculptural to playful: spoons shaped like 
colored fish with checkerboard tails, and knives like sinuously curving bars of 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
High-priced styles are still fashioned of traditional silver and gold, but less 
expensive cutlery is now made of aluminum, brass, wrought iron and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Many of today's cutlery designers come from a fashion or jewelry background and 
describe their flatware as "functional sculpture." Izabel Lam, who creates 
undulating bronze and silver cutlery, apprenticed with fashion designers 
Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein. "A knife and fork must fit snugly into the 
hand. It's just like designing clothes -- they both must fit the moving body," 
she explains. 
</P>
<P>
But what about washing these miniature sculptures? Kirsten Hawthorne, a painter 
and photographer turned flatware artist, swears that her utensils of sterling, 
gold plate and sandblasted plexiglass are dishwasher-safe. But some of these 
avant-garde creations cost up to $110 apiece; it may be prudent to wash this 
new cutlery the old-fashioned way.

Thank you for exposing the Feinstein mystique. 
</P>
<P>
The facts, as the article pointed out, are that Dianne loves to portray 
working-class ethics only when she can benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she blames others for her lackluster showing. 
</P>
<P>
Her golf picture says it all. There's Dianne using a one iron on a putting 
green, wearing shoes that are so new they are not even bent in the toes. 
</P>
<P>
When Feinstein says it's not easy to break into Southern California politics, 
it reminds me of something my grandmother used to say: You can only gain the 
respect of others when you have learned to work as hard as they do.

I think Feinstein has sufficient political experience, progressive and 
pragmatic policies, mental toughness, charisma, candidness and sensitivity to 
impress and win over Southern California voters. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a nice change of pace to have a woman in the governor's office, 
which up to now has been an exclusive all-males' club. 
</P>
<P>
Some criticize Feinstein because she has high-class tastes. But what's wrong 
with a governor who is sophisticated and has a degree of culture, especially 
since it doesn't prevent her from identifying with and helping minority groups?

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I anxiously awaited your magazine each Sunday during the month of February, 
I grew increasingly disappointed. For alas, your magazine decided to ignore 
Black History Month entirely except for an article on Malcolm X and another on 
black haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, during this Black History Month we had the joy and privilege of 
seeing Nelson Mandela released from prison after 27 years. This wondrous event 
couldn't even merit a cover. 
</P>
<P>
The usually provocative and thoughtful Los Angeles Times Magazine instead chose 
to hail the fabulous '50s ("When We Were Very Young," by Charles Perry, and 
"Mid-Century Memoirs," by Karen Lansky), which most people know were not so 
fabulous for many African-Americans. My disappointment changed to disgust when 
I read the hedonistic article on plastic surgery aimed at white, middle- and 
not-so-middle-aged, vain, professional men. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the magazine can once again find its former social consciousness -- and 
quick.

<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few occasions in theater are more frustrating than going to a musical by 
Stephen Sondheim, the most extraordinary composer to have ever written American 
musical drama. His music is accessible upon first hearing, but his lyrics-the 
most complicated and devilishly clever lyrics in musical theater-are impossible 
to catch whole during one performance. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal way to see a Sondheim musical is to study, in advance, the 
intricacies and wizardry of the words. And the best way to do that is to listen 
intently to the original Broadway cast recording and study the libretto. 
</P>
<P>
When digital audio compact discs arrived five years ago, it appeared that 
Sondheim and CDs were as perfect a marriage of art and technology as one could 
imagine. And now comes the laser videodisc to show us how video, when combined 
with digital audio, can, in many ways, make the Sondheim experience at home 
even more exciting and rewarding than in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
No other lyricist today writes such precise and complicated words. The clear CD 
sound makes it possible to catch every syllable, every nuance. This adds to the 
listener's comprehension of Sondheim's complicated score. 
</P>
<P>
But when you add video's capacity to focus in on characters offering key 
verses, to show you the staging in detail, to give you the ability to replay 
complicated passages, you have an experience superior to watching a Sondheim 
musical unfold on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
No other composer uses silence as powerfully as Sondheim. The silent surfaces 
of the CD enable his music to affect the ear the way the artist Georges 
Seurat's dots of paint affect the eye. 
</P>
<P>
It is Seurat's painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte," 
which inspired Sondheim's Pulitzer Prize-winning triumph, "Sunday in the Park 
With George." A laser videodisc with digital sound presents an accurate sonic 
and video picture of that musical (Image Entertainment laser videodisc, 147 
minutes, under $35; a vastly inferior videotape is available from Media Home 
Entertainment). CDs have given us a standard of sound thth video analog sound 
simply cannot match. The laserdisc offers digital sound as crisp and clear as 
the "CA Red Seal CD version of this same production. 
</P>
<P>
Mandy Patinkin as Seurat, and in Act II as Seurat's great-grandson, and 
Bernadette Peters as his model-mistress, Dot, and in Act II, the daughter, 
Marie, do what Sondheim asks: They enunciate every syllable and sing with 
passion and concern. Peters has become the perfect Sondheim heroine-she sings 
with a clarity that makes it possible for an audience to unddrstand the word, 
as well as the action. Patinkin is a marvel-his voice ranges all over (from 
bass to falsetto), and he brings both Georges to life in an unforgettable 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The sound is better than the video. The direction is mediocre-it does a prosaic 
job of capturing the action but ignores the sweep of the drama and often goes 
in for a close-up when the knowing viewer wants to see what else is happening 
on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Sondheim's greatest work, "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" is s 
guably the finest musical written for the American stage. Unlike Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's much-ballyhooed and vastly inferior "The Phantom of the Opera," 
"Sweeney Todd" is, in the truest sense, an opera in the worthy tradition of the 
masters. Everything is brilliantly staged to music, and the arias are as 
powerful and as moving as anything in opera history. "Sweeney Todd" is to 
"Phantom" what Fred Astaire is to "Dirty Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the complete opera is available on "KO Home Video tape or Image 
Entertainment laserdisc. Unhappily, it is not yet available on laser videodisc. 
Although the original videotape on which the home edition is based has 
excellent detail and sound, the home copies are poor replicas, with fuzzy 
picture and low buzzing sound. 
</P>
<P>
Still, nothing can dim the performances of George Hearn as the barber and 
Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett. The sweep of the drama and the sharp wit of the 
lyrics carry the day. 
</P>
<P>
A prosaic documentary-type account of Broadway's tribute to "Follies," staged 
in 1985 by Sondheim expert Thomas Z. Shepard, is also available (Fries 
Entertainment videotape and Image Entertainment laserdisc). 
</P>
<P>
"Follies in Concert," the video, seen on cable and public television, is a 
truncated record that includes some of the great names of musical theater: Lee 
Remick, Carol Burnett, Licia Albanese, Erie Mills, Liliane Montevecchi, Andre 
Gregory, Barbara Cook, Phyllis Newman, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Elaine 
Stritch, Daisy Prince, Hearn, Howard McGillin, Patinkin and others. 
</P>
<P>
The audio CD version includes full accounts of all 22 numbers, ones that stay 
in the memory. This video, muddy with analog sound, doesn't compete well. Since 
it is a concert version, the pictures don't add much to the performances, and 
the documentary portions, while revealing, are more annoying than illuminating. 
The video becomes more of a companion piece to the CD than a work in its own 
right. Still, some of "Follies" is better than none.

IF YOU'VE NEVER ad back trouble, you probably haven't heard of Obus Forme. Obus 
is an acronym for orthopedic brace upright support -- a lightweight portable 
brace that fits into a chair, auto seat or bed. Its patented shape provides 
rigid yet comfortable support to hold the back muscles and spine at rest, which 
regular chairs do not do; even chairs contoured to fit the spine permit 
sideways slippage. The brace was invented by industrial designer Frank Roberts, 
who had wearied of the cumbersome plaster body cast prescribed by his doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Since its introduction in 1980, more than 1 million Obus Formes have been sold 
to those suffering from herniated discs, osteoarthritis and swayback due to bad 
posture, pregnancy or overweight, as well as to wheelchair users. Indeed, many 
insurance plans recognize Obus Forme's therapeutic effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it seemed a chore to schlep the Obus Forme from chair to chair. So it 
was only a matter of time before some bright manufacturer united his seat and 
frame with the Obus Forme back. That producer, Global Upholstery, is a major 
supplier of ergonomic office chairs. With their movable backrests and 
five-branch swivel bases, ergonomic chairs resemble steno chairs but are more 
expensive and have a broader range of adjustments. These include a gently 
rounded "waterfall" edge at the front of the seat to promote blood circulation 
in the thighs, a gas spring cylinder to raise seat height with the flick of a 
switch, and tilt-angle and spring-tension adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Use of an ergonomic chair ($425 to $550) is hardly limited to the office; if 
you spend a few hours a day in front of a home computer, or reading or sewing, 
you probably could use one at home too. The Obus Forme's contoured back 
prevents slouching while sitting, a major cause of fatigue and lower-back pain. 
The armrests, which look stingily short to the casual viewer, support the 
elbows without getting in the way of the computer keyboard -- a big plus for 
those who pamper their wrists by lowering the keyboard to knee height. It all 
adds up to just one more reason to work at home and skip the freeway war games. 
</P>
<P>
 The ergonomic chairs are available at Alan Desk Business Interiors, 8575 
Washington Blvd., Culver City, (213) 655-6655; at Dozar Office Furnishings, 
2656 S. Western Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 732-6173; and at American Office 
Products, 501 Broadway, Santa Monica, (213) 393-2701.DAVID LASKER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the tale's told here, Bill Gilbreth was walking through a wheat field near 
Abilene Christian University last winter when he first heard The Voice. 
</P>
<P>
 If you build it, he will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbreth looked over the sea of gold and envisioned a baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Not sure if he had just gone 'round the bend, Gilbreth figured he had just 
landed on a movie set in an Iowa cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like 'Field of Dreams,' " Gilbreth said. "The only thing missing 
was Shoeless Joe." 
</P>
<P>
That's not all that was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball hasn't been part of this college campus for 11 years, and Gilbreth 
wanted to bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
He started his pitching career at Abilene Christian 25 years ago, developing a 
fastball that landed him stints with the Angels and the Detroit Tigers in the 
early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilbreth, a 42-year-old accountant and father of two, was ready to give up 
on his dream. Fund-raising efforts hadn't produced enough money for a ballpark, 
which the college wanted to build on the wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
By January, Gilbreth was distraught. In a last-ditch effort, he and Abilene 
Christian vice president Gary McCaleb, also a former player, flew to Alvin, 
Tex., to find help. 
</P>
<P>
They went to find Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth's dream started in 1988. He and a group of former Abilene Christian 
players began raising money for the Division II baseball program, which folded 
in 1979 because of cuts in the men's athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expanding our women's programs," McCaleb said. "It wasn't an 
anti-baseball decision, it was just a budgetary decision." 
</P>
<P>
McCaleb and Gilbreth knew the project wouldn't be easy. They needed a new 
stadium because the university tore down the old one three years ago to build a 
biblical studies center. They knew of at least 100 men interested in playing, 
but had no uniforms or scholarships to offer. After 1 1/2 years of fund raising 
produced little more than complaints from alumni, Gilbreth was getting 
frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who played with me had a lot of hard feelings about the way things 
were done (in 1979) and wouldn't contribute," Gilbreth said. 
</P>
<P>
So Gilbreth contacted Ryan, who invited Gilbreth and McCaleb to lunch. They 
spent the next few hours talking everything from fastballs to fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, an Angel teammate of Gilbreth's in 1974, listened to him describe the 
school's fund-raising woes. By the time they finished dessert, Ryan had come up 
with a plan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish the Nolan Ryan Fund for Baseball at Abilene Christian University. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promote a $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner honoring Ryan's record-breaking 
career. The dinner is scheduled for April 23 in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 43, knows all about struggling college baseball teams. He established a 
scholarship fund at Alvin Community College 10 years ago, and is active in the 
school's baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed watching that program grow over the years," Ryan said. "It's 
rewarding to see a new program at Abilene start out. I've known Billy for a 
long time and I wanted to help him out." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers mailed banquet applications to season-ticket holders. Local 
sponsors underwrote the cost of the dinner so all proceeds will go to the 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 620 people have made reservations, a profit of $62,000. The expected 
sellout will provide $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the dinner was set, the university announced it had hired a coach 
-- Gilbreth. He began April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"When they announced the dinner, almost immediately things went crazy," 
Gilbreth said. "I had no intention of coaching. I just wanted to put (Nolan) 
together with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from zero dollars to this. Nolan is a special person. He was very open 
to us and gave us all kinds of ideas about fund raising." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's philosophy was simple. 
</P>
<P>
"To get something like this going, you have to get people involved," Ryan said. 
"The more interest you can stimulate in a baseball program, the better off it 
is. But that's not always an easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
One of Ryan's ideas was to auction baseball memorabilia before the dinner, with 
all proceeds going to the team. 
</P>
<P>
Autographed bats, balls and jerseys have arrived from stars such as Mickey 
Mantle, Ted Williams and Hank Aaron. Ryan encouraged several of the players to 
donate the items. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan asked me what I thought all this was worth," Gilbreth said. "I think 
it's worth a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner and the auction should provide enough money to clear the wheat field 
and lay down the grass surface, Gilbreth said. Grandstands, lights and a press 
box will have to wait until next year, when the program becomes part of the 
athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Ranger groundskeeper Jim Anglea, Gilbreth started marking the 
field with stakes. After the wheat is harvested, construction will begin. The 
field should be ready by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We want quality, not extravagance," McCaleb said. "It's going to be done well. 
It will depend on the funds. The sooner the money comes along, the sooner the 
field's done." 
</P>
<P>
Without Ryan's help, Gilbreth said the field wouldn't be finished for at least 
two or three years, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Ryan) that he doesn't realize how happy he has made a bunch of college 
students," Gilbreth said. "Maybe we can bring out the talent in some kid, and 
he will have a chance to do what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth didn't play baseball at Abilene High School. The school didn't field a 
team, so he pitched in summer youth leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great fastball," McCaleb said. "He was a senior in high school when I 
was a senior at ACU. Our coach had him come out and throw batting practice to 
us one day. He threw hard." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth, a left-hander, threw even harder after he graduated from Abilene High 
in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
At Abilene Christian, he was a four-year letterman and as a junior led the NCAA 
in strikeouts with 134, an average of 13 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth was picked by Detroit in the third round of the 1969 draft, the 67th 
player taken overall. After a stint in the minors, he became the only Abilene 
Christian player to reach the majors when the Tigers promoted him in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Gilbreth had become a celebrity in Abilene, a city of 110,000 
located 150 miles west of Dallas. Abilene Christian's athletic reputation is in 
track and field, producing stars such as Olympic sprinter Bobby Morrow, 
Gilbreth's neighbor, and Billy Olson, a world-class pole vaulter. 
</P>
<P>
"My story's like a fairy tale," Gilbreth said. "I told some of our (ACU) kids 
that I'm living proof that you don't have to go to a big school to get drafted. 
If you're good, you will be drafted. The scouts will find you, no matter where 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth spent his first days in the majors watching from the bullpen. Then, as 
he was dressing for a game against Cleveland, Manager Billy Martin tossed him a 
ball and said, "You're starting, kid." 
</P>
<P>
"I called my wife (Phyllis) and said, 'I'm fixin' to start and you better turn 
on the radio quick because I don't know how long I'm going to be in there,' " 
Gilbreth said. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis listened to the entire game. Her husband pitched a five-hitter for a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just living in a tree," Gilbreth said. "Everything was going right." 
</P>
<P>
In his next game, Gilbreth pitched a three-hitter against the Yankees. He was 
2-0 and his earned-run average was below one. 
</P>
<P>
His success didn't last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing an inning of relief against Washington, Gilbreth missed his next 
few starts. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was juggling his pitching rotation, which included Joe Niekro and Mickey 
Lolich. Gilbreth was bumped to the bullpen, and by the end of the season, he 
was back in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I got totally frustrated," Gilbreth said. "I started against Kansas City and 
got shelled. I didn't pitch for two weeks and when I came back, I struggled 
with my control. I had no idea where it was going." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth was back in form during spring training the next season, throwing six 
innings of one-hit ball against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Then a stomach virus drained him for a month. He lost 25 pounds and returned to 
the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no luck whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing burnout as a reason, Gilbreth quit baseball in 1973 and returned to 
Abilene. He got a job raising funds for the university. 
</P>
<P>
That lasted a year. 
</P>
<P>
He rejoined the majors in 1974, when the Angels bought his contract from the 
Tigers. In his only season with the Angels, Gilbreth appeared in three games, 
pitched 1 1/3 innings, gave up two hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
He ended his final season in the major leagues with a 13.50 ERA, no decisions 
and no strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
With the Angels, Gilbreth met another young fastball pitcher from Texas. They 
were the same age and shared mutual acquaintances. He and Nolan Ryan became 
instant friends. 
</P>
<P>
"The neat thing about it was he was just becoming a superstar and I was just 
becoming," Gilbreth said. "He treated me just like part of his family, and that 
told me something about him." 
</P>
<P>
While Ryan's career blossomed, Gilbreth had things other than baseball on his 
mind. Within a year, his mother was paralyzed with a broken neck, his 
grandmother suffered a stroke and his father underwent eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
So, at 27, Gilbreth left baseball again. But this time it was for his family 
rather than himself. 
</P>
<P>
"They took care of me a long time," he said of his parents. "I had to go take 
care of them. Besides, when your parents are sick, you lose all interest in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth never played pro baseball again. He spent the next 10 years taking 
care of his parents and raising his own family. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he wonders how Gilbreth would have done if he had stayed in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"His family situation certainly played a role in his career," Ryan said. "But, 
as an individual, you have to do what's in your best interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he would have been a successful pitcher if he had stayed in baseball, 
but that's not always what's best for everyone. If he would have continued, he 
would have had a lot of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Gilbreth began helping pitchers at Cooper High School in 
Abilene. He taught them form, new pitches. The school won state 5-A titles in 
1986 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
"After that. I was more or less the volunteer pitching coach," Gilbreth said. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is again part of Gilbreth's life. His playing experience made him a 
logical choice for the Abilene Christian job, McCaleb said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill's developed a reputation in the area as being someone who knows 
baseball," McCaleb said. "He has a great grasp of mechanics and fundamentals. 
For years people have been saying that he needs to get into coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The school made a good choice with Bill," Ryan said. "He has always worked 
well with kids and he keeps them interested." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a little bit about baseball," he said, "but I have a lot to learn about 
being a coach and recruiter. But when you work with guys like Billy Martin, you 
don't have to be too smart to have some of that (managing skill) rub off on 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth laughs when asked about The Voice. The folks in Abilene sometimes 
stretch stories a little, and Gilbreth enjoys telling this one. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have heard some of the alumni standing behind me saying, 'If you build 
it. . . . ' " he said. "But Shoeless Joe didn't come." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gilbreth hadn't seen "Field of Dreams" until a few months ago. His 
daughters, Tiffanie and Melanie, rented the video and insisted he watch it. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbreth smiled at the opening, when actor Kevin Costner first heard The Voice. 
</P>
<P>
But he turned a bit misty eyed at the end, when Costner played catch with his 
father on the field he had built. Gilbreth's father, W.P., died in November. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me remember my dad, when he used to come home dog-tired after work and 
I wanted to play catch," Gilbreth said. "He took me out there and taught me all 
he knew about pitching, even though he never played himself. That's how this 
all started, me and my dad playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
"All the connections came together when I saw that scene. That's the connection 
to why we're building this field."

RIBBS IS DRIVEN TO REACH GOAL OF COMPETING IN AN INDY 500; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: BLACK DRIVER WILL TAKE FIRST STEP WHEN HE DRIVES IN LONG BEACH 
RACE. HE ALSO WILL BE MAKING HISTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Willy T. Ribbs is not going to the Indianapolis 500 this year -- except perhaps 
as a spectator -- but he says that it's only a matter of time, and getting the 
right equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The way Ribbs looks at it, when he takes the green flag on Sunday in the Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach, the Indy car race through the streets of that seaside 
community, it will have the same significance for blacks in auto racing that 
Jackie Robinson had for baseball players when he made his first major league 
appearance on April 15, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"Auto racing history will be made in Long Beach," Ribbs said. "I don't know 
where Jackie Robinson made his debut (Ebbets Field in Brooklyn), but I'll be 
making mine in Long Beach. I will finally be making it to the big leagues. I 
think I've earned it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully aware of the implications of being the first black in Indy cars, but 
that's not what it's all about. I'm going in with the same attitude Jackie 
Robinson had, and that's to be a winner. It doesn't matter if I'm black, white 
or purple, the object is to win." 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs, 34, will drive a year-old, Judd-powered Lola, No. 25, for the 
Raynor-Cosby Racing Team in Long Beach. The only other serious black Indy-car 
candidate since the sport evolved in 1909 was Benny Scott of Long Beach, who 
had hoped to use the L&amp;M Continental series as a springboard to Indy in 
1973 but never made it after his under-financed team quit. 
</P>
<P>
"Indy will come later, when we get the kind of a car we need to be 
competitive," Ribbs said. "The team only has an '89 chassis and on an oval, 
with the new rules, it doesn't cut it against the new '90 models. On a road 
course, or a street course like Long Beach, the difference is not as 
pronounced." 
</P>
<P>
The highest finishing year-old Lola in Sunday's Indy car opener at Phoenix was 
10th. It was driven by rookie Scott Goodyear of Canada. The first six finishers 
were 1990 cars, all powered by Chevrolet engines. 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs tested nearly for 1,000 miles on the one-mile oval at Phoenix before he 
and team manager Kim Green decided to skip oval races this season and 
concentrate on the 11 road races on the Championship Auto Racing Teams 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer we ran, the more we found we couldn't be ready in our older car," 
Ribbs said. "When Bill Cosby and the Raynor team made the announcement last 
November that we were going to Indy, we all felt that we would have a 1990 Lola 
to work with, but it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
With Cosby, TV's highest-rated personality, coming aboard as a part-owner, it 
was assumed that sponsors would scramble to sign up with the Raynor team. 
Especially when word leaked out that Cosby would throw in a commercial -- 
rumored to be worth in the neighborhood of $1 million -- for the sponsor-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, no sponsor has been found, and the lack of one has caused 
Raynor to postpone its order of a new chassis, which costs about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We did expect the Cosby name to be magic," Green said. "But we got started too 
late in the year for major corporations to juggle their budgets to accommodate 
us. To properly plan for the future, we need a multi-year program, and that 
means 1991 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment, we're a good team, but we're small and we can't do the 
development work the richer teams can. The difference in first place and 10th 
place today might only be less than a second, but measured in money, it can be 
in the millions." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for a tight, street course such as Long Beach's 1.67-mile, 11-turn 
seaside circuit is difficult because the track will not be open until shortly 
before practice early Friday morning. Ribbs did his preparation at West Palm 
Beach, Fla., on a fairgrounds track where the International Motor Sports Assn. 
holds sports car races. 
</P>
<P>
"We put in three days at West Palm and came away quite satisfied with our 
progress," Ribbs said. "The most important thing in preparing for a street race 
is compromising the car, getting it so it will respond quickly -- without 
sliding up against a wall -- and turn equally well in both directions." 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs has done his homework on road courses for 14 years since he earned a 
racing license at the Jim Russell school at Willow Springs Raceway. He has 
raced and won in Formula Ford, Formula Atlantic, Trans-AM, IMSA GTO and IMSA 
prototypes, but at Long Beach he will be racing a 750-horsepower Indy car for 
the first time. Already, he is impressed with the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But Ribbs, remembering a practice at Phoenix last month, is still learning to 
handle the car. 
</P>
<P>
"We were testing a softer spring combination and we went too soft and the car 
bottomed out on the pavement," he said. "That sent it into a spin in the middle 
of the second turn. It hit on the left side and it wouldn't have been so bad, 
but it put a hole in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the first time (to hit a wall), and it won't be the last." 
</P>
<P>
This is actually the second time that Ribbs, a flamboyant second-generation 
driver from San Jose -- his father, Bunny, was active in Sports Car Club of 
America races on the West Coast -- has been at the center of an Indy-car 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, heavily sponsored by Miller beer and promoted by boxing's Don King, 
Ribbs went to Indianapolis with a car owned by Sherman Armstrong. With no prior 
practice, Ribbs was thrown into the rookie orientation program and, after about 
50 laps and a top speed of 172.215 m.p.h., he climbed out of the car and 
announced that he would not continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was no good, but that was only part of it," Ribbs said. "The car 
wasn't as bad as the people involved with it. The whole thing was a disaster 
from the word go. It was one of the smarter decisions I've made to walk away 
from the whole deal." 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs heard the not-so-veiled criticism from the old-timers at the Speedway, 
who said that the concrete walls and the speed had thrown fear into the young 
black man's heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them say what they want, it was just a question of making a professional 
decision," Ribbs said. "I've never let my emotions control a decision in my 
racing career. If I'd been all emotional about getting to Indy, I'd have stayed 
around and struggled, but that was not the way to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Arie Luyendyk had driven the car for Provimi Veal and didn't like it, so they 
sold it to Armstrong. Jim Trueman, who helped me more than anyone else when I 
was getting started, warned me that it was a Mickey Mouse deal but I thought 
with Don King aboard, it would turn into something. I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"After I walked away from it, Armstrong closed his garage and left. He knew no 
one could make it run." 
</P>
<P>
This year's decision to skip Indy bears no relation to the earlier 
disappointment, Ribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a new 1990 car, like most of our competitors have, we would have 
been at Phoenix and we would be going to Indianapolis. But we don't, so we want 
to do the best with what we have and that means concentrating on road-course 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raynor team, Kim Green, the team manager, and the entire crew, all the 
engineers, everyone, have been great to work with. I think the future with them 
is great." 
</P>
<P>
Green, an Australian who came to the United States in 1981 to work with his 
brother Barry on the Paul Newman Can-Am team, has been Raynor's chief mechanic 
since November, 1987, and recently was promoted to team manager. Barry holds 
the same role with Bobby Rahal's car on the Galles-Kraco team. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of street- and road-track situations, we feel that Willy can make up 
the difference between the old and the new car," Green said. "We all know that 
the ones with the Chevy engines have a decided advantage on any circuit. 
Realistically, our goal at Long Beach is to be right there at the tail end of 
the Chevies, but at the front end of the Judds and Cosworths." 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs has driven three times in Formula Atlantic races in Long Beach, but never 
on the course being used for Indy cars. When he drove, the course included a 
stretch along Ocean Boulevard, up the hill from the current track, which is all 
down on the flat area next to the marina. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy street races, but more important, having Long Beach as the site for my 
first race is something special to me," Ribbs said. "It is the granddaddy of 
all Grand Prix street races in America and with all that tradition, it has a 
tremendous attraction about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs became the team driver for Raynor, a garage door company in Dixon, Ill., 
after the owners, Ray Neisewander Jr. and his son, Ray III, decided they needed 
an American driver to market if they expected to attract major sponsorship from 
other corporations. Derek Daly, an Irishman who is driving for the Nissan GTP 
team in IMSA, had driven for Raynor for three years and had 11 finishes in the 
top 10 in 43 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek helped us become a contending team, but we felt we it was important to 
have an American in the car," Green said. "We were definitely against getting a 
'buy ride,' a driver who got the ride because he brought a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a young driver, someone with a lot of potential. We tested John 
Andretti, Mario's nephew, and Robby Unser, Bobby's son, at Memphis and were 
impressed by both of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Willy T. heard we were looking for a driver and he approached us, mentioning 
that Bill Cosby was interested in becoming involved. We took Willy to Memphis 
and put him through the same test as the others. All three were very good, but 
after a lot of discussion we felt that a better program could be built around 
Willy. 
</P>
<P>
"Things haven't completely fallen into place yet, but they certainly will, and 
when they do we expect to have a front-running team." 
</P>
<P>
Cosby got interested in Ribbs when he was watching TV one day in the summer of 
1988 and saw this exuberant black driver dancing on the roof of his Trans-Am 
car at Sears Point Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, after I'd won a race at Brainerd (Minn.) when I 
finished on a flat tire, I got so carried away that I jumped up on the top of 
the car and did a little Sugar Ray Leonard shuffle," Ribbs said. "I got so much 
attention from it that I did it every time I won a race. I was just lucky that 
Bill (Cosby) caught my act from Sears Point. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me the next day and said he'd watched me and asked me about my 
career. We got to be good friends and the next thing you know he was helping 
put together the Indy-car team with Raynor. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months ago, he hardly knew a thing about racing, but he keeps in touch 
every day and now, when we talk, I'm amazed at how much the man knows about 
chassis set-up and engines, everything about the car."

JAZZ FORWARD KARL MALONE SAYS HE DOESN'T EXPECT -- OR NEED -- THE LEAGUE'S 
STAMP OF APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gridlock took hold earlier than usual on a road leading to the 405 Freeway near 
Marina del Rey one recent Friday. A woman stopped her car in traffic, turned on 
the hazard lights, then eluded on-rushing motorists to cross the median and get 
Karl Malone's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Horns blared. Malone, a forward for the Utah Jazz, was heading to his hotel 
room and not trying to draw attention. Although taken aback by the odd scene, 
Malone signed for the woman and continued on his way. 
</P>
<P>
"That still blows my mind," Malone said the next day. "This lady backed up 
traffic just to get my autograph. Me, when I was growing up, I never got 
autographs. I never thought somebody was so important to society to do 
something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Another player of Malone's status might have come off as haughty in retelling 
the story. But Malone, still coming to terms with celebrity, simply smiled and 
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
His modesty is not false because, when it comes to basketball, he really is not 
modest. He acknowledges his place in the NBA hierarchy and enjoys the money and 
privileges. He will be the first to say he has abilities others do not, and 
that no single defender can stop him when he has the ball and the basket is 
within reach. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mailman, as Malone has been called since starring at Louisiana Tech, 
does not like to make a big deal about being a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
In February, for instance, he tried not to make much of an issue about being 
left off the starting lineup for the All-Star game despite being the league's 
second-leading scorer. Privately, he seethed. Publicly, he had no complaints or 
criticisms of the Lakers' A.C. Green, who beat him out in fan balloting. 
</P>
<P>
And now, he has all but eliminated himself from consideration in the league's 
most-valuable-player voting, even though he meets the criteria. Malone averages 
about 31 points, second to Michael Jordan; is fourth in rebounding at more than 
than 11 per game, and is fourth in field goal percentage at 57%. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't gonna be me," Malone said when asked about his chances in the 
seemingly wide-open MVP race. "The only time I think about it is when somebody 
mentions it. It's nothing where I go to bed at night and say, 'I hope I win.' I 
don't think I will. All this stuff has happened to me so quick, I can't even 
comprehend it right now." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Malone said, things such as awards and recognition are not what 
really matter. "What fascinates me is that athletes, in general, how we get 
wrapped up in all the hype," Malone said. "That blows my mind, too. After a 
while, you start believing what they tell you. "My thing is, how did we get to 
be so important to society that people are stopping their cars to come see us? 
We get all these endorsements and big money. Don't get me wrong, there's 
nothing wrong with endorsements and money, but then you start looking down at 
people because people are telling you how great you are. I'm not going to be 
playing all my life, and I want to be the same guy who came into this league." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is the same Malone who once was a child running the two or three 
streets of rural Mount Sinai, La. Outwardly, though, Malone has changed. At 26, 
he has matured and speaks as someone trying hard to retain his home-grown 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Lounging poolside at a Marina del Rey hotel the day before the Jazz played the 
Lakers in a nationally televised game at the Forum, Malone wore a black cotton 
shirt buttoned to the collar, with only a few white polka dots, white linen 
walking shorts and white Italian loafers with no socks. Sunglasses were 
conspicuous by their absence. 
</P>
<P>
Told that he had the requisite look for this town, Malone shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"In this town, to me, it's about what kind of car you drive, what kind of watch 
you have on, all that stuff," Malone said. "In Salt Lake (City), it's not like 
that. You could drive a Mercedes or a Dodge Caravan there. Most people there'd 
prefer a Caravan because it'd fit all their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Malone laughed, squinting into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"But I like L.A., too," he said. "I'd like hanging around Magic (Johnson). Man, 
if I ever played for the Lakers . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Malone says he wants to do everything in his power to bring an NBA championship 
to the Jazz. Two seasons ago, Utah came within one game of eliminating the 
Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals. And since being ousted in the 
first round of last season's playoffs, the Jazz have come back strong. They 
began the weekend leading the Midwest Division with a 53-23 record, the best in 
franchise history even before the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
"When the team wins and you play good, everybody gets the glory," Malone said. 
"You can score 30 points and average however many rebounds you want, but if 
your team doesn't win, you have no chance at the MVP. I'm not dwelling on it. 
I'd rather win than get awards. I realize what I mean to this team. I realize 
who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Who Malone is, in strictly a basketball context, is perhaps the NBA's best 
power forward. His only peer is Philadelphia's Charles Barkley, technically a 
small forward. Barkley and Malone are two of the MVP candidates, along with 
Johnson, Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Akeem Olajuwon and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
So, at the very least, Malone is the NBA's sixth-best player. But no one in the 
league is universally praised more than Malone for his varied talents. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl Malone is the definition of what a power forward is supposed to be and do 
out there," Coach Del Harris of the Milwaukee Bucks once said. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, 6-feet-9 and 256 pounds, has added dimensions to what has been the 
popular definition of his position. Not merely a rebounder and low-post 
defender, Malone has become a prolific scorer from the perimeter as well as 
inside. He runs the floor with the speed of guards, out-muscles taller and 
wider centers, dominates players his own size and, this season, has added 
three-point range to his talents. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't stop him," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "If you double him, he'll 
find the other guys. If you don't double him, he'll wear you down. He'll beat 
you in transition. His first three steps out of the block are the quickest of 
anybody's in the league. He just explodes out of the lane. When he gets down 
low, he intimidates guys. You don't see anybody try to go one on one with him." 
</P>
<P>
Malone intimidates opponents with his ferocity. He grinds his teeth and plays 
to the crowd with exaggerated gestures. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm in the paint, I get down and dirty," Malone said. "Well, not dirty. 
But they should let you play as hard as you can, to the point where you 
shouldn't try to hurt somebody. The paint is where men are made. As long as it 
doesn't get really ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm in the paint, I love it. I love to punish people. If the shoe was on 
the other foot, they'd try to punish me. I'll tell you this: You won't get me 
twice in a row. You may get one shot in, and I'll let you know you got that 
shot in. But then, for the rest of the night, you're in for it." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, in his fifth NBA season, has learned what officials will tolerate. He 
once told a reporter that he has learned to grab the back of a player's jersey 
when officials are not looking, to step on another player's foot before that 
player jumps for a rebound, to furtively throw elbows. 
</P>
<P>
All Malone will say now is that elbows and shoves are common among the league's 
big men. And, since he wants to dominate all aspects of the game, he had to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Malone has learned too well and that referees let him get away with 
fouls. On April 4, after Malone scored 36 points against the Charlotte Hornets, 
losing Coach Gene Littles decried Malone's aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the toughest guy because he's the only guy in the league they allow to 
throw you out of the post," Littles said. "Maybe because he does it all the 
time, it's perfectly legal. If we do it, it's a foul. He is a great player, but 
maybe he thinks he's better than he really is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of playing, he talks to coaches on the bench. He should just play 
basketball. He hasn't won any championships. When he wins some championships 
and shows me some rings, maybe I can say he's a great player. He's averaging 31 
points a game and having a great year, but he should just play and not talk so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Said Malone: "If I was on Coach Littles' team, he wouldn't be saying that. 
Here's a guy, he doesn't even know what post-up guys do." 
</P>
<P>
Three seasons ago, during the conference semifinals, Riley told Michael Cooper 
to play Malone on the wing and force him to the baseline. The first -- and last 
-- time Cooper tried it, he had to pick himself up off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers considered it a success when center Mychal Thompson held Malone to 
25 points in a Laker victory April 1 at the Forum. Thompson's strategy was to 
drape himself over Malone and receive help from two or three teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"With Karl, you have to match meat for meat with him," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a double-beef burger, and I'm just a quarter-pounder. Karl also can 
move that strength all over the floor. That's what makes him so dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
That also is why Malone, modesty aside, says that no player can stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"When one guy can stop me, that's when I retire," Malone said. "If there was 
another Karl Malone out there, I could stop him. I'm not going to say how. But 
the Magics, the Birds, the Jordans, the Barkleys -- it's awfully hard to stop 
them when they're on their games. 
</P>
<P>
"Me, I feel when my jump shot is working, then go inside and make a few 
baskets, then make a few passes, I'm now in my rhythm and it's awfully tough to 
stop me. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been in an arena where you see a guy -- it don't matter what you do to 
him -- he's on fire. You're just hoping, sooner or later, he'll cool off. When 
I feel it, I can fill it." 
</P>
<P>
Malone has had games of 61, 52 and 49 points this season. The 61-point game 
came Jan. 27 against the Bucks, the Jazz's first game after the All-Star voting 
was announced. Malone reached 61 points in slightly more than three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
When Malone reached 53 early in the fourth quarter, Coach Jerry Sloan sent 
reserve Mike Brown to the scorer's table to replace Malone. Before play stopped 
and Brown could get in, Malone scored eight more. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Malone has scored many of his points from three-point range. He 
has made 37% of his three-point tries, including one at the buzzer that beat 
the Lakers Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to work on something every summer," Malone said. "This summer, it was 
the three-pointer. So, when the season rolls around, all you guys say, 'How'd 
he do that?' I remember Coach Riley said the last time I was (in Los Angeles), 
'The least likely guy to beat us on the three was Karl Malone.' But, hey, I've 
worked on my outside shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I'm a great player, but if you look at all the great players, 
like Magic and Jordan, they come back every year with one thing you didn't see 
last year. After a while, you've got everything in your game. Then, you say, 
'How are you gonna stop him?' That's what I try to do when I go home in the 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
Home, for Malone, in the summer now is Dallas. It is only a three-hour drive to 
the home he built for his mother, Shirley Turner, in Summerfield, La. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Malone's mother is almost as well known as he is. His father left home 
when Karl was a child, and Shirley reared eight children by herself while 
running Turner's Grocery &amp; Washeteria in Summerfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to remember my roots, but now I don't have the time that I used to, to 
stop by Louisiana and hang out all summer," Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I try to remain the same person, treat everybody the same. My mom wouldn't 
let me do it any other way. The more I've grown and matured, the more she's let 
me make my own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of years, she's cut the cord, and I live the life I want to 
live. I guess that's what growing up is. But I still ask for her advice." 
</P>
<P>
Malone maintains daily contact with his mother, even when he is in Salt Lake 
City, where he also keeps a home. He has his own construction company there and 
spent part of last summer in Utah filming an independently produced movie. The 
film is based on the life of Porter Rockwell, Mormon leader Brigham Young's 
right-hand man. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, who never acted before, played Rockwell's sidekick, said to be the 
first black man in Utah. Malone said he enjoyed the experience. He got to ride 
a horse and had extensive dialogue. The film, Malone said, will be released in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
"I never acted a day in my life," Malone said. "But I felt really good about 
it. I did it because it was fun. But, since then, I've gotten about two or 
three other offers." 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that people might think he has gone Hollywood, Malone says he does not 
aspire to a film career. 
</P>
<P>
Malone said he will play five more seasons, until he is 31, then retire to what 
he says will be a quiet life. Only then will he consider marriage and a family. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play in the NBA, you're in a certain spotlight," he said. "But my 
life is not really fast-paced. True, I like nightclubs, like the next guy, but 
I also like quiet evenings at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my mind set on having a family and settling down. I want to be able, 
when we have that first little Mailman, to see him every day. I want to be able 
to drop him off at school, take him to the park. I want to do all those things 
in life you never think about. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys play the game, travel all the time, and never see their kids. Dad's 
not around, so all they have is Mom in their lives. I want to be the father 
that, growing up, I didn't have. I had my stepfather, but I knew he wasn't my 
real father. That's something I always dreamed of doing. 
</P>
<P>
"In five years, I want to do that. I'll be 31 and I figure, if I hadn't done 
all I wanted to do in basketball by then, I won't ever do it."

It's Roseanne Barr night! 
</P>
<P>
At a prime courtside seat in the Sports Arena, in which she has been preceded 
by Jack Nicholson, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Douglas, Orel Hershiser, Alan 
Thicke, Boom Boom Mancini, Craig T. Nelson, Bruce McNall and Al Davis -- to 
name a few -- the famed comedienne and her family sit, watching the Clippers 
and Seattle Supersonics. 
</P>
<P>
To her left, her host, Donald T. Sterling, sits in warmups and gathering gloom. 
His Clippers are sinking once more. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's a writer on his other side, so maybe he's being diplomatic. 
In similar situations, this master of body language has crossed his arms over 
his chest for extended periods, dashed his program to the floor, or walked to 
the baseline seat of General Manager Elgin Baylor and sat in the aisle next to 
him for a conference. 
</P>
<P>
What a many-faceted gem is this Sterling, or an actor trying out various 
approaches. Even top Clipper brass was amused when, after returning from the 
Super Bowl, where he had been Davis' guest, Sterling came attired in outlaw 
chic: black pants, black leather jacket and, even though the game was being 
played indoors, sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle lead reaches double figures. 
</P>
<P>
How long, oh Lord, how long? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for 100% of Sterling's nine-year ownership, thus far. The Clippers were 
the only NBA team without a single winning season in the '80s. They are charter 
members of the NBA lottery and have never missed one. Sterling's lottery 
parties are social landmarks. Their reservation for June is made and confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
How to account for this? 
</P>
<P>
Bad luck? 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? 
</P>
<P>
Donald T. Sterling? 
</P>
<P>
"Why isn't Ben playing?" Sterling asks ex-team President Alan Rothenberg, TV 
personality and president of the California bar, sitting a couple of seats 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, ever plugged in, notes that the Sonics don't have a true center 
opposite Benoit Benjamin, just former Clipper forward Michael Cage. At the 
half, the rebound figures are 13 for Cage, one for Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a moment . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rising as if from years of torpor, the Clippers rally. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their problems -- how about that team meeting in Sterling's Beverly 
Hills office to complain about Coach Don Casey? -- these kids are up to their 
teeth in talent. The Clippers can now stumble into being competitive most 
nights. Given uninjured guards, they seemed playoff-bound. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Garrick steals the ball and dunks. The crowd goes crazy. Believe it, the 
Clippers are Los Angeles' declasse darlings. The Seattle lead is down to 
101-97. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, fouled, goes to the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a computer study a few years ago," Sterling says, his optimism 
wondering if it's safe to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed 25% of games are won by four points or less. We've got to find a way 
to score four more points and hold the opposition to four less. That's a spread 
of eight. That shouldn't be too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how to do it? 
</P>
<P>
Ah, there's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin makes two. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, 103-102. The Clippers run a last play. Winston Garland looks inside 
for Benjamin, can't find a passing lane and fires from 18 feet. A moment later 
it's over: Clippers 104, Seattle 103. 
</P>
<P>
Casey dances over and twirls his owner. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to come celebrate with us," Casey yells. "We don't have too many of 
these." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling asks the writer if he wants to visit the locker room. The writer 
demurs. Sterling demurs, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine how emotional he must be, to come across the floor to embrace the 
owner," Sterling says of the departing Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention eager to remain employed. Casey has had tombstones in his eyes 
since Ron Harper went down and the playing roster went to Beverly Hills to 
critique their mentor's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how much I want Coach Casey to succeed," Sterling says. 
"He's an underdog, a former assistant coach. Of course, Elgin will make all 
those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Note that no one has asked about Casey's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Another night at the Clippers is history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Great Sterling 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we seen this somewhere? 
</P>
<P>
In his recent PR offensive that landed him on the cover of California magazine, 
in Business Week and Forbes, Sterling's publicist framed him as the West 
Coast's answer to Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he is more like the West Coast's answer to F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay 
Gatsby. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gatsby, Sterling is immensely wealthy -- the biggest landowner in Beverly 
Hills -- infinitely hospitable . . . and seems to have arrived on the scene 
full-grown. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gatsby, Sterling is vague about his early years. 
</P>
<P>
There, the comparison ends. Gatsby concealed underworld connections. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was merely poor. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Donald Tokowitz -- the T in DTS -- of immigrant Jewish parents in 
Chicago and raised in East L.A's Boyle Heights. He has said his father changed 
their name "many years ago." An old friend says Donald changed it in the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent California magazine story, Sterling said his father was in the 
produce business. The story also noted Sterling's reluctance to discuss his 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's a little more forthcoming; he says his father was a pushcart peddler. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling attended Roosevelt High, Cal State L.A. and Southwestern law school. 
He tried personal-injury cases and won several big judgments. An early client 
remembers him as smart, tenacious and tireless, a seven-days-a-week guy. 
</P>
<P>
When he had something to invest, he sunk it into Beverly Hills real estate. 
That was in the '60s, a time when the market was not slumping but dying. 
Sterling's plunges thus took courage or foresight. An old associate suggests a 
psychological predisposition to acquire real property. Whatever, he had it 
big-time. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling had a single-minded vision of Southern California as the golden land. 
When the market exploded in the '70s, it made him rich beyond his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Formally modest, he mentions repeatedly he merely took a ride on "galloping 
inflation." Thus he denies himself the credit due one who scaled the heights, 
every step of the way on his own merits. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, he became friendly with Jerry Buss, with whom he had done 
business. At Buss' elbow, he glimpsed the fast lane. Sterling's cash, paid for 
about 20 Buss developments, financed the purchase of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Following Buss' example, Sterling bought an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
That's as far as that comparison goes, too. 
</P>
<P>
Buss got Los Angeles, the Forum, the Kings, the Lakers, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and 
the right to draft Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling got the Clippers, a wandering franchise that had started in Buffalo, 
been traded en masse for the Boston Celtics, then transferred to San Diego, 
where it moldered. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's purchase price is reported to have been nearly $13 million. 
Actually, a former associate says, he paid no money, only assuming some $11 
million in deferred-payment debts. Former owner Irv Levin threw in about 
$100,000 in advance season-ticket sales, so in effect, Sterling got a signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Then followed three whirlwind seasons in which Sterling learned to be a public 
figure the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
He was fined $10,000 by the league for saying the Clippers had to "bite the 
bullet" and finish last so they could draft Ralph Sampson. A model named 
Patricia Simmons showed up, saying she was a friend of Sterling, claimed Coach 
Paul Silas' desk and rose to the post of assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego press suggested pointedly that Sterling's behavioral excesses 
often followed a few white wines. The league considered lifting his franchise, 
but settled for his promise to hire Rothenberg and pay his debts. 
</P>
<P>
The deals started: Tom Chambers to Seattle; Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and 
Craig Hodges to Milwaukee; James Donaldson to Dallas; Byron Scott to the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Clippers retain one player -- Ken Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this belongs at Sterling's doorstep, or truly represents incompetence 
as much as bad luck, is another question. 
</P>
<P>
For example, several of the deals, including the Cummings-Pierce-Hodges for 
Marques Johnson fiasco, were made by Carl Scheer, a respected NBA hand. Even 
when Sterling hired competent pros and let them run the show, nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
The roll of Clipper injured became another Who's Who: Bill Walton, Norm Nixon, 
Marques Johnson, Derek Smith, Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Gary Grant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he moved his team to the Sports Arena. The Coliseum Commission made it 
attractive, promising support from the lawyers who had helped fight the NFL 
antitrust suit and improvements to the arena. However, Sterling became persona 
non grata within the NBA and fought in court for four years to hold his ground. 
</P>
<P>
His single decision to move, and the passage of a decade, have enhanced the 
value of his franchise to the $70-million range. Sterling says he has turned 
down $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown With the Donald 
</P>
<P>
In his penthouse office Sterling, in workaday plain blue suit, white shirt and 
tie, stands behind his desk, framed against the backdrop of the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The room is spacious, offers a panoramic view of downtown Beverly Hills and is 
appointed with Louis XIV desk, Napoleon-era clock, Chinese screens, parquet 
flooring from Bordeaux, impressionist paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling offers his visitor a seat, but remains standing on the other side of 
the Louis XIV. He talks, he strides around the room, he turns pensive and looks 
out the window when he talks about his departed father's final years -- "I saw 
him every day. It was the highlight of my life." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps protesting that he doesn't want to do this story and seeks to maintain 
a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when the Clippers first arrived in Los Angeles, Sterling gave few 
interviews and didn't even appear in the media guide. Rothenberg said, "You're 
going to call him the Howard Hughes of the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling has returned to the media guide. Out-of-town writers are often marched 
over at halftime and introduced to him. He sends flowery letters of praise to 
Los Angeles sportswriters he has never met. A man who hires Marilynn Monroe's 
former public relations agent can't be described as a hermit. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling shows pictures of the guests at his last public function in the 
office: Wilt, Pia Zadora, Pat Sajak. He has already mailed copies to Clipper 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Is he star-struck? 
</P>
<P>
He says he is merely dressing up his team's image, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I like sports people," he says, almost breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling is often breathless. Here's the buoyancy that launched him out of 
Boyle Heights: 
</P>
<P>
"I like people who are achievers. But don't we all? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a town where the entertainers work. They love sports like you do and 
everybody else does. There's a certain common denominator that exists in 
sports, you understand? Where you can call anybody like you've known them for a 
lifetime and ask them to be a special guest. 
</P>
<P>
"George Allen called me the other day: 'Don, this is is George Allen, I'm going 
to come in and have lunch with you.' Well, I had never met him before. He's now 
at Long Beach State. He wants to build a nice facility, get uniforms for the 
players, to raise some money -- all good, worthwhile projects. He came with 
Willie Brown from the Raiders, because they know I'm close with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"When Detroit comes to town, Arsenio Hall wants to come. Last night, I went to 
Spago's after the game. Eddie Murphy congratulated us on beating Seattle and 
said he wanted to come to a game. 
</P>
<P>
"So . . . what is the point I'm making?" 
</P>
<P>
That he, indeed, likes celebrities? 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is the most important thing," Sterling says. "But there is a lot of 
little boy in me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I meet the governor of New York and he says, 'Do you think you have a 
good starting five?' that makes me feel good. The night before, my guests were 
the chancellor of Pepperdine, Charles Runnels, and George Page, the owner of 
the museum. That's exciting! 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce McNall (owner of the Kings) sits down with me. He says he has more fun 
at the Sports Arena than he does at the Forum -- and I understand what he's 
talking about. It's more fun watching a team when you're not suffering. I like 
Bruce. I like Buss. I love Al Davis! 
</P>
<P>
"You know who you should talk to? Our commissioner. Say, 'I'm doing a profile 
on Sterling, is there any hope for the guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
OK, suppose he is a poor kid who can't believe his good fortune and isn't sure 
what it is a rich guy is supposed to do. What's the problem? Only in assuming 
that his background isn't somehow becoming. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but celebrity -- his own -- is a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
People sneer at the Clippers. Sterling dies inside. He knows what they say -- 
"You think that people perceive you as a loser . . . I know I'm a winner." 
</P>
<P>
He will apply himself overtime, as he always has. 
</P>
<P>
There must be an answer somewhere and he's going to find it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lawyer by profession," he says. "Lawyers are taught in law school from 
the first day, one, ascertain the issue and, two, address it. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say the issue is easy. You don't have high-enough quality players -- 
I don't know what the issue is." 
</P>
<P>
The search continues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Issue 
</P>
<P>
How did such a nice, gentle, smart, soft-hearted, well intentioned man get into 
this quandary? 
</P>
<P>
What's the Clipper problem? 
</P>
<P>
Well, after you list the pre-existing ruin of the franchise, the new owner's 
inexperience, buzzard luck and over-exuberance, there is still the question of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
It might be better now than the days when it could have been said, if it 
weren't for bad management, the Clippers wouldn't have any management at all. 
</P>
<P>
However, Clipper management is still erratic, as much concerned with his image 
as that of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper insiders, past and present, defenders and critics alike, agree on 
several Sterling characteristics: he is overly tenacious in negotiations; he is 
cheap, although he has learned to come up with market prices for his Danny 
Mannings; he is indecisive; he prefers to ask a million questions rather than 
act; he creates a power vacuum beneath him, into which top lieutenants from the 
Sterling Corp. and the team tiptoe but can't dominate; his coaches and general 
managers aren't allowed to develop true authority. 
</P>
<P>
Says a former associate: "His way is psychological warfare. He puts doubt in 
your mind. Maybe it's his training as a lawyer. He's an expert at avoiding 
taking a position." 
</P>
<P>
Item: the Norm Nixon negotiations. Nixon wanted a three-year, $900,000 deal. 
Negotiations stalled. Nixon got an offer sheet from Seattle. The Clippers were 
then obliged to pay $1.6 million for four years to retain Nixon's services. 
Nixon came back unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Sterling has hired four general managers, with only Scheer described as a 
man who would question his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Scheer came and went within two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Sterling has hired four coaches, three of them former Clipper assistants 
working for bottom scale. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth was another old NBA hand, Gene Shue. Shue pushed for changes, 
couldn't deliver immediate results and, when the players started grumbling, got 
the ax in his second season. 
</P>
<P>
Item: The Clippers met with several likely draft picks last spring, but not 
Danny Ferry, their eventual choice. Ferry fled to Italy rather than sign. Then 
Benjamin announced he was going to Italy, too. The Clippers managed to reel 
Benjamin back in. 
</P>
<P>
Item: the mid-February team meeting with Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling says he did it only after Baylor asked him three times and he turned 
Baylor down twice. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling says: "The third time, Elgin said, 'I'm the general manager and I'm 
telling you there has to be a meeting with the team. All of the players feel 
the owner doesn't care.' 
</P>
<P>
"We called the coach and told him the players were coming in. We would take 
very careful notes. If the coach wanted to come in, he could come in. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten players came in (all but Benjamin and Jay Edwards, reportedly). And I've 
never seen Elgin so aggressive. He said, 'All right, I've arranged the meeting 
with the owner. Speak!' 
</P>
<P>
"Elgin thinks he's the father of all these kids. He doesn't usually talk that 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"So the players, each one, expressed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought they did (have a problem with Casey). I asked each of them if 
they were 100% content with the coach they had in college. Do you know, not one 
said he had a good relationship with the coach they had in college, except 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't the meeting undermining his coach? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a good question," Sterling says. " . . . If I want my general 
manager to perform at his optimum level, I have to do what he tells me. I asked 
Elgin, 'Did you ever in your career have a meeting with the owner? And Elgin 
said no. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Then Elgin, why are you asking me to meet with the players?' 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, confidentially, I don't ever want to meet with anyone I can't say yes 
to. I don't want to talk on the telephone to someone I can't answer in the 
affirmative. I've reached that stage where I can have someone else do that. 
</P>
<P>
"And I asked (Baylor), 'Do you think it undermines the coach?' And he said no. 
</P>
<P>
"To listen doesn't undermine anybody. And when those players left, Elgin made 
it very clear that they weren't going to influence Elgin Baylor in any way, 
whatsoever, so they wouldn't be confused. 
</P>
<P>
"And then he said, 'I expect you, each of you, to play hard. And you give that 
coach 100% support.' 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't like that, but they respected him. And a couple got up and 
accepted that. And others didn't. And he walked right over there -- got off his 
chair and walked over. And he said, 'Did you hear me clear?' 
</P>
<P>
"I personally asked the coach to come in after the meeting and assured him no 
matter what turn the season took, he was our coach the rest of the year. And he 
really appreciated that. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after that, all the coaches came in and were given a written draft of 
everything the players criticized. I thought the coaches handled it very well." 
</P>
<P>
Casey says it really wasn't a big deal but doesn't want to discuss it in 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor says he wishes it had stayed in the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Springtime in Clipperland 
</P>
<P>
Things are looking up again as another season wanes and another of Sterling's 
lottery parties nears. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who got Cleveland's top pick in that Ferry-Harper deal, could 
even have two lottery choices. Imagine that party. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling says the Clippers might make money for the first time. With network TV 
money trebling and cable deals bubbling, he expects a substantial profit next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He is finally in the NBA mainstream. Commissioner David Stern offered him a 
chance to settle everything for a modest price: $6 million, none of it out of 
Sterling's pocket, but instead his share of recent expansion fees; plus an 
apology for moving without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, enchanted, served on the owners' committee that awarded Stern his 
$30-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time he was in town, I took the commissioner to the Bistro Gardens 
for lunch," says Sterling, fairly crooning with joy. "We sat there two hours, 
like two wonderful friends." 
</P>
<P>
From his New York office, Stern says, "The 1990 Donald Sterling is a person who 
is intensely interested and committed, both emotionally and financially, to the 
success of his team and the NBA. I think that's a pretty important thing to a 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, told that Stern has been consulted, is eager to hear what the 
commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
The quote is read to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there one wonderful quote?" asks Donald Tokowitz Sterling.

WHAT IS A GREAT AMERICAN WRITER DOING HOLED UP IN LONDON, AND WHY HAS HE BEEN 
SO QUIET ALL THESE YEARS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S BEEN AN unusually cold, wet winter in England. A wild storm swept in one 
day off the North Atlantic, flooding the streets, snapping trees, blowing down 
houses and killing 50 people. And now, with another gale on the way, people are 
beginning to mutter about the greenhouse effect. Michael Herr is appalled. At 
this point in his life, he wants peace and stability -- not primordial 
struggles with overstoked elements. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and quiet are what he was seeking 10 years ago when he moved to London. 
Unfortunately, Herr says, what he also found was a stagnant, "xenophobic," 
"predefeated" society, "relentlessly looking in the rear-view mirror. There's 
no energy, no joy. The entropy is breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick of life in the city," he says. "I miss the can-do spirit and positive 
energy" of America. 
</P>
<P>
So, is he planning to move back? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly, says Herr. It's a family decision. "I'm totally outgunned." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HERR'S "Dispatches" was published in 1977, critics hailed it as "a 
classic," "the best book to have been written about the Vietnam War" and "the 
best personal journal about war, any war, that any writer has ever 
accomplished." The language was an intimate, subjective blend of rock 'n' roll, 
terror and the war's peculiar drugged absurdities. It's a book that earned him 
a lasting -- even suffocating -- reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Offers of screenplay and book deals poured in. But instead of following 
"Dispatches" with another blockbuster, this writer of classic American prose 
and American dialect fled to England, going on to fashion what must be one of 
the strangest careers of a contemporary American writer. He refused to grant 
interviews. He gave up his once-compulsive world travels and became a dedicated 
homebody and family man, trading drugs for Gauloises and acid rock for Mozart. 
He let his leisurely output slow to such a glacial pace that it looked as 
though he had fallen off the literary radar screen, publishing only one book 
over the next 13 years -- a collection of short profiles of celebrities to 
accompany a book of paintings ("The Big Room") -- and collaborating on two 
movies (with Stanley Kubrick on "Full Metal Jacket" and with Francis Ford 
Coppola on "Apocalypse Now"). Now, in May, abandoning at last his deep 
identification with the '60s, he's coming out with a new book. Set mostly in 
the New York of the '30s and '40s, it is a meditation on celebrity titled 
"Walter Winchell." 
</P>
<P>
"Three movies, three books," says Herr. "Not a massive output." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it takes a long time, I offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, for me it does. I have my own demented quality-control system. I just 
don't like to send something out with my name on it until I think it's great -- 
to the despair of my family and my bank manager and my accountant." 
</P>
<P>
Herr is sitting in the cozy conservatory of a small South Kensington hotel 
while a heavy rain drums on the glass panels overhead. He is casually dressed 
in khaki trousers and a tweed jacket, his beard undisciplined and his thinning 
reddish hair -- he is 50 now -- awry. He's easy to talk to: curious, anecdotal, 
empathetic. ("People have been telling me stories all my life that I swear they 
never told anyone else," he says. "I must have an open face.") 
</P>
<P>
Most often he appears to be an erudite international man of letters, serious, 
well-read, friends with everybody from Salman Rushdie to Hunter Thompson. Yet, 
at other times, Herr will take a lung-withering drag on his cigarette and say 
something like, "I mean, you know, it was crazy, man," and the slow, melancholy 
emphasis he puts into man makes him sound, just for a moment, like some aging 
hippie, bypassed by life and history. Then a second later he'll be talking 
about his childhood and seem like an all-American-boy English major who was so 
enthralled by Ernest Hemingway that he modeled his early life on him -- only to 
discover, as Hemingway did, that celebrity can be a curse. 
</P>
<P>
"The aftermath of the publication of 'Dispatches' was really heaven and hell," 
Herr says, sitting under the conservatory space heaters and reflecting on his 
own encounter with fame. "The reception couldn't have been better, frankly -- 
it couldn't have been more wonderful. It totally changed my life. But it also 
blew my cover. It was great for a little while, but then I wanted to stop it, 
and you can't turn that tap off so easily, particularly in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of friends invited him to dinner. Strangers wanted to meet him. Once, 
Herr recalls, he got a phone call from a guy who said he was standing in a 
phone booth in Nebraska in the middle of the night. "I could hear the wind 
blowing. He hadn't read the book." The caller said, "Time magazine says this. 
What does this mean?" Herr reversed the question: "What do you think it means?" 
"Oh, ho! Now that you're rich and famous you don't want to talk to people like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
To Herr it seemed as if everyone wanted a piece of him. "Every time anyone 
fired a gun off in the bush anywhere on the planet, I'd get a call. I had to 
behave like a spy in New York to get any work done. I went unlisted." Despite 
numerous requests, Herr refused to do interviews. It would have been 
"unseemly," he says, given what the book was about, to introduce even "a 
whisper of celebrity into that. I didn't do any television. I did one or two 
print interviews very early on, before the book was published, and none 
afterward. Over the years, I've been very shy with the press. I'm extremely 
quiet. It has a lot to do with why I live here." 
</P>
<P>
Herr made visits to London in the late '70s with his English wife, Valerie, 
first for the English publication of "Dispatches" and then for a National 
Theatre production of a play based on the book. And in 1980, he and his family 
moved to London to stay. Being an expatriate, he finds, has had its rewards: 
"It's done real good things for my language -- to be able to look at America 
without being in it all the time, because sometimes that can be just like 
having your head inside a wind tunnel, and you really do feel battered by the 
aggression of American culture and the media." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he notes, "I haven't published any more than I did before." 
He spent 10 years, off and on, working on a book about rock 'n' roll, only to 
abandon it as misconceived. "I can't really talk about the book -- I just find 
it so difficult," he says, "except to say it was almost a kind of vehicle, 
using rock 'n' roll for discussing American culture, a way of writing a 
personal memoir, rock 'n' roll being a metaphor for a period of my life from 
1940 to about the time rock 'n' roll fell apart in the 1980s, almost in the way 
that Vietnam was a convenient way of writing about other things. 
</P>
<P>
"Last September I kissed it goodby (and started) an unambiguous novel. I don't 
know how far along I am. I am very hard put (even) to say what it is about 
except to say it is about a friendship that spans 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
His forthcoming book is yet another curiosity -- a screenplay about the late 
gossip columnist Walter Winchell. The producers who commissioned it wanted a 
more black-and-white story about Winchell than Herr felt comfortable writing, 
so he decided to publish the screenplay as a book. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, he says, the book is a departure from the immediate present tense of 
"Dispatches," "but I wouldn't be too literal about the pastness of this. 
Chronologically, Winchell takes place in the past, but I think it is a very 
contemporary view. He is symbolically responsible for a lot of contemporary 
culture. 'Winchell' has to do with the loss of a sense of private life, the 
rise of a kind of promiscuous attention to all kinds of business not properly 
our business, a horrible dominance of entertainment in American life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel judgmental about what he did -- it's what happened," Herr says. 
"He was there at the dawn of it. He was the medium that heralded these changes. 
Always, with a figure like that, there are things going on in the air, like a 
virus in the climate, and someone becomes a receptacle for those impulses." 
</P>
<P>
"That he (Winchell) is barely remembered today, and practically unheard of by 
anybody under 40," Herr writes in the preface to the book, "only gives his 
story a larger shape than the mere rise and slide and fall of his actual life. 
If passing time has obliterated him, it has also given him the status of a 
forgotten ancestor. If people go around today treating themselves like 
celebrities because not to be a celebrity is just too awful, we may have Walter 
Winchell to thank." 
</P>
<P>
IN THE SMALL kitchen of his South Kensington flat, Herr boils water for coffee 
in an electric kettle, and then we sit in the living room on facing sofas in 
front of a smokeless-coal grate. Thanks to Martha, the cat, the ends of Herr's 
sofa are literally in shreds. The place has a well-lived-in look, resembling a 
rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village, albeit one with high ceilings 
and tall windows overlooking a common courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Herr had a writer's instinct, even as a child in Syracuse, N.Y. "When I was 
really young, I was a voyeur," he says. "I trained myself to eavesdrop while 
looking out the train window and not miss a word. I used to walk around when I 
was 12 and follow people home. This would even involve taking bus rides with 
them. I just wanted to see where and how they lived." 
</P>
<P>
At Syracuse University, he began writing fiction and film criticism for the 
college literary magazine, then edited by Joyce Carol Oates. Bored by college, 
Herr quit before graduation to spend a year bumming around Europe, where he 
received a letter from The New Leader, an old leftist magazine, asking him to 
be its unpaid film critic. After he was fired a year later ("I was liking all 
the wrong movies"), he applied for a job with Esquire, then edited by the late, 
legendary Harold Hayes. Although Hayes didn't hire him, they became friends, 
and Hayes threw him the occasional odd assignment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, after spending six months in the Army Reserve to avoid the draft ("I 
did a good job. I was the only squad leader who wasn't relieved of his squad"), 
Herr went to work for Holiday magazine, where he spent 18 months before 
quitting to travel and write. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really traveling nonstop, man, from when I was 18 to when I was 30 -- 
around the country, around Europe, a couple of trips to Asia. The longest I was 
home was six months, and the inevitable question that my Freudian-oriented 
friends back in New York would ask was, what was I running away from?" 
</P>
<P>
What were you running away from? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was ever clear. I just wanted a lot of stickers on my 
luggage." 
</P>
<P>
One inspiration was Ernest Hemingway. "When I was a kid, I was obsessed with 
him and made some pathetic teen-age attempts to imitate him in my life. And I 
reinvented myself as this outdoorsman, hard-drinking and everything with it. I 
dare say that influence put my foot on the trail to Vietnam. Which is why that 
book is about acting out fantasy as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always wanted to go to war. I wanted to write a book. It was something I 
had to do. The networks kept referring to this as a TV war, which I didn't 
believe it was. I sent a proposal to Harold Hayes. I was to write a monthly 
column, but once I got over there I realized this was not the way to approach 
the story. I wired Hayes. He said, 'You do what you want to do. Have fun. Be 
careful.' " 
</P>
<P>
As Esquire's Vietnam bureau chief, Herr was given an honorary rank of 
lieutenant colonel, which, among other things, was great for helping him get 
rides on helicopters. "I'd say, 'I want to get back to Saigon. I want to go to 
Dalat. Is there anything in the air?' If there was a chopper going by, they'd 
radio it, and it would come down and take me." 
</P>
<P>
A sociable, outgoing man, Herr quickly became friends with correspondents for 
the major newspapers and networks. Even so, much of the time he felt like an 
impostor. "One time the chief government press officer in Vietnam introduced 
the press corps at a reception for Teddy Kennedy by saying 'the gentlemen of 
the press and Michael Herr.' . . . I wasn't doing daily or weekly journalism. I 
was there for something else entirely. I was on a different frequency. I was 
just going off on long operations, coming back six weeks later and going into 
my room and smoking a ton of dope and writing notes. I never thought of myself 
as a journalist. I mean, I only wrote one thing the whole time I was there -- 
there was really ever only one dispatch -- so even the title is wrong, and it 
took me eight, nine years to write that blasted thing." 
</P>
<P>
Herr had arrived in Vietnam shortly before the 1968 Tet Offensive, the biggest 
battle of the war. Unlike most other correspondents, who had to cover briefings 
and press conferences, Herr spent most of his time in the field with the 
troops. He was shot at in Hue, saw people in his helicopter die after being hit 
by groundfire and, armed with a .30-caliber carbine, helped repulse a Viet Cong 
night attack in the Mekong Delta. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fire fights, he writes, that really messed with your mind. ". . . 
your senses working like strobes, free-falling all the way down to the essences 
and then flying out again in a rush to focus, like the first strong twinge of 
tripping after an infusion of psilocybin, reaching in at the point of calm and 
springing all the joy and all the dread ever known, ever known by everyone who 
ever lived, unutterable in its speeding brilliance, touching all the edges and 
then passing, as though it had all been controlled from outside, by a god or by 
the moon. And every time, you were so weary afterward, so empty of everything 
but being alive that you couldn't recall any of it, except to know that it was 
like something else you had felt once before. It remained obscure for a long 
time, but after enough times the memory took shape and substance and finally 
revealed itself one afternoon during the breaking off of a fire fight. It was 
the feeling you'd had when you were much, much younger and undressing a girl 
for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
What sets Herr's book apart is the authoritative sense he conveys of the 
terror, ennui and ecstasy of what it felt like to be there. In a chapter about 
the siege of Khe Sanh, he offers a long series of conversations between two 
friends, a huge, gentle black Marine named Day Tripper and a little naive white 
Marine named Mayhew. The exchanges ring so true that one wonders, simply on a 
journalistic level, how he ever managed to record them. 
</P>
<P>
He smiles. "They are totally fictional characters." 
</P>
<P>
They are? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah. A lot of 'Dispatches' is fictional. I've said this a lot of times. I 
have told people over the years that there are fictional aspects to 
'Dispatches,' and they look betrayed. They look heartbroken, as if it isn't 
true anymore. I never thought of 'Dispatches' as journalism. In France they 
published it as a novel." 
</P>
<P>
But, Herr says, "I always carried a notebook. I had this idea -- I remember 
endlessly writing down dialogues. It was all I was really there to do. Very few 
lines were literally invented. A lot of lines are put into mouths of composite 
characters. Sometimes I tell a story as if I was present when I wasn't, (which 
wasn't difficult) -- I was so immersed in that talk, so full of it and so 
steeped in it. A lot of the journalistic stuff I got wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Like what? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this unit at this place. But it didn't bother me. There is no 
shortage of regimental histories." 
</P>
<P>
HERR KNEW HE'D had enough of Vietnam when, on an R&amp;R trip to Hong Kong, he 
started to hallucinate. So after a year at war, he returned to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote most of the book in 18 months -- everything but the first and last 
chapter. I had a great 18 months working and playing. A great time. I was 
really sort of high from that experience, and I sort of re-entered the scene in 
New York where everyone was talking about the war, everyone was obsessed with 
the war, but no one had been to the war and didn't even know anyone who had 
been to the war, and it gave me a certain amount of glamour, and I was high on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in rapid order, Herr lost three close photographer friends in Vietnam: 
Larry Burrows, Dana Stone and Sean Flynn (son of Errol Flynn). Even now, more 
than 20 years later, this is hard for Herr to talk about. His speech slows 
down, and his voice turns grave. "I flipped out. I experienced a massive 
physical and psychological collapse. I crashed. I wasn't high anymore. And when 
that started to happen, other things started to happen, too; other dark things 
that I had been either working too hard or playing too hard to avoid just 
became unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"It was part Vietnam syndrome. I don't know what the other part was. . . . 
(Actually), I do know what it was. It was my life. The end of my 20s. I had put 
myself into every extreme feeling experience. I was a hog for experience, and I 
think it was against my nature. I was a nice, middle-class, educated Jewish boy 
who as a kid had every nervous tic and allergy possible." 
</P>
<P>
He leaves his seat on the living-room sofa and slowly begins pacing, head down, 
the floor creaking. "The first half-dozen years of the '70s were very painful. 
I was having these recurring post-apocalyptic war dreams, but they were all 
taking place in New York, and it was a jungle. Just going out in the streets 
required the cunning and skill of special forces. I was living in the Village. 
There was like a whole year when I didn't go above 14th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't supporting myself. I had help from Valerie, help from my father. I 
was writing, keeping a journal. I didn't want to get out of it. I was so 
attached to my pain. I was in and out of analysis. Valerie and I broke up, and 
I lived in New Hampshire for a year. I was really severely alone in New 
Hampshire, some really serious solitude, and then it just played itself out. 
When I came back, I brought the rest of 'Dispatches' with me." 
</P>
<P>
Even before it was published, Herr knew he had written a powerful book. The 
doctrinaire right was offended by the way he ridiculed the platitudes of what 
he called the Saigon "Dial-soapers," the starched and self-deluded brass. Herr 
had described an audience with Gen. William C. Westmoreland in which the 
commander, noticing Herr's Esquire credentials, asked if he planned to write 
"humoristical" pieces. 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments did not please the doctrinaire left, either. "Viet Nam was what 
we had instead of happy childhoods," he wrote. And leftists piled on, too, 
calling him a war freak enraptured by the ecstasy of battle. "I was deeply 
thrilled," Herr says. "I knew I had succeeded. I offended everybody." 
</P>
<P>
He worked so hard on that book, Herr says, that every word is engraved on his 
brain. "A few years ago I had to go back and re-read 'Dispatches' for typos in 
the American edition. And even after all that time, it was so familiar to me 
that I wasn't really reading, I was almost reciting it to myself. I feel if 
someone really cranked me up, I could almost recite that book phonetically -- 
like Japanese rock 'n' roll singers." 
</P>
<P>
I'M GLAD YOU came here," Herr tells me at one point, "because that means I 
don't have to go there." 
</P>
<P>
You don't like Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"Those drives that you take in L.A., those endless stretches. And for relief 
from that you go and see a few people and nothing human ever gets exchanged. It 
is a very, very weird place. I would love to go back to L.A. for a couple of 
weeks. But I wouldn't want to go back for a couple of months. I tell you, when 
I made the Walter Winchell deal, the one (contractual) condition I had that 
really held up the deal was that I could not be compelled to go to L.A. They 
could ask me to come to L.A., but they couldn't make me come to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
He'd visited once before, after finishing "Dispatches" but before it had 
actually come out. "You get called to L.A. by producers," he remembers. "And by 
the time you get out there, they sort of forget why they asked you to come." 
And the result was, Herr ended up sitting in a room waiting for a phone call 
and feeling "like a schmuck. I have been alone in a lot of places in my life, 
but I was less lonely snowbound in the New Hampshire woods than I was in Los 
Angeles waiting for a phone call." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Herr lived for seven months at the Tropicana Motel on Santa Monica 
Boulevard. "The first room I had, I looked up, and there was dried blood on the 
ceiling. I'd stand outside in the morning, and there would be this terrible 
heat and stillness in the air. You could hear the rustling of the palm fronds. 
The blackbirds wouldn't even fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I never could tap in to the social life there," he says. "At the time I was 
living out there, no one knew who I was. And there is this phenomenon where you 
go to a Hollywood party, and people are afraid to talk to you because they 
don't know who you are. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people gave a birthday party for me, and a rather famous producer came. 
He was seated on my right. A couple of times he turned and actually opened his 
mouth, but nothing came out. He couldn't talk to me. He couldn't talk to me. I 
didn't take it personally. I felt the guy had a struggle going on. If he had 
known 'who I was' -- if my name had been familiar to him, as it was to become 
six months later when the book came out -- I am sure we would have had a great 
chat." 
</P>
<P>
It amazes Herr the number of people who have read "Dispatches" and still don't 
understand that he's not looking for any more wars or celebrity; he doesn't 
want to be on TV; he's had his 15 minutes of fame. But TV producers, Herr says, 
act as though they are the high priests of the new American religion: "It's 
television, man. It's like they are asking you into their temple, the real 
heart of the American faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in New York in 1985 when they were preparing for the 10th anniversary of 
the end of the Vietnam War, which didn't strike me as a cause for widespread 
celebration, and someone from one of the networks called and said, 'We want you 
to go to Vietnam and walk around the old places. We want to do an hour special 
-- "Michael Herr's Vietnam." ' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said I would rather observe this great anniversary in private. The guy 
was unbelievably aggressive and hostile. He demanded to know why I wouldn't 
take this dream offer: all the money they were going to pay me -- 75 to 100 
grand, my name above the title. The idea of going on television anyway just 
fills me with dread and horror. But to go on and impersonate an old war 
correspondent returning seems really profane. Really profane. If they want to 
commemorate the Vietnam War, man, they can welcome the veterans home. Set up 
some apparatus to take the pain away." 
</P>
<P>
HERR ENTERS A restaurant coming on like Ernest Hemingway, sweeping in out of a 
wet London day. He stands in the foyer, addressing the waiters by name, 
slipping out of his raincoat, answering inquiries about his health and 
following the waiter to his usual table, where he sits, back to the wall, 
holding mini-court with a two-olive martini. ("I don't have anything against 
wine, but I do admire the distilled grains.") 
</P>
<P>
Over the meal, Herr talks about the difficulty of writing. "I write very slowly 
for a long time until I write quickly. The writing comes out of a space; it is 
hard to get into that space. You have to write yourself into it. You have to 
have done all your thinking so that by the time you start, it is pure energy. 
You write and look for the little clues and funny unexpected phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"I am never sure how much of that time I spend is self-indulgence or bona-fide 
quality control. Some of that is obviously self-indulgent. When you are working 
for Time magazine, you can't really afford things that are real obstacles to 
writing -- fear and dread." 
</P>
<P>
It's not important, says his friend novelist Richard Ford, that Herr doesn't 
publish much: "It's not how much a person writes. It's how well he writes. In 
'Dispatches,' there is that wonderful fusing moment in which reportage elevates 
itself to literature through the agency of imagination. There are certain 
people in your generation you feel are seminal to your view of the world -- Ken 
Kesey, Bob Stone, Ray Carver -- (who) tell you something you didn't know, and 
you see it, and it tells you something that is indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael is a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
By his own account, Herr writes from 8 to 11 each morning. When he's done, he 
meets people for lunch. That and walking to the market are his only exercise. 
He spends the evening with his family or watches TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to travel. I hate to be away from my kids. I had to go to Paris for my 
book. I would call home. My daughter would hear my voice and burst into tears. 
It would tear me apart. I used to land in a strange city, not know a soul, not 
know the language and love it. Now I don't want to go anywhere, man -- unless 
there's someone to meet me and take me by the hand." 
</P>
<P>
Herr's attitude toward Hemingway has changed many times over the years, but he 
is still devoted to the work. "There was a time when I really tried to make a 
kind of declaration, a break with Hemingway, but in my heart, I think he was an 
extraordinary writer," he says. "Faulkner had greater range and genius, greater 
vision; he was a greater writer. But the thing that Hemingway could do that no 
one else could do -- he makes it happen sexually, and that's a kind of 
shamanistic power. Everybody tried to imitate him. He became a kind of cartoon 
of himself. He was mad, he hit his head too many times, yet he always had the 
tragic view -- and the purity of that writing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his disdain for Hollywood, Herr has mostly warm memories of his film 
collaborations -- especially his work with Stanley Kubrick, another American 
poet self-exiled in Britain. Kubrick, he says, "is fabulously, fabulously smart 
and intellectually fearless. And, to put it mildly, very stimulating. He lives 
by the telephone. And if you are essentially playing with your kids and 
watching TV at night because you are too tired to do anything else, and the 
phone rings at 9 o'clock and it's Stanley -- (by the time) you get off the 
phone at midnight, you hang up with a black ear, a sore throat and a mind 
squeezed like an orange, like someone just came and took all the vitamins out 
of your system." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when Herr was re-writing the screenplay for Gustav Hasford's "The 
Short-Timers," which would become "Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick would send a 
driver to Herr's house every afternoon. "And I'd give what I had written to the 
driver and Stanley would read it, and (that night) we would talk. It was really 
a great way to do it. I got immediate feedback. I was so energized." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say, 'Well, what did you think of that scene?' 
</P>
<P>
"And he would say, 'Michael, I don't think I have the language to tell you how 
much I hated it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Herr is well aware of what is sometimes said of him, that he wrote one great 
book and that was it: "He's missing in action." 
</P>
<P>
"I hear those whisperings," he says. "I hear them quite often. But they don't 
seem to have much to do with me. I find it really hard to think, at almost 50 
years of life, of trying to live up to other people's expectations. I 
understand how most people whose ambitions have not been fulfilled would not 
believe this, but mine were. And I seem to be motivated by other things. I just 
feel as if I'm on a different metabolism now." 
</P>
<P>
HERR LIVES with Valerie and their two daughters, Claudia, 12, and Catherine, 7, 
midway between Queen Victoria's great marble-and-bronze Hyde Park memorial to 
her consort, Prince Albert, and the ancient pink-and-white riveted girders of 
the Albert Bridge. The neighborhood streets consist of block after block of 
three- and four-story row houses variously appointed with wrought-iron fences, 
brass knockers, multiple gables, slate roofs and chimney pots. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense he loves London: It is "the last of the great cities. They really 
respect privacy here, (in contrast to New York, where) they don't even know the 
word is in the dictionary." But the British are also "really, really, really 
complacent. To get anyone to come and do anything -- a plumber, a painter, a 
carpenter -- it's a nightmare. You call them up, and they start to whine and 
lie -- 'My uncle's hip went out and the parrot's sick and the car wouldn't 
start.' They snivel, but they are belligerent with it, a kind of belligerent 
whining. And it is a sound heard often in the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody over 40 is really living in World War II. Almost not a night goes by 
that you don't see Hitler on television. Last summer, we got back from America 
one night, and I turned on the television, and he was on two of the channels at 
once. I knew I was back in England." 
</P>
<P>
What he'd really like to do, Herr says, is "come back (to the United States) 
and live in the country." He owns a five-bedroom home in Upstate New York. The 
problem is, Valerie really loves England. 
</P>
<P>
Herr sighs. "It's complicated. She lived in America for a long time. I met her 
there; she was working for my agent in New York. My wife is sort of a 
middle-class girl who left England when she was 20 or 21 because there was 
nothing here for her -- the barriers were too high -- and she's come back in 
more attractive circumstances, and she likes it. She loves it that her 
daughters are going to these wonderful schools. We are in a really fortunate 
position here. We meet a lot of interesting people. And she loves England. So 
she is a little frightened to leave here and go live in America in what she 
quite rightly considers to be the middle of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is painful. Herr is an American to the bone, and his daughters are 
growing up British. Catherine speaks such wonderfully enunciated, proper 
upper-class English that he says his American visitors like to simply sit and 
listen to her talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that my family is really happy here," he says. "I prefer to be there, 
but I don't mind being here. I don't see any point in going (to America) if 
they're not going to be happy. I feel ambivalent about just about everything. 
If my feelings aren't mixed, I don't really trust them." 
</P>
<P>
WE SAY GOODBY on a street corner. The afternoon is growing dark and the winds 
are picking up. Herr walks down the sidewalk, raincoat flapping, his shoulders 
hunched against the wind -- a man trapped in a place in which he'd rather not 
live by a sense of responsibility to his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's a trap he's chosen. "I really like family life," he says later in a 
call to Los Angeles. "When you describe it to other people, it sounds 
unbelievably boring, but it's not to me. It means much more to have children 
than to have something that is read after my death." 
</P>
<P>
He still thinks, sometimes, that he ought to publish more, "but it doesn't seem 
to be the overriding motivating force of my life. I sometimes have thought that 
it would never really matter if I never published another book. Sometimes I'm 
amazed that I ever finished ('Dispatches')." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, he says, repeating a remark by Hemingway about keeping one's craft 
in perspective: "Books are for saps."

EXPLORING THE DARK SIDE -- AS A PRODUCER; 
</P>
<P>
ACTOR FRED WARD'S TENACITY BRINGS THE COMICALLY SORDID WORLD OF 'MIAMI BLUES' 
TO THE SCREEN

Fred Ward's lonesome hobo face has turned up in enough films to make him a 
familiar figure to American moviegoers. He was the shy astronaut, Gus Grissom, 
in "The Right Stuff," Meryl Streep's work mate in "Silkwood" and the title hero 
of "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, like the great majority of actors this side of Kevin Costner and Robert 
Redford, Ward has worked primarily in supporting roles and has seldom been in a 
position where he could name his own tune. A few years ago he decided to do 
something about that. 
</P>
<P>
After a friend passed Ward a copy of Charles Willeford's little-known 1985 
crime thriller, "Miami Blues," the actor anted up $4,000 for a two-year option 
on the book and the chance to lock up a juicy role if he could get it made into 
a movie. "For some reason, people hadn't caught on to Charles Willeford yet," 
said the 47-year-old Ward, who had never optioned a book before. "Usually these 
things get scarfed up pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
The part he was after was that of Junior Frenger, a larger-than-life psychopath 
from California who steps off a plane in Willeford's Miami with a stolen credit 
card and some major anti-social tendencies that put him on a collision course 
with a rumpled detective named Hoke Mosely. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, I saw Junior for myself and had Gene Hackman interested in doing 
Hoke," Ward said, which is of interest now that the movie is coming out with 
Ward in the latter role as the memorably mangy Hoke, a cop born to the 
flophouse. It's an anti-romantic role but perhaps the best one Ward has had in 
years, and it pairs him with Alec Baldwin, the impassioned young CIA analyst of 
"The Hunt for Red October," who was eventually cast as Junior. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami Blues," being released by Orion this week, is a movie that got made 
because of Ward's tenacity in his maiden voyage as a producer and because of a 
leap of faith taken by long-lost director-screenwriter George Armitage, who 
wrote the screenplay on spec, that is, before he knew he would be paid for it. 
It didn't hurt that Jonathan Demme, an old buddy of Armitage's from their days 
together at Roger Corman's B movie mill, stepped in as guardian angel and 
supervising producer. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched it to Orion, and they passed on it a couple of times," Ward said, 
referring to an early outline of the story. "It wasn't until George wrote a 
script on spec that they could see what it was. They said, 'OK, but we need 
some young blood in it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Which is when Ward gave up the idea of playing Junior and began to think of 
what he might be able to do with the character of Hoke, a middle-age sergeant 
who takes his teeth out at night and puts them on a bedside table in the empty 
room where he lives alone. "Most of his paychecks go to alimony," Ward 
speculates about Hoke. "He's looking to get laid constantly. He's lonely and he 
eats too much." 
</P>
<P>
The novel, one of 14 hard-boiled books Willeford wrote before his death in 
1988, travels in the vicinity of Elmore Leonard country, where the criminals 
tend to be ironic. Junior's facility with homicide is couched in a laughable 
effort to achieve white-picket-fence domesticity with a young call girl 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose American dream is to own her own hamburger chain 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"The dark humor really appealed to me," Ward said. "And this random, abrupt 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Junior's style is fierce and uncomplicated. When a Hare Krishna follower 
accosts him at the airport, he reaches out and breaks the man's finger. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be funny and then sink into this ugly place," Ward said. "It reflects 
my view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Hoke himself is far from a pretty picture. "He's the kind of man," the actor 
said, "who has to go back in his hotel room every night and look at TV. There 
are a lot of people like that. If you're one of those people, you go home at 
night and close that door and you're just looking at yourself. This is part of 
the human condition. It's funny and sad at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Ward originally took the novel to Demme (who directed him in "Swing Shift") in 
the hope that Demme might want to direct it. "I loved the book," Demme said, 
"and I was dying to work with Fred again, but I felt like I had just been 
involved with a lot of stuff with violence in it and stuff with an unexpected 
sense of humor. It wasn't a problem with the material but with me." 
</P>
<P>
Demme passed it on to Armitage, his friend from the days when they were both 
turning out product for America's drive-in theaters at Roger Corman's New World 
Pictures. Armitage's portfolio at New World included "Private Duty Nurses" and 
"Nightcall Nurses." His last movie was "Vigilante Force," a flop released by 
United Artists in 1976. "It's a near-cult film," Armitage jokes about 
"Vigilante Force," which starred Kris Kristofferson as a twisted Vietnam vet 
who takes over a small California town. "I'm fighting for full cult status." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a big believer in Armitage and thought he was one of the best 
directors around," Demme said. "It was just a matter of him getting the right 
opportunity." More specifically, he said, "I was impressed by the freshness of 
the casting and the dynamics of the camera work in his films for Corman. I 
thought he was a filmmaker who was a cut above the rest of us who were working 
there at the time. He was an inspiration to me." 
</P>
<P>
But while Demme went on to direct "Melvin and Howard," "Stop Making Sense," 
"Married to the Mob" and other major movies, Armitage spent the last 14 years 
sinking out of sight. His problems had something to do with the fact, as Demme 
said, that "George is not a schmoozer, he probably would have been busier if he 
had been a schmoozer" and that he was uncompromising in his insistence to write 
and direct original scripts considered esoteric by Hollywood standards. One of 
them was titled "Synergy Warp." 
</P>
<P>
"There've been a number of development deals that didn't go through," said 
Armitage, who, like Ward, is 47. He estimates that he's written 50 scripts 
since beginning his Hollywood career in the mail room at 20th Century-Fox in 
1965. "It was a difficult period, but it was great too. I learned that I really 
wanted to do it, I really wanted to make films. I'm glad I stuck it out." 
</P>
<P>
Armitage warmed quickly to the Willeford book. "I thought it was hysterical, 
but at the same time you couldn't quite laugh," he said. "It's a kind of 
hyper-realism. I got a glow reading it, and thought it would make a great 
picture. I liked the characters -- all these throw-away characters who he 
treated like they had a soul." 
</P>
<P>
The director found the novel's unusual mixture of violence and black humor to 
be one of its selling points but also potentially difficult to reproduce on 
screen. "The novel is actually darker and more violent than the film," he said. 
"He (Junior) is particularly nasty to the girl. We kept that as part of the 
subtext, that at any moment he might do something terrible to her. . . . I 
tried to maintain the tone of the book, and his (Willeford's) wife tells me we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"What interests me about violence is the shock value of it," the director said. 
"If you've ever encountered violence in the real world, it's sudden, and that's 
what I wanted to convey in the film. That's the feeling that I want the 
audience to remember." 
</P>
<P>
Armitage acknowledges that Orion executives, including departed chairman Mike 
Medavoy, had some reservations about his directing "Miami Blues" -- even at the 
budget-conscious figure of $8 million -- since some of them were working at 
United Artists when it released "Vigilante Force." 
</P>
<P>
But Demme, in effect, guaranteed his work by serving as one of the film's 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"I participated in the re-write conferences and the casting," Demme said. "I 
was in that blurry land between consulting and approval." 
</P>
<P>
As one of the film's executive producers, Ward also sat in on casting and 
production meetings and "put in my two cents' worth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, he got a role that required him to learn to speak with a prosthetic 
device in his mouth that covered his teeth (to give him the appearance of 
toothlessness) for those scenes when Hoke removes his dentures. "I felt playing 
Hoke was a risk. Not being believable was a terror. It always is." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, who will also be seen come October as writer Henry Miller in director 
Philip Kaufman's "Henry and June," has led a life that has taken him, he 
admits, into neighborhoods where Hoke might have felt at home. His father often 
ran afoul of the law and, in fact, was in jail the day Ward was born. He moved 
around a lot as a boy growing up in towns scattered across Louisiana and Texas. 
He stayed on the move as a young man, working as an itinerant short-order cook, 
field hand, construction worker and lumberjack before venturing into acting in 
New York and eventually finding his way into productions of two of Sam 
Shepard's early plays in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"You carry the baggage of your childhood with you until you can step into a Zen 
space and objectify it," Ward said dreamily. "There are certain elements of 
need -- the need for acceptance -- from my childhood that gave me the drive 
that an actor has to have." 
</P>
<P>
In "Miami Blues" he found the sort of role that at least gives an actor a 
chance to have that drive rewarded. "It was a great experience, and I'd like to 
do it again," he said about producing. Not that it was easy. "There were times 
when things would stop and no one could move it any further. It took patience. 
Sometimes you wonder how films get made. But they do."

STRAIGHT MAN TO A TALKING HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Alan Young was originally approached to do "Mr. Ed" in the early '50s, the 
star of his own Emmy-winning comedy revue wanted nothing to do with a show 
about a talking horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I didn't want to work with anybody who doesn't clean up after 
themselves," recalled Young. 
</P>
<P>
Fast forward to 1959. George Burns, who had financed an unsuccessful "Mr. Ed" 
pilot with another actor playing architect Wilbur Post, told the show's 
co-owner: "I think you should get Alan Young-he looks like the kind of guy a 
horse would talk to." 
</P>
<P>
This time Young, his career having "taken a nose dive, as they do," readily 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
And because of that, Young will forever be remembered as the man who talked to 
a golden palomino in one of the first in a wave of '60s television fantasy 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
For five seasons, Young-who now makes his home in Dana Point- played straight 
man to "the famous Mr. Ed." Wilbur and the talking horse he inherited when he 
moved into a home in the suburbs are currently enjoying television afterlife on 
Nickelodeon's Nick at Night. 
</P>
<P>
Young said Wilbur was "naive and bumbling," while "Ed was a wily one. I think 
it's the same chemistry that made Laurel and Hardy and Jackie Gleason and Art 
Carney: It's the one guy making a fool of the other guy." 
</P>
<P>
Young, who currently does the voice of Scrooge McDuck on TV's "Duck Tales," 
believes that the affection he had for his four-legged co-star contributed to 
the show's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I love animals," said Young, Rand I guess you have to have a sense of fantasy 
about you, because I think I really got to believe that horse was talking to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, even the writers had trouble keeping the talking horse in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who would attend rewrite sessions, recalled the time that some one made 
a suggestion for Ed "and I said, 'No, a horse wouldn't do that.' And then the 
other writers said, 'No, Ed wouldn't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Finally, George Burns, who was also sitting in on the meeting, said, "A horse 
wouldn't do what? A horse will do anything you tell him to." 
</P>
<P>
Laughed Young: "We suddenly realized we were talking about Ed as though he were 
a real character." 
</P>
<P>
Long after the show ended, it was revealed that Ed's voice was supplied by 
Western star Allan (Rocky) Lane. Young, however, prefers not to divulge how the 
trainer got Ed to move his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll tell you this," said Young, Rafter the first year, you couldn't shut 
him up, because as soon as I stopped talking, his lips started to move." 
</P>
<P>
Although Young received top billing, it was obvious who wielded the most clout 
on the set: "If Ed got tired, they quit shooting for the day; if I got tired, 
it didn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ed, according to Young, loved to work. And it wasn't unusual for the crew 
to break into applause after Ed finished one of his on-camera stunts. But even 
horses have their off days. 
</P>
<P>
Driving to the studio in the morning, Young would often come up behind Ed's 
horse trailer on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell how he felt," said Young. "If his tail was tucked into the tail 
gate, he wasn't up to doing it that morning. If his tail was up and flowing in 
the breeze-then he was up to doing it."

LEAVING A SAFE HARBOR FOR MOCA; 
</P>
<P>
CHIEF CURATOR PAUL SCHIMMEL IS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE LOCAL ART COMMUNITY TO 
GET A TOP SOUTHLAND MUSEUM POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There's a lot at stake at MOCA," Paul Schimmel said the other day of the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, where he assumes the post of chief curator Monday 
morning. "We have a very high-visibility institution. As the identity of the 
institution increases, so does the level of commitment that has to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Last December, when news of Schimmel's appointment was announced, the question 
of the museum's high-visibility status was on many minds. Mary Jane Jacob, 
whose tenure in the post had ended the previous August after a scant 2 1/2 
years, was already the third chief curator in MOCA's brief history. Having 
completed five years of often energetic programming, some first-rate and some 
rather less so, the museum had yet to establish a distinct profile. It was hard 
to know whether its seemingly erratic direction arose from problems of staff or 
from conflicted demands at the top, where the board of trustees had earned a 
reputation for being willful and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel knows something about working with a board of trustees whose 
reputation for difficulty precedes them. He also knows something about shaping 
a tentative and ill-defined program into one that is weightier and more 
substantive. During nine years at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, first as 
curator and then as chief curator, he can be credited with having been 
instrumental in transforming the institution from a perfectly respectable, if 
decidedly regional, museum of contemporary art, headed by a notably contentious 
board, to one of the finest and most adventuresome small museums in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of that success, Newport last year launched a $50-million capital 
campaign to underwrite and endow a new building designed by the celebrated 
Italian architect, Renzo Piano. The prospect of such a development was 
certainly remote when Schimmel, then 26, arrived in Orange County in 1981 from 
his native New York City, fresh from graduate studies at the Institute of Fine 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"My perception of Newport, when I first came," Schimmel explained, "was that it 
was a difficult board, a conservative community, and a very specific, almost 
exclusively regional program. Obviously it has evolved significantly since 
then. The facility hasn't changed, but the recognition the institution has in 
terms of balance of programs, the kinds of publications it does, the 
willingness of the board to underwrite what are, at least in some cases, 
difficult and controversial exhibitions, and the general cultural ambitiousness 
of the Orange County community have made it a really different place than it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Raised to a higher plane, that institutional profile wouldn't be a bad fit for 
the Museum of Contemporary Art. And the successful transformation of the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum likely figured prominently into MOCA's decision to 
offer the senior curator's job to Schimmel. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Schimmel had been among those discussed for the post in 1986, 
following the departure of Julia Brown Turrell for the directorship of the Des 
Moines Art Center, and prior to the hiring away of Mary Jane Jacob from 
Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. Certainly many factors played a part in 
his having been passed over then, but it is reasonable to assume that the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum's proximity to Los Angeles had worked against him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unspoken rule that says you have to move away before the 
folks back home will recognize your worth, the longstanding insecurity of the 
Los Angeles art world had to be overcome. Typically, influential museum 
curators and directors have been imported. In fact, with the exception of those 
who have climbed an institution's curatorial ladder, Schimmel's appointment at 
MOCA is noteworthy as the first major museum position locally to have been 
filled from within the ranks of the Southern California art community. If the 
appointment therefore reflects a newly significant degree of cultural density 
and confidence, Schimmel himself has been among those responsible for the 
change in climate. During the last four years, for example, two of the most 
important exhibitions of postwar American art mounted anywhere in the country 
were organized under his direction at Newport: "The Interpretive Link: Abstract 
Surrealism into Abstract Expressionism, Works on Paper 1938-1948," which 
skillfully traced an epochal shift in art through the early drawings and 
watercolors of the New York School, and "Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey," which 
examined the controversial work of a distinctly under-recognized, Los 
Angeles-based artist and deftly inserted it into the forefront of contemporary 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
While quick to acknowledge the unarguable high points of MOCA's programming in 
the past, neither does the curator hesitate to pinpoint its chief failing. The 
institution has zigzagged from one approach to the next, as various 
constituencies have been identified or have pressed their claims. Pulled in a 
variety of directions, the young museum's mandate can seem arbitrary and 
shapeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to make a very conscious effort not to just think about the individual 
merits of a single exhibition," Schimmel said of his strategy for MOCA, "but 
about how it fits within a larger program -- one that can be described with 
boring words like balance, breadth, reach. A program where there's a different 
character to each show, where they don't feel the same all the time." 
</P>
<P>
How would he characterize the overall program since its 1984 debut? 
</P>
<P>
"Three phases," Schimmel replied, without skipping a beat. "Julia (Brown 
Turrell) did a very strong program of California art. Concurrently, (MOCA 
director) Richard Koshalek's interest in significant New York artists from the 
1960s came through. Then, in reaction to this orientation, there was a feeling 
that the museum needed to deal more with what was happening nationally, with 
the up-and-coming stars of the art world. So there was a series of shows of 
very hot, very topical artists. And then, the third phase, led by Mary Jane 
(Jacob), was a real strong emphasis on European art, on an international 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think about it, it was first a California program, then a national 
program and recently an international program. If you mixed it all together and 
added just one more ingredient -- more historically and thematically oriented 
exhibitions, of which there have been a few -- it would be a balanced, much 
more interesting program. I'd like to think that I was hired because what I've 
tried to do (at Newport) is address all those same issues, and in such a way 
that they happen simultaneously rather than sequentially." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel's concise analysis could be said to reveal an underlying, subtly 
provincial bent to MOCA's program history. Only secondarily has the museum 
pressed its judgment of what constitutes the important currents of recent art, 
of postwar history and of cultural debate today. Instead, the museum has been 
responding first to a perception of the local community and what it lacks: 
recognition for its artists, firsthand knowledge of significant new art as 
identified in New York, and regular contact with aspects of the vigorous 
international art scene that has been the hallmark of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether the art MOCA has shown comes from the West Coast, West 
Broadway or West Germany, these "three phases" have not arisen from convictions 
about which postwar art the museum believes is decisive, as seen by looking 
outward from an inherently distinctive vantage point in Los Angeles. Generally, 
the program has emerged from inward-looking presumptions about what Los Angeles 
supposedly needs. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't play to a regional art world anymore," Schimmel asserted, "or 
you're just talking to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The surest way to turn this discontent around, he believes, is to establish a 
strong profile by identifying and drawing upon the committed artistic passions 
of the museum's professional staff. In that endeavor, he will likely benefit 
from something his predecessors couldn't: a heightened degree of curatorial 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the greatest strength in MOCA's staff has been bound to its greatest 
weakness. In hiring, the director has seemed less interested in traditional 
academic credentials than in creative intelligence and enthusiasm. The result 
has been a relatively young staff blessedly light on the narrow bonds of 
conventional training in art, yet decidedly green in dealing with sophisticated 
museum issues. Now, after several years of intensive, on-the-job training, 
aspects of MOCA's staff are beginning to be seasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel intends to develop a symbiotic relationship with the diverse interests 
of both the staff and trustees, but not to act as a rubber stamp for either. "I 
prefer to embrace the most substantive of their goals for the institution as my 
own," he explained. "Certain of their desires are significant and well-founded. 
If I can make them as if they are my own, then the chance to succeed will be 
greatly increased." 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, Schimmel pointed to the number of exhibitions on issues 
surrounding the dominant New York School painters of the 1950s that he 
organized at, or brought to, the Newport Harbor Art Museum. "The Interpretive 
Link" surprisingly turned to works on paper as the undeclared source of many 
Abstract Expressionist ideas later expressed in paintings. "Action/Precision" 
took a long-overdue look at the second generation of New York School artists, 
while "Bay Area Figurative Painting" and "The Figurative Fifties" examined the 
response, in terms of imagery, to Abstract Expressionism by artists in San 
Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You could make the case that I did (these shows) because (Newport trustee) 
Donald Bren, of the Irvine Company, gave us a lot of money to do them and is 
personally very interested in Abstract Expressionism. But the truth of the 
matter is that I was very interested in working on this material as well. And 
when you think about it, these shows are absolutely the antithesis of the way 
Bren collects. He goes after the most significant works by the most significant 
artists, and here I was biting off at the fringes. But it did mean something to 
him and to others on the board that we were delving into related art historical 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to program considerations, Schimmel is concerned that the museum 
has not yet committed space for regular display of its permanent collection in 
either of its two expansive buildings.

"The unsung hero of MOCA is its collection," he said, "or should I say, its 
collection of collections. You have the Panza, the Schreiber, the Gersh and the 
Lowen collections. What you don't have is a lot of the stuff that fits in (the 
gaps in these holdings). But MOCA has done an exceptional job in building a 
collection at a time when that's almost unheard of. We need a concerted, 
programmatic effort at having a major segment of the permanent collection on 
view all the time."

While the curator's estimable tenure in Orange County does offer a sturdy 
platform on which to build, there are considerable differences between the 
Museum of Contemporary Art and the Newport Harbor Art Museum. MOCA claims 
roughly six times as much exhibition space as Newport. Its program budget alone 
is about the same as Newport's entire operating budget ($1.8 million). The 
staff sizes are hardly comparable.

More important, MOCA is squarely in the public eye in ways that Newport isn't. 
The Newport Harbor Art Museum, like the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, is 
an isolated artistic outpost in its community, and as such has benefitted from 
its convenient proximity to the major cultural center that is Los Angeles. 
Outsiders can zip into Newport Beach with relative ease to see a special 
exhibition; yet, the museum is just far enough away to remain beyond the 
mundane scrutiny that would attend operation within the day-to-day art life of 
Los Angeles. When sizing up a neighboring museum's performance, it's best to 
keep in mind the Victorian sightseer's favorite admonition: Distance lends 
enchantment to the view.

The other thing Los Angeles has that Newport Beach doesn't is a rapidly 
growing, increasingly prominent cadre of artists. As Schimmel arrives at MOCA, 
that single fact could be the clincher.

"The Metropolitan, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney all existed in New 
York (before 1945)," he said, "but they were provincial institutions until the 
art world essentially reinvented itself in the context of America. Until 
everyone in the Los Angeles art community realizes that their greatest asset is 
the artists -- before the institutions, before the collectors, before the 
foundations, before the curators, before the critics -- this really will not be 
among the preeminent art capitals of the world."
