The homemade dolls that three junior high school students in San Leandro took 
to their English class generated a barrage of criticism from about 200 angry 
parents, students and teachers. One doll was dressed in a Ku Klux Klan robe. 
Another depicted a black person being hanged, and the third carried a sign with 
a racial epithet. The Bancroft Junior High School students were suspended and 
they issued an apology. "We will not forget it," one angry parent shouted at a 
meeting. "We won't let you sweep it under the rug." Principal Bruce Jackson 
said an investigation is under way to determine who made the dolls. The three 
students, who were suspended for five days, wrote a letter that read, in part, 
"We want to apologize to the Bancroft school students, teachers and the 
community. Our actions were dumb, but not meant to be racist."

Atizapan, near Mexico City, was the center of a search for evidence linking the 
drug-smuggling cult blamed for 13 ritual killings near the U.S. border with 
other slayings in the capital, the government newspaper El Nacional reported. 
The paper said the Mexico City killings took place over the last two years but 
did not say how many people died. It said the attorney general's office, which 
handles anti-drug efforts, had been asked to assist in the case. The cult's 
suburban "safe house" and two apartments in Mexico City were raided four days 
after police in Matamoros, 550 miles to the north, found 13 mutilated bodies 
buried on a ranch.

The Unit 2 reactor at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant was operating at 30% of 
capacity after a one-week shutdown to replace a leaky cooling system valve, a 
utility spokesman said. The reactor near San Luis Obispo was providing 300,000 
kilowatts of electricity, enough for about 300,000 people in Northern and 
Central California, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Ron Rutkowski said. 
The gradual process of returning the reactor to full power was expected to be 
accomplished today. At full power the reactor supplies 1.1 million kilowatts to 
1.1 million people.

A strike of supermarket workers in Northern California still is possible, 
despite a settlement between management and a big Sacramento local, union 
leaders say. Phil Tucker, a spokesman for 11 locals of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union in the Bay Area and in the Central Valley, said: 
"We're no closer to a contract than we were a week ago. There is a negotiated 
settlement that is going to be recommended to the Sacramento membership, but 
there are still 30,000 workers who could go out on strike if we don't reach a 
settlement." Local 588, representing about 9,700 workers, reached a tentative 
agreement with management, calling for wage increases, bonuses for all 
employees and increased benefits. President Jack Loveall was cautiously 
optimistic that Local 588's pact would serve as a model for other UFCW 
negotiations. But Tucker said, "We still have many hurdles to overcome."

A second bridge collapse in Tennessee killed one teen-ager and injured two 
others riding with him, officials said. Their pickup landed upside down on 
railroad tracks 25 feet below the 40-year-old wooden bridge near the eastern 
Tennessee town of Oliver Springs, Trooper Ray Fletcher said. It was not 
immediately clear whether a 25-foot section of the bridge had already collapsed 
or crumbled as the truck drove over it, police said. The collapse came two 
weeks after the failure of the Hatchie River bridge, 45 miles north of Memphis, 
killed eight people whose vehicles had plunged into the river. That accident 
was thought to have been caused by high water washing soil away from bridge 
supports. State Department of Transportation records show Hatchie River bridge 
deficiencies were discovered during inspections in 1985 and 1987.

 -- War in Sudan has taken such a devastating toll that "all that seems to be 
left is their souls," said Audrey Hepburn in an emotional plea on behalf of 
victims of civil strife in the African nation, where the actress concluded a 
four-day tour of refugee camps. "I take with me so many images. Images of 
newcomers staggering into the camps with absolutely nothing left at all . . . " 
Hepburn said on a brief stopover in Nairobi on her return to Europe. Hepburn, 
the UNICEF goodwill ambassador, told of a desperate need for food and water as 
relief efforts try to stem the wave of deaths. The United Nations estimates 
250,000 people starved to death in southern Sudan last year because of the war 
and another 100,000 will die this year unless the relief effort can proceed 
unhindered.

 -- He had an often-Dickensian childhood in London and achieved immortality 
through Hollywood, but it was in Switzerland that Charlie Chaplin spent the 
last 25 years of his life, giving the Swiss village of Corsier-sur-Vevey 
special impetus to heartily celebrate the comedian's 100th birthday Sunday. 
"His films leave us a poignant message of justice and equality," said Swiss 
President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, who spoke at a ceremony dedicating a park to 
Chaplin, who is buried in the village near Lake Geneva. Thousands watched an 
hourlong procession that, naturally, featured lots of baggy pants and bowlers.

 -- Intense scrutiny and sweltering Florida heat didn't wilt Britain's Princess 
Anne, who remained cool and unsmiling throughout a 15-minute press conference 
in which no one was allowed to ask the question on everyone's lips -- is her 
marriage breaking up? Buckingham Palace had demanded that reporters restrict 
their questions to equestrian subjects as a condition of her appearing before 
the press at the Volvo World Cup Finals of show-jumping in Tampa. At one point, 
the princess, being closely watched by 100 reporters, remarked, "it's quite hot 
here," drawing snickers from the media. Organizers had warned that they would 
halt the questioning if anyone asked about purloined personal letters written 
to the princess by a handsome aide to Queen Elizabeth II. The letters have 
fueled speculation about her 15-year marriage to fellow equestrian Mark 
Phillips. ANN CONNORS

State and federal officials evaluated a test by Exxon-paid workers of an 
environmentally risky method to clean rocks blackened by the March 24 Alaska 
oil spill. Meanwhile, oil from the more than 10-million-gallon spill, mostly in 
the form of tar balls and mousse-like foam, threatened Homer and other fishing 
ports in Cook Inlet. But with winds mainly from the south, there was no sign of 
oil advancing toward Kodiak Island and rich crab waters nearby, Coast Guard Lt. 
Jim Madden said. The test of cleanup methods on blackened rocks in Prince 
William Sound included high-pressure, hot-water sprayers, which are effective 
in removing oil but upend rocks, strip away sand and gravel and kill beach 
life. Scientists say it takes up to two years for life to return to the 
sterilized shore.

ALLEGED DRUG KINGPINS SEIZED IN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About two dozen people were arrested in Washington during an anti-drug sweep 
that netted the alleged leadership of a group that controlled much of the 
cocaine market in the nation's capital. Among those arrested were Rayful Edmond 
Jr., 24, and Tony Lewis, described as being in his mid-20s. Officials said the 
two operated a network that controlled up to 20% of the cocaine and crack 
traffic in Washington. The Washington Post quoted sources as saying the pair's 
alleged drug network employed more than 150 people and has been linked to 
scores of homicides. Edmond and Lewis were arrested on cocaine distribution 
charges. The arrests resulted from a two-year joint investigation conducted by 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and district police. Mayor Marion 
Barry said the arrests would put "a mini-dent" in the local drug supply.

FALLOUT YET TO SETTLE IN DEATH OF POPULAR TIJUANA JOURNALIST 
</P>

When Hector Felix Miranda slumped across the front seat of his car on a rainy 
spring morning almost one year ago, the victim of two point-blank shotgun 
blasts to his left side, a singular journalistic voice in Mexico was silenced. 
</P>
<P>
But while his assassins quieted the irreverent and flamboyant columnist, widely 
known here as El Gato (The Cat), the furor surrounding his sensational murder 
has never fully abated, casting a pall over both journalism and politics -- two 
of Felix's passions -- in the newsman's adopted home state of Baja California. 
The fallout has yet to settle. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the slaying, and the ensuing investigation that critics consider 
inadequate, have become painful reminders of the tenuous position of a free 
press in a nation where more than two dozen journalists have been slain in the 
past six years. Most of the murders -- like the slaying of Felix, who was a 
newspaper institution here for more than a decade -- have not been fully 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
"The case reflects the vulnerability of journalists everywhere in Mexico, 
particularly those who chose to remain independent," said Victor Clark Alfaro, 
a human rights activist here. 
</P>
<P>
"The murder of Hector and what has happened since demonstrated that there is no 
security for us," said Jose Enrique Garcia Sanchez, a respected longtime 
reporter-photographer in Tijuana. "The custom of murdering journalists has not 
been lost." 
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the one-year anniversary of his slaying on April 20, there 
is renewed pressure on authorities here to answer a vexing question: Who 
ordered the murder of El Gato? Many say the answer lies in the halls of power 
here. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly charged election year, it is not a question that many politicians 
affiliated with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party are eager to 
field. "The governor's been busy with other things," said Enrique Sanchez Diaz, 
chief spokesman for Baja California Gov. Oscar Baylon Chacon, when asked about 
the matter. The governor took office in January and is scheduled to serve until 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say authorities would like the case to go away. 
</P>
<P>
"The government hasn't cleared up anything," said J. Jesus Blancornelas, who 
co-founded and co-edited the feisty weekly Zeta along with Felix and now sits 
as the sole editor, although Felix's name remains on the masthead. "We still 
want to know who was the intellectual author of the crime and the material 
killers." 
</P>
<P>
Felix's barbed and gossipy column, Un Poco de Algo (A Little of Something) 
appeared each week in Zeta, which recently celebrated its ninth anniversary, 
having survived Felix's death, a machine-gun attack on the office in 1987 (no 
one was injured) and assorted other difficulties, including attempts by the 
previous governor to thwart distribution. Characteristically combative, Zeta 
since Felix's death has been publishing weekly excerpts from his past writings. 
The columnist specialized in lampooning the rich and powerful, sometimes 
viciously, often utilizing using indecorous words and phrases, double meanings, 
puns and other verbal gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
Even his favorite targets occasionally acknowledged reveling in reading Felix's 
often outrageous thoughts. "I owe my popularity to Gato," Tijuana Mayor 
Federico Valdes, whom Felix often derided as a drunken incompetent, said 
shortly after the murder. 
</P>
<P>
The crime sparked demonstrations and calls for the resignation of then-Gov. 
Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, a favorite target of Felix, whom many charged with 
acceding to -- or ordering -- a cover-up of the crime. Leyva denied any 
wrongdoing. He was eventually replaced last January. Most analysts attributed 
his replacement to widespread fear in the ruling party, known by its Spanish 
acronym as the PRI, that Leyva's bad image -- exacerbated by the uproar 
surrounding Felix's murder -- could cost them the crucial governor's seat in 
July's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities insist that they have solved the murder of Felix. Charged 
in connection with the murder are Victoriano Medina Moreno, a 38-year-old 
former Baja California state policeman who has been in custody for almost a 
year, accused of being the triggerman and mastermind of the slaying, and 
Antonio Vera Palestina, a former Mexico City policeman who is a fugitive, 
although journalists here say he has been sited both in San Diego and in the 
Mexico City area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Act Alone 
</P>
<P>
But while friends and associates of Felix say they have no doubt the pair 
participated in the slaying, they express the strong belief that the two must 
have been acting on the orders of someone who took a strong dislike to Felix, 
either for personal reasons or because of something he wrote. Felix's enemies 
were legion. 
</P>
<P>
Newsmen here have publicly cited several prime "suspects," including the former 
governor, but one name has stood out: Jorge Hank Rhon, 33-year-old president 
and general manager of Caliente Racetrack, one of Tijuana's major employers and 
tourist draws. Both of the two men charged worked for the track. 
</P>
<P>
Hank, scion of a powerful Mexico City family, has adamantly denied any role in 
the slaying, portraying himself as the victim of scandalous speculation. "The 
answer is no. I didn't do it," he said during a dramatic post-midnight press 
conference at his office last year following the arrest of Medina, the alleged 
triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities, who adamantly deny any cover-up, have never even 
questioned Hank in connection with the case. They say there is no need. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen, the case has been pursued diligently," said Luis 
Hernandez Bazan, the deputy district attorney who is handling the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The connections between Hank and the alleged killers are not in dispute. Vera, 
the fugitive, arrived in Tijuana with Hank in January, 1985. Before he 
disappeared after the slaying, Vera served as Hank's personal bodyguard, or 
guarura, for 15 years, Hank confirmed in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the killing, Vera was in charge of security at the race track 
and Medina was one of his lieutenants. Vera allegedly withdrew $10,000 in cash 
from the track cashier at about the the time of the slaying, according to court 
documents. (Hank said the money was for legitimate security expenses.) 
</P>
<P>
"In Mexico, the bodyguard is like a Doberman," said Blancornelas, Felix's 
longtime colleague, who has consistently pointed the finger at Hank. "He only 
does what his boss tells him to do. He doesn't act on his own initiative, 
because he could get his boss into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hank of Blancornelas: "He has to sell newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Hank acknowledged that he and the slain journalist were social acquaintances, 
although Hank said he was no closer to Felix than to other journalists in town. 
The two, along with Alberto Murguia, a close associate of Hank, were frequently 
seen together at the race track, parties and other social occasions. 
</P>
<P>
But Felix was acid-tongued, and one of his favorite targets was Jorge Hank. In 
one of his final columns, Felix referred to Hank obliquely as the "abominable 
snowman" -- a reference either to Hank's flowing hair and beard (since shorn) 
or, perhaps, his rumored taste for cocaine. Hank denied any use of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Each week since Felix's death, Zeta has published a black-bordered page, 
"signed" by Felix, asking Hank: "Why did one of your bodyguards kill me?" 
</P>
<P>
The print also asks former Gov. Leyva, now reportedly assigned to a minor 
diplomatic post in Lisbon, Portugal: "Who ordered my killing?" 
</P>
<P>
In response, Hank said in the interview, "It's been a year and they haven't 
been able to prove anything." 
</P>
<P>
As for Felix's column, Hank said he found it distasteful and offensive and 
didn't bother to read it. "I thought it (the murder) was coming, because he was 
attacking a lot of people, for a long time," Hank said. "I think it was 
everything that lower-class people wanted to hear about, that's why it was so 
popular. I personally was taught never to use bad words, so I never enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Tarnish Reputation 
</P>
<P>
Since the murder, government officials and journalists affiliated with the 
ruling party here have attempted to besmirch Felix's reputation, implying 
strongly that his assassination was the result of a personal vendetta, perhaps 
a crime of passion. Colleagues denounce the attacks as attempts to deflect 
attention from the real issue of who killed Felix. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Hector did in his personal life, no one had the right to kill him," 
said Jose Enrique Garcia, the Tijuana journalist, who now writes for a spicy 
weekly newspaper called Cambio 21. The publication was founded six months ago, 
after Garcia and his colleagues say they were pressured by the ownership of 
their former newspaper to cut back on their aggressive coverage of the Felix 
case, among other issues. "Whether he was killed for personal or political 
reasons, authorities here have not had the moral willpower to pursue the case." 
</P>
<P>
Medina's alleged motive for the slaying has mystified some. Authorities say 
columns by Felix purportedly cost Medina his job as a state police squad leader 
in 1985. According to prosecutors, Felix published items linking Medina to 
alien smuggling, articles that eventually resulted in his firing. 
</P>
<P>
But Blancornelas, Felix's longtime colleague, says he has researched every 
column ever written by Felix and has never found the name of either Medina or 
Vera. That, say he and other journalists here, is just one example of the 
ineptness and unbelievability of the government inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Bazan, the government prosecutor who had authority to call for 
additional investigations, said he believed the motive offered in court papers: 
that Medina lost his job because of articles penned by Felix. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio de la Fuente, the deputy Baja California Attorney General 
responsible for Tijuana, declined to comment, saying he wasn't familiar with 
the details of the case as he had been in office only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Medina has given conflicting versions of his part in the 
murder, admitting his role and then denying it. After he was arrested, he 
retracted his "confession" at a press conference, contending that he was 
tortured into signing the document. 
</P>
<P>
In the account provided by authorities, Medina cased Felix's home for days 
before the murder to familiarize himself with the journalist's routine. 
Authorities say that Medina recruited Vera, his boss, to assist him in the 
crime. On the morning of the slaying, authorities say, the two assassins 
partially blocked a street frequented by Felix with their vehicle, forcing 
Felix to slow down or stop as he drove to work in the rain. Medina then 
allegedly approached Felix's blue Ford and pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge 
shotgun through the driver's window. Felix slumped over beneath the glove 
compartment, his head coming to rest on his briefcase, amid shattered glass. He 
died almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Citing ballistics evidence and Medina's short stature, colleagues of Felix have 
maintained that the actual triggerman was Vera, while Medina was the driver. 
The defense has also contended that Medina could not have been the one who shot 
Felix. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the doubts, the case against Medina proceeds. He could face up to 30 
years in jail. By Mexican law, the non-jury trial must be completed by early 
May, said Judge Braulio Gomez Veronica, who is hearing the case and is charged 
with passing judgment and imposing a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't felt any pressure whatsoever," Gomez said. "All murder cases are 
serious. This is no different -- except, of course, for the public attention."

TWO VIEWS OF MOBSTER LINKED TO SILBERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
IS PETTI A MAJOR UNDERWORLD FIGURE OR A CROOK WHO LIVES UP TO HIS NAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are two views of Chris George Petti, the underworld figure indicted with 
Richard T. Silberman in an alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
One can be found in a thick stack of federal affidavits, transcripts, crime 
reports, media clippings and testimony before the U. S. Senate on file with the 
Nevada Gaming Commission. They say the 62-year-old Petti has been at the helm 
of organized crime in San Diego, the majordomo protecting the interests of the 
Chicago and Las Vegas mob. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy (the Weasel) Fratianno, perhaps the most notorious mobster ever to turn 
government informant, once described Petti as a "strong-arm thug in San Diego" 
associated with the top leadership of the Chicago and Las Vegas syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to some law enforcement officials, Petti is merely a wanna-be, a bit 
player, a man of Greek extraction trying to rub shoulders in a criminal 
organization traditionally ruled by Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a cheap little hood that showed up in town," said A. David Stutz, a San 
Diego County deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't very bright. He's not a mover and shaker. He's no big deal. He's just 
a cheap, no-good little hood who never really amounted to anything." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is clear: The federal government has spent a lot of time, money 
and manpower tracking his movements for the past 2 1/2 years, deploying one of 
the first ever roving wiretaps enabling the FBI to monitor Petti's 
conversations on any telephone he used. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation ended April 7 with the arrest of Petti, San Diego businessman 
Silberman and two other men for their alleged role in the complicated drug 
money-laundering scheme. A federal affidavit describing the investigation 
alleged that Petti had a powerful friend in Silberman, who confided to an 
undercover FBI agent about Petti: "I love the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman is free on bail. But Petti remains in the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center in downtown San Diego after a federal magistrate denied bail, concluding 
that Petti is a danger to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Goodman, a flamboyant attorney from Las Vegas who is representing Petti 
and has represented a number of organized crime figures, acknowledged in an 
interview that Petti and Silberman have long been friends. But, he added, "I 
can assure you it was a very legitimate relationship, going back a long, long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Petti came from two different worlds. 
</P>
<P>
While Silberman has been a longtime Democratic Party power broker and 
successful financier, Petti came from Cicero, Ill., and is reputed to have made 
his early mark as a Chicago area loan shark. Later, he would be named by 
Fortune magazine as among the top 50 "Biggest Mafia Bosses," and the Nevada 
Gaming Commission would find him worthy of inclusion in its Black Book of 
notorious hoodlums barred from the state's casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he has only two prior criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest in the money-laundering case, he was living in a 
ground-floor condominium in the Hillside Colony near Lindbergh Field, with a 
man identified as Victor Garcia, described as a longtime confidante and 
chauffeur, according to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as Chris Poulos and Christopher Polous, Petti is the father of two 
children, from a marriage that began in 1967 and ended in divorce 18 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinctive Features 
</P>
<P>
Petti's features are distinctive, with silver gray hair, and a long, chiseled 
nose. He has been seen often around the downtown county courthouse wearing 
V-neck sweaters and sometimes a sweat suit. He often hung around the Stardust 
Hotel &amp; Country Club in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"With me he's always been a very honorable fella," Goodman said. "He's a very 
quiet person, actually. I don't know what all the fuss is about." 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 probation report paints a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been seen in the company of organized crime figures in Las Vegas, 
Northern California and Chicago," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
It adds that Petti "has a propensity for violence (and) has a violent temper, 
particularly when he is drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman denied that characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lot of time with him, both during the day and in the evening," he 
said. "He laughs a lot harder when he's drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Petti first surfaced in San Diego in the early 1970s as the bodyguard and 
chauffeur for Frank Bompensiero. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Bomp," Bompensiero had a reputation as an elder statesman in 
organized crime, a top mob boss in California with good contacts to the Chicago 
outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be like a driver or a kind of a courier, a messenger-type carrier," 
said Nick Lore, a former organized crime specialist with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
But Bompensiero was also a government informant. And, according to a former 
Justice Department organized crime prosecutor familiar with Petti, he told 
investigators that Petti was heavily involved in illegal gambling and loan 
sharking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gangland Slaying 
</P>
<P>
Bompensiero was gunned down in 1977 while walking in an alley near his home in 
Pacific Beach, shot four times in the head when a car slowed down alongside 
him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first people his wife called after the murder was Petti, and federal 
agents quickly began to theorize that Petti would assume control for the San 
Diego rackets, highlighted primarily by bookmaking, loan sharking and some drug 
smuggling, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti became closely linked by federal investigators with Anthony "Tony the 
Ant" Spilotro, a notorious Chicago mobster who moved to Las Vegas to run 
operations in the desert. Like Bompensiero, Spilotro eventually was murdered, 
his body dumped along with his brother's in an Indiana farm field. 
</P>
<P>
As Petti was gaining in prominence, so too was the government watching his 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
A 1978 federal affidavit filed in Las Vegas places Petti and Spilotro together 
in a Las Vegas restaurant, discussing what to do about a loan shark victim 
under pressure to cooperate with federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Petti called Spilotro and told him the loan shark victim hadn't 
talked to the FBI, the affidavit says. Later, the loan shark victim met with 
Petti and Spilotro at the same restaurant, the affidavit says, and Spilotro 
suggested that the man be less than truthful in his upcoming grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The document has Petti and Spilotro meeting again, this time to discuss 
upcoming grand jury testimony in San Francisco from Fratianno. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Armstrong, a former FBI agent and San Diego County criminal investigator, 
told a U. S. Senate investigating committee about surveillance of two 
out-of-town union organizers with mob ties. The organizers came to San Diego in 
1978, ostensibly to help local hotel and restaurant employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assault With Baseball Bat 
</P>
<P>
"I watched their organizing efforts in San Diego," Armstrong said. "It was an 
easy job. They would spend half the day playing golf at the Stardust, then 
attend the races at Del Mar and then confer with Joe LiMandri (a reputed mob 
associate) at the card room in the Stardust. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched them meeting with people like Chris Petti." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Petti assaulted two men with a baseball bat during an altercation at a 
La Jolla condominium complex. One of the men suffered a concussion and, in a 
complex legal case, Petti eventually was convicted and in 1984 fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
His second conviction involved a federal bookmaking case that covered the 
1980-81 football season. He was released from prison in 1984, after serving 
just under nine months of his year-and-a-day sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Both court cases came at a time when the California attorney general's office 
issued reports about organized crime activities in the state, noting Petti's 
new prominence in underworld circles. 
</P>
<P>
A 1982-83 report asserts that Petti had been given "carte blanche" by Spilotro 
to handle gambling action in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
And a 1984 report discussed the P&amp;T Construction Co., a home repair 
contracting firm "long alleged to be a front for organized crime in San Diego." 
The report notes that two of the company's principals eventually pleaded guilty 
to felony grand theft involving the diversion of construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
It adds: "Chris Petti, a reported organized crime figure, worked for P&amp;T at 
various times and was a principal . . . in Say-It-All, an entity to which 
P&amp;T diverted construction funds." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the convictions and other evidence, the Nevada Gaming Commission voted 
in May, 1987, to include Petti in its "List of Excluded Persons," a roster 
created to protect the gambling industry from unsavory elements. 
</P>
<P>
Nick De Pento, Petti's attorney before the gaming commission, told the 
commission that any description of Petti as a member of organized crime is in 
error, because "there was no illegal association." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Las Vegas Connection' 
</P>
<P>
"It is a mystical fright that is being presented to you that in reality does 
not exist," De Pento said. 
</P>
<P>
James Chamberlain, a Nevada deputy attorney general, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to prove whether there is a Mafia," he told the commission. "We 
don't need to prove whether there is a Cosa Nostra or Black Hand or anything 
given that way. When we talk about organized crime, we talk about people 
getting together to make crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He did that. He has done that. And he has done it with a Las Vegas 
connection." 
</P>
<P>
The exact nature of Petti's relationship with organized crime has been debated 
in law enforcement circles for years. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials discount Petti's role, such as one former Justice Department 
organized crime prosecutor who said that "the guy is a classic LCN (La Cosa 
Nostra) hanger-on." 
</P>
<P>
Stutz, the San Diego County deputy district attorney, said Petti was never able 
to stand shoulder-height with such notorious mob figures as Bompensiero or 
Spilotro. "I never viewed him sitting down with the heavyweights at all," Stutz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Lore, the former FBI organized crime expert, think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy right now has the stature of a major hoodlum in the United States," 
Lore said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a righteous mob guy. Without being a soldier or a member of La Cosa 
Nostra, he's got all the moves of a made guy. He's involved in extortion. He's 
involved in bookmaking and gambling. Now you can add money laundering." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Important Mobsters 
</P>
<P>
But Lore also said there are hundreds of other mob associates in both Chicago 
and New York with far more importance that Petti, primarily because there is so 
much more "action" in those cities than San Diego. He said the Chicago and East 
Coast outfits consider San Diego something of a "branch office," out of the 
mainstream of mob racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
"He comports himself the way you'd expect a mob guy to," Lore said. "He wears 
all the nice clothes. He likes to drive around in nice cars. He is very well 
manicured. He's well coiffed. He's your typical well-groomed mob guy." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, testifying before the Senate subcommittee, said Petti was "the top 
organized crime figure in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
And Bob Morehouse, supervisor of the organized crime unit for the California 
Department of Justice, echoed that sentiment. "He's a major figure in San 
Diego," Morehouse said. "Maybe the major figure." 
</P>
<P>
One person who gravitated to Petti was Robert Benjamin, a 20-year associate 
with an extensive arrest record dating to 1951. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federal affidavit filed in connection with the 
money-laundering arrests this month, Benjamin was a confidential government 
informant and told investigators how he had "been involved with Petti in 
bookmaking, loan sharking, extortion and other illegal activities." Benjamin 
played a key role in introducing Petti to an undercover FBI agent posing as the 
representative of drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, the Las Vegas attorney representing Petti in the money-laundering 
case, said he was eager to confront Benjamin in a trial as one of the key 
government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a squeaky voice," Goodman said. "I'm going to eat him up for lunch 
and maybe even spit him out. That's how I feel about him." 
</P>
<P>
The government, in its affidavit and request to hold Petti without bail in the 
money-laundering case, alleged he has been active in trying to extort money 
from individuals reportedly in debt to the late Spilotro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbery Plan Claimed 
</P>
<P>
The government also contends that Petti had been planning the armed robbery of 
an elaborate illegal bookmaking operation in Las Vegas run by an individual 
known only as "Marty the Jew," and that Petti had helped enlist the efforts of 
alleged strongman Carmen DiNunzio to help him. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges there was repeated discussion about Petti being paid for 
his involvement in setting up the meetings between the undercover agent, who 
said he had money to launder, and Silberman, who allegedly came to Petti 
seeking some business. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Petti and Silberman, and their string of alleged 
telephone conversations and meetings at a Denny's restaurant downtown, is at 
the heart of the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
According to the money-laundering affidavit, Silberman at one time told the 
undercover FBI agent that his reason for wanting to move money surreptitiously 
was because "I just wanted a little diversification and that's why I went to 
Chris." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boasted of Friendship 
</P>
<P>
Petti allegedly boasted about his friendship with Silberman, according to the 
affidavit. The document describes a meeting between Petti and the undercover 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"Petti explained that he had a wealthy associate who was a founder of the Jack 
in the Box restaurants and who was a prominent member of the Democratic Party 
having served in the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown," the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
"Petti said that this individual had a way to get money out of the country 
which involved purchasing private stock which is held in trust accounts in 
Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says the undercover agent asked Petti if he trusted Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
"Petti said that he trusted this individual and personally vouched for his 
trustworthiness," the affidavit says. 
</P>

<P>
Three men and a woman were injured in a drive-by shooting early Sunday when 
gunfire that came from a slow-moving car sprayed a crowd of people standing in 
a restaurant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were taken to Paradise Valley Hospital in National City, where one 
was admitted and the other three were treated for minor injuries. The hospital 
declined to identify the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Nate Caplan said the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m. in the 
parking lot of Huffman's Barbecue, 5039 Imperial Ave. 
</P>
<P>
He said the victims were shot as a cream-color car drove slowly through the 
parking lot and its occupants opened fire on the group of people standing 
there. He said one witness followed the car after it sped away, and later led 
police to a pistol discarded by the suspects.

'A SIGNAL FOR SHAMIR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yasser Arafat's "recognition of Israel" can be compared with a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
We constantly read in the media (editorial) that Israel "occupies" the 
territories of the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
When will the media, including The Times, and our State Department cease 
referring to the West Bank and Gaza as "occupied territories"? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it clear that for some 22 years Israel has been administering territories 
which it won decisively in self-defense under pressure from surrounding 
belligerent Arab countries? 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that Israel must work out a system of rapprochement with Arab 
residents within the borders finalized at the conclusion of the 1967 Six Day 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially those of us not living within the borders of such a tiny 
country as Israel, could possibly experience the pressure of life and the 
feeling of insecurity as the Israelis do under the constant threat of 
annihilation by its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Poppycock to the suggestion of "land for peace." Peace as a promise from any 
Arab government is only a fantasy as perceived by those who want to believe in 
unrealities. Arab leaders are as stable and expendable as yesterday's bread. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Israel remains strong the wolves will stay away from her door, and 
U.S. interests and influence will be protected by its staunchest and only 
friend in the Middle East, Israel.

PAYING TAXES AND THE IRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hip, hip, hooray for Kevin Phillips! ("Taxes Reformed, Taxes Resented," 
Opinion, April 9.) I hope future presidential candidates took time out to read 
his insightful column on the unfair tax reform of 1986. Living in Orange 
County, I have seen how the top 1-5% have chosen to spend their unjustified 
"windfall," crowding the streets with BMWs, Mercedes and limousines. At the 
same time the federal government is throwing money at the rich, it is quickly 
withdrawing funds from student loans and grants -- making life miserable for 
students such as myself who don't have wealthy parents to fund our education. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly support re-establishment of the progressive income tax brackets, 
and hope that other frustrated and angry Americans will send a message to 
Washington that the time has come to let the middle income and poor get richer 
and have the rich take some punches for a change.

JAIL ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County chief probation officer Barry Nidorf's excellent column 
("Practical Alternatives to Jail's Fast Shuffle," Op-Ed Page, March 20) points 
up a most effective (yet underused) approach for combatting the crime and 
substance abuse problems that have made our city streets a battlefield. Jail 
and prison time alone, in part because these institutions are overcrowded, are 
only useful for incapacitating most offenders for brief periods of time. As 
Nidorf points out "house arrest," "work sentencing," and "work furlough" 
programs should be better funded to develop methodologies for nonviolent 
offenders who can be rehabilitated. By placing more tractable convicted 
criminal in close surveillance, community programs will leave more room in our 
jails and prisons for those dangerous offenders who need to be incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
I would add a further dimension to Nidorf's important recommendations. Vigorous 
law enforcement and imprisonment are only partial and temporary solutions to 
the problem. Recent research reveals that around 70% of criminals arrested 
commit drug-related crimes. For many of these offenders, some form of mandatory 
drug addiction rehabilitation should be made part of their "community 
sentence." In particular, there are a number of excellent therapeutic community 
programs for treating substance abusers now available in Los Angeles County, 
including Delancey Street, Phoenix House, and several at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
These programs, if properly funded through our outstanding Los Angeles County 
Probation Department, could become part of a comprehensive community approach 
that could help solve our overall homicide, gang, and addiction crime problems.

'A SIGNAL FOR SHAMIR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "To Reach a 2-State Solution, Israeli Doves Must Be Heard," by 
Prof. Yehoshafat Harkabi, Op-Ed Page, April 4: 
</P>
<P>
Harkabi's is a 3-state not a "2-state solution" -- two Arab Palestinian states 
and one Jewish Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was created by Britain in 1922, and -- occupying 80% of the "Jewish 
homeland" purportedly assured to the Jews by its League of Nations mandate and 
prior Balfour Declaration -- is an Arab Palestinian state. It is 70% 
Palestinian in population. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to that Arab Palestinian state occupying 80% of Palestine, a half of the 
remaining 20%, by converting the 10% which is Israel's last security in depth, 
i.e., the "territories," to which Harkabi refers, into another Arab Palestinian 
state, is a recipe for war, not peace. 
</P>
<P>
For that 10% which Harkabi would give for another Arab Palestinian state 
contains the Jordan River crossing, heights and passes; the holder is in a 
position to cut off Israel's capital, Jerusalem, its water and principal food 
sources. And to cut Israel at its narrow waistline along the sea. It includes 
also the seacoast salient leading from Egypt into Israel (Gaza). 
</P>
<P>
And Harkabi is dreaming, indeed, when he analogizes the Arab world, in which 
rule is by despots or anarchy (Lebanon) -- to possible membership with 
democratic Israel, of a "common market, Benelux or confederation."

Water policies for California remain as uncertain and tumultuous as they were 
during the bitter 1982 Peripheral Canal referendum. Northern-Southern 
California divisions, conflicts between environmentalists and the water 
industry and growing tensions between urban and agricultural users all reflect 
the lack of consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the uncertainty is based on the erosion of water industry clout -- 
exercised by a longstanding coalition of public agencies and private interests. 
This coalition recently has demonstrated a declining aptitude for setting the 
water agenda. Water-industry lobbying groups, such as the Assn. of California 
Water Agencies, continue to argue the need to build and expand. But the cost 
and the environmental consequences of constructing new, large-scale water 
development projects no longer generate automatic support from the Legislature, 
the media or the public. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the turmoil of current water politics, we see the possibility of a 
new type of alliance based on the development of emerging social movements in 
both urban and rural communities. These are movements concerned with the 
quality of daily life, growth and development issues, the continuing expansion 
of the urban megalopolis and the agribusiness empires of the Central Valley and 
the need for a new ethic of respect for the land and for community or 
neighborhood. The hazards of chemical-intensive agricultural production, urban 
expansion and water development are key issues for a new urban/agricultural 
water alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance can play a crucial role in establishing what the staff of the 
state Water Resource Control Board has called "a new water ethic." Such a water 
ethic would consist of the following guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The greater the use, the higher the price. The current pricing structure in 
the state and federal water systems is neither fair nor efficient. The big 
price breaks given large-scale farm businesses encourage industrial-like 
farming operations, heavy pesticide use, farming of marginal lands and 
employment of farm laborers working under serf-like conditions. In urban areas, 
the prevalent approach is to charge the same rate to everyone -- including new 
users such as developers in outlying areas and big users such as industry and 
owners of large-estate homes. 
</P>
<P>
A more equitable and efficient system would operate on the principle of the 
greater the use, the higher the price. In agriculture, water subsidies would be 
strictly limited to 960 acres or less to protect and encourage smaller, 
residential family farmers, while larger water users would be charged a 
substantially higher price. These would include farm-management arrangements 
that have been used to mask larger farm holdings. In the cities, small 
residential water users would be protected while the largest and newest users 
would pay higher fees, reflecting the additional costs they bring to bear on 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A rural community betterment fund. In the last several years, talk of water 
transfers or sale of water by agricultural to urban users has become popular. 
Such a proposal often benefits the major owners who control most of the land 
and thus the water rights to the land. But there has been little discussion of 
how to protect the people and communities whose livelihoods depend on 
agriculture. Water transfers from agriculture to urban users can depress rural 
communities by eliminating jobs and taking lands off the tax rolls. A community 
betterment fund established through transfer or sales proceeds and controlled 
by local rural communities would be a good starting point to address those 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Water quality as a priority. The issue of water quality has become a 
dominant concern of urban residents. Less known is the pollution of water 
supplies in rural areas, where thousands of wells have been contaminated by 
pesticides. The water agencies, in the business of development and expansion, 
have to reorder their priorities to place water quality at the top. That 
requires a major effort aimed at reducing or eliminating the use of high 
volumes of pesticides, industrial solvents and industrial and commercial 
chemicals that are the major culprits of our deteriorating water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greater accountability: opening up the water industry. Water agencies are 
some of our most unaccountable and inaccessible public decision-making bodies. 
Elections are undemocratic, decisions are made without public input, and the 
water agencies function in a kind of "clubby" atmosphere with their 
private-interest counterparts. The inner workings of water agencies have to be 
opened to the public, the media and the Legislature. Water agency elections 
with one person/one vote would be a good starting point. Such a system would 
replace current practices, such as one acre/one vote for many irrigation 
districts and the appointment, instead of election, of urban agency directors. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the turmoil in water policy today, certain urban environmentalists and 
legislators have called for a Northern California-Southern California urban 
water alliance against the Central Valley. That is a mistake, one that is both 
polarizing and shows a lack of sensitivity to rural issues and agriculture. 
Many small family farmers are at the forefront of a new land ethic, farming 
without chemicals in an environmentally sensitive manner. Urban residents share 
some of these same values placed in an urban context. A dialogue has to be 
established, creating a new understanding: The interests in protecting the land 
and those who work it are compatible with protecting communities and the people 
who live there and drink the water. We all want to be safe.

A GEORGIA FOR THE GEORGIANS IS SUDDENLY NOT SO SOVIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD GRIGOR SUNY, Ronald Grigor Suny is a professor of modern Armenian and 
Soviet history at the University of Michigan and author of The Making of the 
Georgian Nation (Indiana University Press and Hoover Institution Press, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreigners have most often seen the people of Soviet Georgia as carefree and 
proud, extraordinarily generous, lavish in their sharing their piquant cuisine 
and rich wines. Their spas and beaches have become a favorite vacation retreat 
for Soviet citizens less favored by sun and mountains. And whatever prejudices 
linger about Georgian entrepreneurs overcharging for fruits and flowers in 
Moscow markets, Russians have usually viewed their southern neighbors as an 
exotic people of passion and daring. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last week these unexamined biases and romantic images evaporated 
when a bloody clash between Soviet troops and Georgian nationalist 
demonstrators in the capital, Tbilisi, left at least 19 dead and hundreds 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The killings have created a major new crisis for Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a native Georgian 
and former Communist Party chief in the republic. More than a local flare-up of 
nationalism, the Georgian protests are a test of the limits of Gorbachev's 
democratization, a trial for peaceful reform and a warning that the aspirations 
of non-Russians could very well bring down the program of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
After 68 years under Soviet control, Georgians have evolved into a compact, 
self-conscious nation prepared to defend their language, territorial integrity 
and cultural dominance in their republic. With the coming of glasnost, 
subterranean nationalists emerged from the ranks of dissent into the legal and 
semi-legal political arena. Cultural and political groups such as the Ilya 
Chavchavadze societies (named after the leading nationalist poet of the last 
century) and the National Democratic Party (modeled for a pre-Soviet 
nationalist party) appeared with their own newspapers and platforms. All shared 
the common program of cultural resistance to Russian inroads and greater 
political control in local hands, but some went further than others in calling 
for secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Georgians are a nation profoundly aware of their ancient history, beginning in 
the 3rd Century BC. Early in the 4th Century AD, Georgia adopted Christianity 
and, with its neighbors, Armenia and Caucasian Albania, found itself in time on 
the exposed frontier facing militant Islam. For more than a thousand years 
Georgians lived in uneasy coexistence with the Muslims of Iran and Turkey, 
often retaining a degree of political autonomy, always maintaining their unique 
ethnic culture and language. Dominance by shahs and sultans and division among 
empires did not prevent medieval Georgia from developing a rich literature or 
providing a haven for non-Georgians escaping the ravages of nomadic invaders. 
</P>
<P>
Unity, however, generally eluded the Georgians until the coming of the Russians 
at the beginning of the 19th Century. Russian rule -- like Soviet power after 
1921 -- brought Georgians together under a single political authority and began 
a long social transformation that ended the village isolation of most of its 
population. With czarist administration came relative peace and security, 
commerce and the growth of towns. European learning, through a Russian filter, 
stimulated Georgians to develop their own sense of modern nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet rule, Georgia lost is political sovereignty and the possibility of 
expressing its nationalist aspirations. But at the same time Soviet nationality 
policy encouraged the "nativization" of the Soviet republics. Armenians, who 
before the revolution had controlled the towns of Georgia economically and 
politically, now drifted to their own Soviet republic. Georgians were favored 
in hiring, and membership in the local Communist Party overrepresented the 
percentage of Georgians in the population. So rather than being Russified like 
the Ukrainian, Belorussian and Baltic republics, Georgia became ever more 
Georgian. Its people developed a coherent national consciousness that stressed 
the need to preserve their language and cultural heritage. They took pride in 
their native son, Josef Stalin, who though he presided over the worst years of 
national repression, forced collectivization and the purging of the Georgian 
intelligentsia, nevertheless was admired as the man who had transformed the 
whole Soviet Union from a largely agricultural to a primarily industrial Great 
Power and successfully resisted the Nazi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter century, however, Georgia suffered from a notorious 
corruption, a flagrant wheeling and dealing in a widespread underground 
economy. Shevardnadze governed the republic from 1972 to 1985 and tried to 
cleanse the country of the worst abuses. Nationalist sentiment steadily grew, 
and in 1978 protests forced Shevardnadze to concede that Georgian would remain 
the officially designated language of the republic. But that same year the 
Abkhazians, a Muslim minority with their own autonomous republic within the 
republic of Georgia, condemned Georgian misrule and petitioned to join the 
Russian republic. Their demands were rejected by Moscow, even as their 
complaints were recognized as legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
This March, the Abkhazians once again raised their demand to join the Russian 
republic, fueling anxieties about Georgia's future. Thousands heeded the cries 
of nationalist intellectuals that Georgia was in danger. A month earlier about 
15,000 had marched to mark the anniversary of the loss of Georgian 
independence. (When the Communists came to power in Russia, the Georgian Social 
Democrats led the country to a short-lived independence that ended with a Red 
Army invasion in 1921.) Now in early April, more than 100,000 were filling the 
streets and squares of central Tbilisi to call for autonomy or independence. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony, of course, of this new nationalism is that it was fostered by 
consolidation under the Soviets and later unleashed by Gorbachev's initiatives. 
It now presents the greatest potential threat to his embryonic democracy.

AT SEDER, A DIFFERENT IMAGE FOR ISRAEL; 
</P>
<P>
TO IGNORE PALESTINIAN CRY IS TO INVITE PLAGUES OF PHARAOH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR WASKOW, Arthur Waskow is a faculty member of the Reconstructionist 
Rabbinical College in Philadelphia and the author of Seasons of Our Joy 
(Summit, 1985) and The Freedom Seder in Ramparts Magazine (1969). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For millennia the Passover Seder has given the Jewish people a mirror of 
ourselves. In that mirror we have seen a band of slaves who, with God's help, 
resisted Pharaoh and won perhaps the first great human victory for freedom. 
Because of that mirror we have kept on seeing ourselves, not once but in every 
generation as those who continue to resist all Pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
But this year the Seder will be different from all others Seders. When we look 
into its mirror we will see, as always, the image of ourselves as those who 
resisted Pharaoh. But shadowed in the mirror's depths will be another image: a 
hint of Pharaoh's own grim countenance within our own, a fear that some element 
of Pharaoh may live within us, too, a fear that we might learn to act like 
Pharaoh. 
</P>
<P>
For this past year we have known that another people -- the Palestinians of the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- are seeking to win their freedom: their freedom 
from us. 
</P>
<P>
We feel their pain -- the present suffering of people, including children, who 
are not only created in the image of God like all human beings but who in some 
ways are part of our own larger family; a family caught in rage and fear, 
precisely because both branches glimpse and fear the family resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
Why family? It is not only biblical archetype and tradition, teaching that the 
one people are the children of Abraham through his wife Hagar and their son 
Ishmael, and the other the children of Abraham through his wife Sarah and their 
son Isaac. In the present, the two peoples have had an agonizing family 
resemblance -- each loving the same land, each denying the other's right to the 
land. Only recently have the Palestinians given up their desire to drive out 
their cousins, and instead called out the ancient cry, "Let our people go!" 
</P>
<P>
Now that they have, more and more Jews are remembering what happens when a 
government ignores that cry. We fear that if Israeli policy toward the 
Palestinians does not change, then upon Israel itself and the Jewish people may 
be visited such plagues as grew from the hardheartedness and hardheadedness of 
Pharaoh, when he ignored that outcry. These were plagues that did not end until 
Pharaoh and his army lay defeated, shattered on the Red Sea sands. 
</P>
<P>
What is the career of Pharaoh? At first, he hardens his own heart against the 
sufferings of the Israelites and their demands for freedom. When they persist 
and when God -- the very truth and power of the universe -- closes in upon him 
with the first few plagues, he hardens his heart and head still more. 
</P>
<P>
And then God takes over. Pharaoh loses the ability to choose. Even when his own 
advisers say to him, "You are destroying Egypt!" he cannot change. Now it is 
God who hardens his heart -- against the sufferings of the Egyptians as well as 
those of the Israelites. Now God -- Reality -- is turning Pharaoh's rigidity, 
which he thinks will save him, into what will actually destroy him. What began 
as choice ends as addiction. 
</P>
<P>
For this past year the government of Israel has chosen hardness, over and over 
-- even though 54% of the Israeli public now supports talking with the PLO to 
see whether it is serious about making peace with Israel. As a result, plagues 
have begun to descend upon Israel. Disaffection among Israeli Arabs. 
Disaffection in the army, where some officers have refused to serve in the 
occupied territories. Disaffection in American public opinion. Economic 
strains. 
</P>
<P>
If we want to prevent the recent choices of hardheartedness from becoming an 
addiction to hardheartedness, the addiction that brings down even worse plagues 
upon us, what must we do? 
</P>
<P>
What would be a cautious and openhearted policy on the part of the Israeli 
government? It could simply say that it accepts, as a victory for Israel and 
for common sense, the Palestine Liberation Organization's long-delayed 
recognition of Israel; that it sees as its own goal the achievement of legal 
and physical guarantees of Israeli security (for example, through 
demilitarization of the West Bank and Gaza), and that without prejudging the 
question of diplomatic recognition, it is ready to meet informally with 
representatives of the new Palestinian "state" in order to discuss the 
conditions under which formal negotiations might occur. 
</P>
<P>
And we American Jews -- what do we do? If our goal is real change, we must keep 
in mind how vigorous we were and how effective we became when we insisted that 
the Israeli government forgo making changes in the "Who is a Jew" laws. 
Everything we did then would be relevant now. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we begin? Passover is upon us. In that great mirror of our peoplehood, 
we must create a version of ourselves that is not Pharaoh and is not Pharaoh's 
victim, which instead reaches out to our cousins, the children of Abraham and 
Hagar. 
</P>
<P>
In the great Passover tradition, let us ask ourselves these questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is this Passover night different from every other? 
</P>
<P>
Because on every other Passover, we call out to another people -- "Let our 
people go!" -- and tonight another people calls out to us: "Let our people go!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why does the Torah teach: "When a stranger lives-as-a-stranger with you in 
your land, you shall not oppress him. The stranger who lives-as-a-stranger 
(hager hagar) with you shall be as one of your citizens; you shall love him as 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"For you were strangers in the Land of Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why do we break the matzo in half? 
</P>
<P>
Because the bread of affliction becomes the bread of freedom when we share it. 
Because the land that gives bread to two peoples must be divided in two, so 
that both peoples may eat of it. So long as one people grasps the whole land, 
it is a land of affliction. When each people can eat from part of the land, it 
will become a land of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why do we dip herbs twice, once in salt water and once in sweet charoset? 
</P>
<P>
For the tears of two peoples, Israeli and Palestinian; for the sweetness of two 
peoples, Palestinian and Israeli; for the future of both peoples, who must 
learn not to repeat the sorrows of the past but to create the joys of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is there an egg upon the Pesach plate? 
</P>
<P>
It is the egg of birthing. When we went forth from Egypt -- Mitzrayim, the 
Narrow Place -- and came to break the waters of the Red Sea, it was the birth 
time of our people, the People of Israel; and today we are witnessing the birth 
of freedom for another people, the People of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Seder table this Passover, perhaps we can begin to explore a new 
theology of the land, one that would understand it as twice-promised land, both 
to the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael. Promised twice as a test 
put to both peoples: Can we, precisely because we are intended to be in some 
sense "model" or "chosen" peoples, learn to share this little land so that the 
many peoples of the human race can learn to share the great unboundaried Earth?

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI MAN STABBED AFTER POOLROOM FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A20-year-old Simi Valley resident was stabbed early Sunday by men he had 
earlier tangled with in a poolroom fistfight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three suspects was arrested Sunday afternoon, but the others 
remained at large, Simi Valley Police Sgt. Ken Tacke said. Police arrested 
Jorge Hernandez, a Simi Valley resident in his mid-twenties, on suspicion of 
attempted murder, Tacke said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not provide further details of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Sgt. Arch Morgan said the victim, Juan Martinez, was sitting 
with a friend in his car in the driveway of his home in the 1800 block of Royal 
Avenue at about 4:30 a.m. when another vehicle pulled up behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the three assailants got out of the second vehicle and broke out 
the windows in the passenger and driver sides of Martinez's car. One of the 
three assailants stabbed Martinez twice in the chest before the three fled. The 
friend was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and the three men had fought at a pool hall earlier, police said. 
Morgan said the assailants had apparently followed Martinez home. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was in satisfactory condition at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, he 
said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MEN WOUNDED IN DISPUTE OVER DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three young men were shot and wounded while riding in a vehicle on a Northridge 
street early Sunday after a shouting match in which the assailants accused them 
of driving too slowly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Don Kitchen said the three gunshot victims range in age 
from 18 to 23 and live in the Devonshire area. A fourth victim was hit by 
flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen said the victims were heading west on Lassen Street east of Balboa 
Boulevard about 1:30 a.m. when a blue, late model Japanese-made car came up 
from behind them. Five men in the second car began shouting and making hand 
gestures at the victims, indicating they were driving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
A man in the second car leaned out a window and began shooting with a handgun, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen said the shooting did not appear to be gang-related. But he declined to 
identify the victims for fear of their safety. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was hit in the neck and shoulder and a second was hit in the 
shoulder. They were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where 
the more seriously injured man remained in stable condition Sunday. The other 
man was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The third man, who was hit in the right elbow, was treated at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center and then released.

ENSURING SEDER MEAL FOR NEEDY JEWISH FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 needy Jewish families and individuals will have a chance to celebrate 
Passover in style -- with a traditional seder meal of kosher chicken, gefilte 
fish, borscht, applesauce, matzo meal and other delicacies donated Sunday by 
five San Fernando Valley lodges of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 volunteers worked from 8 a.m. to noon delivering the food baskets, 
which also contained kosher dish-cleaning fluid, a wool blanket and a bottle of 
wine. In addition, the baskets contained a Haggada, the book read at seder that 
includes the biblical narrative of the Jews' exodus from slavery in Egypt in 
search of a homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Seder is the festive meal that marks the beginning of Passover, which begins at 
sundown Wednesday. The eight-day holiday commemorates the biblical account in 
which God spared the Jews from the last of 10 plagues against Egypt, where the 
Jews had been living in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Other items donated included oranges, apples, grapefruit, tea, sugar, honey, 
onions and eggs, said David Kaye, community chairman for the Encino lodge of 
B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid at Easter, Christmas 
</P>
<P>
"We do this every year for Passover," said Mike Singer, ways and means vice 
president at the lodge. "We do similar things for Easter and Christmas for 
other denominations. People who observe a holiday should not be denied the 
privilege of observing the holiday because of financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers spent Saturday packing the boxes, which were delivered Sunday 
directly to needy Jews living in the Valley, Santa Monica, Venice and the 
Fairfax District, Singer said. Volunteers picked up the baskets behind Gelson's 
Food Market at Reseda and Ventura boulevards in Tarzana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each food basket consisted of two boxes of goods, with a retail value of more 
than $50, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first house I went to, the man was retarded and the woman looked like she 
was retarded, too," Singer said. "What depressed me was the condition of the 
house. It was so bare. It looked like a threadbare coat. You see people like 
that and your heart goes out to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lodges' Participation 
</P>
<P>
The effort was organized by the Encino lodge, said Kaye, who has been 
coordinating the "Passover Food Basket Program" for 14 years. The Kadima, 
Rishon, Van Nuys and Haavarim lodges -- all in the Valley -- also participated 
in the effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye said the lodges paid for the food baskets with money raised at B'nai 
B'rith fund-raisers held throughout the year. He said the 103 baskets donated 
by the Encino lodge alone cost at least $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye said the Passover food baskets represent only one part of the lodges' 
year-round donations to a host of social agencies, which include churches and 
drug rehabilitation centers. 
</P>
<P>
He said only about 20% of donations are made to Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see color, we don't see race, religion, or anything," Singer said. 
"People qualify if they're needy. That's what we're here for."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEMORIAL SERVICE HELD FOR SLAYING VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relatives of three victims of confessed killer Robert A. Berdella gathered at a 
Raytown, Mo., church to memorialize one of the victims, a Canoga Park man. 
</P>
<P>
The service Saturday at Spring Valley Baptist Church was held four years to the 
day that Robert A. Sheldon was asphyxiated at Berdella's home. Sheldon was the 
second of six young men that Berdella confessed last year to torturing and 
killing in his house between July 6, 1984, and Aug. 5, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's skull and some teeth were found in Berdella's house. The skull of 
another man, Larry Pearson of Wichita, was later found buried in Berdella's 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the other victims -- Mark Wallace, Todd Stoops, Walter James 
Ferris and Gerald D. Howell -- were not recovered. Berdella told investigators 
that the bodies were buried in a city landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Berdella pleaded guilty to killing the men and is serving a life sentence 
without parole in the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Sheldon of Canoga Park had said that he and his ex-wife had planned 
to bury their son in California, but then decided to have the service in 
Missouri as a memorial to Berdella's victims and their families. Burial was in 
Mount Moriah Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, his ex-wife, Connie Sheldon of Arleta, and their daughter, Tammy 
Martinez of Sun Valley, were among the two dozen people who attended the 
service. Parents of two other of Berdella's victims, Ferris and Howell, also 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon also is survived by two brothers, Michael Sheldon and Jeffrey Sheldon 
of Arleta; his paternal grandparents and his maternal grandfather.

LATC'S 'MINAMATA' IS CONFUSING, CAPTIVATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reza Abdoh throws images and sounds across the stage like a kid playing 52 
pick-up. 
</P>
<P>
In "Minamata," at Los Angeles Theatre Center, those images and sounds sometimes 
coalesce into arresting patterns that begin to make a giant statement about the 
cultural imperatives that plunder our planet. 
</P>
<P>
Just as often, though, the primary purpose appears to be to show off the 
fecundity of Abdoh's imagination and the extraordinary versatility of his cast. 
This isn't an entirely unworthy goal, but it's not on a par with helping to 
save the world. Abdoh's show-off impulse also leads to moments when his 
internal editor completely gives up the ghost, and confusion reigns. 
</P>
<P>
Even at its worst, however, this is a remarkable production, as fascinating as 
it is frustrating. It signals that some of our home-grown theater artists are 
ready to venture beyond the blue horizon of familiar forms and ambitions, 
across the frontiers of the art. 
</P>
<P>
The title is taken from the Japanese fishing town that was the victim of 
mercury contamination by a chemical company. Yet the events at Minamata are 
only the springboard for director Abdoh and his co-writer Mira-Lani Oglesby. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, a self-described lawyer (Mark Rosenblatt) -- without naming 
names -- refers to the famous photojournalistic account of the aftermath of the 
Minamata poisoning, by W. Eugene Smith and Aileen M. Smith, and more or less 
dismisses it: 
</P>
<P>
"Pictures are symbols. And through pictures, information becomes symbols. 
Symbols are forgettable. Aesthetic. This play wants to be more than aesthetic. 
It wants to be more than about some crazy diseased cats and Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
Well, this "Minamata" (as opposed to the book of the same title by the Smiths) 
is surely about more than Minamata. But it's ironic that the Abdoh/Oglesby text 
sneers at the "aesthetic" as "forgettable," for Abdoh's work is many times more 
"aesthetic" and symbol-laden (and ultimately, more forgettable) than is the 
Smiths' book. The aroma of artiness is in the air at LATC as it never is in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know what actually happened at Minamata, or if you want to 
empathize with the suffering of the people of Minamata, go to the book, not to 
the theater. Which is evidently what Abdoh and Oglesby themselves did, as they 
later cite the Smiths' descriptions of the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, you want to make the connections between the poisoning 
of Minamata and, say, the deforestation of the Amazon jungle or the 
computerization of telephone operators' jobs, then Abdoh is your guide. Which 
is not to say that every connection rings true, but that he does attempt to 
paint the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
Characters from Minamata are represented here, but they are altered to fit 
Abdoh's larger aims and his heightened style. For example, the Minamata birth 
defects are depicted when a stocky man in drag (Tony Abatemarco) gives birth to 
a mutant baby girl who's played by a naked man (Ken Roht). The characterization 
of the company doctor (Mark Christopher Lawrence) who first suspects the source 
of the poisoning is so distorted that first-time viewers may not realize he's 
the company doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, large pieces of Abdoh's staging are so hectic and unfocused that 
first-time viewers will miss much of what's going on. Our eyes are repeatedly 
diverted from the essential to the extraneous; in some scenes, actors appear to 
do calisthenics on the periphery of our field of vision, as if Abdoh 
deliberately wants to splinter our attention. I had the luxury of seeing the 
show twice over the weekend; much of it clicked only upon second viewing, but 
some of it remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
What works best, the first time out, are the musical numbers, whether directly 
related to the Minamata tale (a haunting Japanese funeral song) or not 
(abstract dances which depict an increasingly mechanized world or a spirited 
folk-rock rendition of "Kentucky Woman"). Composer Fredric Myrow and 
choreographer Rene Olivas Gubernick provide the lyricism and the pulse which 
keep this show moving even through its thorniest patches. 
</P>
<P>
The performances also remain focused even when the text doesn't. As a spectral 
Expert Witness, who descends from above like a modern-day Hitler, Tom 
Fitzpatrick embodies the forces of dehumanization with crisp precision. 
Abatemarco is howlingly funny. Boyish-looking Andy Taylor leaps effortlessly 
from rigorous gymnastics to playing the cello to playing the saxophone. 
Lawrence has a booming voice and presence that converts quickly into an 
ineffectual whine, when the occasion calls for it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the women, Maureen Kelly's supercilious doctor's wife contributes much of 
the evening's comedy. Karole Foreman is a bundle of concentrated energy, even 
(or especially) in the nude. Semina DeLaurentis and Emily Kuroda unfortunately 
get the bulk of the responsibility for intoning straightforward information, 
but they do it with dispatch and a sense of irony. 
</P>
<P>
Timian Alsaker's blond wood platform adds a welcome note of simplicity, and 
lighting/projections designers Douglas D. Smith and Bradford Fowler add a 
parade of evocative images to the backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St., Los Angeles, Tuesdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., 
Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., through May 21. Tickets: $22-$25; (213)

BOBBY BROWN: A SOUL IN MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Laaaaadddddiessssss!" singer Bobby Brown shrieked passionately at the packed 
Forum Friday night. "Laaaaaaddddieeeeesssss, listen to me!" 
</P>
<P>
Brown didn't have to yell. He already had the ladies' attention. 
</P>
<P>
By then the slender singer's shirt was off and his silky, baggy pants were 
shimmying down his legs, revealing skin-tight, Spandex shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the show, the hottest male soul singer to come along in the last few 
years was constantly removing his shirt, dropping his pants and doing 
bumps-and-grinds. You'd have thought he was headlining at Chippendale's rather 
than the Forum. In concert all of Brown's songs -- even the hits "Don't Be 
Cruel" and "My Prerogative" -- were just vehicles for his steamy antics. 
</P>
<P>
Brown started his show the way any 20-year-old egomaniacal superstar would -- 
descending to the stage on a throne, bragging that he was about to tear the 
roof off the hall. From then on, he was in perpetual motion, dancing and racing 
across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
As a concert singer, though, Brown is a lightweight. His mediocre vocals were 
mercifully drowned out by his large, ear-splitting band. 
</P>
<P>
The former New Edition member makes excellent records -- his "Don't Be Cruel" 
was one of last year's best albums -- but compared to greats like Marvin Gaye, 
Otis Redding, Teddy Pendergrass and Prince, he falls short as a singer. Still, 
there's an edgy, sexual energy coursing through his vocals. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the show Brown acted like a star-struck kid, inviting celebrities 
like Chaka Khan, Sheila E., Eazy-E and New Edition on stage for a chaotic jam 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, he was claiming to be a man of God, inviting the audience to join him 
in a prayer. For the women in the audience, that somber, religious monologue 
must have hit like a cold shower. 
</P>
<P>
Was his point that even though he comes across as a macho, sex-crazed 
egomaniac, he's really a saintly, caring guy underneath? Talk about your mixed 
messages! 
</P>
<P>
Brown was preceded by LeVert, a trio best known for a superbly sensual tune 
called "Casanova." The crowd responded mostly to the high-voltage dance music 
and didn't seem to care that these guys are inept live singers. 
</P>
<P>
By far the best singer on the Forum stage Friday night was Karyn White, the 
magnetic, prodigiously talented young singer who preceded LeVert and stirred up 
the audience with sizzling performances of her two big hits, "The Way You Love 
Me" and "Superwoman."

FELD BALLET NOVELTIES IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music/Dance Critic

<TEXT>
<P>
Eliot Feld -- whose company of 21 energetic young dancers opened a rare 
Southern California engagement at Symphony Hall on Friday -- has come a long 
way since he choreographed "The Consort" in 1970. No one who knows his facile, 
prolific and provocative output doubts that. 
</P>
<P>
The very mixed mixed-bill that served as his calling card here left some doubt, 
however, as to whether Feld has come a long way forward. By following the 
inventive antics of "The Consort" with three dutiful genre pieces created in 
the past four years, it was inadvertently suggested that Feld may have gotten 
lost in a cutesy maze or stalled in a trendy cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
Don't misunderstand. One always has to acknowledge his wit and theatricality. 
One has to admire his musicality, even when it is applied to maddening 
minimalist repetition. One also must be impressed by the vigor and versatility, 
if not by the uniform technical authority, that he has coaxed from a robust new 
generation of dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, after all these years, one can ask if Feld has fulfilled his initial 
promise. When he emerged upon the scene, many experts were certain they had at 
last found the next Robbins, possibly the next Balanchine. Now there can be 
room for doubt. The worst skeptics think Feld may just be another Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Consort," he demonstrated an uncanny command of changing density and 
shifting proportion, plus a sly sense of irony. Perhaps most important, he 
showed a respect for climactic development. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet begins with some deft balletic abstraction of Renaissance court 
rituals. Gradually, the formality loosens, and the lofty manners sink to earth. 
The six busy couples concentrate -- with lusty, deftly focused bravado -- on 
basic libidinous interaction. The curtain falls, and not a moment too late, on 
an elegantly stylized peasant orgy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Feld may not have made any profound statements in "The Consort," his 
touch was emphatically secure, his purpose clear, his choice of tone certain. 
Similar claims cannot be made for "Asia" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
In this mildly beguiling little mishmash, he flirts simultaneously with subtle 
exotic kitsch, broad exotic-kitsch parody, fuzzy odes to Diaghilev and Fokine, 
shimmering gallic sensuality and Hollywood-harem cartoonery. In the end, the 
conflicting flirtations lead to contradictory frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
The musical inspiration is Ravel's "Sheherazade." But where the unidentified 
mezzo-soprano on the over-amplified tape recording sings gently of "assassins 
with smiles on their faces," Lynn Aaron as the crimson-sleeved odalisque in toe 
shoes plasters a grotesque wide-mouthed grimace on her pretty visage. It tells 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
Before the piece unwinds, Feld introduces a quartet of vamping or preening 
sorority priestesses and, anticlimactically, a self-absorbed slave-boy (Darren 
Gibson) who usurps the traditional cold-siren duties. There is a lot of arm in 
too many directions, both stylistic and emotive, for aesthetic comfort. 
Nevertheless, it is well crafted, and it certainly was well danced. 
</P>
<P>
In "Kore" (1988), Feld provided the sleek yet lush Buffy Miller with an 
indulgent solo to the irritatingly redundant accompaniment of Steve Reich's 
Music for Large Ensemble. This is Feld's seventh Reich ballet. With luck, it 
could be his last. 
</P>
<P>
The music thumps along mechanically for 15 minutes, bludgeoning the senses 
while the delicious Persephone, dressed by Willa Kim as a quaint figure lifted 
from a Greek vase, celebrates fertility and springtime her special way. Her 
way, in this case, involves an increasingly frantic yet regimented series of 
stock maneuvers: nervous flicks and twitches, arching propeller motions, 
willowy poses, weight-shifting sidesteps and measured collapses. It must be 
exhausting for the dancer. It definitely is exhausting for the observer. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-decreasing audience adored "The Jig Is Up" (1984), which closed the 
program. This is, if nothing else, a crowd-pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
Irish and Scottish music, courtesy of recordings by the Bothy Band and John 
Cunningham, provides the rocky impetus for a suite of eight gutsy-cutesy 
exercises. The folk element here is appropriately synthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-working participants -- decked out in Kim's designer-chic unisex rags 
and sneakers -- wag their hands, kick and flail, prance and smirk with 
virtuosic glee. At key moments, Allen Lee Hughes' lighting scheme turns them 
into animated silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 dancers bounce through Feld's ornate mock-jigs and athletic disco 
numbers feverishly. They also end up bouncing monotonously. It isn't their 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
The program sheet, incidentally, provided precious little background 
information. An apologetic note at the bottom blamed Performing Arts Network 
for "failing to deliver the program book." Perhaps the annotation will improve, 
along with the repertory, when the company returns for performances on Friday 
and Saturday.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
An editing error in Monday's Calendar distorted Martin Bernheimer's review of 
"Asia," as performed by the Feld Ballet in San Diego. As published, the passage 
read: "There is a lot of arm in too many directions, both stylistic and 
emotive, for aesthetic comfort." 
</P>
<P>
The passage should have read: "There is a lot of arm undulating, a lot of 
mock-Oriental posing, a lot of twisting, churning and limb-tangling among the 
lunging ladies. The communal silliness rambles in too many directions, both 
stylistic and emotive, for aesthetic comfort."

'AN INSPECTOR' CALLS ON HACKNEYED THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in "An Inspector Calls," a mystery at the Lamb's Players Theatre, the 
patriarch of a well-to-do British family in 1929 dismisses the socially 
responsible messages of George Bernard Shaw and Leo Tolstoy as so much 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
It's small mystery, then, when the Birling family learns that what we do to 
others will ultimately swing full circle and be done to us. 
</P>
<P>
This is ground well trod by the likes of Arthur Miller's "All My Sons" and, 
more recently, the movie "Jean de Florette." 
</P>
<P>
The moral is important and worth a reminder. But, despite a smooth execution 
under the direction of Robert Smyth, the twists will surprise only those 
unfamiliar with the genre. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector breaks in on a happy family party to bring news that a girl has 
committed suicide. All disclaim knowledge of the girl until, one by one, they 
recall that there was a young woman each of them had injured -- either by 
causing her to lose her job, by refusing her in need or, in the case of the 
men, by taking advantage of women who were both lonely and poor enough to be 
desperate for their money. 
</P>
<P>
The ironies drop as heavily as the message. The play is set at a time when the 
prosperous Birling family, living in the elegant set designed by Mike Buckley, 
foresees no more wars or hard times -- although we know better. The cast, 
admirably, navigates smoothly around the frequent melodramatic crags. 
</P>
<P>
Some heavy-handedness is scripted and can't be helped, as when David Cochran 
Heath, quietly and powerfully authoritative as the inspector, must lecture the 
family on what will happen to the world if we don't realize that humanity is 
one interconnected family. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Tulumello as the lush son Eric, who gets his big revelations near the end, 
becomes mired in excess, as if determined to milk his postponed catharsis with 
interest. Veronica Murphy Smith as the mother is locked into a caricature of 
controlling coldness, and Jim Holcomb as the father not only lacks the 
requisite assurance, but his enunciation comes off as a loser in an ongoing 
fight with the very words in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
But Luther Hanson is always smoothly appropriate as the smug young suitor 
Gerald Croft, and Christine Nicholson soars as his fiancee, Sheila, the first 
young Birling in whom the inspector manages to awaken a conscience. Whenever 
the spotlight is on this pair -- both veterans of the Lamb's Players' recent 
fine production of "Amadeus" -- they bring a crackle to the old formula that 
makes the show worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
"An Inspector Calls" runs through May 14 at the Lamb's Players Theatre, 500 
Plaza Blvd., National City. Shows are at 8 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday, 2 p.m. 
Saturdays, and 2 p.m. May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the general fascination with such multiple personalities as 
those examined in "Sibyl" or "The Three Faces of Eve" stems less from a 
fascination with the deviant than from a recognition of the multiple voices 
that can war inside even a healthy person? 
</P>
<P>
In the world premiere of "Strindberg Sonata," by Anne Bogart and Jeff Halpern 
at the Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts, a dozen UC San Diego 
actors play the inner voices in August Strindberg's mind during a time of 
crisis that the playwright himself labeled his "Inferno" period. 
</P>
<P>
That the effect is more musical than literary is both to the splendor and 
detriment of this grand conception. 
</P>
<P>
Like musical instruments, the ensemble -- none of whom is connected with any 
distinct role in the program -- take turns repeating certain lines like musical 
themes, with only the voices, inflections and volumes changing: 
</P>
<P>
"I put no faith in women. But I love them." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been expecting you . . . as one expects an accident." 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings are to be pitied." 
</P>
<P>
As in music, the effect is emotional, but in an abstract rather than personal 
way. Among the male and female characters wearing clothes of various degrees of 
constriction is a naked woman. And she, remarkably, for all her flaunted flesh, 
comes across as symbolically as the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Strindberg may recognize references to his plays and themes 
and pick up on the excerpts from operas (particularly Gounod's "Faust") and 
Swedish folk songs delivered in dance hall style. But without the benefit of a 
narrator or a guide, a la Virgil in Dante's "Inferno," there is no dramatic 
thread to aid the uninitiated in looking at Strindberg. This is a rarefied 
vision, one that scholars may appreciate more than lay people. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even those without a map as to what those behind the play envision in 
Strindberg's mind can enjoy moments of transcendent beauty akin to poetry being 
whisked into physical form. The cast, seven of whom are credited for their 
six-month involvement in the writing, bring the flawless precision of virtuoso 
instrumentalists to their craft. The voices are lovely, with Philip Larson's 
soaring above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The set, by J. Michael Griggs, is a brilliant evocation of a house with seven 
distinct rooms in which the actors launch into old battles, switching parts in 
the manner of those who have not learned from the past and so are condemned to 
repeat it. The complicated lighting demands of the many, shifting, often 
simultaneous scenes are served by Brenda Barkley Berry's lighting design with 
seemingly effortless perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Journeying through someone's personal hell -- even Strindberg's -- is no 
picnic. But for those who can last through the uninterrupted 90-minute show, 
there is a payoff for the repetitively mounting fury. 
</P>
<P>
The house, under the mounting pressure, splits, and a white light and mist 
draws the actors from the wreckage like lost souls toward a vision of heaven. 
</P>
<P>
When they return, there has been a sea change, but not as great as one might 
have hoped. They say the same things, but -- and this is crucial -- they say 
them differently -- gently and with love. That, too, seems like a brilliantly 
precise choice. 
</P>
<P>
Strindberg, after all, did continue to struggle after this period, following 
two failed marriages in his earlier life, with another failed in his later 
life. But there was a gentler, dreamier, more understanding aspect to his 
writing in this later period. 
</P>
<P>
The production, which celebrates Strindberg's questioning mind, touches off 
questions as to what led the writer to enter or exit his "Inferno" period. But 
it would be frustrating at best to explore this show for the clues. Like a 
musical sphinx, it charts the course beautifully, but without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Performances are at 8 p.m. Thursday-Sunday, except April 16, when it is at 7 
p.m. Through April 22. At the Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts, La 
Jolla.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A CELEBRATION OF BROUGHTON AND SINGER FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Celebrating Intimacy: James Broughton and Joel Singer," tonight's presentation 
at LACE at 8, includes films that Broughton, the pioneer avant-garde San 
Francisco film maker, made with Singer and several before their collaboration 
began over a decade ago. Broughton is a master at celebrating the body and the 
spirit in a harmonic blend of poetic words and images, and his work defines 
that which is erotic rather than pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
His films with Singer reveal a broader, deeper perspective with their concern 
for ritual and nature. Broughton and Singer, indeed, are film makers profoundly 
in touch with nature, self and each other. The selection of films ranges from 
Broughton's "The Golden Positions" (1970), a paean to the body's mobility, to a 
premiere of Broughton and Singer's "Scattered Remains" (1988), a mystical, even 
magical performance film featuring Broughton and directed by Singer. 
Information: (213) 276-7452, (714) 923-2441.

The Films of Werner Schroeter continues Tuesday at 8 p.m. at UCLA Melnitz with 
"Palermo or Wolfsburg" (1980). As in "The Kingdom of Naples" Schroeter once 
again projects a tragic view of life with compassion and a solemn beauty. An 
innocent, impoverished Sicilian youth (Nicolo Zarbo) is forced to leave home to 
seek work in Wolfsburg, West Germany, site of the vast Volkswagen works, and 
encounters a cold, hostile and totally alien society. 
</P>
<P>
"Haile Gerima: A Retrospective," which screens Wednesday through Friday at 
UCLA's Melnitz Theater, calls attention to an outstanding but little-known film 
maker. A 1976 recipient of a UCLA master's degree in cinema, the Ethiopian-born 
Gerima, currently a professor of film at Howard University, has made five 
features over the past 15 years and is soon to make another. Among them is 
"Harvest: 3,000 Years" (1976), which screens Friday at 7:30 p.m. with Gerima 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in Ethiopia in 1974 and '75, it is an epic saga of a rural way of life 
little changed over the millennia. At first the film seems much like Satyajit 
Ray's "Pather Panchali," but gradually it emerges as an increasingly angry and 
militant protest against the seemingly unending cycle of poverty and 
exploitation of the peasantry. 
</P>
<P>
It unfolds as a series of vignettes of daily life, including a heart-breaking 
sequence involving a mother's loss of her daughter in a flood, but two 
characters eventually dominate and clash. The first is a witty Don Quixote-like 
character, a visionary and a philosopher who lives under a bridge, having lost 
his land in the aftermath of the long-ago invasion by Mussolini's Italy. The 
other is a sleek, well-dressed petty tyrant, a man who spends his days on the 
veranda of his ramshackle wooden mansion, which looks for the world like one of 
the less pretentious Southern plantations. This man takes his pleasure in 
making life miserable for his tenant farmers, who are virtual slaves. Both 
these men are often comical, but Gerima's film ends as a dead-serious call for 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvest: 3,000 Years," which has been compared to "The Battle of Algiers" and 
the films of Alexander Dovzhenko, remains banned in Ethiopia and is the only 
feature Gerima has made there.

To everything there is a season and three early members of the 1960s folk-rock 
group the Byrds have filed a lawsuit to stop the group's original drummer, 
Michael Clarke, from using the band's name in ventures that don't include the 
other original band members. Former band members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby 
and Chris Hillman filed the lawsuit in Tampa federal court on Friday. The three 
performed a series of concerts in Los Angeles this year to try to solidify 
their right to the band's name. Clarke applied three months ago for exclusive 
rights to use the name and plans to tour as the Byrds, featuring Michael 
Clarke, his agent said. Named as defendants are Clarke, Artists International 
Management Inc. of Boca Raton and agent Steve Green. The lawsuit accuses Clarke 
and his associates of false advertising, unfair competition and deceptive trade 
practices. "Their intent is obviously to stop Michael from earning a living," 
Green said. "We think the whole thing stinks a mile high -- make that eight 
miles high."ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig

<P>
GUILD TO 'TURN UP HEAT' AT THE UNION-TRIBUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a general membership meeting last Wednesday, roughly 200 members of the San 
Diego Newspaper Guild unanimously approved a motion advising their bargaining 
committee to tell Union-Tribune management to "shove it." 
</P>
<P>
The motion came after the membership unanimously approved a similar motion 
rejecting a 9% salary increase -- more than double previous salary increase 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
Money is not the primary issue. Negotiations have been stalemated primarily due 
to a long list of "management rights" clauses, which Guild representatives 
believe are designed to break the union. The Guild, like other unions in the 
U-T plant, has been working without a contract for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
Representing about 1,000 U-T employees, the Guild is planning a series of 
anti-management activities for Thursday to coincide with the start of an 
increase in health-care costs, according to Guild President Ed Jahn. Guild 
employees, who have not had a raise since December, 1987, will have to pay $50 
more a month in health fees. The employee's health program is run by U-T 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is they've mismanaged it," Jahn said. "Now, they're throwing the 
increase on us." 
</P>
<P>
Jahn said the health-care increase has helped mobilize Guild membership. 
Besides Thursday's unspecified activities, they also will be demonstrating at a 
home show sponsored by the U-T on Saturday. Jahn would not detail the Guild's 
plans, beyond saying the Guild is going to "turn up the heat" on management. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn said the Guild also has been buoyed by aid from the national office of the 
Newspaper Guild. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a new spirit of willingness to get things settled," Jahn said. "For 
the first time, it's starting to look hopeful on our side." 
</P>
<P>
The loose band of talk-show hosts around the country, now known as the "Tea Bag 
Revolt Network," has reached new heights of importance -- at least in the minds 
of its members. According to a press release, the network, represented locally 
by XTRA-AM (690) morning host Mark Williams, was "responsible for the defeat of 
this past winter's congressional salary grab," after they organized listeners 
to send in tea bags (a reference to the Boston Tea Party) to members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously encouraged by the avalanche of publicity they received for the stunt, 
the network members plan to meet this June in Boston to discuss future ways 
they can change the world. Twenty-five to 50 talk-show hosts are expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he is looking forward to the tax write-off the trip will provide 
him. He downplayed a suggestion that the network could turn into a powerful, 
single-voiced lobbying group, threatening legislators with "government by tea 
bag." 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us has an ego too large for that," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The network has found another common cause: support for a national day of 
boycott against the Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised we found another cohesive issue," Williams joked. "We're already 
bickering about who should take credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 117 anti-abortion activists arrested last week in front of a 
Hillcrest doctor's office: Jim Holman, publisher of the Reader. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 years with Airwatch Traffic, Susan DeVincent is leaving to be Larry 
Himmel's new partner on the KIFM (98.1) morning show. The Himmel-DeVincent 
pairing is scheduled to hit the air April 24. 
</P>
<P>
When news of Richard Silberman's arrest broke, most local television stations 
and newspapers referred to him as a "co-founder of Jack in the Box," which sent 
representatives of Jack in the Box owner Foodmaker Inc. scurrying to the 
phones. They wanted to clarify that Jack in the Box was started long before 
Silberman became the company's vice chairman in 1965. . . . KGTV (Channel 10) 
had exclusive footage from two years ago of Silberman case figure Chris Petti 
wandering around San Diego. It was another coup for photographer Bob Lampert, 
who consistently comes up with some excellent footage thanks to his chummy 
relationship with local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Former KNSD-TV (Channel 39) assignment editor Eric Hulnick has a new job. He's 
executive news producer for KVBC (Channel 3), the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
As dog-and-pony shows go, the offer from the firm representing KFMB-TV (Channel 
8), Roni Hicks and Associates, was only a little sillier than most. To entice 
coverage of the station's 40th anniversary next month, professional journalists 
were invited to dinner at the station to "watch the news from the control room, 
meet the news team and even see what it feels like to deliver the news from the 
anchor's chair." Wow, a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
This month's edition of Channel 39's "Third Thursday," scheduled to air at 6:30 
p.m. Thursday, will discuss banning assault rifles. No matter how hard they 
tried, the show's producers couldn't find a politician willing or able to 
discuss the issue. They even offered to set up satellite links to Sacramento or 
Washington. Still no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite ratings that rank it in fourth place in the 7 p.m. ratings race, behind 
"People's Court," "Wheel of Fortune" and "Cheers," KUSI-TV (Channel 51) is 
pleased with "The Cosby Show," which entered syndication last year with 
unprecedented hoopla. "We're relatively happy," Channel 51 General Manager 
William Moore said. "It strengthened our whole block," anchored by "Night 
Court" at 7:30 p.m. Moore said his station didn't pay the inflated prices paid 
in many markets for rights to the series, which obviously has worn out its 
welcome with the American public.

Twenty-seven million starving talking heads in the world and Channel 8 hires 
ex-Charger Hank Bauer to do sports. His over-anxious, inarticulate on-air 
persona brings new clarity to derogatory characterizations of "ex-jock

According to a press release, Oceanside resident Al Razutis' film "Amerika" 
explores the "connections between the mass media, American popular culture, 
pornographic movies, sleazy motels, and semiotics as applied to classical film 
theory." In other words, it ain't "E.T." "Amerika" won the L.A. Film Critic's 
Award for Best Experimental Film in 1988. It will be screened at 7:30 p.m., 
Tuesday, at Installation on E Street.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Last week's bloody riots in Soviet Georgia so far pose no threat to the "San 
Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union," according to Paul Downey, 
spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor. The October-November festival is built 
chiefly around the culture of the Soviet state of Georgia. At least 19 died 
during last week's rioting, triggered by Georgian nationalists who have 
complained that the Soviet government is dominated by people of Russian 
descent. Festival organizers were assured last week by officials at the Soviet 
Embassy in Washington that "there is no point of concern for the festival," 
Downey said.

BANGLES ARE QUEENS OF HOMECOMING CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No surprises, but a triumphant homecoming nonetheless. Performing before a 
capacity crowd at the Santa Monica Civic on Saturday, the Bangles socked out a 
sparkling 90-minute set that stretched from the top of today's charts back to 
those halcyon daze when the girls graced the stage of the Whisky, lo, these 
seven, eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They still grace the stage. No corny costume changes. No kootch dancing. No 
sticking guitars between their legs. No labored call 'n' response routines. No 
desperate solicitations for affection. No pandering. 
</P>
<P>
No. They sang, they played. And when you can sing as well as Susanna Hoffs, 
Michael Steele, Vicki Peterson and Debbi Peterson, you don't have to stoop to 
conquer. 
</P>
<P>
Quick: How many other groups have four capable lead singers? And what other 
rock groups -- male or female -- have ever sung four-part harmonies with the 
style and precision of this fabulous feminine foursome? 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, there's the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Hollies, the Byrds, Buffalo 
Springfield (and their legion of imitators/spinoffs) and. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, and how many of those acts who are still functioning are worth the price 
of a ticket today? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some of the band's self-confidence comes from racking up a 
half-dozen hits over the past five years, especially when the most recent (the 
power ballad "Eternal Flame") is the biggest yet. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with a driving version of Paul Simon's "Hazy Shade of Winter" and 
closing with the pharoahest-of-'em-all silliness of "Walk Like an Egyptian" the 
Bangles' show was superbly paced, sprinkling major ("Manic Monday," "If She 
Knew What She Wants") and minor ("Hero Takes a Fall," "Walking Down Your 
Street") hits atop a crop of tunes taken from their current "Everything" LP 
like so much sugar-plum fairy dust. 
</P>
<P>
Energetic and democratic, the evening was not without a couple of 
semi-spontaneous moments. Tossing a tease chorus of "I Fought the Law" onto the 
intro of "If She Knew . . ." for one. And it's not only nice to hear the local 
girls still honor '60s L.A. popfolkrocker Emmitt Rhodes by pulling the old 
Merry-Go-Round number "Live" out from under their nuevo-retro punkadelic funk 
'n' finery, but also comforting to hear that Hoffs, introducing a song about 
being rejected, can confess that this had happened to her once. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by Saturday's crowd, the Bangles appeal to everyone from dedicated 
followers of '60s fashion (lotsa vests, paisley, miniskirts, dangling earrings 
and long hair) to couldn't-care-less surfer dudes 'n' dates, ranging in age 
from kindergarten though second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
And if seeing the Bangles makes little girls go home and beg their parents for 
electric guitars, who but the neighbors can complain?

POP CAPSULES : BAD COMPANY AGES WELL AT THE AMPHITHEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Can it really be 15 years since Bad Company came on the scene as a pleasingly 
straightforward alternative to the distended boogie and progressive rock of the 
day? 
</P>
<P>
A lot has changed in the meantime, but the newest version of the English band 
-- which headlined the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday -- fills pretty much 
the same function in today's bloated hard-rock world -- only there's lots more 
competition now. While such "classics" as "Ready for Love" and "Can't Get 
Enough" have aged well (as have guitarist Mick Ralphs and drummer Simon Kirke, 
the sole holdovers from the original band), the new material is hardly a match 
for, say, Metallica on the metal side or the Smithereens on the rock 'n' roll 
side. And singer Brian Howe won't make anyone forget original frontman Paul 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's unadorned and unpretentious presentation deserves credit for 
its lack of cliche and bombast, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Opening act Vixen, on the other hand, appeared ready and willing to embrace any 
and every bombastic hard-rock cliche. But these four hair-extension poster 
girls are not able, and their set was at best a cartoon imitation of bad rock. 
Can it really be 13 years since the Runaways came on the scene . . . ? STEVE

POP CAPSULES : NO PUNCH LINE FROM KILLING JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Killing Joke began a wall-of-sound juggernaut across the 
post-punk soundscape with such innovative metal-dance anthems as "Change" and 
"Wardance." After a two-year layoff, the English quartet roared into town over 
the weekend, headlining the Ford Theatre and playing a Saturday set in Los 
Angeles at the Club With No Name. (When the Joke finished at 3 a.m., it seemed 
like the club with no schedule too.) 
</P>
<P>
The band may have a new rhythm section, including original Public Image Ltd. 
drummer Martin Atkins, but not much has changed since "Change," which is still 
Killing Joke's best song. Too much of the material falls into the same 
minor-chord mush, though the group still has the energy and sonic density of a 
DC-10 lifting off. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Jaz Coleman, who attempts an apocalyptic pagan image, is more clumsy 
than compelling. With his blow-dried hair, sweat pants and messy Magic Marker 
scribbles on his face, Coleman resembled a Middle Eastern lounge singer on a 
bad mushroom trip. His kung-fu gestures did nothing to enhance his overblown 
sermons about greed and cholesterol. CRAIG LEE

SAN DIEGO REVIVES A TRADITIONAL 'BUTTERFLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music/Dance Critic

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional opera doesn't have to be careless opera. Take, for example, the 
revival of "Madama Butterfly" that opened Saturday night at the San Diego 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
There were no theatrical shocks here, and few musical surprises. Everyone 
involved, from lofty protagonist to lowly chorister, took Puccini at his 
seasoned word. Luckily, no one took that word for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Kees Bakels of Amsterdam conducted with emotive force that respected both the 
light and the shade in the score yet avoided sentimental excesses. Adelaide 
Bishop, a splendid singing actress in her time, staged the proceedings with a 
loving eye for detail and steadfast avoidance of expressive cliches. 
</P>
<P>
John Scheffler's hand-me-down picture-post-card set proved eminently 
functional, and it was sensitively illuminated by Peter Kaczorowski. Zack 
Brown's costumes, borrowed from the Washington Opera, accentuated the positive, 
even to the point of disguising Lt. Pinkerton's portly physique with a dark 
off-season uniform. 
</P>
<P>
All this still would have meant relatively little had the cast been 
perfunctory. This cast wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the singing actress confronting the rigors of the title role 
encountered some problems. But singing actresses encounter problems in this 
elusive challenge everywhere these days. San Diego holds no monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroko Nishida, a Japanese native with considerable experience in Germany, was 
making her American debut on this occasion. She proved more effective 
dramatically than vocally. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny and fragile, she exuded vulnerable innocence at her first appearance. 
Cio-Cio-San's tragedy became all the more poignant as the evening progressed 
because it was conveyed with such open simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Her lyric soprano sounded bright and lovely so long as it stayed at mid-range 
and mid-volume. Unfortunately, in moments requiring climactic stress, the tone 
became unsteady and the pitch flat. When it came to the cresting D-flat of the 
entrance aria, she chose the safe anticlimax of Puccini's lower option. Perhaps 
it was a matter of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Welch, another popular import on German stages, returned to his home 
territory as an exceptionally ardent, golden-voiced Pinkerton. At the final 
cadence of the first act, incidentally, he chose Puccini's upper option and 
rose to a ringing, effortless high C. Remember the name. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harlan Foss sounded like a modest Yamadori impersonating the American 
consul, his sympathetic characterization compensated for any baritonal 
shortcomings. Here was a Sharpless who conveyed stern exasperation with his 
caddish countryman and lavished pained, courtly deference upon the abandoned 
geisha. Even as the ultimate crisis beckoned, he wouldn't enter her home 
without taking off his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The generally strong supporting ensemble included Robynne Redmon as a robust, 
attentive Suzuki; Joseph Frank as a clever, unexaggerated Goro; Stephen West as 
a gruff, formidable Bonze, and William Nolan as a pleasant, stolid Yamadori. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the Civic Theatre was flooded with cheers and tears at the end. 
Old "Butterfly" soared and scored again.

The title is ironic; the three sons of this working-class Warsaw family are 
pulled into Communism or petty crime, while their widowed mother continues to 
have faith in ideals and/or men who unfailingly let her down during the 30-year 
span of the story, from 1930 to 1956. Begun in 1982, then stopped when martial 
law was imposed, Janusz Zsorki's tribute to naive tenacity won a prize for its 
central actress, Magda Theresa Wojcikz; its brooding black-and-white camera 
work is splendid, but it is a long sit and a far too predictable story. --

 Just as in "Letters From the Park," Gabriel Garcia Marquez based this 
screenplay on a two-page fragment from "Love in the Time of Cholera"; it's a 
sensuous, cruel love story about a compulsive seducer with waxed mustache whose 
obsessive romanticism brings on catastrophe. Cinema Novo mainstay Ruy Guerra 
("Erendira") has turned into a master of gorgeous surfaces, but he never loses 
sight of the devastating social satire Marquez has secreted within his 
Scheherazade-style storytelling and jeweled metaphors. RECOMMENDED. -- MICHAEL

 In this complex, beautiful, harrowing and utterly demanding film, Derek Jarman 
has created a stylized, often surreal visual accompaniment to the Benjamin 
Britten oratorio, which was inspired by the work of World War I poet Wilfred 
Owen. Told from the perspective of an elderly veteran (Laurence Olivier, in a 
poignant, silent cameo), the film re-creates the Great War through archival 
clips, vignettes and religious tableaux in an attempt to give meaning to all 
those who sacrificed so much for king and country. Jarman, however, moves well 
beyond nostalgic patriotism to make a stunningly effective anti-war protest as 
the horrors of World War I give way to images of the conflicts that have risen 
since "the war to end all wars." RECOMMENDED. -- KEVIN THOMAS

MOZART CAMERATA COMPLETES SEASON AT SANTA ANA HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Music lovers who search for ensembles possessing a string sound of warmth and 
clarity and demonstrating admirable nuance ought to put the Mozart Camerata on 
a list of favorite groups. 
</P>
<P>
At least this is the conclusion of one listener, after the chamber orchestra's 
Saturday performance. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the program with the Sinfonia in G, Opus 3, No. 6, by J. C. Bach, 
conductor Ami Porat revealed why the Santa Ana High School Auditorium is his 
venue of choice: The hall's bright, resonant-yet-warm acoustics are perfectly 
matched to the group's full-blooded sound. 
</P>
<P>
No thin, wiry string ensemble this, but the maker of a sound that dispels the 
notion of a chamber orchestra as merely a small orchestra without enough 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Nathaniel Rosen would appear to be a soloist suited to this orchestra 
like hand in glove, capable of seemingly endless nuances of phrasing and 
bowing. His collaboration in Francois Couperin's "Pieces en Concert" proved a 
minor revelation. So temperamentally matched were leader and soloist that Porat 
not so much accompanied Rosen as simply welcomed him to the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
The opening movement of Luigi Boccherini's cello concerto in B-flat 
demonstrated that some human elements were in play, after all. Using the 
19th-Century edition of Friedrich Grutzmacher (including that editor's 
cadenza), allowed Rosen to adopt a Romantic approach perfectly suited to his 
strengths, but at odds with Porat's Classical bent. At the beginning, Rosen 
consistently forged a hair ahead, at the ends of runs particularly. Porat 
maintained a cool head and firm hand, however. The prayer-like slow movement 
and vivacious finale had the principals back in concert, literally. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's Symphony No. 33 gave Porat ample opportunity to demonstrate his 
special gifts for the podium. He is a conductor who knows how to escape the 
tyranny of beat patterns for the only justifiable reason: to give the music its 
own voice. 
</P>
<P>
Porat's encore arrangement of the Intermezzo from Pietro Mascagni's "Cavalleria 
Rusticana" showed that he and his group are no strangers to the late Romantic 
style, though one wished for stronger bass-playing.

RIGHT MUSIC, WRONG AUDIENCE FOR TIFFANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiffany hit 'em with her best shot right at the start Saturday at the Celebrity 
Theatre in Anaheim, opening with three punchy rock songs that made it seem for 
a moment as if the 17-year-old kid-pop star might really have a future in rock 
'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
With the six musicians backing her cranking out energetic, barroom-style rock, 
Tiffany could have been an unknown, novice rocker on the road to finding her 
feet as a performer, and having some fun doing it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that Tiffany's punch knocked the wind out of her predominantly 
pre-teen audience. Instead of whooping it up while she rolled through "Oh 
Jackie" and "We're Both Thinking of Her" from the second of her two platinum 
albums, most of the fans remained inert in their seats. Averaging little more 
than half the singer's age, Tiffany's core crowd is probably not ready for 
rough and tough stuff yet. 
</P>
<P>
As the show went on, Tiffany obliged with ballads, dance pop and a too-long 
oldies medley. The fans were quickly put at ease, and they began a nonstop 
pilgrimage through the aisles to the apron of the circular, rotating stage, 
where Tiffany obliged one and all with a smile and a touch of a not-so-old 
friend's hand. 
</P>
<P>
After her surprisingly hard-rocking start, Tiffany meandered through an 
unimpressive 60-minute hodgepodge in which she tried on a succession of vocal 
styles, from Madonna to Ronnie Spector to Stevie Nicks. Whatever guise she 
chooses, Tiffany needs to strengthen a voice that frequently lapsed into forced 
bleating when she tried to hold a high note. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany as bar rocker might not be such a bad idea, especially because those 
opening songs showed that she has some instinct for it. The 9-year-olds may not 
be able to get through a gin-mill door, but the singer just might learn things 
about performing that she never will in a gilded cage. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany doesn't need to pay the barroom dues that almost any other singer her 
age would be facing, but that doesn't mean she couldn't profit from it. 
</P>
<P>
How about it Tiff: Go to college, start a pick-up band. It's a time-honored 
tradition, and you'll get a nice respite from being picked on by old-fogy pop 
critics.

BALLET HISPANICO AT PLUMMER AUDITORIUM

<TEXT>
<P>
Performing with great purity, energy, elegance and sensuality, the 12 dancers 
of Ballet Hispanico of New York created a strong first impression at 
Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium on Saturday. The program showed off their 
versatility with a vivid, mural-like depiction of the Spanish conquest of 
Mexico, a sultry whorehouse dance-drama and virtuosic solos evoking the 
exuberance of Rio de Janeiro carnival revelers. 
</P>
<P>
Talley Beatty's "Tres Cantos" (1975) -- to the music of Carlos Chavez, Lorenzo 
Fernandez and Silvestre Revueltas -- evoked the dignity and pride of an Indian 
society via tautly upright postures, thrusting arms, pliant torsos and a sober 
weightedness reminiscent of the style of Martha Graham. The use of lengths of 
fabric to convey the stifling control of the Spanish conquerors also suggested 
a homage to the metaphorical use of cloth by Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more striking images was the covey of women in billowing cloaks who 
paused, looking skyward with palms up, like a chorus of clairvoyants. As the 
Indians' Leader, Pedro Ruiz created a dramatic aura with the keen attack and 
sustained intensity of his movements. Swathed in a long cloak in the middle 
conquest section, he seemed fatefully under the sway of the unseen 
conquistadors, ever-so-slightly cantilevering his upper body while the music 
shrilled tensely. 
</P>
<P>
If "Cada Noche . . . Tango" (1988) was a disappointment to those who expected 
to see couples doing the tango -- newly popular in the United States. in the 
wake of "Tango Argentino" -- the piece did offer an unusually plausible 
bordello scene, full of seemingly casual gestures that suddenly erupt into 
violence. In Graciela Daniele's choreography, these men and women of the Buenos 
Aires underclass are a microcosm of a society with strongly defined sexual 
roles and touchy pride. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the cigarette smoke, slouching figures and roaming hands, Ruiz and Jose 
Costas pick an elaborately stylized fight. Eventually, as the raspy, sighing 
taped accordion music of Astor Piazzola plays on, they form an aggressive 
three-way relationship with proud and mysterious Nancy Turano. The pure dance 
passages occurred in brief moments -- someone's walk, two women who suddenly 
dip their knees twice -- that flashed out of the moody darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"Batucada Fantastica," choreographed by Vincente Nebrada in 1982 to the 
percussive music-with-chants of Luciano Perrone, concluded the program by 
showcasing eight dancers in ultra-flexible, sometimes appealingly goofy parades 
of movements that changed direction and shape with dizzying speed.

PARENTS BATTLE FOR THEIR 'STREETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Taking Back the Streets," airing at 7:30 tonight on KCET Channel 28, is heavy 
with allusions to war, continually speaking of the battlefield, armies, 
recruiting soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
This is not another PBS documentary on warfare, but the metaphors are 
nonetheless accurate, for the show's focus is on a group called Concerned 
Parents, fighting the battle of their lives against gangs in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1978 in response to the "cholo wars" on the Eastside of Los Angeles 
-- there were 24 gang murders that year in the Monte Villa housing project 
where Concerned Parents began -- the group linked mothers of children in 
different gangs for the first time. They formed an underground network -- 
keeping tabs on their children, breaking up the rhythm of the gang kids' life 
on the street. Ten years later, Monte Villa had zero gang-related deaths -- no 
mean feat in Los Angeles' worst year of gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-producer Martin Burns devotes most of "Taking Back the Streets" to a new 
group of concerned parents, who were given a small grant by the state to set up 
a program in South-Central Los Angeles. Particularly effective are a segment on 
the group meeting with -- and counseling -- gang members at a California Youth 
Authority facility and a segment that follows a young mother, Joyce Patrick, as 
she searches for her son, Tyrone, a teen-ager who ran away to live on the 
streets with his gang mates. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the strength of Concerned Parents -- and the documentary -- is that it 
shows parents a way out, a way of fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"Once one mother gets herself strengthened, then she can help another mother," 
says Eartha Vernon, a member of the South-Central group. "We're gonna have to 
recruit . . . until we get enough mothers that we're ready to walk the whole 
world if necessary."

POLICE, STADIUM BLAMED IN BRITISH SOCCER DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor police crowd control, inadequate emergency medical facilities and 
shortsighted design of the soccer stadium here were being blamed Sunday as the 
death toll rose to 94 in the nation's worst sports disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were asphyxiated or crushed to death at a national soccer 
championship playoff match Saturday when thousands of additional spectators 
surged at the last minute into an enclosed and already overcrowded viewing 
terrace, trapping early arrivals against fixed metal barriers. 
</P>
<P>
A clearly shaken Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced a full-scale public 
inquiry into the disaster during a four-hour visit Sunday to the site of the 
tragedy and to some of the 50 injured fans still in the hospital. In all, more 
than 200 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever decisions we have to take will be taken, because we cannot go through 
this again," Thatcher said during a half-hour tour of Sheffield's Hillsborough 
Stadium, where Saturday's semi-final championship contest between Liverpool and 
Nottingham Forest turned into a nightmare of panic and agonizing death. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing several survivors tell of the event, Thatcher described their 
experiences as "a story, in the midst of tragedy, of tremendous, heroic courage 
and, of course, still fantastic anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
Hero schoolboy Ian Clarke, 16, told Thatcher how he used the life-saving 
techniques he learned as a swimmer to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to "10 
or 12" victims before collapsing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"As the crowd moved away I could see people lying there with their faces going 
purple, so I helped drag them away," Clarke said. "We got about eight of them 
back alive, but I'm not sure about the others. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to get a few more from the terracing, but there was another surge 
and I was knocked on the ground. It was like being underwater when you can't 
get back up and you've got no air. I was trying to fight, but there were dead 
bodies on top of me. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can describe it -- it was like something out of a horror 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
In a country suffused with grief and anger after the tragedy, the inquiry is 
considered likely to bring legislation that could drastically alter the 
traditional face of Britain's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10,000 Mourners at Service 
</P>
<P>
At Liverpool, the blue-collar port city that was home to most of the victims, 
up to 10,000 mourners attended a memorial service Sunday evening. Three 
thousand filled Liverpool's huge concrete and glass Roman Catholic cathedral, 
while more than twice that many stood outside under chilly, overcast skies. 
</P>
<P>
The first 25 fatal victims identified by police Sunday ranged in age from 10 to 
62 and included two sisters, aged 15 and 19. Most of the dead were young men. 
</P>
<P>
London's Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph both published extraordinary, angry 
front page editorials about the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"A slum sport played in slum conditions," railed the Sunday Times. "Despite 
disaster after disaster, nothing seems to shake the complacency or incompetence 
of those who run the country's most popular spectator sport. Football (soccer) 
stadiums and their administration remain a disgrace. They are filthy, dangerous 
places; spectators only put up with them because of their enthusiasm for what 
happens on the pitch (field)." 
</P>
<P>
"Pitiful indeed is the country that cannot ensure the safety of its people 
while at play," declared the Sunday Telegraph. "Inquiries are set up after each 
successive tragedy. New precautions are decreed. But to no avail. Football 
calamities are becoming as much a natural part of Britain's fate as are 
earthquakes in South America or famine in India." 
</P>
<P>
The Football Assn., which administers professional soccer in Britain, is to 
decide early this week whether to cancel the rest of this year's national 
championship playoffs -- a move comparable to halting the Super Bowl in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's tragedy also raised new questions over a ban that prevents British 
clubs from participating in European competition. The sanction was imposed 
after British fans attacked their Italian rivals during a May, 1985, match at 
Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium, triggering a riot in which 39 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The Union of European Football Assns., which is the ruling body of European 
soccer, voted only last week to lift the ban for the 1990-91 season. But its 
action was conditional on the continued good conduct of British fans and the 
agreement of the British government. 
</P>
<P>
While there was no Heysel-type hooliganism in Sheffield on Saturday, the 
incident is nevertheless bound to raise more questions internationally about 
the behavior of British soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
Here, however, it was the police who appeared to be getting most of the blame 
on Sunday. South Yorkshire County Police Constable Peter Wright has confirmed 
that a senior police official at the scene ordered a 16-foot-wide gate to be 
opened at the back of the grandstand just minutes before game time Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Most survivors say it was that action that produced the last-minute surge of 
fans into the ground-level, standing-room-only spectator terrace behind the 
goal at Liverpool's end of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Life-Threatening Situation' 
</P>
<P>
Police said the decision was made to relieve what they called a 
"life-threatening" situation that was developing outside the stadium as crowds 
of frustrated fans, unable to gain admittance, surged against closed 
turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
The police are also accused by some critics of losing control both outside the 
stadium and inside, where the last-minute surge of entrants was allowed to jam 
the already crowded center sections of the Liverpool end zone rather than being 
funneled into two less crowded sections on either side. 
</P>
<P>
The tension among the police was clear here Sunday when a senior officer waved 
off reporters' questions and walked abruptly out of a press conference after 
announcing that there is also to be an internal police inquiry into the actions 
of his forces. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Ashton, a professor of medicine at Liverpool University, charged that 
once the incident occurred, "there was no organized (medical) response at all. 
There was nobody in charge, no plan, no organization at all. I had to make sure 
the people who were still alive and most seriously injured were got off to 
hospital first." 
</P>
<P>
Ashton described the scene as "absolute chaos" and complained that there was no 
resuscitation equipment available on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appalling ... Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Glyn Phillips, another practitioner who rushed onto the field to help the 
injured, said he asked for an electric shock machine at one point and was told 
there was none at the stadium. Later, he was given an oxygen tank that turned 
out to be empty. He called the situation "appalling" and "an absolute 
disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
Criticisms of stadium design are potentially the most significant in the long 
run, raising the possibility of fundamental change in spectators' habits here. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough's perimeter fence, for example, originally installed between the 
stands and the playing field to cut down on crowd violence and prevent rowdy 
fans from disrupting play, turned into a death cage Saturday, preventing 
crushed fans from using what would have been their only avenue of escape. 
</P>
<P>
The fence was installed at the insistence of local police and over the protest 
of the Sheffield club's safety consultant, Dr. Bill Eastwood. Similar fences 
are used in the stadiums of most top professional clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Perimeter fencing has been the product of an obsession with hooliganism as 
distinct from concern with safety," said Roy Hattersley, the opposition Labor 
Party's shadow home secretary. "Yesterday I think we saw the ending of 
perimeter fencing and the terrible things that happen when pressure becomes 
unbearable," the politician said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television 
interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spectators' Habits 
</P>
<P>
There were also calls to replace standing-room-only spectator terraces with 
regular seats, a move that would drastically reduce the capacity of the 
country's soccer grounds and radically alter spectators' habits spanning 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
Many British fans have historically preferred to watch their favorite soccer 
team while standing shoulder-to-shoulder on huge, open concrete terraces behind 
the goal and swaying to home-team chants. Even at Hillsborough, which is 
considered one of the most up-to-date stadiums, nearly 60% of the listed 
capacity is made up of standing-only terraces. 
</P>
<P>
To someone more used to American football stadiums, these terraces are 
claustrophobic affairs even under normal circumstances. And as Saturday proved, 
they can be deadly in abnormal ones. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a fundamental re-think about this issue," said Football Assn. 
chief executive Graham Kelly at a London press conference Sunday. "We have got 
to get our football clubs to get to their supporters and say: Are you sure that 
in this day and age, you want to go through turnstiles and a tunnel and stand 
in a place like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Kelly added that Britain would not have "a cat in hell's chance" of hosting a 
future World Cup soccer competition without stadiums in which all spectators 
had seats. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jill Smith, an administrator for the English Football Assn., said 
"clubs have tried to change the way fans watch matches by eliminating terraces 
and making their stadiums all-seating. But the public in England demands the 
right to stand."

LAW'S USE HELD OUT OF CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
THE LONG ARM OF RICO -- IS IT REACHING TOO FAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
He was an engineer who did not date much after a failed marriage. She was a 
former Miss Orange County. Within two months of the day they met, they decided 
to marry. 
</P>
<P>
But when he put up a $50,000 promissory note to buy into her family's garment 
company and she decided she wanted a divorce, he went one step further than 
divorce court: He filed a federal racketeering suit, alleging that she and her 
parents had enmeshed him in a criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Man meets beauty queen, is seduced by the beauty and body, eagerly is swept 
off his feet and taken for a ride into the land of enchantment, greed and 
crime," Richard Millan said in his court papers. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also contained allegations of bankruptcy fraud, wire fraud and mail 
fraud, but divorce was hardly what Congress must have had in mind when it 
passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a statute 
that allows the government to prosecute criminal enterprises and permits 
private parties to bring lawsuits against them for treble damages. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Millan's suit was thrown out of court last December, but not before 
months of court hearings and thousands of dollars in legal fees. Similar civil 
disputes in the guise of racketeering cases are likely to populate the court 
calendars for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Though the 19-year-old RICO statute has become a prosecutorial staple in major 
organized-crime cases, sending top Mafia bosses across the country to prison 
for decades under its stiff penalty provisions, only in the last few years has 
it been widely wielded against white-collar crime and in ordinary business 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers, who in recent months have unsheathed the powerful 
statute against such diverse targets as junk bond whiz Michael Milken, the 
Teamsters Union, former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and a failed 
Orange County savings and loan, say RICO's powerful forfeiture provisions allow 
them to go after criminals where it hurts most, by freezing and ultimately 
seizing the economic fruits of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere has the litigation been as bountiful as in Los Angeles, which has the 
highest volume of civil RICO filings in the country. A total of 144 new cases 
were filed last year. 
</P>
<P>
But an increasing array of critics -- an odd coalition that runs from Wall 
Street to civil libertarians to the mob -- say use of the statute has escalated 
out of control, branding ordinary businessmen as racketeers and subjecting 
their life savings to forfeiture for conduct that may have only skirted the 
fringes of the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Charges 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, often citing Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s recent agreement to 
plead guilty to securities fraud charges that carry a $650-million fine, rather 
than face the possibility of a RICO indictment, say the mere threat of RICO 
inspires enough dread to prompt potential defendants to cooperate with the 
government or, in a civil case, settle quickly. As the Drexel case has shown, 
they say, billions of dollars in personal and corporate assets -- and the 
future of entire companies -- may be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"Any statute that could, in effect, become an offer you can't refuse makes the 
people making those offers, in effect, gangsters. If it's either 'You're 
destroyed and you're broke and you go to jail for 40 years' or 'You cooperate 
with us and you're free and clear,' that's no different than what Marlon Brando 
said in 'The Godfather,' " New York lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said. He is 
representing one of the defendants in the Milken case and in a related case 
against Princeton-Newport Partners, a New Jersey money management firm that did 
considerable business with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton-Newport went out of business last year after five of its principals 
were indicted on RICO charges. The indictment alleged that they acted with a 
former Drexel bond trader to generate $13 million in phony tax losses, and the 
partners were required to post a $14-million bond against forfeitures that 
might be assessed in the event of a conviction. The company claimed it could 
not survive under the cloud of the RICO indictment and the threat of new 
charges that might require additional forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Assets 
</P>
<P>
Milken and two others, accused in a 98-count RICO indictment of scheming with 
former speculator Ivan Boesky and others to defraud Drexel clients and 
investors, was ordered Friday to post the equivalent of a $700-million bond 
against the $1.8 billion in personal assets the government claims should be 
forfeited in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, some state RICO laws allowed prosecutors to freeze assets even 
before a trial. In Ft. Wayne, Ind., the owners of a chain of adult bookstores 
accused of selling obscene material found their three businesses immediately 
padlocked after they were named in a state RICO complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last month found such pre-conviction freezes to be 
unconstitutional. But the court declined to act on a similar case under the 
federal RICO law in Virginia, where the owners of a chain of adult book and 
video stores had to forfeit the businesses, their inventories and the property 
on which the stores were located for selling six magazines and four videotapes 
that were determined to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
In one Los Angeles case, a man convicted on RICO charges for running a 
$35-million boiler room operation was required to forfeit a $1-million Malibu 
home, a $500,000 Westlake Village house and another $500,000 condominium. The 
money was used to pay restitution to more than 100 victims of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Alluring 
</P>
<P>
For prosecutors, RICO's forfeiture provisions are even more alluring than its 
20-year maximum prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a double whammy," explained Terree Bowers, head of the U.S. 
attorney's major frauds section in Los Angeles. "Some of these people are 
willing to sit out the jail time, as long as they can come out and enjoy the 
fruits of their criminal enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what Congress had in mind in 1970 when it adopted the RICO statute -- 
reputedly named in honor of Edward G. Robinson's character in the movie "Little 
Caesar" -- is still subject to debate. Critics of its use in corporate fraud 
cases say it was intended to attack classic organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who was largely responsible for drafting the statute, G. Robert 
Blakey, a former Senate committee staffer who is now a law professor at the 
University of Notre Dame, said the debate at the time made it clear that 
Congress was very much interested in organized crime's infiltration of 
legitimate business -- and organized crime committed by people who had nothing 
whatever to do with the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear it was not mobsters only; absolutely it was not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has vigorously resisted any efforts to narrow the reach 
of the statute, arguing that not all dangerous criminals are members of 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intent Told 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of RICO was to give the government a vehicle for dealing 
with that side of organized-crime activity that ended up in the 
quasi-legitimate financial fields," said Paul E. Coffey, who as deputy chief of 
the department's organized crime and racketeering section oversees all RICO 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has subsequently noted that the statute itself calls for 
a broad interpretation. The court held that legitimate businesses "enjoy 
neither an inherent incapacity for criminal activity nor immunity from its 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, RICO is targeted at "enterprises" that engage in a "pattern of 
racketeering activity." More than two dozen individual crimes, ranging from 
such state offenses as murder and arson to federal crimes such as mail fraud, 
securities fraud or union funds embezzlement -- any two in a 10-year period -- 
are included among the acts that can make up a RICO violation. 
</P>
<P>
RICO law remains in substantial disarray, however, because of continuing 
confusion over just what constitutes an "enterprise" or a "pattern" of 
racketeering activity. Few questioned, for example, the Justice Department's 
characterization last year of the Los Angeles Mafia family as a racketeering 
enterprise that had engaged in a pattern of activity that included extortion, 
loan-sharking and murder plots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Single Act 
</P>
<P>
But what of an indictment last week that alleged that the now-defunct North 
America Savings &amp; Loan of Santa Ana was operated by its deceased president 
and a former consultant as a racketeering enterprise? What of a group of 
individuals who commit a variety of unrelated frauds over a period of several 
years? Can a single act of fraud, if accompanied by a mailing, or a telephone 
call, be enough to sustain a racketeering case? 
</P>
<P>
While the Justice Department has guidelines that limit the instances in which 
criminal RICO cases can be brought, the water has been muddied in recent years 
by civil litigants, who can obtain treble damages and attorney fees if they can 
establish a similar pattern of racketeering activity by way of a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark 1985 case that opened the way for much 
broader use of the RICO statute, held that prior criminal convictions are not 
required to sustain a civil RICO action. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of that ruling, civil RICO suits have explored the outer fringes of 
the legal frontier. Alleged "racketeers" have since included the Democratic 
National Committee, Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Adolfo Calero 
Portocarrero, countless businessmen locked in financial disputes -- even the 
FBI. In a recent, highly publicized ruling, a federal appeals court upheld a 
civil RICO case against 27 anti-abortion activists who protested against a 
Philadelphia abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Accidents 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest civil RICO cases in the country is pending now in Los 
Angeles, where the Automobile Club of Southern California is seeking $200 
million in damages from a group of doctors, attorneys and others who are 
accused of running a staged auto accident ring. The case, which one defense 
lawyer estimated has already generated 1 million pages of documents, is 
expected to go to trial next year. 
</P>
<P>
Most judges who have spoken publicly on the issue, including Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist, have expressed concern that RICO, if allowed to proceed 
unabated, could jam the federal courts' dockets with cases that more properly 
belong as simple contract disputes in state court. 
</P>
<P>
"In a broad sense, I doubt that Congress had any idea that it would be used as 
creatively as it has been used, to get at common-law fraud, and I think that's 
the thing that most judges get upset about," said U.S. District Judge Pamela 
Ann Rymer, considered the leading authority on the statute on the Los Angeles 
federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'd even bat an eyelash if they came in and said the defendant 
did this act of extortion and then went out and killed somebody. That's real 
RICO. It's when they come in and say somebody tried to defraud me and called up 
(on the telephone) two or three times, that's what gets a lot of judges upset."

The Supreme Court is expected to revisit this year the question of what 
constitutes a "pattern" of racketeering activity, clarifying many of the 
questions that remain in civil cases. Legislation now before Congress, 
introduced earlier this year by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Rep. 
Frederick Boucher (D-Va.), would clarify some of the remaining points of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Single Damages 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, it would permit most plaintiffs to recover only single 
damages, except where the defendant has been convicted of a related felony or 
in insider trading cases, in which punitive damages would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, in the meantime, says it has developed sufficient 
guidelines to ensure that only those cases that truly encompass a broad pattern 
of criminal activity -- and which cannot be covered by any other statute -- are 
filed as RICO cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We've authorized over 800 RICO prosecutions since 1980. That's a lot," Coffey 
said. "In hindsight, some of them were great, some of them we probably should 
have rethought and prosecuted under other statutes and the great majority were 
somewhere in the middle. Basically, RICO worked."

TOWERING AMBITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY'S SEARCH FOR AN IMAGE IS LOOKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A downtown in search of a more fashionable face can look out at the world with 
a new hauteur today, as the sleek, pale contours of a new and conspicuously 
different skyscraper rise in cool contrast to the city's bulky skyline. 
</P>
<P>
This horizontal city, where buildings over 13 stories were prohibited until 
1957, has become home to the tallest building on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-story tower is the work of I.M. Pei &amp; Partners and is one of a score 
of giant office buildings being shaped for Los Angeles by well-known 
architects, including Michael Graves, Cesar Pelli, Arthur Erickson, Helmut Jahn 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
The new crop of designer skyscrapers is part of a bid for visual distinction 
that has long eluded downtown Los Angeles. Flush with foreign money and eager 
for the world's approval, the city is anxious to shed any traces of 
provincialism. At the same time, the city is hoping to create a landscape in 
which a lot more people will want to live. With less than 2% of the people who 
work downtown living there, habitability has become a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
Take care of the problem, and local leaders believe they can realize their goal 
of a downtown with nearly twice its current working population of 276,000 and 
twice the commercial space of downtown San Francisco. (Los Angeles now has 
slightly less than San Francisco.) With office growth averaging about 1 million 
square feet a year and the occupancy rate running about 80%, the boosters' 
dream of a skyline that stretches from Union Station to USC may not be all that 
fanciful. 
</P>
<P>
In the works for nearly 10 years, the tower points to the city's growing 
preoccupation with its image and its confusion over what the image ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are those who say the city needs a majestic skyline, like New York 
or Chicago, if it is going to be recognized as a world capital. California 
historian Kevin Starr said recently that one reason Los Angeles has not been 
taken as seriously as other cities its size is because its large buildings are 
not especially impressive. Starr suggested that a city better known for zany 
architecture -- the original Brown Derby restaurant shaped like a hat, 
Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Tail of the Pup hot dog stand -- could do with a 
make-over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Dubiousness 
</P>
<P>
But there are also people who say that the rush to build modish skyscrapers, 
like Pei's tower, will superimpose an anonymous big-city look on a town famous 
for the personality of its smaller buildings. Critics wonder why a Western city 
with a long legacy of original architecture should look eastward for its 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Pei's architects said that as they worked on plans for the new tower, they 
looked east and west, at buildings rich in classical ornamentation and at those 
with very little detailing. The architects said they hung up pictures of the 
Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. But they said they also paid 
close attention to the Central Library -- "a strong, spare building, very 
authoritative and very Western," in the words of Henry N. Cobb, the architect 
in Pei's firm most responsible for designing the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb and his colleagues said they wanted to put up a building that was both 
showy and self-effacing. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a building that was more spirited than many big buildings 
downtown, but one that did not threaten the primacy of the library," Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Cobb set out to build the tallest building west of Houston, a 
$350-million skyscraper standing a fifth of a mile high, that would not 
overshadow the three-story structure across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb has reason to be sensitive about the library. Few buildings in Los Angeles 
have so endeared themselves to the public. The preservation of the library has 
been a cause celebre for at least 25 years. Moreover, its fate and that of the 
tower are closely linked. Approval of the tower was contingent on a commitment 
by the developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, to underwrite $110 million of the 
cost of preserving and expanding the library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on the Ground 
</P>
<P>
As the tower has risen to its full height, it has become clear that its success 
will be gauged as much by the way it meets the ground around it as how it 
greets the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is going to be judged on how it enhances the environment around 
it as opposed to how it shows off at the top. The top 60 feet belongs to a few 
people. The bottom 60 feet belongs to everyone," said Richard Weinstein, dean 
of the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Design. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at the bottom that the building will achieve its uniqueness, if it is 
going to, in its response to the weather, to the street-scape, to the library . 
. . to those things that are distinctly Los Angeles," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the tower and a 54-story neighbor that also is a Maguire Thomas 
project will bring 8,000 to 10,000 people, about 2,000 cars, and more than 3 
million square feet of development to the three-block neighborhood now known as 
Library Square. Most of the people who will work there are part of the city's 
expanding financial service sector. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no public viewing deck at the top of the tower. The bottom is 
where the developers will try to please the public. There, they have taken on 
the daunting challenge of trying to provide downtown Los Angeles with a popular 
outdoor gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a colorful street-scape where people of all walks of life mix easily 
and often, where there is a little fun in the air, has proved to be one of the 
more elusive goals for planners and developers who want to make the downtown an 
enjoyable place to work and live. 
</P>
<P>
In Weinstein's words, the downtown badly needs "an extraordinary public place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking a Location 
</P>
<P>
If one can be created, Library Square would be an appropriate spot. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting on 5th Street between Flower and Grand, the new tower perches on a 
50-foot rise that symbolizes a cultural divide between the granite and glass 
canyons of the Bunker Hill Financial District and the lower downtown, a seedier 
if livelier place, that stretches north from the apparel and jewelry marts to 
Broadway, Skid Row and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to Maguire Thomas and their architects is to create a link 
between the two sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have responded with the kind of exotic gesture one might have 
expected of Los Angeles in an earlier time, when the city dreamed of itself as 
a Mediterranean oasis, created its own Venice and built houses to look like 
Moorish palaces. 
</P>
<P>
Library Square looks to Rome for its inspiration. A lavish outdoor stairway 
meant to recall Rome's Spanish Steps will wend its way 50 feet down from the 
top of the hill, around the curved base of the tower to 5th Street and a 
walkway leading to the library's west lawn. According to designer Lawrence 
Halprin, cafes and kiosks will border one side of the stairway, which will be 
broken into a series of terraces with places to sit and eat. 
</P>
<P>
The steps, which won't be finished for several months, are based on one of the 
most striking architectural elements in Rome and one of that city's most 
romantic settings. In Los Angeles, unlike Rome, the steps will be notched 
between two giant buildings, the new tower and an existing high-rise office 
building next door. This being a modern city, the steps will be flanked by 
escalators. And, here, the steps will end rather abruptly against a busy 
thoroughfare, something that the Spanish Steps, descending into a long piazza, 
don't have to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
Halprin's plan has generated excitement downtown and a bit of grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Too baroque, too grandiose, too voluptuous, entirely too much going on," said 
Merry Norris, who chairs the city's Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Topping It Off 
</P>
<P>
As Pei's staff prepares to complete the new tower with its illuminated crown, 
they too say the bottom of the building is the most important part of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The base will be considered the most notable aspect of the building when the 
whole thing is done," Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring not just to the steps but to his own efforts at the foot of 
the tower. Cobb said he wanted to get away from the fortress facades typical of 
many big buildings downtown and to avoid "a confrontational stance" toward the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a building that came to the street facing several directions, and 
not staring stiffly in a flat-faced way that would challenge the primacy of the 
library," Cobb said. At the same time, he said, he did not want a round 
building. "Round buildings are self-centered. We were not interested in being 
the center of everything. We were trying to make a welcoming gesture." 
</P>
<P>
The shape that evolved is an interlocking series of planes and curves. From its 
glass crown, the building steps down, its competing geometries facing off at 
corners, terraces and ledges. At the base, the tower's granite finish gives way 
to colonnades of glass that Cobb hopes will create a feeling of transparency 
and openness. 
</P>
<P>
As critics and other architects watch the tower take shape, they say the 
business community is getting what it wanted, a thoughtfully conceived, sleekly 
tailored contemporary skyscraper with an aura of the past about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a late-modern office tower that recalls the romantic era of American 
skyscraper building," said John Kaliski, principal architect for the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling Hopes 
</P>
<P>
The building may also turn out to be the pacesetter that people hoped it would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpted facades and classical allusions evident in the plans of a dozen or 
more office buildings, now in the works, suggest that the skyline will be more 
varied than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt at all that the design stakes have been raised," Kaliski 
said. "L.A. is going to have a skyline as up to date as anywhere in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
But there is also the sense that the tower would fit in comfortably elsewhere, 
and that despite Cobb's sensitivity to the library he did not root his building 
in the culture of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much a modern American office building that could exist in many 
other cities," said Richard Keating, a Los Angeles architect who is designing 
the second building for Maguire Thomas at Library Square. The building will 
front on 5th Street just east of the new tower. Keating said his building will 
complement the tower. "We're not breaking new ground either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tower is a serious building. There are no exotic allusions, nothing to 
suggest the freewheeling, fanciful style of many buildings here. Even the 
63-year-old library, with its Egyptian ornamentation and Beaux Art details, 
reflects a bit of the exuberance of Los Angeles in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the tower) is a very sober building, one that avoids any element of the 
irony you see in a lot of buildings these days," Kaliski said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Matter of Taste 
</P>
<P>
"Cobb is an architect in a gray flannel suit. You don't expect his buildings to 
scream out at you. What you can expect is elegant, tasteful and careful 
design," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
It can be argued that Los Angeles' best architecture is mostly low-lying, in 
homes, stores and public buildings that aren't good models for designing 
skyscrapers. Moreover, Los Angeles has no high-rise base to build on. There is 
very little variety to big buildings downtown partly because of a fear of 
earthquakes that had led to the ban on tall buildings. (An exception was made 
for City Hall.) 
</P>
<P>
The tower at Library Square marks only the second generation of tall buildings 
here, perhaps a little early to be demanding originality. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just beginning," Keating said.

The steamer Portland, which disappeared in a storm 91 years ago with perhaps 
200 passengers, has been found at the bottom of the Atlantic off Massachusetts, 
an oceanographer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt; we've got it," said John Fish of the Historical Maritime 
Group of New England. Fish worked with Arnold Carr and William McElroy for 13 
years to solve the mystery of the Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"The find is particularly significant, not only because the Portland was one of 
the worst maritime disasters in the Northeast, but because it remained shrouded 
in mystery," Paul Johnston of the Smithsonian Institution said. 
</P>
<P>
Fish said it appears that the hull was rent lengthwise when the ship went down 
in 1898. "We expected something weather-beaten," Fish said. "We found something 
that appeared to have exploded."

SHAMIR BACKED ON PLAN FOR VOTE BY PALESTINIANS 
</P>

<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan to hold elections in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip received support in principle from most of his Cabinet on Sunday, 
although details were not worked out and hints of future disagreements surfaced 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Some rightist ministers, including two from Shamir's own Likud Party, warned 
that his plan would eventually lead to Palestinian independence. Leaders of the 
center-left Labor Party, while backing the proposal, put forward their own 
ideas on how elections should lead to peace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Arabs Killed 
</P>
<P>
While the Cabinet heard a report from Shamir on his recent diplomatic trip to 
Washington, soldiers shot and killed three Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, 
including a 10-year-old boy. In the past four days, at least 10 Palestinians 
have died in clashes with the army, making the period one of the bloodiest in 
the 17-month-old Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials were investigating an incident that occurred Thursday at the 
village of Nahhalin where at least four Arabs were killed. Police Commissioner 
Chaim Bar-Lev said initial findings showed that a few of the border police who 
raided the village were isolated by stone throwers, ran out of rubber bullets 
and turned to more lethal ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources, however, said the army was considering disciplinary action 
against two officers of the military's border police because their men used 
excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
The Nahhalin incident, along with the spate of weekend killings, appeared to be 
a setback for hopes expressed by the Bush Administration that a period of 
confidence-building take place to lead to peace talks between the Israeli and 
Palestinian sides. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's proposal suggests elections be held for Arab peace delegates who would 
work out an interim agreement with Israel and accept an autonomy arrangement 
under Israeli authority. Talks on a final arrangement would be held some time 
later. The Cabinet will name a "committee of experts" to work out the election 
details, said Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner. 
</P>
<P>
Pazner added that there is no timetable for the committee's work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of West Bank 
</P>
<P>
Criticism from the Likud Party centered on fears that the process would end in 
loss of the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a path of no return," cautioned David Levy, the housing minister and a 
persistent challenger for leadership in the Likud. Likud has long opposed 
giving up land in return for peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
Likud member Yitzhak Mordechai compared the plan to a man jumping out of a 
skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many details yet to be worked out are whether the elections would be 
for municipal posts or delegates elected at-large, whether Arabs who live in 
East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1967, could participate and whether 
Israel would withdraw any troops before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rabin Is Satisfied 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who originated a proposal similar to the one 
Shamir brought to Washington, expressed satisfaction with the election idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is a good initiative. This initiative puts the ball in the Arab, 
Palestinian court because Israel offers something concrete," Rabin said after 
Sunday's Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin is a top official of the Labor Party, which shares in Shamir's government 
a prominent, if junior, role. In national elections last year, Labor campaigned 
on a platform of holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza and at some point, 
surrendering occupied land in return for peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area-Wide Vote 
</P>
<P>
Rabin favors an area-wide vote, rather than one for municipal office holders, 
so that its winners would have no powers outside of negotiating with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who heads the Labor Party, said that the 
elections should produce delegates who would not only negotiate an interim 
accord but also the final status of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
"They will go and elect their representatives, something that will enable them 
to negotiate freely as equals for their own destiny," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
Arab activists initially rejected Shamir's proposal on the grounds that the 
vote would have no meaning if Palestinians were not guaranteed eventual 
independence. They also demanded at least some foreign supervision of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are now hinting at a positive response, if only because they are 
reluctant to appear rigid. The task of coming up with a measured response has 
been complicated, they say, by the violence of the past few days and especially 
that at Nahhalin. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that initial findings of an army investigation of the 
Nahhalin incident showed that the pre-dawn raid was badly planned. The 
commander of the company that entered the village was not present during the 
violence, and the officer in charge let things get out of control, initial 
inquiries showed. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that the border police and a regular army unit that later 
entered the village clashed when the army troops refused to give more 
ammunition to the border police. Harsh words and a shoving match broke out 
before the army left the scene, army sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron said that despite accusations that the border 
police have used excessive force in suppressing the uprising, the unit will 
continue to be deployed in the territories.

Dutch soccer fans smashed store windows, hurled bricks at police and fought 
with rival spectators Sunday, and 27 people were injured and 24 arrested, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence came one day after 94 people were crushed to death in a mad rush 
at a soccer match in Sheffield, England. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday's match between Ajax of Amsterdam and the Feyenoord team from 
Rotterdam, the visiting fans went on a rampage, smashing the interior of a 
subway train and windows of nearby shops, police spokesman Klaas Wilting said. 
</P>
<P>
Scuffles broke out before and after the match, which began 15 minutes late 
because of the unrest, Wilting said. Police wearing riot gear had to make 
several baton charges into the stands of the Olympic Stadium and in surrounding 
streets in order to keep the rival groups of fans apart, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those arrested were being held on suspicion of violent behavior, 
including hurling bricks at police, Wilting said. He said 24 soccer fans and 
three police officers were injured, and 10 of those were hospitalized. There 
was no immediate word on the extent of the damage, Wilting said.

A "moderately strong" earth tremor, with a magnitude of 4.5, shook buildings in 
Austria's mountainous northern Tyrol region early Sunday but caused no damage,

ILLINOIS' $69-MILLION LOTTO PRIZE TO BE SHARED 4 WAYS

<P>
There was no $69-million man or woman in Illinois on Sunday, but there were 
four winners who will have to be content with $17.25 million or so each as 
their shares of the world's biggest lottery jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
None of the winners had stepped forward by midday Sunday, but lottery director 
Sharon Sharp said two of them bought their tickets in the Chicago area, one in 
west-central Illinois and one in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of you who said it's easier to be struck by lightning than to win the 
Lotto, four people were struck last night, and they struck gold," Sharp told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers, drawn Saturday night, were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46, 54. 
</P>
<P>
The holders of the four winning tickets -- be they individuals, couples or 
groups -- will each receive at least $17.25 million before taxes, to be paid 
out over the next 20 years, she said. The prize may be even larger after final 
sales figures are tallied today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hopeful players from around the country descended on Illinois in the past week 
and bought tickets in record numbers that enabled lottery officials to pad the 
prize. Some travelers changed flight plans and stood in long lines at O'Hare 
International Airport; other players called from as far away as Europe to find 
out how to get a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
Losers, who were bucking odds of 13 million to 1, said they were disappointed 
but took the loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got one ticket because . . . if you're going to win, you'll win with 
one," said Lonny Taylor, a systems engineer from Chicago. "I didn't win, but it 
didn't bother me at all."

BUT BUSH AIDES STILL VOW TO FIGHT FOR KEY ADMINISTRATION BUDGET ITEM; 
</P>
<P>
DARMAN SEES SLIM CHANCE OF CAPITAL GAINS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's budget director conceded Sunday that "chances look to be low" 
for a key Administration budget priority -- reduction of capital gains taxes, 
but Administration officials still vowed to press ahead with the controversial 
tax cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to work awfully hard to get the capital gains tax reduction," said 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. And while chances for the plan look 
dim now because of strong opposition by congressional Democrats, the prospects 
could improve in the months to come, insisted Richard G. Darman, director of 
the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Windfall for Rich 
</P>
<P>
Bush argues that cutting taxes on capital gains -- income a person receives 
from the sale of assets such as stocks or bonds -- would spur the economy, but 
Democrats charge that the plan would merely line the pockets of the rich. 
Currently, income from capital gains is taxed the same way as any other kind of 
income. Under Bush's plan, most capital gains would be taxed at a lower rate, 
as has been past practice. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the idea is one of several unresolved elements in the agreement for 
next year's federal budget that the Administration and congressional leaders 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the budget agreement was announced, Administration officials claimed that 
it would reduce the federal deficit by about $27 billion, but in an interview 
Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation," Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman 
of the House Budget Committee, said that only about two-thirds of that amount 
is real. And even that two-thirds, he said, depends in large part on decisions 
that Congress and the Administration have yet to make. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Gimmicks Too 
</P>
<P>
The budget plan includes roughly $8 billion in real spending reductions, 
Panetta said, and a similar amount in new revenues. The balance of the 
agreement involves accounting gimmicks and plans to shift some spending from 
next year to this year, making the deficit worse for the current fiscal year, 
which ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
With major policy decisions yet to be made, Administration officials and 
congressional leaders fanned out to cover all the major network weekend 
interview programs seeking to advance their positions in the continuing budget 
debate. Their statements served mostly to illustrate how much the two sides 
continue to differ over deficit reduction and how much each side would like the 
other to be the first to propose higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, interviewed on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Sununu, on "Face 
the Nation," and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" each defended the capital gains proposal and lauded the budget agreement 
as a major first step toward reducing the deficit without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foes Assail Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, including Panetta on CBS, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim 
Sasser (D-Tenn.) on ABC and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker Saturday," each denounced the proposed 
capital gains cut, depreciated the budget agreement as "minimalist," in 
Sasser's words, and insisted that eventually Bush would have to propose higher 
taxes to really make a dent in the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to engage in a second level of negotiations with the 
Administration unless everything's on the table," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have everything discussed and negotiated," responded Sununu, 
"but it's a question of who brings it to the table." 
</P>
<P>
As the maneuvering continues, the most pressing immediate question is how to 
plug a $5.3-billion hole that the budget negotiators left in the middle of 
their agreement. The figure represents additional federal revenue that Congress 
and the Administration have agreed to raise without actually increasing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost in Asset Sales Seen 
</P>
<P>
The Administration argues that cutting the capital gains tax would accomplish 
most of that. If the tax is cut, Administration economists say, many people 
would take advantage of the lower rates and sell appreciated assets. The 
increase in asset sales, in turn, would bring the government more revenue even 
with lower rates. Bush proposed the tax cut during the fall campaign and argued 
strenuously for it. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats reject the idea. The rate cut might spur enough sales to increase 
revenue the first year but that would only steal money from future years, 
making the long-term deficit worse, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Mitchell said, Bush's proposal would "provide an enormous increase 
(in income) to those at the top" because wealthy families own nearly all the 
nation's capital assets. Given that the income disparity between rich and poor 
in America has increased noticeably in the last decade, "that's the last thing 
we need in our society today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Democrats stick to their opposition and the capital gains reduction does not 
pass, the way out of the current dilemma may be to extend some taxes that are 
currently set to expire, Sasser said. For example, he noted, the current 
federal excise tax on airplane tickets, which raises about $3 billion a year, 
is set to expire at the end of this year.

KEMP PROPOSAL EASES EVICTIONS DUE TO DRUG USE 
</P>

Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said Sunday his department will make illegal drug 
use or sales a specific violation of public housing leases as a way to ease the 
eviction process for local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp announced the step as he released a report describing actions public 
housing authorities around the country are already taking to solve drug-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the secretary of housing and urban development said HUD would 
inform local housing authorities of ways they can use already appropriated 
federal funds to make physical and management improvements aimed at improving 
security against drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
He said HUD would publish a notice informing local housing authorities that 
leases must include explicit provisions that allow termination of the lease if 
any member of a household or person under the tenant's control engages in 
drug-related criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Shorten Process 
</P>
<P>
Although evictions that are instigated because of drug-related activity are 
already possible, the process is often cumbersome because there is no direct 
provision in a lease relating to drug violations. Inclusion of such a clause 
would simplify and shorten the process -- in much the same way it is easier to 
evict a tenant for failure to meet specific rent obligations spelled out in a 
lease than it is to evict an undesirable tenant on some more vague ground. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD statement did not say whether a person had to be convicted of 
drug-related criminal activity before being evicted.

MANY SEEM AMBIVALENT ON IMPACT OF ROE VS. WADE RULING ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago's Cook County Hospital called it the "septic patients ward," but it was 
actually a chamber of medical horrors. When shame or poverty drove women to 
gamble on illegal abortion, the septic ward was where they often ended up. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Quentin Young did a few weeks of his internship there in the late 1940s, 
each day seeing 20 new victims of botched abortions and trying to repair the 
damage. Later, whenever he had to face a patient who was determined to end an 
unwanted pregnancy, the memories of those desperate women would haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had years of genuine anguish," recalls Young, who later became chairman of 
the hospital's department of medicine. "What I had seen made me unwilling to 
throw anybody out into that unsafe world, yet I had nothing to offer them" as 
an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Well before the U.S. Supreme Court made abortion legal in 1973, most people had 
come to agree that there was something wrong with an outright ban on abortion. 
All but three states had passed laws to allow it in some circumstances, and 
four -- Arkansas, Hawaii, New York and Washington -- permitted it for any 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Form of Birth Control 
</P>
<P>
With abortion rights once again under threat, Young is adamant that the 
procedure should remain available to women who want it. But he worries that it 
has become "the ultimate form of birth control. . . . It's not a good thing 
that it's used that way." 
</P>
<P>
Today's statistics are troublesome, even to those who fought to make abortion 
legal. One in four pregnancies now ends in abortion, giving the United States 
one of the highest abortion rates in the industrialized world. About 40% of the 
women getting abortions have had them before. 
</P>
<P>
Activists on both sides may shout their views without a trace of uncertainty, 
but like Young, most Americans seem ambivalent about where the Supreme Court's 
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision has taken this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polls Show Contradiction 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show an unreconcilable contradiction in the views of most 
Americans. On the one hand, they express solid support for the idea of allowing 
a woman, not the government, to choose whether she will have an abortion. But 
in the same surveys, they also say abortion should be against the law in most 
of the instances where it is used. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years, politicians and voters did not have to reckon with these 
inconsistencies, because Roe vs. Wade protected the right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators seeking to placate abortion foes without arousing pro-choice forces 
always had an easy out: They routinely approved new restrictions on abortion, 
well aware that judges would quickly knock them down. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the Supreme Court may once again throw the entire question back 
into the political arena, when it rules on the constitutionality of a Missouri 
law imposing relatively narrow restrictions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has urged that the Missouri case be used to overturn 
Roe vs. Wade entirely. Even if the court upholds only the Missouri law, it will 
send a strong signal that its new conservative majority is ready to start 
dismantling abortion rights. Anti-abortion groups also expect to find allies 
among the scores of conservative Ronald Reagan appointees who now dominate many 
federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to Drawing Board' 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, it's back to the drawing board; if we don't, it's full speed 
ahead," says Susan Carpenter McMillan, president of the Right to Life League of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, agrees. If the court allows any part of the Missouri law to stand, she 
says, "it opens the door all across the country. They're going to test the 
limits in every state." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion, an issue that barely registered on the political radar of state 
elections recently, could suddenly hit lawmakers with hurricane force. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Legislature will stop dead in its tracks. They won't be able to get 
anything else done," predicts Sue Rockne, a Democratic national committeewoman 
and pro-choice activist from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the actions they have taken in the years since Roe vs. Wade, most 
states would put significant restrictions on abortion, and many would try to 
make it almost impossible to get one. Among those expected to move most 
quickly: Illinois, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Minnesota, Idaho and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
California, which protects the right to an abortion in its state Constitution, 
is generally expected to remain in the pro-choice camp. 
</P>
<P>
However, California is one of only about 10 states where abortion rights 
activists are reasonably confident they can prevail. An equal number of states 
already have laws on their books expressing an intent to make abortion illegal 
or regulate it to the maximum extent possible if the Supreme Court shows any 
inclination to chip away at abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Another indicator of the direction an individual state may go is the 
restrictions it has put on abortion already. Many have pressed as far as the 
courts will let them. 
</P>
<P>
The most far-reaching has been the refusal of 37 states and the federal 
government to spend their welfare dollars on abortion, except in extreme 
circumstances. A dozen states also mandate parental notification or consent 
before a minor may receive an abortion, although courts have required them to 
allow judges to waive that requirement in individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
While anti-abortion forces have been less effective recently in electing their 
candidates to Congress, there is some evidence that their strength has been 
building on the state level. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the years since Roe vs. Wade, abortion foes made no headway with 
the ballot initiatives that they advanced. In 1984, their persistence paid off 
for the first time, when they narrowly won a Colorado referendum banning 
state-funded abortions for the poor. The symbolism of the vote was important, 
because Colorado had been the first state in the nation to liberalize its 
abortion laws back in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, they scored three additional victories: Colorado reaffirmed its 
stand against Medicaid funding for abortion, while Arkansas and Michigan 
followed suit. The Arkansas referendum also included language declaring it 
state policy to protect "the life of every unborn child from the moment of 
conception." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predictions Impossible 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to predict with certainty what any state will do, however, 
because the political momentum could shift dramatically. Pro-choice activists 
have just begun marshaling their forces -- most visibly, at the gigantic 
protest march in Washington April 9, where at least 300,000 turned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (April 9) was literally a turning point where the pro-choice majority 
found its voice," Michelman says, claiming that her pro-choice coalition is 
signing up 15,000 new recruits a week. Pro-choice groups also are planning a 
major advertising campaign to get across the point that any government 
intervention threatens all abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no moderate position. You either have a fundamental right, or you 
don't," Michelman says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other side is beginning to smell victory after years of 
frustration, and is not about to give any ground. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dupre, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, says his 
group is working furiously "to educate our folks now that, whatever the court's 
decision, we are left with battles in the states that must be fought. We are 
making sure that people know and understand that this issue comes back to the 
states." 
</P>
<P>
Legislators are keenly aware of the single-mindedness of those who oppose 
abortion. "We will go to the polls for this one issue," McMillan says. "That's 
where our strength comes from." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quieter Search Continues 
</P>
<P>
Even as the clouds gather for a roaring political storm, a quieter moral search 
continues among scientists, philosophers and theologians, who are no closer 
than they have ever been to settling the basic question of when human life 
begins. Nor can they agree on how to balance the interests of the fetus against 
those of the full-grown woman who carries it. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of 16 years and 25 million legal abortions has done little to 
resolve the questions that abortion poses. If anything, it has become an even 
thornier subject than it was when the Supreme Court handed down Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more women have sought abortion, their individual stories have 
raised issues never considered before. What, for example, are the rights of the 
father in determining the fate of a fetus? Who makes the abortion decision when 
a woman has been physically or mentally incapacitated? Should fetal tissue be 
used for medical research? 
</P>
<P>
And which is the greater evil: abortion, or bringing a child into a world where 
only suffering awaits him? 
</P>
<P>
To many women, it seems unfair for the government to be allowed to make that 
choice without shouldering the responsibility it carries. 
</P>
<P>
During last month's protests by the militant anti-abortion group Operation 
Rescue, one abortion foe yelled at a group of pro-choice picketers: "In hell, 
you're going to lift up your eyes. You're going to hear all these babies cry." 
</P>
<P>
A woman named Rosa, who admitted she had recently had an abortion, shouted 
back: "I'm a poor black woman with two children. Why don't you put your money 
where your mouth is, and give me some money for my children?" 
</P>
<P>
Rockne, the Minnesota lobbyist, says that many legislators have not considered 
the consequences of an outright ban on abortion. "Wait until they see what 
their welfare budgets are going to look like," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She and other pro-choice activists also insist that outlawing abortion will not 
stop it. History proves that. 
</P>
<P>
Rich women will find a way to obtain it outside their home states, says Merle 
Hoffman of the New York Pro-Choice Coalition. "Black and poor and Hispanic 
women will find that the kitchen tables are their new health care system." 
</P>
<P>
Many argue that government must turn its attention to the forces that bring 
pregnant women to abortion clinics in the first place. They press for reducing 
poverty, improving sex education and reforming adoption policy. 
</P>
<P>
The most basic reason that the United States has a higher abortion rate than 
other industrialized countries is the fact that contraceptive use is lower 
here, according to a study of 20 Western nations by the Alan Guttmacher 
Institute, a nonprofit group that does research, policy analysis and public 
education on reproductive issues. 
</P>
<P>
The institute reported that other countries routinely make contraceptives 
available at convenient and familiar locations, and at low or no cost. Women in 
the United States generally must go to medical specialists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Methods Available 
</P>
<P>
The range of available contraceptive methods is also greater in other 
countries, the institute reported. Not yet available here are such means as 
steroidal implants, injectable steroids and more easily reversible tubal 
sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it likely that any new methods will come on the market soon. Most U.S. 
companies have been scared out of the business by huge liability judgments. 
"Basically, only Johnson &amp; Johnson is doing serious research," said Carl 
Habermaf, a securities analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
No contraception is foolproof, however, so society will never be able to 
completely escape its abortion dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have long felt that abortion, although abhorrent, is basically a 
private matter. That feeling came through once again in a Times poll last 
month, when 74% agreed with the statement, "I personally feel that abortion is 
morally wrong, but I also feel that whether or not to have an abortion is a 
decision that has to be made by every woman for herself." 
</P>
<P>
But in the same survey, only 41% said they would make legal abortion available 
in cases where women believe they cannot afford more children. That would 
eliminate one of the justifications cited for more than two-thirds of all 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
A majority expressed the opinion that abortion should be legal only in cases of 
rape, incest, likelihood of fetal defect or a threat to the mother's health. 
Those circumstances account for a small fraction of the 1.5 million abortions 
performed in this country each year, according to a 1987 study by the 
Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rate Doubles 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it is contradictory to assert that abortion is a private matter, 
then to advocate that the government deny it to most of the people who seek it. 
What this may reflect is a general feeling that abortion is a necessary option, 
but that it is too often becoming a means of birth control or a matter of mere 
convenience. The annual legal abortion rate today is more than double the 
number performed in 1973, the first year that it was legal in every state. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's churches, long the moral voices in the debate, are themselves 
reassessing their views in light of the role abortion has come to play in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics, originally almost alone in their strong opposition to Roe vs. Wade, 
appear increasingly divided over how high abortion should rank on their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Some bishops are recruiting their flocks for the all-out war being waged by 
Operation Rescue, which physically blockades abortion clinics to try to shut 
them down. Others are trying to diffuse the church's emphasis on abortion by 
making it part of a "consistent life ethic" that also weighs such issues as the 
death penalty and nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the mainstream Protestant churches that helped lead the 
fight to end illegal abortion are shifting subtly in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Episcopal Church general convention approved a statement 
declaring that life is "sacred from its inception until death" and warning that 
abortion "should be used only in extreme situations." 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, we've really been struggling with this," says Marcia Newcombe, 
Episcopal officer for social welfare. "It's a struggle to keep the pro-choice 
stance in the forefront, (but) there is that sense that people are becoming a 
little too free in their relying on abortion." 
</P>

WHY WOMEN HAVE ABORTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 The following figures are based on a 1987 survey of 1,900 abortion patients by 
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit corporation for research, policy 
analysis and public education in the reproductive health field. Each woman was 
allowed to cite more than one reason: 
</P>
<P>
In percent 
</P>
<P>
Concern about how having a baby could change her life: 76 
</P>
<P>
Can't afford baby now: 68 
</P>
<P>
Problems with relationship or desire to avoid single parenthood: 51 
</P>
<P>
Not ready for responsibility: 31 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't want others to know she has had sex or is pregnant: 31 
</P>
<P>

C.K. MCCLATCHY, 62; HEAD OF CHAIN OF NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
C.K. McClatchy, chairman of the McClatchy chain of newspapers in California, 
Washington state and Alaska, died Sunday after collapsing while jogging in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken man known for his abiding independence, McClatchy, 62, was 
jogging in William Land Park, near a school bearing his family's name, when he 
apparently suffered a heart attack, said McClatchy Newspapers President Erwin 
Potts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a great friend and a great boss," said Potts, who knew McClatchy 
for 13 years. "He was a hell of a newspaperman and he was a hell of a guy. 
We're just going to miss him an awful lot." 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy, who Potts said had no history of heart problems, was pronounced dead 
shortly after 1 p.m. at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy Newspapers publishes the Sacramento Bee and 11 other West Coast 
newspapers. The Anchorage Daily News, one of the company's papers, won the 
Pulitzer Prize for public service last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Place in Journalism 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to draw up a list of people most important to journalism in this 
country, you'd come to C.K. pretty early in the game," said Riverside 
Press-Enterprise Publisher Tim Hayes, a longtime McClatchy friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I was most struck by his independence," Hayes said. "There's so little 
independence left in this profession. He was a wonderful guy without any 
pretense." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times Publisher and Chief Executive Officer Tom Johnson described 
McClatchy as a "splendid newspaper leader who represented the very highest 
standards of editorial and managerial excellence." 
</P>
<P>
"He was uncommonly dedicated to quality in his newspapers. His passing is a 
major loss to our profession." 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy's family has been a powerful force in Sacramento since 1857, when 
C.K. McClatchy's great-grandfather, James McClatchy, served as the first editor 
of the Sacramento Bee. He later bought the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
C.K. (for Charles Kenny) McClatchy was born in Fresno on March 25, 1927, and 
earned a bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1950. He began his 
career as a reporter for the Washington Post in 1953, and moved to the 
Sacramento Bee five years later. 
</P>
<P>
He held several editorial and managerial posts at the Bee and with the parent 
company, and was elected chairman of the board when McClatchy Newspapers stock 
was offered for sale to the public last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Others 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time the company began offering its shares on the American 
Stock Exchange, McClatchy accused some newspaper chains of paying more 
attention to profits than to quality journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering the annual Press-Enterprise Lecture at UC Riverside, McClatchy 
pointedly criticized several newspaper groups, saying Rupert Murdoch's News 
America Co., then owner of the New York Post, "deserves mention in any listing 
of the appalling." 
</P>
<P>
"He was saying we should talk candidly about the problems associated with group 
or chain ownership," said the Press-Enterprise's Hayes. "Groups should 
criticize each other and look at the problems -- the sameness of papers in a 
chain, excessive rotation of editors. Nobody is in your town for more than 
three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy's great-grandfather came to California during the 1849 Gold Rush and 
sent dispatches to several newspapers, including Horace Greeley's New York 
Tribune. As the Bee's editor, he proved to be a forceful environmentalist, 
arguing against hydraulic mining. 
</P>
<P>
The process ruined the environment, poured debris into the rivers and harmed 
farmers, James McClatchy argued. When he died in 1883, he was succeeded by C.K. 
McClatchy, a champion of the state's progressive movement, ally of reform Gov. 
Hiram Johnson and a foe of the Southern Pacific Railroad's grip on state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The elder C.K., who died in 1936, was succeeded by his daughter, Eleanor, who 
left Columbia University to run the company for the next 42 years. She, in 
turn, was followed by McClatchy, her nephew, and C.K.'s grandson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberal Editorial Policy 
</P>
<P>
The papers were characterized by their liberal editorial point of view, and 
McClatchy's endorsement was vigorously sought by Democratic Party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy had autographed photos of John F. Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson, Theodore 
Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Earl Warren in his office. He worked as 
Stevenson's press secretary during the former Illinois governor's 1956 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy's independence and courage made the newspaper company willing "to 
take on big, tough and potentially dangerous subjects, and to risk and fight 
through the litigation that this inevitably brings," former Sacramento Bee 
executive editor Frank McCulloch told The Times in a 1987 interview. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers once had seven libel suits pending simultaneously in Fresno 
County alone, McCulloch said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt once sued the chain's Bee newspapers for $250 million, 
charging that he had been libeled in a story saying profits had been skimmed 
from a gambling casino he once owned. Laxalt and the papers settled the suit 
before trial, and both sides claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He can put whatever label on it he wants to, but the fact is he has dismissed 
(the suit) without (receiving) any apology, without any retraction and without 
any payment of money (for damages)," McClatchy said of Laxalt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Payment 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers' insurance carrier later paid Laxalt's lawyers $647,454 for 
their work in the unsuccessful suit. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Sacramento Bee and the Anchorage Daily News, McClatchy 
Newspapers publishes the Fresno Bee and Modesto Bee, the Tacoma News Tribune 
and Tri-City Herald in Washington state and several weekly newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of McClatchy's death, he was a member of the Pulitzer Prize board, 
the Newspaper Advertising Board of Directors, a trustee of the Washington 
Journalism Center in Washington, D.C., and a member of the executive committee 
of the American Press Institute. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy is survived by two sons, Charles, 30, of Phoenix, Ariz., and Kevin, 
26, of Miami; a daughter, Adair, 28, of San Francisco; two brothers, James, 58, 
of Tiburon, and Ellery, 64, of Palm Beach, Fla., and his mother, Phebe, of 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were pending.

SUSUMU HAGIWARA; MEDICAL PIONEER, UCLA PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susumu Hagiwara, a physician and professor of physiology at the UCLA School of 
Medicine who was a pioneer in understanding the mechanisms of excitability in 
nerve and muscle cells, has died of a heart attack, a school spokesman 
announced. Hagiwara was 66 and died April 1 at his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
Hagiwara, the Eleanor I. Leslie professor of neuroscience at the Westwood 
campus, was the first to hold an endowed chair there. 
</P>
<P>
"Susumu Hagiwara revolutionized our understanding of how calcium moves across 
cell membranes, basic discoveries which lead to the calcium-blocking agents 
currently used to treat patients with heart disease, migraine and stroke," said 
Dr. Kenneth Shine, dean of the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Hagiwara, who is survived by his wife, Satoko, and a son, won dozens of honors 
and had been awarded several honorary degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he was involved with the regulation of ion channels in nerve and 
muscle membranes.

MENTAL 'PROFILE' CALLS SALCIDO A DANGER TO ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If police accounts of Ramon Salcido's rampage are correct, relatives and 
colleagues are at greatest risk from the 27-year-old winery worker, according 
to forensic psychiatrists and a psychologist who compiled a profile of the 
suspect for the Sonoma County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Strangers face less danger, but after so many killings, Salcido is "capable of 
anything -- capable of suicide, certainly capable of taking another life. . . . 
Anybody who has contact with him is in jeopardy," Sonoma County Sheriff Richard 
Michaelsen told reporters after receiving an assessment of Salcido's likely 
actions from police psychologist H. Wayne Light. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Salcido may try to kill himself or force police to kill him. "But 
right now," Michaelsen said, "he's bent on killing other people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Light's description of Salcido as "a time bomb" prompted the sheriff to 
place the suspect's hospitalized daughter and co-worker, as well as his 
father-in-law, former wife and daughter in Fresno under guard. Protection also 
will be provided at the victims' funerals, Michaelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Light, who works with law enforcement agencies in Northern California, had 
warned authorities after the first five slayings Friday that Salcido also was 
capable of killing the three daughters he had apparently abducted. The next 
day, the bodies of Teresa, 1, and Sofia, 4, were found at a local garbage dump. 
Salcido's 3-year-old daughter, Carmina, was found alive, but with her throat 
cut from ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wish I'd been very wrong," Light said. He refused to discuss the 
Salcido profile in more detail than that released by the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists, however, describe the person who committed the wine country 
crimes as a rare and exceptionally dangerous blend of two types of killers: 
those who exact vengeance on workplace colleagues, generally suffering from 
paranoia, and those who slaughter their families, generally depressives who 
reveal warning signs of impending violence. 
</P>
<P>
Murderers of colleagues usually kill one or two others at the workplace, then 
stop. They tend to be suspicious and believe in conspiracies against them, 
projecting all the blame for their career problems on others, psychiatrists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who murder their families often then call police and either wait calmly 
for authorities or commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
But Salcido's travel to multiple locations, his refusal to surrender and his 
use of both a pistol and a knife defy the experts' categories. He is also 
younger than most family mass murderers. And the possibility that he may have 
cashed a check at a local bank after the first round of killings baffles them, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
His apparent history of heavy drinking and drug use also complicate matters, 
psychiatrists said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is so frightening that one Orange County psychiatrist who has 
studied murderers asked to remain unidentified in print. "He may be here," the 
psychiatrist said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido "seems to be some incredible combination," the psychiatrist said. "He's 
acting as though he's quite psychotic and, on the other hand, as though he's 
quite in control of his senses." 
</P>
<P>
Another psychiatrist, Park Dietz of Newport Beach, believes that Salcido 
probably has a list -- in his head or written down -- of intended victims. 
Dietz, who evaluated John Hinckley for the U.S. government after Hinckley shot 
former President Ronald Reagan, said Salcido probably will try to kill all of 
those named on his list. "The most important thing is his mission," Dietz said, 
even more important than protecting himself. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica psychiatrist Mark J. Mills agreed. "The general rule is that the 
best history of future behavior is past behavior," Mills said. "This is a guy 
who killed people who are close to him." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mills speculated, some of the slayings may have had little to do with 
revenge. He said Salcido may have killed his daughters because he thought death 
would be better for them than living with the aftermath of their father's 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Salcido believes someone stands in the way of accomplishing his 
goals, that person could well become a victim too, experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be the guy who picks him up hitchhiking," Mills said. "Who 
knows what all this has done to his underlying propensity to solve problems 
with violence?" 
</P>
<P>
Light, according to the sheriff, and psychiatrists agreed that anyone who sees 
Salcido should alert authorities and stay away from him. "If he held me 
hostage, I would follow exactly what he told me to do," Mills said. "But 
presumably his daughters did that too and two of them are dead."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PAUPERS' GRAVES COST MONEY AND DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extremes of San Diego County are ever more apparent: the million-dollar 
manses and $300,000 tract homes on one end, the migrants in the bush and 
homeless on the streets on the other. 
</P>
<P>
One misery index is unequivocal. The number of people dying so destitute that 
their worldly assets cannot pay the cost of a burial or cremation is up sharply 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985-86, the county public administrator arranged for 132 burials or 
cremations for indigents. The figure for 1986-87 was 172, for 1987-88 it was 
206. And in the first six months of 1988-89 it is 150. 
</P>
<P>
The acting public administrator sees no reason that the full year's count will 
not top 300, a 50% increase in one year. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if the county hands out free burials or cremations lightly. The 
deceased's assets are carefully tallied, and relatives are quizzed to see if 
they can contribute. Only as a last resort does the county take over. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of indigents are cremated, but those who are thought to have been 
opposed to 
</P>
<P>
cremation are buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Southeast San Diego, in unmarked 
graves, up to four per grave, separated by a thin layer of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had them arrive in plastic bags and cardboard boxes," said cemetery 
manager George Stelter. "I've had to tell the mortuaries that I want them in 
decent containers. I think every dead body is due some dignity." 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego, which runs Mount Hope, gets $145 for an indigent burial 
-- $90 for digging and closing an adult-size grave and $55 for "perpetual" 
care. The $90 figure was set in 1980, the $55 figure in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
But even a pauper's grave is not immune to the rising costs attached to even 
the most modest slice of local real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing no end to the trend of increasing indigent burials, the city has 
decided to seek a higher individual payment, closer to the $400 it says each 
burial actually costs. 
</P>
<P>
Customer Dissatisfaction 
</P>
<P>
Linda Silverman Goldzimer, the former deputy chief administrative officer of 
San Diego County, now runs her own business consulting firm in San Diego and 
New York and is the author of the just-published " 'I'm First': Your Customer's 
Message to You." 
</P>
<P>
Goldzimer and collaborator Gregory Beckmann, news editor of the San Diego 
County Edition of The Times, argue that too many businesses and public agencies 
are shackled by a sloppy attitude toward customers and a lack of marching 
orders and incentives for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Their view of modern public agencies: 
</P>
<P>
"Citizen discontent has led to . . . public-contact staff members (who usually 
see themselves as underpaid and who frequently work in antiquated offices) 
becoming unnecessarily frustrated, tense, mortified, and feeling helpless about 
their ability to do a good job -- so they don't do a good job, or they quit and 
you have to hire and train someone new." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Unless something is done, the driver's license line at the DMV is 
the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
No Match for UCSD 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that Peterson Hall at UC San Diego had ever seen a presentation 
as revealing or an audience as intense as a week ago during a fraternity rush 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred male students packed the campus lecture hall to watch two young 
women cover themselves with oil and wrestle around on a mat. One of the women 
began the frivolity by flinging off her bikini top and engaging in what was 
called "interaction" with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
One delighted fellow was invited to remove her lace stockings with his teeth. 
Another decided to make the wrestling match a threesome. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience was totally into it, yelling and screaming," reported the UCSD 
Guardian, the student newspaper. The shouting has now stopped, but the outcry 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
A campus feminist group called the event sexist and "regressive," the 
fraternity that sponsored it has issued an apology, and the chancellor's office 
is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
The wrestling match has also become an issue in this week's election for 
student body president, in which the fraternity president is a candidate.

GENES THAT CAUSE CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENTISTS GAIN INSIGHT INTO TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR FUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The study of oncogenes -- genes that cause cancer -- is one of the most 
promising approaches to understanding cancer, many scientists believe. Now, 
scientists are gaining insight into not only oncogenes but their "mirror 
images," anti-oncogenes, which protect cells from cancer. Such studies, they 
say, may lead to the development of entirely new ways to treat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The first oncogene (from the Greek onkos, meaning mass or tumor) was isolated 
in the early 1970s from a virus that causes cancer in chickens. Researchers 
found that a single gene in the virus could cause the tumors. Biologists have 
subsequently found oncogenes in a variety of viruses. 
</P>
<P>
The oncogenes are closely related to cellular genes that are responsible for 
the normal proliferation of cells, such as during infancy and adolescence. In 
fact, researchers believe most human cancers result when these normal genes are 
converted to oncogenes by chemicals, radiation or exposure to viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, researchers found a family of human genes whose function is 
almost the exact opposite of the oncogenes. They quickly dubbed these new genes 
anti-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the anti-oncogenes is "a tremendous breakthrough that, within 
the next decade, is going to have a tremendous impact on human cancer," 
according to geneticist John Minna of the National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Md. Researchers studying anti-oncogenes have been in a period of 
"feverish activity," added molecular biologist Robert Weinberg of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical 
Research in Cambridge, and new discoveries are being made "unexpectedly 
rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
One potential use of anti-oncogenes for therapy has already been demonstrated. 
Molecular biologist Wen-Hwa Lee of UC San Diego and others have already shown 
that the addition of anti-oncogenes to tumor cells grown in the laboratory can 
convert the cells back into healthy, non-cancerous cells. While it may not be 
practical to add anti-oncogenes to tumors in humans, researchers hope that they 
can find simple chemicals that will mimic the activity of the anti-oncogenes. 
</P>
<P>
One unexpected result of the research on oncogenes and anti-oncogenes, 
according to microbiologist Edward E. Harlow Jr. of the Cold Spring Harbor 
Laboratory in New York, is the recent discovery that at least four different 
types of viruses that cause cancer in animals and humans operate through a 
common mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the viruses produces a protein that inactivates a recently discovered 
different cellular protein that acts as a brake on undesirable cell growth, 
Harlow has found. By canceling the activity of the restraining protein, the 
viral protein sets the stage for the unrestrained growth typical of cancer. 
That growth might then be triggered by a chemical carcinogen such as tobacco 
smoke, by radiation, or perhaps even by another virus. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that discovery, some scientists are concluding that the 100 or 
so different types of cancer actually represent a much smaller number of types 
that are clinically quite different, such as the rapidly proliferating cancer 
of the blood called leukemia and the much slower growing cancer of the colon, 
but that share a common mechanism at the molecular level. Researchers have 
feared that it would be necessary to develop a unique form of therapy for each 
of the 100 types, but it seems possible that cancers with similar mechanisms 
might ultimately be found susceptible to similar forms of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
But the research has implications far beyond cancer research. Because the genes 
produce chemical signals that control the proliferation of cells, the research 
may shed light on such disparate processes as stimulating wound healing, 
initiating the production of more blood or immune cells in injured or ill 
patients, and perhaps eventually even in stimulating the growth and healing of 
spinal cords or the regeneration of missing organs or limbs. 
</P>
<P>
According to molecular biologist Donald Coffey of the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine in Baltimore: "Research on cancer may teach us more about 
biology than it does about cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Another major boost to the study of oncogenes -- and one that was crucial to 
Harlow's work -- was the discovery of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene in October, 
1986, by ophthalmologist Thaddeus Dryja of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear 
Infirmary. The RB gene was like no other gene seen before. The gene protects 
the body against development of retinoblastoma, a rare eye tumor that affects 
about 500 children in the United States each year. Retinoblastoma occurs only 
when RB genes are inactivated. 
</P>
<P>
Most people are born with two healthy RB genes, one from each parent, that 
protect them from retinoblastoma. Only rarely, about once in every 40,000 
individuals, both RB genes in a single cell are damaged by chemicals, viruses 
or radiation, allowing a tumor to form. 
</P>
<P>
Dryja and his colleagues, however, studied an inherited form of the disease. He 
found that children in such families inherit a normal RB gene from one parent 
and a defective gene from the other parent. In these children, only the healthy 
RB gene must be damaged before a tumor occurs. The process occurs so easily, 
they found, that many children from such families develop multiple tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Dryja has developed a genetic test to identify children who are susceptible to 
retinoblastoma. These children can then be monitored closely to detect tumors 
in their earliest stages, when they are more vulnerable to therapy. 
</P>

Were the RB gene linked only to retinoblastoma, it might be considered little 
more than a curiosity. But epidemiologists have found that children who survive 
retinoblastoma and grow to adulthood also have a high incidence of osteogenic 
sarcoma, breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. Researchers have found that 
many cells from such tumors are also missing the RB gene, suggesting that loss 
of the RB gene contributed to development of the tumors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, molecular geneticist Eric Stanbridge of UC Irvine isolated chromosome 
13 from healthy cells and inserted it into cultured tumor cells from an 
osteogenic sarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and found that the chromosome caused 
the cells to revert to normal. That feat has subsequently been duplicated with 
other chromosomes and other cancers. Last December, Lee demonstrated that the 
retinoblastoma gene, which is found on chromosome 13, can cure the osteogenic 
sarcoma cells by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Lee has been studying the protein that is produced by the RB gene and has found 
that it binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the cell's genetic blueprint. He 
and others believe that this RB protein binds to certain sites in a cell's DNA 
and thereby prevents the activity of genes that promote cellular growth. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers now know that a whole family of genes similar to the RB gene exist 
throughout the body to regulate growth. Studies have shown, for example, that 
many colon cancers are missing a segment of chromosome 5 that presumably 
carries an analog of the RB gene, while other tumors have been found to lack 
sections of chromosome 11. 
</P>
<P>
Harlow's group, working with MIT's Weinberg, found that an oncogene-related 
protein called E1A binds to the RB protein, "the first example where the 
product of an oncogene binds to the product of an anti-oncogene," Harlow said. 
The binding of the two proteins prevents the RB gene from functioning -- in 
effect, releasing the brake on the cell. The cell is then free to respond to 
other growth stimuli, which leads to tumor formation. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent American Cancer Society symposium in Irvine, Harlow said 
oncogenes in other cancer-causing viruses also bind to the RB protein. The SV40 
virus, which causes tumors in monkeys, makes a protein that binds to the RB 
protein. So too do all polyoma viruses, which cause cancer in animals and 
cultured cells. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significant, the papilloma virus has a protein called E7 that 
binds to the RB protein. The papilloma virus, Harlow said, "is associated with 
90% of cervical carcinomas in humans." It is not yet clear why the other 
viruses are unable to cause cancer in humans. "Undoubtedly, the body has worked 
out ways to defend against these viruses," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion may itself be important. If researchers can discover how the 
body fights off some cancer-causing viruses, they may be able to learn how to 
fight off others.

GROWTH TREATMENT TESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

197th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Dallas.

A new approach to treating children with growth disorders caused by 
insufficient production of human growth hormone is being successfully tested 
clinically, according to chemist Arthur Felix of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in 
Nutley, N.J. Such children are now treated with hormone produced in bacteria 
through genetic engineering techniques, but the relatively expensive protein 
must be used in fairly large amounts and must be injected three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann-La Roche has been working with a different protein, called growth 
hormone releasing factor, that was discovered in 1982 by researchers at the 
Salk Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The releasing factor, about a quarter the size of the growth hormone, is 
produced in the hypothalamus gland and stimulates production of several forms 
of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. It can be used in much smaller 
quantities than the hormone and, because it is a much smaller protein, can be 
administered through a skin patch rather than by injection. He predicted that 
the hormone could be used on 10,000 children in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Felix and his colleagues have developed a derivative of the releasing factor 
that is smaller still and that appears especially effective in animals. 
Research in cows and pigs has shown that it increases milk production and the 
efficiency with which feed is converted into muscle, while making the animals 
leaner.

DRUGS PREVENT FOWL DISEASE

<P>
A new way to prevent the spread of coccidiosis, a parasitic disease of 
chickens, has been developed by researchers at Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Their approach is particularly promising, said chemist Douglas Rector, because 
it does not involve dosing the chickens with antibiotics or other drugs that 
might be passed on to humans in chicken flesh. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is caused by a parasite called coccidia, which is transferred from 
chicken to chicken when they eat infected fecal matter in the litter that lines 
their cages. The researchers have found that a family of drugs called 
quinolines and quinazolines, which are harmless to humans but foul-tasting to 
chickens, can be added to the litter to prevent the chickens from eating it. 
Tests with chickens have shown, Rector said, that it prevents spread of the 
disease in coops.

'JEKYLL, HYDE' FOUND IN WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times science writer Thomas H. Maugh II reports from the 
197th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Dallas.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many red wines contain a "Jekyll and Hyde" chemical that is both a mutagen (a 
chemical causing mutations in cells) and a potent anti-cancer chemical, 
according to microbiologist Terrance Leighton of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, called quercetin, occurs naturally in high concentrations in 
onions and garlic and in lower concentrations in many fruits and vegetables, 
including the grapes used for making red wines. Recent studies in China have 
shown that Chinese who eat diets high in onions and garlic have only 
one-quarter as much stomach cancer as the general population there. 
</P>
<P>
In his study of 250 red wines from around the world, Leighton, who owns the 
Kalin Cellars Winery in Novato, found quercetin only in those that had not been 
treated with a chemical called PVPP during "fining," the process of removing 
fine solids from the wine. Quercetin binds to PVPP and is removed. Leighton 
noted that there is no danger in drinking red wines because the 
anti-carcinogenic effect of the chemical is much greater than the mutagenic 
effect.

NFL GETTING READY FOR SOME ACTION OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL, already busy with late college draft details, enters a week in which 
it will begin to make major decisions about a proposed international spring 
league and the successor to Commissioner Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
The 28 club owners or their representatives will meet Tuesday in New York to 
review the sale of the Dallas Cowboys and get down to serious business about a 
spring league that figures to have teams in the United States and overseas. At 
the least, a group will be formed to look at all aspects from television to 
travel costs, and almost everyone expects Cowboys President Tex Schramm to be 
intimately involved with the project. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the league office will have received recommendations from all clubs 
for consideration as successors to Rozelle, who recently announced his 
retirement after 29 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Any number of names may be recommended, but some of the more prominent ones 
include Washington-based attorney Paul Tagliabue, who has represented the NFL 
in court and before Congress; former player Calvin Hill; and Pete Dawkins, who 
recently failed in a bid to become a U.S. Senator from New Jersey. NFC 
President Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and AFC President Lamar Hunt 
of the Kansas City Chiefs head the selection team and probably will begin to 
seriously review the recommendations after the April 23 draft. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated league development, there are increasing indications that if Al 
Davis and his Los Angeles Raiders can't work out things in Southern California, 
a suitable arrangement could be worked out in Oakland, of all places. 
</P>
<P>
While George Vucasin, president of the Oakland Coliseum Commission, said he has 
not talked with Davis, he indicated there are few if any hard feelings over the 
Raiders' departure from the Bay area earlier this decade. A Raiders' preseason 
game in Oakland Alameda County Stadium sold out in 2 1/2 hours. "It surprassed 
anybody's wildest imagination," Vucasin said. "There may be a stronger base of 
fan support here than in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Vucasin said he is prohibited from negotiating with the Raiders until something 
is resolved with the Southern California city of Irwindale, which had 
engineering and environmental problems with its potential stadium location, to 
where the Raiders are considering moving. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not talked with Al Davis, at all," he said, adding the Oakland stadium 
already has plans for new luxury boxes and more seating, which was not 
available when the Raiders left. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders rarely sell out the 93,000-seat Los Angeles Coliseum, and have to 
compete with the Los Angeles Rams, who play in nearby Anaheim, for attention. 
Vucasin says fan support in Oakland is coming from the East Bay areas, which 
don't include the same fans who traditionally support the Super Bowl champion 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to see them back in Oakland Alameda County Stadium," Vucasin said. 
"They left eight years ago, but I've only been with the board five years. I'd 
do anything I can as president of the Coliseum board, if I had any indication 
that's what Al Davis wanted, to make it work. I can say this: The community 
still supports the Raiders, and a package would be in place." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland also is seeking an expansion team -- the reason stadium improvements 
are already planned. 
</P>
<P>
As for the spring league, many in the NFL, especially Schramm and Rozelle, 
would like to get the wheels turning as soon as possible. Schramm says fielding 
teams in the spring of 1990 is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Half the teams would be based in the United States, half overseas. New YorkNew 
Jersey, Chicago and Los Angeles are virtually must American cities, as is 
London abroad. Milan, Frankfurt and a major city in Ireland likely are other 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate ownership, not allowed in the NFL, would be encouraged in the spring 
league. Some believe the newly set 80-man roster limit was more than a measure 
to keep the richer teams from bringing 140 players to camp. With only 80 
players per team under contract, there would be quite a large talent pool 
available for the international league. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm and Davis were among those who suggested overseas teams years ago. Most 
of the other owners now have caught up with their thinking, especially now that 
games will be televised live in Great Britan, on prime time Sunday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The last days of Rozelle's tenure hardly will be marked with inactivity. The 
owners have asked for his input on the selection of a new commissioner. And 
Rozelle will be very involved with the spring league. 
</P>
<P>
He and the owners will soon begin sifting through the recommendations. Jack 
Kemp's name continues to come up, but he has said he is happy with his position 
in President Bush's cabinet and is not ready to leave politics. Some people 
close to the league believe, however, that Kemp would have to seriously 
consider the position if offered. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, people are mentioning Tagliabue, who would certainly be 
well-equipped to handle the litigation problems that wore on Rozelle in the 
last decade.

WOMEN'S GOLF TOURNAMENT AT RANCHO PARK; 
</P>
<P>
BRADLEY IS A LOT HAPPIER ONE YEAR LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will be year ago Tuesday that Pat Bradley was diagnosed as having 
hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves' disease. 
</P>
<P>
She had been embarrassed and ashamed for failing to make the cut in the AI 
Star/Centinela Hospital golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a probable future Hall of Fame golfer, who suddenly was playing 
poorly, and she didn't know why she was deteriorating physically. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a heart-warming comeback story, Bradley's condition has now 
stabilized and she reaffirmed her status on the LPGA tour Sunday by winning the 
AI Star/Centinela Hospital tournament by one stroke over Nancy Lopez and Hollis 
Stacy, who shared second place. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley shot a final round 67 at Rancho Park for a 54-hole total of 208 and 
earned $67,500 for her victory. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that the money is nice but the victory, considering her 
previous turmoil, meant everything to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I think I shot an 82 and then an 87 when I missed the cut and I just 
snuck off the course and out of my hotel and I wanted to hide," Bradley said. 
"Here I am a year later on top of the world and very thankful that I've been 
given a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who has 23 career victories since starting on the tour in 1974, hadn't 
won since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of that year and 1988 were pure hell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Graves' disease affects your hormones and nervous system. Your hormones are 
out of whack," Bradley said. "My body would tremble and my hands were always in 
a tremor and my heart was racing 100 miles an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley consulted a doctor in Dallas after she left the tournament here last 
year and he diagnosed her condition and treatment began. 
</P>
<P>
By December she was ready to play again. 
</P>
<P>
After Bradley parred the 18th hole Sunday, an emotional scene soon developed. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, she had to sweat out Lopez, who was playing one hole behind her. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if anyone could birdie the last hole it would be Nancy," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez could only par the 18th after missing a 20-foot birdie putt that 
would have forced a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley's victory was assured, she tearfully embraced her mother, 
Kathleen. Her father, Dick, died in 1988 and that had added to the trauma she 
was already enduring with her physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said, though, that her father was with her. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw more golf today than when he was alive," she said. "I know that he was 
feeling for me. When I was ill, it was eating at him the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
There was always a ritual in the Bradley home in Westford, Mass., after she 
placed first. Someone in the family would ring a bell on the porch of their 
home in that small town to signify another Bradley victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although her mother was with her Sunday, the bell was rung again. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said she called her brothers, Chris, Mark and John, who continued the 
tradition Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very emotional day," Bradley said. "When Nancy missed that putt and I 
was finally able to relax and reflect on the last two years that have have been 
really hell for me. 
</P>
<P>
"One year you're on cloud nine and everything is going your way and the next 
year you're at the bottom of the totem pole and you can't even find yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not only tough, but it hurts. Before, the harder I tried the worse 
things got. I was very ashamed and very embarrassed at the numbers I was 
posting, especially after 1986 when I was on top of the LPGA (five victories 
that year including three of the four majors). 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was having a nervous breakdown and they were coming to take me 
away. It was at this tournament a year ago that I packed it in. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until I was diagnosed I thought I was losing my mind and falling apart. 
What a difference a year makes." 
</P>
<P>
Of all her victories, and she has won six majors in her career, the 38-year-old 
Bradley said that her lastest victory is "very, very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I had been written off," she said. "I had been protected quite a 
bit in my years on the tour. I never experienced missing many cuts, or shooting 
a lot of high numbers, or not qualifying for tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, through an illness, I was so far back in the pack that 
reality struck and I wasn't eligible for any of those things. I learned you're 
only as good for the minute. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that your 15 years of being in the top ten and the record of winning 
those majors meant nothing. If you're not within a certain framework on this 
tour, you're out. And that was very hard to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
There were tears in Bradley's eyes as she relived the past and she's very 
grateful now that she has been given a second chance.

MORNING BRIEFING: DISTRAUGHT COLUMNIST DEALS OUT SOME CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Capitals' early exit from the National Hockey League playoffs 
left the Washington Post's Tony Kornheiser more than a little distraught. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disease," he wrote when the end appeared inevitable. "It has to be a 
disease. It doesn't matter who they bring in here. You can be the greatest 
player in the world, you could be (Wayne) Gretzky, but as soon as you put on 
the Capitals' uniform, you lose in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
And later, addressing the players directly, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I've done my best. I've tried every trick in the book to motivate you. The 
first time I called you choking dogs, it worked; you won. But the next time, 
you lost -- choking like dogs, I might add. When I reversed that and called 
your opponents choking dogs, you still lost. Why do you always lose in the 
playoffs? Why can't you ever get out of your division? What is it, a visa deal? 
The last person who was as tied down was Gulliver." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: What was the feat achieved last year by Jose Oquendo? 
</P>
<P>
Please, no tipping: According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Dodgers lack 
something in the etiquette department. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when they were in town for the season opener against the 
Cincinnati Reds, they were invited to a free lunch at a Cincinnati restaurant. 
Seven players showed up and "knocked off better than $150 worth of food . . . 
then stalked off without tipping the servers," the Enquirer said. 
</P>
<P>
That left the restaurant owner to pick up both the tab and the tip. 
</P>
<P>
Seems odd sort of behavior for a team managed by a restaurateur. 
</P>
<P>
He was too nice: For a short while, John Wooden was a commentator for NBC, but 
left of his own accord. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have preferred me being more critical," he said. "I don't like 
commentators telling coaches what to do. Some weren't very good coaches to 
begin with. . . . I don't know how Dick Vitale ever lost a game." 
</P>
<P>
A blank check, of sorts: There was more at stake than met the eye when Nolan 
Ryan came close to throwing a no-hitter the Milwaukee Brewers last week. 
</P>
<P>
Had Ryan achieved his sixth no-hitter, Little League Baseball would have been 
$1.35 million richer, courtesy of Best Western and American Express. 
</P>
<P>
The companies have pledged $250,000 this year and $25,000 for each of the next 
40 years if Ryan pitches a no-hitter during the Little League's 50th 
anniversary year. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the 42-year-old Texas Ranger allowed one hit in eight shutout 
innings and struck out a team-record 15 batters. At $300 per strikeout from the 
two companies, that was worth another $4,500 to Little League. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Oquendo played every one of the nine baseball positions during 
the 1988 season for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Golfer Andy Bean, talking about slumps: "If you're swinging bad, not 
even a baseball bat will help you. Maybe an ax would have helped me all those 
times I was in the woods."

first half, but Costa Rican goalkeeper Luis Gabelo Conejo lunged high to his 
right to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado, who drew a yellow card for rough play, now has two yellow cards in 
World Cup qualifying. He received an automatic suspension from the April 30 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tough game," Rhoden said. "But we prepared ourselves mentally 
and things came out really well." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica leads the group with a 2-1 record and four points. Guatemala is 1-1 
with two points. El Salvador and Trinidad-Tobago have not played yet in the 
five country round-robin qualifying. The top two teams make the 24-nation 
finals in Italy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was rated the favorite after Mexico and Canada were 
eliminated. Guatemala beat Canada last fall and Mexico was expelled after using 
over-age players in qualifying for the world under-20 championship.

NEWSWIRE: OFFICIAL SAYS JOHNSON MAY BE ABLE TO RUN IN '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Johnson may be allowed to run for Canada at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, 
despite his disqualification for steroid use at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, 
Canadian Olympic Assn. president Roger Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a possibility of that, yes," Jackson told the Canadian Press 
in an interview late Saturday. Jackson was not immediately available for 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson spoke during the association's four-day annual meeting, which ended 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson lost his 100-meter Olympic gold medal and world record of 9.79 
seconds, Canadian Sports Minister Jean Charest said he would be "banned for 
life." 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson said he believes the ban means Johnson will get no more federal 
funding, "but we all know Ben Johnson doesn't need federal funding." 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletics Federation imposed a two-year ban on 
Johnson after the Seoul test, but that will end well before the Barcelona 
games.

SABATINI CHANGES HER STRATEGY AND STOPS GRAF'S STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gabriela Sabatini ended top-ranked Steffi Graf's 31-match winning streak with a 
3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory in the final of a $300,000 women's tournament Sunday at 
Amelia Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
It was Graf's first loss since Nov. 19, 1988, when she was beaten, 6-3, 7-6, by 
Pam Shriver in the Virginia Slims Championships at New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely not playing well," said Graf, who made 60 unforced errors, 29 
of them on her usually tough forehand. "My serve was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, ranked third, took control of the match in the second set when she 
built a 5-0 lead. After the first set, when she tried to match Graf's power 
from the baseline, she changed her strategy. Her high topspin groundstrokes 
kept Graf pinned deep on the clay court. 
</P>
<P>
"I started using my mind more," Sabatini said after picking up the $60,000 
winner's check. "She started making mistakes. My game was bothering her." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini broke Graf's serve in the first game of the third set and made it 
stand up until Graf broke back in the 10th game to tie the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed Graf would steal the match, but Sabatini broke Graf's serve to go up, 
6-5. She then held on to win as Graf netted a forehand volley on match point. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini also beat Graf in the semifinals of this tournament last year, 6-3, 
4-6, 7-5, before losing to Martina Navratilova in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden won his first pro tournament, wearing out 
Yugoslavia's Bruno Oresar with an overpowering forehand for a 6-2, 6-0 victory 
in the $200,000 River Oaks tournament at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who earned $40,000, hit 28 forehand winners, most of them to 
Oresar's backhand. Oresar got $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Luiz Mattar of Brazil won a $230,000 tournament at Rio de Janeiro by 
beating third-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour match, held on a specially constructed court on Copacabana 
Beach, was delayed several hours because of heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
Mattar earned $40,000, while Jaite, ranked 64th in the world, won $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Playing a powerful serve-and-volley game, Ronald Agenor of Haiti defeated 
top-seeded Kent Carlsson of Sweden, 6-3, 6-4, to win his first Nabisco Grand 
Prix title at the $125,000 Athens International tournament.

39 seconds. He set the record of 2:06:50 at Rotterdam last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old policeman from Addis Ababa said warmer weather than expected 
and no pressure from runner-up Alejandro Cruz of Mexico late in the race kept 
him from bettering the record.

Cruz finished second in 2:09:24, followed by Marti ten Kate of the Netherlands

Jocko Conlan, a Hall of Fame umpire best known for his battles with manager Leo 
Durocher, died at the age of 89 in Scottsdale, Ariz. Cause of death was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Born John Bertrand Conlan on Dec. 6, 1899, Conlan spent more than 40 years in 
baseball, playing in the major leagues for the Chicago White Sox. He was 
elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1974, the fourth umpire to be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous disputes involving Conlan occurred when Durocher began 
kicking dirt on Conlan's shoes during an argument. Conlan retaliated, kicking 
dirt on Durocher. Then Durocher kicked Conlan in the shins, so Conlan kicked 
him back.

Daryl Doran scored at 4:46 of the second overtime Sunday to give the Los 
Angeles Lazers a 5-4 victory over the Wichita Wings in the Major Indoor Soccer 
League regular-season finale before an announced crowd of nearly 3,000 at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita's Mike Fox scored with nine seconds left in the fourth quarter to tie 
the game, 4-4, and force sudden-death overtime. Neither team scored during the 
first 15-minute overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers finished the season with a 21-27 record and missed the playoffs, 
while Wichita finished 23-25 and moves on to post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Doran had two goals for the Lazers. Poli Garcia, Ben Collins and Hector 
Marinaro also scored for Los Angeles. Fox had two goals for the Wings. Also 
scoring for Wichita were Erik Rasmussen and Chico Borja. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings outshot the Lazers, 38-36. Lazer goaltender Kris Peat had 19 saves 
while two Wichita goalies, Chris Vaccaro and Nenad Zigante, had a total of 14 
saves.

FRENCH-BASED COLT TAGEL WILL MISS THE DERBY; 
</P>
<P>
IS IT TRUE ALSO EXPECTED TO SKIP RACE AFTER A POOR PERFORMANCE AT SANTA ANITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 115th Kentucky Derby, which seems to be losing more horses than it gains, 
shrank again Sunday when Tagel, a French-based colt with globe-hopping 
possibilities, was scratched from a stake because of a cough that has been 
bothering a number of horses at Longchamps. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel, who hasn't run since he finished third, behind Is It True and Easy Goer, 
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November at Churchill Downs, needed a strong 
race Sunday in order to be considered a Derby candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Is It True also was probably eliminated from the Derby after running last in a 
sprint at Santa Anita on Friday. Is It True was making his first start since he 
underwent knee surgery shortly after the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, the heavy favorite for the Derby and the reason some owners with 
marginal 3-year-olds will duck the race, worked five furlongs Saturday at 
Belmont Park in an easy 1:00 4/5, in preparation for his appearance in the Wood 
Memorial on Saturday at Aqueduct. Trainer Shug McGaughey said that he worked 
Easy Goer a day earlier than scheduled because rain in New York figured to make 
Belmont's track muddy on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Faultless Ensign, the winner of Saturday's Garden State Stakes at Garden State 
Park, is not expected to challenge Easy Goer in the Derby, which will be run 
May 6. 
</P>
<P>
The list of viable candidates for the Derby has been reduced to this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sunday Silence, the winner of the Santa Anita Derby, and Hawkster, who ran 
fourth in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Western Playboy, the troubled winner of Saturday's Blue Grass at Keeneland 
and possibly Dispersal, who finished second after twice bumping the winner in 
the stretch and almost knocking him sideways. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston, the favorite who finished fifth in the Santa Anita Derby. After a 
workout today at Santa Anita, trainer Wayne Lukas is expected to announce that 
Houston will run in the Derby Trial, a week before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The winner of the Arkansas Derby this Saturday at Oaklawn Park, where 
Manastash Ridge will be favored. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Possibly the winner of the California Derby, which is also scheduled 
Saturday at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Open Mind, who is already stabled at Churchill Downs and will run in either 
the Derby or the May 5 Kentucky Oaks for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Majesty's Imp, the second-place finisher to Dispersal in the Louisiana 
Derby, who will need a strong performance in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland 
next week in order to earn a trip to Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
The average number of starters in the Derby this decade has been 17. It is 
beginning to look as if this year's field will be the smallest since 
Spectacular Bid won in a 10-horse lineup in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his colt's victory over five other horses in the Blue Grass, trainer 
Harvey Vanier knows that Easy Goer will be an extraordinary opponent for 
Western Playboy in the Derby. The two horses both have a running style that 
brings them from well off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning at Keeneland, Vanier sounded like a man whose horse is 
running for second place in the Derby. "If my horse had just a little more zip, 
we might be able to beat that other colt," Vanier said. 
</P>
<P>
One good thing for Vanier is that this year's Blue Grass, for the first time 
since World War II, was run three weeks instead of nine days before the Derby 
and Western Playboy will have the extra time to recover. When Vanier won the 
Blue Grass on an off-track -- much like Saturday's -- with Play Fellow in 1983, 
the colt came out of the roughly run race and was dull in the Derby the next 
week, finishing sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Voicing a minority opinion, trainer Bud Delp said that Dispersal probably would 
have won the Blue Grass if he had been able to run a straight path in the 
stretch. Dispersal had a narrow lead when he came from off the fence at the top 
of the stretch and slammed into Western Playboy, who was closing in the middle 
of the track. A more widespread opinion was that Western Playboy was about to 
roll past Dispersal when the first of the two incidents occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Dispersal will remain here until Thursday, when he will either be shipped to 
Churchill Downs, 75 miles to the west, or be sent to Maryland. If he stays in 
Kentucky, Dispersal will run in the Derby Trial and Delp will then consider the 
Derby. If the other option is used, the objective will be either the Preakness, 
the second leg of the Triple Crown, at Pimlico on May 20 or the Jersy Derby at 
Garden State Park on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
If Delp runs in the Kentucky Derby, it would be like old times for the trainer 
of Spectacular Bid, trying to beat a relatively small field at Churchill Downs. 
This time, though, Delp would be running one of the Davids instead of the 
Goliath.

WIZARD'S WAND HELPS CARDINALS BEAT METS, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since he learned how to handle the bat four or five years ago, Ozzie Smith 
has thought of himself as the St. Louis Cardinals' inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
He may have something there. When the brilliant fielding shortstop was on the 
disabled list to open the season, the Cardinals were off to a poor start. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is back and he's hot. Suddenly, so are the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, an offensive liability his first half dozen seasons in the majors, had 
three singles and drove in two runs Sunday at St. Louis to lead the Cardinals 
to a 5-3 victory over the slumbering New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' second win in a row since Smith opened his season, dropped the 
Mets, odds-on favorites to win the National League East, five games out of 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry, who hit his first home run of the season Saturday, provided 
the Mets' offense against Jose DeLeon with two more home runs. The other Mets 
had only two hits as DeLeon improved his record to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
From the start with San Diego in 1978, Smith was such an outstanding shortstop 
nobody cared whether he hit. After the trade in 1982, the Cardinals worked with 
Smith on offense. Now, although not a home run threat, Smith is a good hitter. 
In 1987, he batted .300 and drove in 75 runs. 
</P>
<P>
He is as good on the hit-and-run as anyone. In the 10th inning Saturday, his 
single put the winning run on third for Pedro Guerrero to drive home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my attitude has contributed as much as my five hits to the two 
victories," Smith said. "I'm still not 100% recovered from the rib cage injury, 
but I'm playing through it. Your teammates appreciate it when they know you're 
playing under those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think riding the stationary bicycle has been a factor in my recovery. Now, 
it just stiffens a bit when I work up a sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Mets' Manager Davey Johnson met with his players to discuss the problems of his 
team which is 3-7 and has scored only 34 runs in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Was Davey angry? He wasn't happy," first baseman Keith Hernandez said. "We're 
going home for 10 days. We've got to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Mets have scored 15 runs in two wins over Cardinal left-hander 
Joe Magrane, 1988 NL leader in earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- The way injuries keep popping up, the Pirates will 
soon be fielding a minor league lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mike LaValliere joined the injury list when he sprained his left knee 
in a crash at the plate with Montreal's Rex Hudler in the eighth inning of the 
Expos' 11-inning victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Hudler scored the tying run, coming in from second base on Nelson Santovenia's 
single with two out. In the 11th, Santovenia doubled off the top of the wall in 
left, went to third on an infield out and scored on pinch-hitter Hubie Brooks' 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
LaValliere was put on the disabled list. Also out with injuries are relief ace 
Jeff Gott, center fielder Andy Van Slyke and first baseman Sid Bream. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Philadelphia 3 -- Rick Sutcliffe didn't have his best stuff in this 
game at Philadelphia, but helped himself by driving in two runs with a 
bases-loaded single. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe extended his winning streak to three games and the Cubs' to seven. 
The Cubs increased their lead in the East to two games over the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe (3-0) allowed six hits, struck out four and walked five in 8 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I got by today," Sutcliffe said. "There was a lot of luck 
involved. Nothing I did was pretty. It's hard to believe we won." 
</P>
<P>
After Sutcliffe walked two batters in the ninth, Mitch Williams was summoned 
from the bullpen. Although he gave up run-scoring singles to Tommy Herr and 
Chris James, he managed to earn his sixth save in six tries when he got Mike 
Schmidt to fly to right with the tying runs on base. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, San Diego 0 -- Normally outstanding the first two months of the 
season, Rick Mahler lost his first two starts for the Reds due to lack of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
But after Herm Winningham and Jeff Reed hit consecutive home runs in a five-run 
first inning at San Diego, Mahler breezed. He gave up sixe hits and pitched his 
first shutout in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 7-1, San Francisco 2-6 -- The Braves, like the rest of the NL this 
season, couldn't contain Kevin Mitchell, but they did outscore him in the 
opener at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell hit a two-run homer in the first inning of the first game, but Gerald 
Perry hit a three-run homer and the Braves romped. John Smoltz (2-1) ended the 
Giants' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell drove in three runs with a pair of doubles in the second game to help 
left-hander Joe Price get the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who hit 19 home runs last season, leads the majors with five home 
runs and 19 runs batted in in 12 games. DAN HAFNER

MIKE DOWNEY: ROSE TAKING HEAT, SHOWING NO SIGNS OF WILTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose, public enemy No. 14, is in town today, up to his shaggy bangs in 
investigation and innuendo. How happy he would be if the toughest question he 
had to answer all week had to do with sending up a pinch-hitter, or pulling a 
pitcher, instead of those third-degree interrogations that begin: "Where were 
you on the night of . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
Ask me baseball questions, Pete Rose pleads, a condemned man's last request. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, after weeks and weeks of wild rumor and nasty humor, Pete 
Rose remains persecuted, not prosecuted. This may change, and soon. A decision 
is due any month now. So far, however, Pete Rose has been accused of everything 
but the Lindbergh-baby kidnapping and the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaner scam. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something," his old friend and foe, Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda, said Sunday. "If this guy is innocent, can you imagine the injustice 
that's been done to him?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I can. If Pete Rose is innocent, I think he should take the bat he used to 
break Ty Cobb's record -- if he still has it -- and come out swinging at every 
single person who has soiled his good name. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the man manages to keep managing, manages to keep his Cincinnati Reds 
near the top of the National League standings, while dealing with all the 
Rose-bashing and Red-baiting that has followed him from town to town. Charlie 
Hustler, they call him now. Or gag songs they write, like "Gamblin' Rose," a 
parody of an oldie by Nat King Cole. Ours can be a cold, cruel world, can't it? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pete Rose's various transgressions could turn out to be 
extremely serious, in which case, he could end up being inducted in the Hall of 
Infamy. He could end up the very way he stood his ground in the batter's box -- 
with the short end of the stick. 
</P>
<P>
All we can say is, we hope not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simple game," Pete Rose is fond of saying. "The ball is round, and you 
try to hit it square." 
</P>
<P>
That's all the guy wants, a square deal. If these investigators really have 
something on him, he must pay the price. If they don't, then somebody owes this 
guy an apology-and-a-half. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Charlie Hustle has endured. He has handled himself about as 
well as anybody could be expected to handle the notion of people prying into 
his personal life, quoting his children, quoting his former spouse, quoting his 
friends, quoting his casual acquaintances, quoting unknown and unnamed 
assailants, dissecting his personal life as though he should be this week's 
special guest star on "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe things will turn out poorly for Pete Rose. Maybe he will be thrown out at 
home, caught stealing, trapped in a rundown, sent to the showers. As we say, we 
sure do hope not. Pete Rose has been good for baseball, as well as vice versa. 
He is one of those guys we hoped would stick around as long as Casey Stengel 
and Yogi Berra, grow old wearing short pants, be there to manage the Reds on 
the first Monday in April of the year 2000, be there to toss out the ceremonial 
first ball at the World Series of 2025. 
</P>
<P>
At this season's opener, before his friends and apostles of Riverfront Stadium, 
the Reds had a date with the world champion Dodgers, and Lasorda had hoped to 
pull him aside, speak to him confidentially. Trouble was, whenever Pete Rose 
poked his head from the dugout, wherever he stepped on the diamond, he bumped 
into somebody who wanted to know if he placed bets on this, or sold this to 
that, or gave secret hand signals to so-and-so. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally managed to whisper in his ear," Lasorda recalled. "There were all 
these people around, it was hard to get near him. All I told Pete was, we're 
all pulling for him to come out of this thing fine. We're all hoping he'll come 
out with his reputation not tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things they say and write about Pete, they'd better be sure of their 
facts. I'll tell you one thing: He has to be a very, very strong person to keep 
doing his job the way he's been doing, because I certainly understand how 
demanding it is taking care of your players, your coaches, your trainers, your 
fans, your press, you name it. I know Pete's got a lot on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If the guy messed up, he's gotta pay for it. Everybody knows that. But they'd 
better be damn sure he messed up before they accuse him of it." 
</P>
<P>
And to think it was only last summer when the biggest worry Pete Rose had, or 
certainly appeared to have, was overtaking the Dodgers for first place. The 
blues got the last laugh on the Reds, hanging tough all the way through 
October, after the Cincinnati manager had prophesied that Los Angeles would 
topple somewhere along the way. 
</P>
<P>
All Pete Rose wanted to think about during the off-season was ways to jump from 
second place to first. The biggest problem he seemed to have was staying in 
owner Marge Schott's good graces, and making sure he never ran over her dog 
with his Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Pete Rose returns to Chavez Ravine, he is fighting for more than first 
place. He is fighting for his baseball life. And, I will tell you something 
about Pete Rose. He will not go out without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
You can bet on it.

'NEW MONEY' SQUEEZES OUT MUSEUM BUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not too many years ago, people in the know began to say that museum directors 
needed training in business as well as art history to cope with an art world 
that was increasingly concerned with money. But almost as soon as that notion 
became conventional wisdom, the price of doing art business escalated so 
abruptly that the wisdom seemed futile. 
</P>
<P>
"An MBA won't do it anymore. A lottery ticket is what you need," Tom 
Freudenheim, assistant secretary for museums at the Smithsonian Institution, 
told participants at the 1989 Artnews World Art Market Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday on a panel called "The Future of Museums," at the Grand Hyatt 
Hotel in Manhattan, Freudenheim and other museum administrators warned that 
spiraling costs may cripple operations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Even a winning lottery ticket probably wouldn't provide sufficient funds for 
museums to continue presenting international loan exhibitions of Vincent van 
Gogh and other artists whose work has brought record prices at auction. 
Insurance alone, which can account for half the cost of an exhibition, is 
prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
And no museum is likely to get lucky enough to buy the loaned artworks that are 
leaving their walls and going off to auction. 
</P>
<P>
The latest is "Portrait of Duke Cosimo I de'Medici" by Jacopo da Carucci, a 
Florentine Mannerist known as Pontormo. After hanging for 19 years at the Frick 
Collection in Manhattan, the painting will go on the block May 31 at 
Christie's. Valued at more than $20 million, the Renaissance portrait is "the 
finest Old Master painting in private hands in the country," according to 
Richard L. Feigen, a leading Old Master dealer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Like Van Gogh's "Irises" at Westbrook College in Portland, Me., and the Hal B. 
Wallis collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Pontormo is an 
asset of a charitable organization (in this case, the Homeland Foundation) and 
has become too valuable to give away. A spokesman for the Frick has said that 
the owner of the Pontormo, the late Chauncey Devereaux Stillman, had indicated 
in writing that he intended to give the painting to the museum. But before his 
death, on Jan. 24, Stillman notified the Frick that circumstances had forced 
him to change his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Very few museums have annual acquisitions budgets that exceed $1 million, noted 
moderator Myrna Smoot, director of the American Federation of Arts. Frustrated 
over their inability to compete in the market place, some museums are selling 
works from their own collections to buy others that seem more desirable. While 
the panelists didn't object to judicious pruning, they lamented pressures to 
sell and warned against hasty decisions based on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Art museums have been "a growth industry" in the '80s, Smoot said. About 100 
American museums have been built or significantly expanded during the past 10 
years and an equal number of plans are in the works for the next decade, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smoot listed a familiar litany of financial problems that will continue to 
face museums in the future: competition for grant dollars as corporations shift 
charitable donations from culture to social welfare, decreasing government 
support, income-tax laws that discourage donations, and legislation (now under 
consideration in Congress) that could remove the tax-free status of museum gift 
shops and other sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
Museums have been successful as businesses, said Jim Snyder, director of 
planning and programs at the Museum of Modern Art. "In a sense, we are victims 
of that success." 
</P>
<P>
Programming pays the price of success when exhibitions reflect what can be sold 
to corporate supporters and ticket buyers, Freudenheim added. "It ends up being 
a beauty contest. The homely but intellectually exciting creature that doesn't 
look good in a bathing suit" can't compete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the two-day conference dealt with art's problematic "success" as a 
commodity. In a session on "Investing in Art -- Strategies for the '90s," 
panelists talked about the scope of the art boom. "There's a worldwide surge of 
money coming into the marketplace," said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's 
auction house. "It's not just the Japanese," he said, citing Switzerland, 
Germany, Italy and the Middle East as other pockets of free-flowing wealth. 
</P>
<P>
'We haven't yet heard from the Koreans and the Taiwanese, but look out because 
here they come with wagonloads of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the "Investing in Art" panelists -- all of whom make their livings by 
selling art -- agreed that art as investment is a loathsome notion. "Let's 
remember we're not buying pork bellies. The idea is to love what you buy," said 
Harry A. Brooks, president of Wildenstein &amp; Co. galleries. 
</P>
<P>
But Feigen cut short such protests when he declared, "We are at a watershed 
point in the art market. There has been a sea change and we have to learn how 
to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chase Manhattan Corp. plans to launch a $300-million art-investment 
fund and that Citibank already makes loans based on the value of its clients' 
art collections, Feigen said, "Art has been monetized." 
</P>
<P>
As long as art was regarded as a luxury, even by the rich, there were limits to 
how much would be spent on it, he said. But that has changed. "Art is now 
considered a safe place to put money." 
</P>
<P>
Whose money? Since the time of the Medicis, it has always been "new money" that 
fuels the art market, dealer Andre Emmerich said. 
</P>
<P>
And if this new money -- coupled with escalating prices and changes in tax laws 
-- has made it extremely difficult for museums to collect art, the situation is 
not all bad, according to Emmerich. 
</P>
<P>
"The great moral contribution we (dealers) can make is to imbue art with value. 
If museums have to struggle to get a work of art, they will take better care of 
it. Our society takes care of only the things it values," he said. "When art 
has financial value, it will be preserved; when it does not, it will rot and 
molder."

THE HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE; 
</P>
<P>
BLACK FILM MAKERS DECRY LACK OF INDUSTRY CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years after creating the cult comedy "Hollywood Shuffle" and directing 
"Raw: Eddie Murphy Live," is Robert Townsend getting offered lots of parts? 
"Oh, sure," the black actor-director said with a wry chuckle. "All the ones 
that Eddie (Murphy) or Richard (Pryor) have passed on." 
</P>
<P>
Lauded by critics as a hot comic commodity, Townsend has the ultimate Hollywood 
calling card -- a three-picture development deal with Warner Bros. Films. But 
so far he is not being offered the kinds of parts that would go to white comic 
actors like Martin Short or Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Is it because he is black? Do the economics of the Hollywood studio system 
stack the deck against young black talent? According to black film makers, 
Townsend's career opportunities are severely limited by an apparent Hollywood 
attitude that white audiences will not go see films populated with black stars. 
</P>
<P>
Black entertainers have achieved widespread acclaim in pop music, sports and 
television. But in Hollywood, black star power is a rare commodity. With major 
studio production geared toward mega-hits, it has become increasingly difficult 
to bankroll modest-budgeted films that explore ethnic issues or feature black 
directors, writers or black casts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame -- it's a totally messed-up situation," said Townsend, currently 
co-starring with Denzel Washington in "The Mighty Quinn," an MGM/UA film. "The 
studio people are scared. Nothing about black subject matter gets done until a 
film maker with clout -- like Norman Jewison or Steven Spielberg -- comes along 
and insists on telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
"America should be the melting pot of all kinds of film and all kinds of 
stories. But instead, you almost never see films where black characters are the 
heroes. You don't see blacks with sex lives or even girlfriends." 
</P>
<P>
According to conventional studio wisdom, Eddie Murphy is the only black actor 
with enough box-office wallop to draw a significant crossover audience. "That's 
so out of touch with reality," said Keenen Ivory Wayans, who directed and 
starred in "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka," a popular low-low-budget blaxploitation 
spoof. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jackson and Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are all huge stars. It can't 
be that only black people support them. White America goes to the movies. And 
if you entertain them, they'll go to your movies, regardless of the color of 
the entertainer." 
</P>
<P>
Even Murphy, whose films have grossed more than $1 billion in barely six years, 
isn't immune to studio fears about attracting white audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"My last movie was virtually all-black and the studio was definitely a little 
nervous," said Murphy, who has a lucrative long-term contract at Paramount 
Pictures. "They were wondering if white people -- or how many white people -- 
would go see it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the movie made $200 million worldwide, so I think you can say there are 
plenty of white people out there who'll go see a movie with black people -- 
lots of black people -- in it." 
</P>
<P>
You can always find black people in Spike Lee's movies. Lots of them. In fact, 
the young black director's third feature, a barbed tale about New York race 
relations called "Do the Right Thing," is his first with a major white 
character, played by actor Danny Aiello. (The film is due this summer from 
Universal.) 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be made at Paramount," he said. "But they got scared of how 
people might react to it. They were afraid it was going to incite people to 
riot or something. When they got cold feet, I took it to Universal, who's been 
very enthusiastic about it. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I was out in L.A., in between meetings with Paramount when I realized 
they were starting to get scared. So I had (ex-Universal production exec) Sean 
Daniels come over to my hotel and gave him a copy of the script while I was 
waiting for the next meeting. When Paramount told me they were passing, I had 
him OK the script within an hour!" 
</P>
<P>
According to Paramount motion picture group chairman Sidney Ganis, the studio 
had no problems with the film's content. "There was nothing extraordinary or 
inflammatory about the material at all," he said. "We were interested in the 
film -- and in Spike. And we continue to have a strong interest in working with 
him. We've spoken several times since we passed (on "Do the Right Thing"). We 
just decided it was a film we didn't want to make." 
</P>
<P>
Lee isn't shy about attacking what he sees as moviedom's racial politics. He 
contends that Columbia Pictures, which distributed his second feature, "School 
Daze," did little to promote the movie outside the black community. Before it 
opened, he complained that Columbia chief Dawn Steel had "ghettoized" the film. 
(Today he says: "It was left out there to die. It made $16 million with no help 
at all. It was pitiful how they dogged us.") Columbia refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's current "great" relationship with Universal hasn't stopped him from 
speaking out about what he calls Hollywood's "total disregard" for black 
history. "Film has an enormous power to interpret history," he said. "Listen, 
lots of people -- even black people -- think Cleopatra was a white woman just 
'cause Elizabeth Taylor played her in the movie." 
</P>
<P>
He is especially outraged by "Mississippi Burning's" controversial 
fictionalization of the 1964 murder of three civil-rights workers. "Now you got 
people walking around thinking the civil rights movement was saved by the FBI! 
Real art has to be about the truth. You can't make stuff up and twist facts 
around just because you want to sell the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Lee takes his complaints to the top. Spotting an anti-"Mississippi Burning" 
letter in the New York Times, Lee faxed copies to Orion production chief Mike 
Medavoy and MCA motion picture chairman Tom Pollock. He followed with phone 
calls. "I simply asked Medavoy how Orion could make a film about the civil 
rights movement without any prominent black characters. He told me it was a 
really uplifting film and that they were getting criticized from both sides, so 
they must be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Lee disagreed. "The people -- black and white -- who died in the civil rights 
struggle have got to be spinning in their graves after that movie." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's white Establishment isn't Lee's only target. "I love Eddie Murphy 
and I'm 100% behind him, but if I ever get one iota of the power he has, I'm 
gonna raise holy (expletive) hell," Lee said. "Eddie has made a billion dollars 
for Paramount. Yet I don't see any black executives with any real power at that 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were Eddie, I'd go into Sid Ganis' office and say, 'If you want me to 
keep making movies here, I want to see some qualified black production execs 
and marketing execs. And I can guarantee you the next day there'll be plenty of 
black execs on that lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I have minuscule juice compared to Eddie. I can't go into Tom Pollock's office 
and ask for anything -- he'd think I was crazy. But Eddie has economic clout. 
Look at Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford and Warren Beatty. They all use it. 
It's a privilege that comes with power. And once we get in that position, we 
shouldn't be uncomfortable or ashamed about using the same Hollywood machinery 
everyone else uses to get our people access to jobs, too." 
</P>
<P>
Still, hasn't Murphy provided lots of black talent with jobs through his 
production companies Lee countered: "Come on. Everyone he's got working there 
is related to him! 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie needs to flex his muscles in ways that can help black people get into 
this industry. Clout isn't just getting the best table at Spago. How's that 
helping your people?" 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was dismayed by Lee's harsh criticism. "It's real easy to be on the 
outside looking in, telling people what you should be doing," he said. "But I 
don't need anyone telling me how much social consciousness I should have, 
especially if you don't know my overall plan. I've done a lot for my people. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress is a gradual thing in this town. We've made light years of progress 
in the past five years. And Spike, Keenen and Robert Townsend are great 
examples. Ten years ago those guys couldn't have gotten pictures made in this 
town. But since I've had success at the box office, every studio has been 
looking around for a black guy of their own who could make hit movies." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy laughed. "I've opened the door for Spike and now he's throwing rocks at 
me!" 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is now directing "Harlem Nights," a film he wrote which stars himself, 
Richard Pryor and Arsenio Hall. He said Eddie Murphy Television has two black 
producers, while his film arm, Eddie Murphy Productions, has two black 
development executives. 
</P>
<P>
"And none of them are related to me," he added. "I do have two family members 
who are associate producers with my companies. But that's not unusual. And on 
my films, my editors, my cameramen, my make-up people -- and lots of behind the 
scenes people -- are black. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the answer is me rushing into Paramount and raising hell. You 
can't go into someone's house and start yelling (obscenity) just because you're 
Eddie Murphy. It's their house. Clout comes and goes around here. I'm just the 
brother of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made lots of contributions to help my people prosper. But I'm not a 
politician. I'm a businessman and a film maker. And what I try to do is make 
movies that appeal to everybody. The loudest statement you can make is to be a 
black man and make movies for everybody. I think that's the biggest political 
statement of all." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's Sidney Ganis said his studio enjoys strong associations with 
blacks, noting that both Murphy and Arsenio Hall have exclusive film deals at 
Paramount. "It also so happens that for years we've had a black publicity 
executive -- Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who's now a vice president of publicity 
here," Ganis said. "And in our production area, we have Kevin Jones, a young 
black executive who's been responsible -- along with others -- for developing 
our upcoming films, 'Fat Man and Little Boy' and 'Star Trek V,' and who's 
worked with Eddie Murphy and his development people on his new film, 'Harlem 
Nights.' 
</P>
<P>
"Our hiring them, among others here, had nothing to do with black or white 
issues -- or anything Eddie might ever say. We hired them because they're good 
movie executives." 
</P>
<P>
Still, other film makers see an industry full of white faces. "I look out there 
and I only see a handful of black executives or agents," said Robert Townsend. 
"It goes all down the line. There are still plenty of places in America where 
theater owners just don't want black films. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you make a great film, the issue isn't color. The issue becomes 
magic. If the industry feels you can make money for them, then the color issue 
turns green. I never say, 'Man, if I was white. . . . ' If I do quality work, 
I'll get my share." 
</P>
<P>
No one has lambasted the Hollywood shuffle more than Lee, whose outspoken views 
often rattle film executives. "I know Hollywood isn't in love with me," he 
said. "But they believe they can make money with me. And the minute they don't, 
I bet they'll get rid of me." 
</P>
<P>
Lee insists that most Hollywood executives have little contact with black 
realities. "They pride themselves on being so liberal and open-minded, but they 
never come into contact with real black people. Just because you see Eddie 
Murphy or Quincy Jones or some other Hollywood Negro at a party, doesn't mean 
you know black people. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hollywood, business gets done by connections. I get resumes every day from 
young black people who want to get into the business. Eighty-five per cent of 
the crew on my last movie was black. I got 11 people into the union. They don't 
want me to take the mike and blast it out that they don't have any black people 
in the union, so we got waivers to hire them -- and by virtue of them working 
on the film, we found ways of getting them into the union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much, but it's a start. They probably had two black people in the 
union before. Now they got 11 more!" 
</P>
<P>
Lee cautioned: "There are only two things people react to in our society today 
-- violence and economic pressure. I'm not ready to pick up a gun yet, so I 
practice economic pressure. Because money is one thing Hollywood really 
understands."

HERE COMES 'THE JUDGE,' OR RATHER 'EL JUEZ' FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK A. FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge David E. Marin, who likes to say he chose law as a profession "to serve 
my fellow citizens," is about to earn his pay. He's returning to the bench 
following a recess in a bitter child-custody suit. The parents and the young 
son they are feuding over wait expectedly for his verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, the people most hurt in divorce cases are the children," Marin lectures 
in Spanish, his tone fatherly but stern. "They can feel insecure and confused. 
Tomas loves both of you and that's marvelous! You shouldn't make him feel like 
he's an object being fought over. He has to know who he can depend on. So, for 
the good of Tomas, you two must make an effort to behave." 
</P>
<P>
With a reproving wag of his finger and a rap of his gavel, Marin notifies 
Tomas' mother he won't permit her to deny the father visitation rights. Now 
faced with the reality of having to tolerate one another, both parents 
apologize to each other and, joined by Tomas, they all embrace under the glare 
of television cameras and Marin's approving smile. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 p.m. today, Spanish-speaking viewers in Los Angeles will get their 
first chance to see the fictional Marin and his family court on KMEX Channel 
34, as Univision network and Genesis International TV Sales Inc. debut "El 
Juez," a Spanish-language copy of the daytime courtroom series "The Judge," 
aired by KHJ-TV Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
The low-budget but fast-paced "El Juez" not only uses the same sets, cameras 
and production staff as its English-language counterpart, it also uses the 
exact same scripts, translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Univision and Genesis are heralding "El Juez" as the first 
Spanish-language drama produced in this country and based entirely on a U.S. 
show. While they obviously are hoping the show has the same kind of voyeuristic 
appeal for Latinos that "People's Court," "Divorce Court" and "Superior Court" 
have for the English-speaking crowd, the significance of the weekly half-hour 
program goes deeper for actor Rene Enriquez, the former "Hill Street Blues" 
star who plays Judge Marin. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the history of this country, a breakthrough, a milestone 
-- a Spanish-language dramatic series filmed here so Hispanics can come and 
work," Enriquez gushed in his accented English. "It's extraordinary. We're 
going to develop lots of good actors and these will put us (Latinos) in 
position in the American film market." 
</P>
<P>
Univision, the Spanish-language network that purchased the rights to "El Juez" 
before production even started, said that about 200 Spanish-speaking actors 
were used to make the first 26 episodes of "El Juez." 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan-born Enriquez cites this statistic and what he sees as the 
program's educational value for Latinos (forthcoming episodes will cover 
abortion, AIDS and immigration law) as the prime motivation behind his 
accepting the role. 
</P>
<P>
"By giving this program the aura that 'Hill Street Blues' gave me, I'm giving 
it credit. I do it with passion because it will give work to Hispanics," 
declared Enriquez, who played Lt. Ray Calletano in the Emmy Award-winning 
police series. "I'm taking an enormous cut in pay to do this. Well, why not? 
Put your money where your mouth is -- that's the expression, isn't it? I hope 
other Hispanics in the community will come and help me with this." 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc coalition of Latino actors, writers and directors doesn't share 
Enriquez's unqualified enthusiasm for "El Juez," however. Several of its 
representatives have criticized the Screen Actors Guild for letting the show's 
producer hire Latino union members for $148 below the union's minimum daily 
wage without consulting the guild's membership, and are demanding a meeting 
with SAG officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a major problem with SAG, which is that they just don't treat us with 
respect, and that includes the (SAG) staff and board of directors," said Rachel 
Levario, an active member of Nosotros, one of the groups that is organizing the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to Levario and sources closely involved in the making of "El Juez," 
actors who worked on "El Juez" (with the exception of Enriquez) were paid $250 
a day, while their English-speaking counterparts on "The Judge" and other 
SAG-sanctioned shows typically earn at least $398 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Cahn, who produces both "El Juez" and "The Judge," said that he requested 
a wage waiver from SAG only as a "temporary relief" because the price Univision 
offered to pay Genesis for the show precluded him for paying actors the full 
rate. He promised that by late July or early August, at the end of 52 weeks 
worth of filming (Genesis retains an option to film an additional 26 weeks of 
shows in addition to the 26 weeks worth already finished), he would either 
renegotiate actors' salaries or cancel the show outright, depending on the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, SAG insisted that it had the unspoken support of its 2,212 Latino 
members, 80% of whom are typically unemployed on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
The guild's Hollywood affirmative action administrator, Rodney Mitchell, said: 
"We were rather excited about it (the waiver agreement with Genesis) because it 
met the concerns of Hispanics who had been urging us to do something for them 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
According to figures released in the fall edition of "Screen Actor," the SAG 
magazine, Latinos accounted for only 3.4% of all performers working in TV and 
film in 1987, despite making up more than 8% of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
Citing SAG's constitution, Mitchell pointed out that the guild did not need 
membership approval to enter into any waiver agreements. Mark Locher, a SAG 
spokesman, said the guild approved the waiver request to keep the producer from 
hiring non-union actors or taking the show to Mexico or Puerto Rico, where 
labor is much cheaper.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'MOLLY DODD' TRIM, FUNNY FOR CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
All right, Molly Dodd fans. She's bahhhhhh-ack. 
</P>
<P>
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" -- a wonderfully wry and ironic series that 
was dropped by NBC in 1988 because of low ratings -- resumes first-run life 
tonight on cable's Lifetime. That means: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A smaller budget. 
</P>
<P>
But it's "not too much" smaller and it's a "doable budget," said "Molly Dodd" 
creator-producer-director-sometimes-writer Jay Tarses from New York, where the 
series is filmed. "We don't have the fat anymore, so we can't make too many 
mistakes, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A smaller audience. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lifetime claims to reach 41 million households, the number of viewers 
watching "Molly Dodd" on Lifetime surely will be puny compared to even its 
tiniest audience on NBC, an audience deemed too small for survival. "We know 
that we're not going to have the mass audience," Tarses said. "But we're going 
to have people who will want to watch the show." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing beats feeling wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is that Lifetime is tickled to have us and we don't have to 
feel like a stepsister," said Tarses, who feels that "Molly Dodd" was 
mishandled by NBC and still sounds bitter about NBC Entertainment President 
Brandon Tartikoff's earlier public bashing of the show. 
</P>
<P>
The first of 13 new "Molly Dodd" half-hours produced for Lifetime airs at 8:30 
p.m., following a previously unaired episode of the original series at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Monday is a one-shot time slot. Starting April 29, the new "Molly Dodd" will 
air twice on Saturdays, at 2 and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Enough with the announcements. The only one that matters is that, based on 
sampling the unaired NBC episode and the first two made for Lifetime, "Molly 
Dodd" is still magic. 
</P>
<P>
It's the feeling you haven't felt, the sound you haven't heard, the rare series 
that's almost impossible to define. When you try, you feel like Molly's shy, 
tongue-knotted boyfriend, Moss Goodman. It's . . . uh . . . just . . . I mean . 
. . well. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, if you watch it and like it, you'll know. Comedy, dramedy, shmamedy 
or whatever. Magic! 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly played by red-haired Blair Brown, Molly is a restless, 
sometimes-jobless, often-aimless, always appealing 38-year-old divorcee living 
in New York and trying to gain control of her life. Whether she will is a 
tossup. 
</P>
<P>
The funny unaired NBC episode finds Moss (David Stathairn) abandoning Molly for 
Switzerland (he'll return later this season), leaving her at yet another 
crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
The still-funnier first Lifetime episode finds Molly again looking for 
employment, after quitting her job at Moss' bookstore, and welcoming her 
ex-husband Fred (William Converse-Roberts) back into her life as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the second Lifetime episode is actually laughing-out-loud funny, a 
rarity for a series in which amusement always seemed to merge with melancholia. 
</P>
<P>
That's the irony: "Molly Dodd' certainly doesn't look less expensive than it 
did on NBC. And the smaller budget and smaller audience may equal bigger 
laughs, something that NBC always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Much later this season, Molly gets raped and becomes pregnant. No giddiness 
there. Yet, said Tarses, "I think we're funnier this year. The jokes are 
better. The writers we used this year tend to be more facile. And Blair is 
trying to play it a little lighter. I think the show is better all around." 
</P>
<P>
Returning regulars beside Brown are James Greene as Davey, the erudite 
doorman/elevator operator for all seasons, and Allyn Ann McLerie as Molly's 
widowed mother, who now has a boyfriend of her own. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, one character who didn't survive the change of venues was Molly's 
broadly written sister, whom Tarses found "cartoonish." 
</P>
<P>
One character who not only survives but also is getting vastly more exposure is 
Fred, an unreliable musician who Molly never got over and who continued to 
haunt her thoughts. Now he's her confidante. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought Fred back as an ally because it seems we did all the torture we 
could do and we had to go to a new plateau or the character would be useless," 
Tarses said. "Also, if she needed a man to go to and confide in, why not have 
Fred be the one? She's a woman of 38, instead of 35 when we started, and crunch 
time is sort of approaching." 
</P>
<P>
Just as Lifetime saved "Molly Dodd" from extinction, "Molly Dodd" has rescued 
Lifetime from the anonymity that comes with being a low-profile cable network 
that has no strong identity. The Molly-to-Lifetime move has captured the kind 
of media attention previously unknown to Lifetime, and Brown may soon eclipse 
Dr. Ruth Westheimer as Lifetime's biggest star. 
</P>
<P>
Tarses is looking toward May when "Molly Dodd" ends production and Lifetime 
decides whether to order additional episodes. As enigmatic as Molly, Tarses 
sometimes sounds anxious to continue the series forever, other times just as 
anxious to retire it after its present run. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tonight's the night, as Molly's mother marks the show's new 
beginning this way in the opening moments of the first Lifetime episode: "Fade 
to music and let's see if there's really an audience out there watching cable."

TROUBLE HUNTER; 
</P>
<P>
AMBITIONS OF COLORFUL, CONTROVERSIAL MAYOR REACH BEYOND ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late '60s, future Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter prowled the city streets in 
tattered "Frisco" jeans, hair to his shoulders, boyish smile topped by a 
ferocious Fu Manchu mustache. He also carried a badge. 
</P>
<P>
As undercover narcotics cops, Hunter and his partner William (Wild Bill) Essex 
bent some rules to make their busts. Essex once rushed into a drug house at 3 
a.m. wearing a rubber monster mask, a bloody vinyl hatchet in its forehead. 
Hunter, perched in a tree outside, leaped down on the terrified dealers as they 
ran out into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has followed an unlikely career path to become mayor of Orange County's 
largest city. Sailor, undercover cop, personal-injury attorney, Bible-thumping 
preacher touring the South, Hunter the politician carries with him a colorful 
past. Now he leads a city where three mayors in the past 20 years have moved on 
to county and statewide offices. Hunter has his sights set higher: a 
congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
But to reach that goal, Hunter must convince powerful critics who call him the 
"Joe Isuzu of Anaheim," referring to the TV auto pitchman, that he can deliver 
on promises. He must bring a moribund city redevelopment plan to life. A 
lingering lawsuit with the California Angels that has bled the city of more 
than $6 million in legal fees since 1984 must be resolved. And there is the 
familiar litany of other urban woes that plague any large city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tremendous Energy 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, his critics and backers agree, brings tremendous energy to the 
challenges. Poised, a fiery public speaker, he has an engaging personality 
fueled by burning ambition and determination. But he can also be impulsive, 
unprepared and inconsistent, some critics say, and a reckless free-lancer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a charismatic kind of person who people enjoy being around," said William 
D. Ehrle, Hunter's closest colleague on the Anaheim City Council. "But he can 
be his own worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter himself concedes, "I will always be in trouble, just like when I was a 
cop, because I make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was born in 1941 in a tiny Chicago apartment on a freezing November 
morning. His mother promptly placed him in a warming oven. 
</P>
<P>
He was the second of three boys born to Charles Darwin Hunter, a baker from 
Iowa, and Helene Hunter of Oklahoma, a devout follower of the Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 3 weeks old, his parents bundled the family into a car and drove 
West, seeking work at the Navy's Long Beach shipyards, booming with the 
outbreak of World War II. They settled in the low-income housing projects just 
built in nearby Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nothing," Hunter recalled. 
</P>
<P>
His mother dominated the family, Hunter said, shepherding her boys to church on 
Sunday, Sunday night and Wednesday night. His father, who worked in the 
shipyards, stayed home at church time, baking pies every Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We studied the Bible a lot," Hunter said. Hunter, a good student in school, 
said the one thing he never considered was college. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went to college from my neighborhood," he said. "You joined the service 
or you went to work." After high school graduation, at 17, Hunter signed up 
with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy, Hunter drove from his San Diego base to the Church of Christ in 
Wilmington to preach on Wednesdays and Sundays. The pastor, Milton Anderson, 
"was a big influence in my life -- a dynamite Gospel preacher who took me under 
his wing," Hunter said. Hunter spent hours before a mirror, practicing 
memorized sermons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set Up a Church 
</P>
<P>
After the Navy, Hunter set up his own church in Parker, Ariz. He was 21. Over 
the next 2 years, he also traveled through Texas, Oklahoma and other Southern 
states, making his way as an itinerant preacher. 
</P>
<P>
His preaching days ended when he "just couldn't see myself doing this the rest 
of my life," Hunter said. Back in the Wilmington projects, he looked around and 
on impulse answered a newspaper ad seeking police officers in Anaheim. "Hell, I 
didn't want to be a cop," Hunter recalled. But the $400 monthly salary in 1962 
looked too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph B. Clark, who would later become an Anaheim mayor and member of the 
Orange County County Board of Supervisors, sat on Hunter's police hiring panel. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with him at his interview," Clark recalled. "And he has moved 
right along." 
</P>
<P>
Essex, now chief of the UC Davis police, went by the nickname "Wild Bill" then 
and was one of Hunter's first partners working undercover narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a fantastic cop," Essex said. "He had a knack. He could arrest people 
and they'd like him. He was just super with people, a great interrogator, 
really smooth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hated Paper Work 
</P>
<P>
But Hunter chafed under regulations and hated paper work, his colleagues and 
supervisors recall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always in (trouble) around the Anaheim Police Department," Essex said. 
"There was always some captain (mad) at him. But he was always clean." 
</P>
<P>
Former Anaheim Police Chief Jimmie Kennedy, then a lieutenant supervising 
Hunter, remembers the young officer as "an awfully good P.R. man. We used him a 
lot in delicate situations that needed a lot of handling." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter recalled: "We used to do the wildest things. But I liked working dope. 
You know why? You're a real loner. I used to make things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very ambitious. You have to have a lot of confidence in yourself. It 
built up to where I felt like Superman. I could do anything. A rush. That's 
what it is. Not ego. A challenge. You go in and outwit and outfox people. It's 
being an actor, a good one." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 5 years of his police career, Hunter went to law school at night, 
studying torts at stakeouts on 3-by-5 cards. After graduating from Western 
State College of Law, Hunter failed the state bar exam on his first try but 
passed the next year, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Delegator 
</P>
<P>
"I hung up my shingle immediately," Hunter said. He had no interest in rising 
through the police ranks. "I'm not a delegator," Hunter said. "I've not learned 
how to do that. That's why I'm a sole practitioner lawyer. I do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
At first, he rented an office in Fullerton with a former undercover narcotics 
police friend, Raymond T. Sharp, sharing the criminal defense workload. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred took right off to it," Sharp said. "He was very effective at trial. A 
little bit like a poker player, not letting everyone see his cards but backing 
them up." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal law soon gave way to a more lucrative personal-injury practice, and 
Hunter moved to Anaheim, where he set up an office in a renovated old home 
across the street from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Twice divorced by this time, Hunter was married a third time, to a flight 
attendant with United Airlines. He has four children, who live with him and his 
wife, Jeanne, in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Courtroom opponents say he can be formidable foe. "He is aggressive," said J. 
Kevin Lilly, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in Newport Beach, who 
settled a $150,000 case in Hunter's favor earlier this year. "Frankly, he's the 
best personal-injury lawyer I have dealt with in the past 3 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caseload of 60 Suits 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he handled settlements totaling $1 million last year, from which he 
received more than $300,000. He usually carries a caseload of 60 to 70 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the city firefighters union walked into his office for help with a 
contract, Hunter said. That started his political career. He lost his first 
council bid in 1984 but returned to victory 2 years later. But how far his 
career will go depends much on what Hunter can accomplish over the next 4 years 
as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hunter said, he is reading "Packaging the Presidency: A History and 
Criticism of Presidential Campaign Advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Always restless, Hunter aims high. His critics say he aims too high, too soon. 
But after only one 2-year term as a City Councilman, Hunter ran last fall for 
mayor and won, beating an opponent who was better financed and backed by five 
former Anaheim mayors and most of the city and county's political elite. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter admits the power brokers hold him at arm's length but says he has his 
own priority list, an agenda to grapple with the city's problems. His critics 
say they wonder if he has any agenda at all and ask what he has done lately. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred can be a very effective politician," said Harvey Englander, a Newport 
Beach political consultant who managed a successful campaign this fall for a 
City Council candidate who beat a candidate backed by Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to the Task? 
</P>
<P>
"But he needs to show more substance to be successful. The essence of politics 
is being able to produce a consensus and a majority, and I'm not sure he is up 
to that task." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), now a candidate for lieutenant governor, 
was one of the city's former mayors who supported Hunter's opponent in the fall 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel Fred Hunter had an agenda," Seymour said last week. "In my 
opinion, the jury is still out on that one. The real question is yet 
unanswered. Can he lead on a specific agenda and specific issues?" 
</P>
<P>
But Hunter said Seymour "viewed me as a threat. 'Let's kill this guy's ambition 
now.' . . . Was he really looking out for his constituency in Anaheim or was he 
looking out for his rear at a guy moving faster than him?" 
</P>
<P>
Asked to point to a major accomplishment after 2 years on the City Council, 
Hunter paused, then named the abolition of a two-tier pay scale for the city 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
It is that professed concern for working people that has built Hunter's 
political base of city unions and homeowners' groups. At election time, Hunter 
can deploy an impressive and effective army of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred's given us a real voice downtown," said Bob Horton, board member of the 
Anaheim Homeowner's Assn., which claims a membership of 1,700 households. "Fred 
listens to us. He sees things from the family point of view as opposed to the 
financial developer side of the coin." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Compassionate Republican' 
</P>
<P>
Hunter likes to call himself "a compassionate Republican." 
</P>
<P>
His heroes form an ideological grab bag: Martin Luther King Jr., former Marine 
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, and Jack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I am a Republican, I share a lot of Democratic principles, a desire 
to help people less fortunate," Hunter said. "I know what the development 
community and others say, that Fred can't be trusted. But doing things like 
they say you should is kowtowing to the special interests. I just don't like 
people telling me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even his backers concede that Hunter's independence can lead him down 
dangerous paths. 
</P>
<P>
His council colleagues have at times chided Hunter for solo forays into city 
policy matters. In the months before his mayoral election, then-Mayor Ben Bay 
removed him as one of the council liaisons with the Angels for free-lancing 
solutions to the prickly litigation over the Rams football team putting office 
buildings on the stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"He tends to want to do things more on his own," Hunter's friend and council 
colleague Ehrle said. "Being ambitious, he has to allow others to be part of a 
process-building agenda to move things forward." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has vowed to serve at least one term in the city's top job, but once 
again he is in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide reapportionment of legislative and congressional districts is 
coming in 1991. One, and maybe two, new congressional districts may fall may 
into Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do go on, I'd make a big leap," Hunter said. "I'm not interested in being 
on the Board of Supervisors, in the state Assembly or Senate. If I did 
something, it would be typical Fred Hunter. Congress I would consider. Yes, 
that's a probability."

EX-CIA CHIEF DEFENDS ROLE OF VIETNAMESE IN LITTLE SAIGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former CIA Director William E. Colby praised members of the county's Vietnamese 
exile community Sunday, calling them "hard-working" Americans who have had a 
positive influence on America. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring opportunities for refugees in the United States, Colby told a 
predominantly Vietnamese audience of more than 200 people in Westminster's 
Little Saigon that he recently sat next to the Air Force Academy's top 
graduate, who happens to be Vietnamese-born. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of accomplishments Vietnamese bring to the United States," he 
said. "That's the kind America needs." 
</P>
<P>
Colby's comments in a speech at the Nguyen Khoa Nam Center contrasted sharply, 
Vietnamese leaders noted, with those of Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry 
Jr., who told Vietnamese veterans last week, "If you want to be South 
Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Colby, in his first visit to Little Saigon, spoke about forming the American 
Committee for a Free Vietnam. He said he had been briefed about Fry's comments 
and the controversy they caused. 
</P>
<P>
After his talk, Colby said the controversy is "the same kind of thing that the 
Italians had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
"But if you can have a St. Patrick's Day Parade for the Irish or a special day 
for the Italians, why not let them (Vietnamese veterans) have their parade 
here?" Colby asked. 
</P>
<P>
Fry's statement was made in a televised City Council meeting after the council 
denied a parade permit sought by Vietnamese veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Fry has denied that his statements were racially motivated but has maintained 
they were a personal expression intended to encourage assimilation by 
Vietnamese people into the U.S. mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of having their own parade, Fry said Vietnamese should commemorate 
their war dead on a U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day.

Hundreds of Vietnamese packed into the Nguyen Khoa Nam Center to hear Colby, 
who directed the Central Intelligence Agency from 1973 until his retirement in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience, such as Cypress businessman Phong Tran, said they 
remember Colby from his Vietnam days, including the former director's role as 
head of the Phoenix program directed against the Viet Cong. The CIA also had 
close contacts with a group of generals who staged a coup in 1963 in which 
President Ngo Dinh Diem was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we had a former high-ranking American official involved with something 
called Americans for a Free Vietnam, and we wanted to know about the committee, 
so we invited him to speak," Tran said. "After all, the Vietnamese community in 
Orange County is known worldwide as the capital of the Vietnamese overseas." 
</P>
<P>
The committee that Colby heads was recently incorporated as a private, 
nonprofit organization based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is nonpolitical and is designed, Colby said, to educate the 
American people, "including those who served there, to help Americans think 
about Vietnam and support changes for freedom there." 
</P>
<P>
He said the informational group will help change U.S. opinion the in same way 
as the American Committee for Freedom in Afghanistan did. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam panel's new executive director, Karen McKay, also headed 
Afghanistan committee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his talk, Colby repeatedly mentioned the recent Soviet pullout from 
Afghanistan as positive evidence that the "Communist world is withdrawing," 
including the Vietnamese from Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Human Rights 'Disaster' 
</P>
<P>
"Now you see the Soviets pulling out of Afghanistan, and we hope to do the same 
with Vietnam," he said to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights, political liberty and economic rights have "been a disaster" 
under the North Vietnamese, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam could be a titan today if it didn't have the present restrictions," he 
said, urging Vietnamese to contact relatives in Vietnam to tell them that a 
better way to live "does exist." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to bring change in Vietnam," he said to applause. "It is quite obvious 
that to bring about political change you need a political base, a political 
force to make it work. It can be natural or helped to grow so that everyone 
demands it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that if we keep the pressure on, we can bring freedom in 
Vietnam."

CLASSIC MUSTANG ROUNDUP CORRALS 1,000 CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Upchurch, who flew in from Albuquerque just to see the car show in Orange 
County, said Sunday that he was not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Looking around at the hundreds of vintage automobiles, Upchurch said, "It's 
fabulous. There are more (display) cars here than I've ever seen in one place." 
</P>
<P>
Another visitor, Larry Quay of Covina, said, "For someone who likes cars, this 
is like Christmas." And yet another visitor, Donald E. Petersen of Detroit, 
chairman of board of the Ford Motor Co., said, "This is the biggest show of 
Mustangs in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands jammed the east side of Knott's Berry Farm to lovingly stare at a 
wide array of classic cars on display. Petersen, in an interview, said there's 
a reason Southern Californians love cars so much. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the California spirit is one of freedom and experimentation -- trying 
things that are different and new," Petersen said. "And there is also here a 
love for the outdoors and a love for being active. I think this interest in 
cars, especially sporty cars and unusual cars, is just part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen was at the event to mark Ford Motor Co.'s 25th anniversary of its 
enormously successful Mustang model. About 1,000 early-model Mustangs, now 
coveted as collector's items, were on display. European car lovers brought 37 
of the classic Mustangs to the show. They shipped their cars from Europe to 
Florida and then drove them cross-country to Buena Park to be in the event. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the vintage cars came from Southern California -- a place sometimes 
mocked by the rest of the nation because of its love affair with automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, however, said he well understands the mystique cars hold for Southern 
Californians. "It's a phenomenon I was first introduced to a little kid," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in Minnesota, but I grew up in Southern California. I lived with my 
folks in San Bernardino and Long Beach. I was in a Depression family that 
didn't have cars. But I sure yearned for them and loved to look at them." 
</P>
<P>
As Petersen recalled his lifelong interest in cars, thousands milled among the 
gleaming automobiles on display nearby. Some in the crowd stood before restored 
cars as if having a religious experience. Their eyes had a dreamy, far-away 
look. 
</P>
<P>
The show had a wide assortment of makes and models of classic cars. But the big 
draw, and numerically the largest single model on display, was Ford's Mustang. 
Today is the official 25th anniversary of the historic vehicle, and Petersen 
said Ford Motor Co. chose the Knott's show to be "the official celebration for 
the 25th anniversary of the Mustang." 
</P>
<P>
Mustang car owners from Switzerland to San Diego came to the show to display 
their "Mustang collectibles." Most were early-model Mustangs, with 1964 1/2 
models being the prime objects of attention. Mustang devotees -- and there were 
thousands in the crowd -- were quick to point out that the car's debut in 
April, 1964, came in mid-year. Thus the first models are officially known as 
1964 1/2 year-of-make. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Upchurch and his wife Sherron were among those in the crowd who are proud 
owners of 1964 1/2 Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two 1964 1/2s: a coupe and a convertible," said Sherron Upchurch. 
"We've had quite a few (Mustang) shows in Albuquerque where they've had more 
than 100 cars, but it's nowhere near what this show has. The Europeans who 
brought their Mustangs to this show drove through Albuquerque, so we saw part 
of the 'Pony Drive' on its way here." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Upchurch said he is so anxious to protect his 1964 1/2 Mustang "that I 
never drive it any more, I just keep it in the garage for shows." 
</P>
<P>
Sherron Upchurch said that the original year-of-make Mustangs now bring hefty 
prices. "I only paid $1,100 for my Mustang in 1968 when I bought it, as the 
second owner," she said. "Now I could sell it for about $14,000," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Upchurchs, Larry Quay, a professional photographer from Covina, stood 
by his restored 1964 1/2 Mustang convertible. Quay said he had taken a junked 
Mustang and restored it to a car that he estimated would sell for up to 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
A display book by the car, with photos made by Quay, showed the before and 
after transformation of his Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
"I found this car about 1 1/2 years ago in Gardena," Quay said. "It was in 
absolute, terrible shape. I paid $1,200 for it. Since then, I've put a lot of 
work into it, and I guess I've spent about $10,000 all told." 
</P>
<P>
Quay said that fixing up an old car is a bit of adventure. "It's like doing 
archeology," he said. "It's also like a three-dimensional crossword puzzle. 
It's definitely a hobby; it's real enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Quay said that while the restored vehicle now brings many purchase offers, he 
has no intention of selling. But he said he is pleased at his investment. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, the Ford Motor Co. chairman, said that one of the interesting things 
about the early Mustangs is how they have escalated in value. 
</P>
<P>
"The first ones are worth so much more now than what we sold them for," said 
the Ford executive. "We started (in 1964) selling Mustangs at $2,268, and if 
you really wanted to spend a lot of money, you could pay $250 more for our 
manual soft-top convertible. So you could buy a new convertible Mustang in 
those days for about $2,600." 
</P>
<P>
While the economics of car collecting interested some in the crowd, others said 
just the sheer beauty of the vehicles made the event akin to attending an art 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Quay gestured to the acres of restored classic cars at the display. "This is 
the ultimate," he said.

A NEW START;

<P>
BARRETT REBUILDS LIFE WITH SOFTBALL AFTER CAR ACCIDENT SHORTENS SWIMMING CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NISTA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swimming saved the life of Toni Barrett; softball slowly pieced it back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
For Barrett, 26, a promising swimming career came to screeching halt more than 
six years ago when the car she was driving was broadsided at a Huntington Beach 
intersection, crushing her left side and destroying her dreams of swimming at a 
major university. 
</P>
<P>
Three others in the car suffered only scrapes and cuts, but Barrett survived 
mainly because of her swimming background, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
"My lungs were very developed from swimming," said Barrett, who swam and played 
softball at Marina High School before continuing with a successful swimming 
career at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors told me that anyone else would not have been able to live through it." 
</P>
<P>
Six ribs and half a lung were taken out of Barrett's body in 10 1/2 hours of 
emergency surgery on that New Year's Day in 1983, the day before her 20th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps even more painfully, her dreams of a swimming scholarship at a 
major university were snatched from her grasp. 
</P>
<P>
She spent the next 17 days in a hospital as her chances of earning a 
scholarship slowly sank along with her second and final swimming season at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she attempted to swim competitively again at OCC, but her lungs didn't 
have the capacity to keep her going. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't do it," Barrett said. "That was a big letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Such a big letdown that she decided to end her athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really determined to not do anything," Barrett said. "I was always 
whining. I was in a slump, I guess you could say." 
</P>
<P>
That continued about two years until a friend talked to her about playing 
softball again, which eventually turned around her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally overcame the fact that I was in an accident," Barrett said. "I just 
decided to try to play it." 
</P>
<P>
So she took her fragile body out to the Golden West College softball diamond, 
where Coach Betsy Ward, Barrett's coach at Marina High School, welcomed her 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 season, she batted .348 and had a .980 fielding percentage at 
first base en route to becoming an All-Orange Empire Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
This season, her hitting has dropped off. She's batting .215 as the Rustlers 
(15-12 overall, 5-7 in conference play) are vying for the third and final 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
She's not complaining, however. 
</P>
<P>
"She never complains," Ward said. "She never says that she's sore or hurt. You 
can see the pain in her face when she swings hard, but she doesn't say 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls new to the team didn't know she had been in an accident and had been 
left with half a body. When they found out, they said, 'God, look at how hard 
she works.' " 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't have trouble running the bases and playing the field, but her 
reduced lung capacity limits her endurance running in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her slump at the plate, Barrett's work habits and fielding have not 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of lead outs because she comes up and fields bunts so well," Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She could play anywhere. She's even tried third base and she's a super 
outfielder, but first base is where she has her experience." 
</P>
<P>
She probably could play other sports, but is content with softball. 
</P>
<P>
"I still swim for fun," Barrett said. "I like to play all sports, but softball 
is for me right now." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett still has to be careful, though. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors pulled out fragments of what amounted to six ribs during the emergency 
surgery the day of the accident. The rest of the ribs were wired together as a 
makeshift rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, she fell off a skateboard and fractured a few ribs. Two years 
ago, she fractured ribs while swinging the bat and surgery followed to remove a 
piece of rib growing the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the most part, her return to softball has been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, it was really hard," Barrett said. "But I'm in better shape 
now. It doesn't bother me. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always very athletic. I don't think I would have been able to accept not 
playing anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Playing softball seems to have been her best cure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want anyone to pity me," Barrett said. "There's nothing really to 
pity me about. Maybe they can say it's great that I'm playing. But it's over. I 
don't really feel like hearing that there's anything wrong with me. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I could play any sport I wanted to, but softball is a sport I've played 
all my life." 
</P>
<P>
And first base is where she wants to stay at least for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
After that, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
Barrett might go on to a four-year college to continue with softball or she 
might attend nursing school. 
</P>
<P>
"You see how some nurses treat you and you want to be able to help out," 
Barrett said. "I've been through so much, maybe I could help the patients a 
little."

CAPISTRANO VALLEY'S SHAW TO SWIM AT TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amy Shaw of Capistrano Valley High School has signed a letter of intent to 
attend the University of Texas in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who holds the American long-course record in the 200-meter breaststroke 
(2 minutes 29.78 seconds), said she chose Texas for its swimming program. She 
had also been considering the University of Florida and the University of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel it's the best swim program in the nation," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw set the record in July of 1987 at the U.S. Swimming Long Course National 
Championships in Clovis, Calif. She also competed for the United States in the 
Goodwill Games in 1986.

CUSTOMERS PULL $60 MILLION OUT OF LINCOLN S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
CONFUSION ON PARENT'S BANKRUPTCY STATUS CITED BY REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Customers withdrew $60 million from Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. within 48 hours of its seizure Friday, apparently due to confusion over 
bankruptcy plans of its parent corporation, federal regulators said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some depositors closed certificate accounts before maturity and paid the early 
withdrawal penalty because of confusion about the status of the thrift, said M. 
Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
Wall announced Sunday that Lincoln, with 29 branches, will reimburse any early 
withdrawal penalties to customers who elect to reinstate their certificate 
accounts withdrawn since last Friday, April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who heads the agency that put Lincoln into a conservatorship Friday, said 
the policy will continue "until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that depositors can see Lincoln is continuing to operate as usual under 
strong new management, we are extending the opportunity for them to reinstate 
their accounts and have the early withdrawal penalty reversed," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators took control of Lincoln on Friday after the parent company, 
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, declared bankruptcy Thursday. Wall said 
the confusion stemmed from the bankruptcy filing, which did not include 
Lincoln. Lincoln has a new chief executive officer and advisory board and is 
operating under the control of federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
A Bank Board spokeswoman said the $60 million in withdrawals is significant but 
not an overwhelming amount for Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge institution, and that number looks a lot bigger than when you 
consider how big the institution is. It has over $5.4 billion in assets," 
Martha Gravlee said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall insisted that depositors "have no reason to withdraw their funds." 
</P>
<P>
Funds are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is being brought in as conservator, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Misunderstanding' 
</P>
<P>
"The concern that we have is that some people have confused or misunderstood 
the relationship between American Continental . . . and the savings and loan 
that they own in California that is not part of the bankruptcy," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall would not characterize the money loss as a run on the S&amp;L but 
described Saturday's activity as "heavy withdrawals," with particularly great 
activity at a limited number of branches. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the confusion apparently stems from the fact that many Lincoln Savings 
customers were aware that its parent was seeking bankruptcy protection because 
they had invested in bonds issued by American Continental, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those bonds were sold at Lincoln Savings branches but the bonds were 
not insured because they weren't deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Wall speculated that those branches with the greatest withdrawal activity may 
have been where greater numbers of bonds were sold. 
</P>
<P>
All of Lincoln Savings' branches are in Southern California. As of mid-1988 it 
was ranked as the state's 18th-largest thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank Board said upon seizing Lincoln that its troubles began when American 
Continental bought it in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The board said management had abandoned its traditional operations to pursue "a 
rapid growth strategy based on soliciting brokered deposits to purchase real 
estate and to fund high-risk acquisition, development and construction loans, 
equity securities and junk bonds."

Oops! Not all creative accounting in the motion picture industry is 
premeditated, as followers of Cineplex Odeon Corp. have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto security analysts recently asked the movie and theater company why its 
1988 annual report alludes to tax-loss carryforwards of $100 million at the end 
of 1987, when the annual report for that year said the sum was a mere $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
No explanation for the $85-million discrepancy was offered in the latest annual 
report. But Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky solved the mystery with a 
shrug. The lower number, he said, was just a "typographical error."

'Toons Baking Well 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Thomas is looking for her fortune in cookies, and Cruella, Dumbo and 
Snow White are showing her the way. Slowly. A junior at the University of 
Southern California, she is the first person to receive a license from Walt 
Disney Co. to put Disney characters on cookies. She has them baked in Seattle 
in three-inch, white-cake circles, then iced with a hard, shiny glaze that 
includes a remarkably colorful portrait of a character. The marketing major 
said she has sold 50,000 around the country so far to movie theaters, which 
sell them for 75 cents to $1.25 each. That's a good start, she thinks -- but 
not enough to repay the $10,000 she borrowed from her family to get started in 
business.

Century City: Seat of Suitors 
</P>
<P>
Rival suitors for Northwest Airlines -- billionaire oilman Marvin Davis and 
investor Alfred Checchi -- are far from strangers. The two are master-minding 
their separate takeover bids from offices just two floors apart in Fox Plaza, 
the same Century City high-rise where former President Reagan conducts 
business. Fox Plaza is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdock, who bought it from 
Davis in 1985. Joked one Davis acquaintance, "Too bad he didn't wire it for 
sound."

Tailored to the Early Bird 
</P>
<P>
Here's a case of the early bird getting the pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Sherwood, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer with the firm of O'Melveny 
&amp; Myers, had a problem. He liked shopping at Carroll &amp; Co., a 
traditional men's clothier on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. But he felt 
guilty leaving his busy practice in midday to go browsing. 
</P>
<P>
When Richard Carroll, founder and owner of the 40-year-old store, heard 
Sherwood's lament, he leaped into action. Starting Tuesday, the retailer will 
open his doors at 8 a.m. weekdays instead of the usual 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're the first to do it," he said, acknowledging that "logistically, 
it's a very big problem for us" because of the need to schedule extra tailors 
and an early shift of salespeople. "I don't know how cost-effective it will 
be," Carroll said. "I don't know if anybody will come in to buy anything, but a 
lot of people will come in to get things fixed and have a cup of coffee." 
That's coffee and two button-down shirts to go, please.

Students of Capitalism 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy may face challenges from overseas, but foreign students still 
flock here to learn the ABCs of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, France, Nigeria and other countries are 
most likely to major in business and management while in American colleges, 
according to a recent study by the National Science Foundation. In contrast, 
engineering is the first choice of students from India, Iran, Taiwan, Malaysia 
and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan -- with 25,660 students in U.S. classrooms -- was the leading source of 
foreign scholars here in 1986, followed by Malaysia, China and South Korea.

Ford Mexico Plant to Retool: The Ford Motor Co. assembly factory in Hermosillo 
will suspend operations for six months starting in August to retool for 
production of a new model car, the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada reported. 
The plant, which assembles the Tracer Mercury GT-18 for export to the United 
States and Canada, will convert its assembly lines to produce the Ford CT-20, 
auto workers union leader Dario Aguilar Tapia was quoted as saying. Production 
will increase from 32 to 40 vehicles per hour and average about 50,000 a year. 
The plant's 1,200 workers will receive full salaries during the suspension.

ALAMO AGREES TO CHANGE CAR RENTAL REFILL FEES 
</P>

Alamo Rent A Car will change the way it charges for refilling the gas tanks of 
its rental cars in an effort to meet standards proposed by the National Assn. 
of Attorneys General, a company spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
The move by Alamo, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., comes amid a series 
of lawsuits against rental car companies alleging that fuel charges are 
inaccurately calculated and inadequately disclosed. The new rental car industry 
guidelines from NAAG, an organization that has no law enforcement powers, were 
issued April 1 and called for prominent disclosure in advertisements of all 
mandatory gasoline fees. 
</P>
<P>
Renters always have the option of filling the gas tank themselves before they 
return the car. With vehicles rented from the Big Four rental firms -- Hertz, 
Avis, National and Budget -- the renter thus can avoid the companies' refueling 
charges. However, at Alamo and some smaller rental agencies a mandatory fuel 
charge has been levied regardless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked to Choose 
</P>
<P>
As of May 1, Alamo's mandatory $11.95 charge for half a tank of gasoline will 
no longer be required at any of its 82 U.S. offices, spokeswoman Liz Clark 
said. Instead, customers will be asked to choose between paying the flat fee or 
agreeing to return the car with as much gas as it had when it was rented. If 
the car comes back with less, the renter will be billed up to $1.95 a gallon 
for the refill. 
</P>
<P>
The new system is already in use in California, Illinois and Hawaii, all of 
which have banned mandatory gas charges within the past year. Alamo is the 
nation's fifth-largest car rental company and is the largest firm with 
mandatory charges. 
</P>
<P>
Some Alamo clients, especially those traveling on business expense accounts, 
continue to pay the $11.95 fee and bring the car back nearly empty of fuel, 
Clark said. "The customer knows exactly how much the car is going to cost 
before he turns the key." 
</P>
<P>
The change was made to put the company "in accord with" the new NAAG 
guidelines, Clark said. But the guidelines, intended to serve as a model for 
state regulation of the industry, specify only disclosure and do not ask for 
eliminating of mandatory gas fees, said Art Weiss, a Kansas deputy attorney 
general who assisted in drafting them. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have decided it's easier to make it an option than to advertise it," 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Three Alamo offices in Britain will retain the mandatory fuel charge, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Alamo on Dec. 29 alleging 
that in giving price quotes the company failed to disclose either the mandatory 
gasoline fee or its airport access surcharges, collected at 13 airports around 
the country that have imposed revenue-based fees on rental agencies that do not 
rent airport counter space but pick up customers from terminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consent Order 
</P>
<P>
Alamo agreed to a consent order the same day, neither admitting nor denying 
wrongdoing, and its sales personnel are now instructed to mention the charges. 
Clark said the firm would aggressively promote its new fuel charge plan as 
offering consumers a choice that rival firms do not. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Alamo lawsuit, other car rental agencies have begun to mention their 
gas fees -- up to $1.99 per gallon at Avis and Hertz -- in printed 
advertisements and over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona attorney general's office is suing Hollywood, Fla.-based General 
Rent-a-Car, alleging that the company should disclose its mandatory gas fees of 
$12 to $13. Officials of General did not return phone calls Friday.

Canadians to Bid for Jerusalem Post: Canadian investors headed by Charles 
Bronfman and British publisher Robert Maxwell will make a joint bid for the 
Jerusalem Post, Israel's English-language daily, a spokesman for the two said. 
Bronfman's Claridge group and Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communication Corp., 
are bidding for the controlling 55% stake in the left-leaning Post, owned by a 
subsidiary of Israel's troubled Koor Industries. The Maxwell-Bronfman group, 
refused to disclose the amount of the offer to be submitted today. The Post 
does not make a profit and its daily circulation of about 28,000 is among the 
smallest of the secular Israeli newspapers but it is read by government 
leaders, diplomats, the foreign media, English-speaking Israelis and 
Palestinians and visiting Jews. A weekly international edition reaches 60,000 
readers.

JACK SMITH: HOW DO OUR LIBRARIES STACK UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Libraries are among man's most ancient and enduring cultural achievements, and 
at the same time among the most fragile; witness the obliteration of the great 
library at Alexandria, Egypt; the wanton destruction of the Hollywood branch 
library by fire, and the disastrous damage inflicted on the Los Angeles Central 
Library by a sociopathic arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
Sociopaths are not the only villains. 
</P>
<P>
Now we read that the California Historical Society has closed its library in 
San Francisco for lack of money. The library houses 8,500 manuscripts, 35,000 
historical texts, 3,000 maps and several special collections found nowhere 
else. All will now be closed to scholars and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Also, according to a letter to the editor from Dr. Patrick A. Mauer, the 
library of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. will soon be closed so that the 
association may divert the money it costs to other uses. The library is to be 
surrendered to something ominously called "reconfiguration;' meanwhile, its 
collection is to be scattered or sold, and physicians are to be directed to 
other library services. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the association's rationale, I would hate to see this library vanish, 
if not by fire by ukase. It has stood for 55 years on its quiet corner at 
Wilshire and Westlake, a block from MacArthur (Westlake) Park, serving not only 
the medical community but also the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
I am not a doctor but I have used this cozy library many times, recently to 
search its 1,000 medical journals for the latest articles on a neurological 
disorder I am interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Besides holding 87,000 books and 63,600 bound volumes of periodicals, it has a 
precious collection of rare medical books, and serves as a quaint museum of 
medical artifacts. In its lobby a collection of antique medical instruments is 
displayed under glass; in an alcove one stares incredulously at a life-size 
model of a pregnant woman once used by students in the study of obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
The library obviously has been built and administered with love and care. I 
agree with Dr. Mauer that "It is difficult to envision the continuation of (the 
association's) worthy tradition ('the betterment of the medical profession and 
the interchange of knowledge within the profession') if this library is so 
wantonly destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the central library labors toward restoration and renaissance, 
the Pasadena Public Library is showing what a library can do with generous 
community support. 
</P>
<P>
I toured the library recently with its librarian, Edward Szynaka; he is 
orchestrating a multimillion-dollar restoration that will prepare the library 
for the 21st Century without defacing architect Myron Hunt's 1927 Spanish 
Colonial Revival masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The great reception hall, 42 feet high and lined with oak panels, will be kept 
intact. (One problem is the removal of pits caused by women's stiletto heels in 
the original cork floor.) The children's room is being restored with a gift 
from a Pasadena businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Szynaka demonstrated the computerized indexing system that is replacing the old 
card catalogues. One simply punches the title of a book, an author, or a 
subject, and the computer screen shows whatever is in the collection. I 
wondered if the technology might be difficult for some users. 
</P>
<P>
To show how easy it was, Szynaka punched in my name. Instantly the screen 
showed that 22 copies of my books were in the collection. "And they're all in 
the library," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously it was time to retire some of the copies, perhaps in the annual 
public book sale. 
</P>
<P>
The computer index includes the library's eight branches and the Glendale 
Public Library, with which Pasadena has reciprocal privileges. "Eventually," he 
said, "it will include the whole nation. If you want something from the Harvard 
Theological Library, you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the library checked out 1.6 million books -- 10 per capita of the 
city's 160,000 population. Cardholders may check out 50 books at a time for 28 
days. At any time, 12% of the books in circulation are overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Szynaka seems happy in his work. No wonder. His first assignment, after his 
graduation from the University of Syracuse, was at the library in Massena, 
N.Y., on the St. Lawrence River Seaway. "It was 40 below in February," he 
recalled. "At night only the library and the pool hall were open." 
</P>
<P>
Libraries need all the help they can get. As Ray Brabury says, they are "the 
universities of the poor."

DESIGNERS DELIVER GOOD NEWS FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of his show here Thursday, designer Giorgio di Sant'Angelo knelt 
down on the fashion runway, leaned into the crowd and kissed the editor of 
Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, on the cheek. She smiled and blushed. 
</P>
<P>
That suggested something about why designers stage fashion shows. They want to 
get out the news of their latest collections, and they hope the news will be 
good. 
</P>
<P>
This season many will get their wish. Reactions have been positive to clothes 
that look fresh, but at the same time familiar. Active wear shapes -- 
especially parkas, down-filled vests, ponchos and stretch pants -- are all 
being recast in luxury fabrics for ready-to-wear dressing. They give fall 
fashion an air of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Navajo Blanket Print Coats 
</P>
<P>
There are other themes to watch for too. Men's bathrobes inspire the Burgundy 
velvet and gold silk Jacquard coats Donna Karan is showing for evening, and the 
Navajo blanket print version Ralph Lauren offers for day. 
</P>
<P>
Color is replacing black. Not harsh, hyper-bright shades, but warm, flattering 
tones of blue, green and deeper red. A number of designers are using these 
shades for the narrow-cut suits they prefer as office wear. Calvin Klein, 
however, substitutes taupe or deep sand for black. 
</P>
<P>
White shirts are still a staple, especially for Karan and Ronaldus Shamask. 
Often they are shown tucked into narrow-leg pants. Pants have stirrups at 
Lauren, Karan and Roehm. They are cropped at the ankle at Klein and Shamask, 
for the cutting-edge silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short, Narrow Skirts Return 
</P>
<P>
Skirts are making a return to style, after two seasons when they were 
overshadowed by pants. Short, narrow skirts look best now. (For day, Oscar de 
la Renta and Geoffrey Beene show them above the knee, Bill Blass and Calvin 
Klein show them to the knee.) 
</P>
<P>
Ankle-length is second choice. (Shamask prefers it for day and night. Louis 
Dell 'Olio for Anne Klein shows it as often as knee-length. Isaac Mizrahi 
offers some skirts to the ankle, but more are cut above the knee.) Only 
mid-calf lengths look out-of-sync for fall. (Karan shows many at that length, 
so does Roehm.) 
</P>
<P>
The other interesting development in fashion now has to do with casual dress. 
Younger-spirited designers in particular are giving over as much as a third of 
their collection to clothes for traveling, touring, lounging, and working as a 
self-employed business person unrestricted by a corporate dress code. 
</P>
<P>
Roehm shows stretch pants, tunics, ponchos and parkas as the essence of her 
casual collection. Karan teams oversize cashmere sweaters with stretch pants, 
and often adds a Sherpa jacket or coat for her high quality, super-casual look. 
</P>
<P>
Klein shows tight, suede jeans and cable knit cashmere sweaters tied one over 
the other for expensive-looking casual wear. Marc Jacobs of Perry Ellis offers 
witty, flag-motif stoles, and suede pants tucked into thigh-high boots. 
Standouts in Mizrahi's casual collection are his strapless, tartan plaid kilt 
dresses, and his black, broadtail knapsack jacket to wear with a silk taffeta 
shirtwaist dress. He filled the deep patch pockets of the jacket with wild 
flowers for his show. 
</P>
<P>
But evening parkas are by far the most surprising fall addition, and Isaac 
Mizrahi shows them to their best advantage. The 27-year-old designer started 
the trend with his first collection, about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silk Parka 
</P>
<P>
His newest designs include a satiny, sable-colored style he tosses over short, 
strapless, body-skimming dresses in the same color. And his formal wear 
includes a floor-length silk parka, worn with a white silk shirt and dazzling 
black, sequinned pants. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Klein shows a quilted velvet parka with narrow velvet pants for night. 
Michael Kors styles parkas, as well as gray flannel sweat-shirt dresses with 
drawstring hoods, for day. 
</P>
<P>
Karan upgrades the down-filled vest for fall. Hers is Bordeaux velvet, worn 
with navy, crepe, stretch pants and an ivory silk blouse. 
</P>
<P>
It works, where some others do not. Jacobs of Perry Ellis mixes bright, satin 
down vests with strictly daytime shirts and pants. The playful yet dressy outer 
wear loses something in the translation. 
</P>
<P>
Having mastered her unique approach to day wear, Karan's evening wear is her 
more inventive group for fall. She shows slinky, elasticized-crepe dresses that 
mold to the body in a sensual way. Her bathrobe coats and smoking suits look 
rich and modern. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Kamali is also showing bathrobe coats, in embroidered velvet, 
flamboyantly oversized and reminiscent of the late Victorian era. But they 
don't quite work; they look too much like costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Kamali's strength lies in her belted, black jumpsuits with white collar and 
cuffs. They fit like unitards and look right for youthful, swift, supple 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Di Sant'Angelo, known for his small evening collections, drapes and knots 
fabric around the body in characteristic form for fall. His smartest daytime 
coat dress is made of a fabric he calls bonded foam that has the look and feel 
of surfers' Neoprene wetsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Super-slim model Cheryl Tiegs sat in the front row at the Di Sant'Angelo show, 
and her sort of long, lean figure is best suited to his body-contoured 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blanket Dressing' 
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, audiences started talking about the "blanket dressing" seen 
on many designer runways this season. The term refers to the variety of big 
wraps worn layered over each other, or knotted over suit jackets, for day as 
well as night. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Dell 'Olio for Anne Klein put his huge shawls over tunic sweaters and 
sarong-like skirts in red or black wool, for day. Bill Blass shows enormous 
evening wraps in chiffon, over long, fluid dresses. Some have a single sleeve, 
which apparently makes them difficult to wear. Even his runway models struggled 
to keep them from twisting and tangling. 
</P>
<P>
The blanket idea makes sense for Los Angeles, where temperatures seldom require 
a heavier wrap, and driving makes it difficult to wear snug-fitting coats or 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Other good ideas for Southern California are the light-weight, very full shell 
coats that almost every designer includes in his or her fall collection. 
Geoffrey Beene makes the most beautiful version. His is ankle-length, tangerine 
mohair lined with black-and-tangerine gingham check taffeta. He shows it over 
black pants and a burnt orange fencing-style jacket. 
</P>
<P>
If Mizrahi is New York fashion's new young Turk, Beene is the uncontested 
master. Other daytime looks in his fall collection are built on black 
jumpsuits. He adds bolero jackets or brief, almost off-the-shoulder jackets he 
calls shrugs. Some have hoods. His daytime suits have matching shawls wrapped 
several times around the shoulders for a nose-tickling look. 
</P>
<P>
His taffeta evening skirts have hems of lingerie lace that show only in front, 
where the skirt rises slightly. And gold, lingerie lace floats to the floor, in 
an outfit with a matching hooded cape. 
</P>
<P>
Among his imaginative accessories are a glen plaid taffeta stole for day, 
black-net and lace gloves, and a confetti-dotted net stole for night. 
</P>
<P>
But the newest invention from this ingenious designer's studio is his shrug. He 
made the first one in black lace, for Glenn Close' Oscar outfit this year. 
Close was in the front row when Beene showed his remarkable fall collection.

THE PHOENIX OF BEL-AIR; 
</P>
<P>
SINCE HER DIVORCE FROM A DELOREAN, CRISTINA HAS BECOME ONE RED-HOT FERRARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"All of that unpleasantness," Cristina Ferrare pronounces, "is behind me." 
</P>
<P>
She is sprawling across an upholstered sofa in the study of her Bel-Air home, a 
stunning 39-year-old woman wearing a big cotton sweater that saw her through 
her latest pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Arianna, born less than three weeks earlier, is tucked inside a 
frilly bassinet, alternating between sleeping and cooing. 
</P>
<P>
Cluttering the bookshelves are framed photographs of Ferrare's husband, 
producer Tony Thomopoulos, herself and the children -- counting all the his and 
hers and theirs, a total of seven. 
</P>
<P>
Vases of fresh-cut flowers grace the tables. Sunlight streams in from the 
garden. A maid brings in a tray of decaffeinated coffee poured into fine 
porcelain cups. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of "all that unpleasantness" are nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I purposefully kept a low profile over the last few years and purposefully 
shied away from any publicity, just, you know, doing my thing, doing my job, 
taking care of my family," Ferrare says. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, you know, with everything that is happening and all of these positive 
things, I feel more at ease and comfortable talking about everything." 
</P>
<P>
The everything is understood. It means the arrest and trial of her husband of 
12 years, former auto maker John Z. DeLorean, who was acquitted in 1984 of 
conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It means her role as the glamorous model-turned-wife-and-mother who stood by 
her man only to leave him within three weeks of the not-guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
It means her marriage, two weeks after the divorce to DeLorean was final, to 
Thomopoulos, then head of the ABC Broadcast Group. 
</P>
<P>
And it means her career as a television personality, which despite scandal and 
motherhood, is hotter than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers, it seems, want to know this woman. They idolize and they criticize, 
and then they keep watching to see what she'll do next. For a brief time 
earlier this year, ABC featured Ferrare in three time slots. 
</P>
<P>
She has been co-host, with Steve Edwards, of "A.M. Los Angeles" for five years 
-- a job she negotiated during the DeLorean trial. Then with John Davidson she 
co-hosted "Incredible Sunday," since canceled, and in January she joined Robb 
Weller as co-host of the nationally syndicated "Home Show." She returns to 
"A.M." and "Home Show" today after a five-week maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she's mulling over the possibility of making room for a television series, 
written for and starring herself. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the shows is going to have to go," she says. "And I'm so . . . I love 
what I'm doing. I love doing 'A.M.,' and I really, really enjoy doing the 'Home 
Show.' I'm in a personal dilemma. . . . I'm in a transition period. I don't 
know what I am going to do yet." 
</P>
<P>
A quiet happiness spreads across Ferrare's face. These days it seems to be an 
abundance of good fortune, opened doors and yet-to-be-tested opportunities that 
occupy her time. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism still hurts, she says, but it doesn't cripple. Even when it comes 
from DeLorean, a man who since their divorce has publicly accused her of 
selfishness, treachery and stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care anymore. My husband loves me. I love him. We're happy. I don't 
care what people think." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Ferrare makes a loud, taunting noise with her lips. Brrrrrr. 
</P>
<P>
It is addressed to her detractors, the former friends, the hypocrites, the 
National Enquirer, the millions of Americans who wanted to know, "How dare 
she?" 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Cristina Ferrare was an international supermodel, a 23-year-old pulling 
down $3,500 for a shoot, when she married John DeLorean, flashy and brash and 
24 years her senior. 
</P>
<P>
It was her second marriage -- a three-year union with personal manager Nick 
Thomas had ended in divorce -- and DeLorean's third. The date was May 8, 1973, 
three weeks after he submitted his resignation to General Motors with plans to 
manufacture his own luxury sports car. 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean brought his 14-month-old son, Zachary, into the marriage, and six 
years later, Ferrare gave birth to the couple's daughter, Kathryn. 
</P>
<P>
"We were like the golden couple," Ferrare says. "We were living the high life. 
We were living in New York. We were invited everywhere and did things and then 
we fell from grace. I mean, we were a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare's friends, the same ones she had kissed and gossiped with at countless 
parties, found the DeLorean affair unseemly. There were scenes straight out of 
Tom Wolfe's novel, "The Bonfire of the Vanities." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them, in the first few days after the arrest, they all wanted to be 
in the know," Ferrare says. "So they all rallied around and then, once we got 
into it -- you know, it dragged on for two years before it went to court -- 
slowly, I would say 90% of the people we knew in New York, we never heard from 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Weitzman, Ferrare's best friend and the wife of the attorney who 
defended DeLorean, recalls a trip to an exclusive spa during that time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Avoided Ferrare 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we went to the spa," Weitzman says, "and there were women who 
literally stayed on the other side of the swimming pool because they didn't 
want to deal with Cristina." 
</P>
<P>
But the real world, the world outside of New York high society, couldn't hear 
or read enough about the DeLoreans. Newspapers and television stations assigned 
reporters to chronicle Ferrare's apparent dress-for-acquittal strategy being 
played out on the fifth floor of the federal courthouse in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Would her new, more conservative hair style win favor with the jurors? The 
serious yet striking look was in. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasn't that stupid?" Ferrare asks, mildly annoyed. "I mean, my husband is 
arrested on a serious crime. My whole life falls apart, and all they could care 
about was writing about what I was wearing and what I looked like. Nobody ever 
cared about how it affected the children and how it affected me, how it 
affected John, our life, our marriage. No one cared about that." 
</P>
<P>
And as for DeLorean, she says: "I staunchly believed in his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, even though there is no love lost between either of us, I can say 
that John neither conspired nor talked about buying or selling cocaine. They 
just got him on the wrong deal." 
</P>
<P>
(DeLorean was later acquitted on the drug charges, as well as separate charges 
of fraud, racketeering and income-tax evasion in a federal case in Detroit and 
is still embroiled in legal disputes stemming from his defunct DeLorean Motor 
Co. of Northern Ireland.) 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrare says the evidence presented in the Los Angeles trial, tapes of her 
husband meeting with undercover FBI agents and informants, revealed his private 
lies. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember going to dinner with these people," she says. "These people were 
undercover agents -- we had no idea -- and this, this drug dealer, people who 
carry guns. And I felt betrayed (later). . . . He involves me in this whole 
thing with people that I didn't know who they were or what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
"He put me in a situation where my life could have been in danger, or 
implicated me, or involved me in some way. I didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Marriage a Sham' 
</P>
<P>
And it was toward the end of the trial, Ferrare says, "when I realized that my 
marriage was a sham, our relationship was not what I had thought it was and 
that basically he lied to me for 12 years. And I guess the hardest thing that I 
had to deal with was that I really don't believe that he loved me when we 
married." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare pauses, and then her voice takes on an even more determined edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that John is a sociopath," she says. "John used me, and used his own 
flesh and blood to be able to attain or to get what he wanted. And he didn't 
hesitate to use any of us in any way for his own personal gain. It was a very 
hard thing for me to admit. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't think to this day that John has any idea how it affected me 
and how it psychologically affected the children. He doesn't understand it. He 
doesn't see it. And I think it's because he's incapable of seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
The words stop. Ferrare's shoulders rise slightly as she takes a deep breath. 
Later she says it felt good, cathartic almost. "I haven't talked about all this 
in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a strong person," she says. "I have a great constitution. I love to laugh. 
Laughter and humor are great healers. That helps. 
</P>
<P>
"And Tony has been a great healer for me because I have him to fall back on and 
he is there for me. . . . I have emerged a whole new person, with a better 
attitude about life. And I'm not even mad at John anymore. He can't push my 
buttons anymore." 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean, who describes himself as a born-again Christian who spends most of 
his time with other Christians, was reached by telephone at his 430-acre New 
Jersey estate. (He got the real estate; she got the kids.) 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the pressures of his trial for the break-up of his marriage to 
Ferrare and wondered about the suddenness of her marriage to Thomopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't leave somebody one day and then the new guy moves in the next day 
and not know that person," DeLorean said. "But that doesn't bother me. I 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, and Pat Robertson has said this, when I was in the middle of that 
government frame-up, that it is normal for couples to break up when they are 
going through such a stressful situation. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, she has become hostile to me," DeLorean said of the woman he 
has described as "a painting who was hanging on my wall." 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand is why." 
</P>
<P>
It is the following day, almost noon on a Wednesday, and Ferrare is racing her 
Jeep Wagoneer through the immaculately groomed streets of Beverly Hills. The 
happy ramblings of daughter Alexandra, 2 1/2, drift up from the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare has been on maternity leave for not quite three weeks, but she's been 
getting a little antsy. Right now, she's about to do lunch with a friend. Then 
it's on to Alexandra's tumbling class. Yesterday it was shopping. Tomorrow, 
another lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The car phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Angel," Ferrare coos. "I'm on my way to lunch with the girls." 
</P>
<P>
Then she starts. Ferrare and her husband have had this conversation before. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go back to work," she tells Thomopoulos. "I want to get out there. I 
feel the need to get back. . . . Well, I can't lose 32 pounds in a week!" 
</P>
<P>
OK, they'll talk later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misses Partners, Staff 
</P>
<P>
"I feel responsible, you know," Ferrare says later. "I have two partners. We 
are a team. I have producers, and staff. They are all terrific. I love them. 
And I miss them. I like working." 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrare says Thomopoulos, 50, "is stuck between the old world and the new." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, when she first mentioned the idea of returning to work earlier 
than the planned five weeks, they fought. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'You're not going,' " Ferrare explains. "And I say, 'What do you 
mean, I'm not going? What are you, my father?' And he says, 'No, dammit, I'm 
your husband and you just had a baby and you're not going!' 
</P>
<P>
"And I went, 'OK, I'm not going.' And I'm thinking, 'Whoooa, is that different 
for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the dispute lingered, good-naturedly, until Ferrare's obstetrician finally 
sided with Thomopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare says she finds the whole thing amusing and endearing -- "I'm stuck 
between the old world and the new (myself)" -- and believes that her husband 
has her best interests at heart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calmer Now 
</P>
<P>
She's calmer these days, Ferrare says, at ease and unthreatened. It shows in 
her children, she says, and it shows in her marriage, which she describes as a 
passionate partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it was love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare says she and Thomopoulos met in 1978, when she traveled to New York to 
talk about possibly filling in on "Good Morning, America." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a pompous ass and he thought I was a rich bitch," Ferrare 
says. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't get the job. 
</P>
<P>
Their paths crossed several times after that, but Ferrare says it wasn't until 
shortly after the DeLorean trial that she and Thomopoulos got together at the 
50th birthday party of a mutual friend in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sitting at a table, alone, and he's standing up, and he was with a date, 
and he just happened to catch my eye. And I looked at him, and I said, 'Would 
you care to dance?' Because I'm sitting there all by myself, and I felt like a 
jerk. And he said, 'No.' And I went, 'Oh, fine. What an ass this guy is, you 
know. I hate him.' " 
</P>
<P>
But a few moments later, Thomopoulos had second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like in the movies," Ferrare says. "It was so melodramatic. He turns 
around, and as he turns around, the moonlight was hitting his face. And he 
looked so gorgeous standing there, and I thought, 'God, what a handsome man.' 
And he came over to me, and says, 'Yes, I would like to dance.' " 
</P>
<P>
So they danced. Ferrare liked his cologne and she liked him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like chemistry. I really felt weak in the knees. . . . And as he was 
holding me, I knew that I was in trouble because I was extremely attracted to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare says that both she and Thomopoulos were separated from their spouses at 
the time, although neither was yet divorced. 
</P>
<P>
They met a short time later for what she says was their first date, dinner at a 
small restaurant in Manhattan. Their first kiss, Ferrare says, came in the back 
of a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"We kissed for the first time and he said, 'I love you. I want to marry you and 
I want you to have my babies.' And I thought, 'This guy is sick. We are both 
old people and he wants to have babies!' " 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrare says she was already enraptured, even though she was still in the 
throes of the DeLorean scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there was a chemistry. I mean, you know, I wanted to have sex with 
him. I didn't want to marry him!" 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare, the girl from Cleveland, and Thomopoulos, the boy from the Bronx, 
married each other about six months later in a private ceremony at the home of 
a friend in Beverly Hills. They will celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
When the producers of "A.M. Los Angeles" and the "Home Show" try to put their 
finger on Ferrare's viewer appeal, they tend to fall back on what she is not. 
</P>
<P>
She is not, they say, Barbara Walters, or Joan Lunden and certainly not Diane 
Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
On the air, Ferrare talks about her children, her marriage, her indigestion and 
her sex life. She laughs, a lot, and sometimes she even cries. Not long ago, 
she was so offended by Michael Edwards, who wrote "Priscilla, Elvis &amp; Me: 
In the Shadow of the King," that she walked off the set of "A.M. Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"She'll be sitting there, and all of a sudden she is talking about how she 
sometimes shaves her upper lip because hair grows there," says Steve Edwards, 
Ferrare's "A.M." co-host and friend. "Now, I don't think Barbara Walters would 
ever talk about that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"She is salt of the earth. People relate to her. . . . In a way, it's like she 
represents them. She is as they would be if they were as beautiful, if they 
were as talented. I think that she has a special kind of magnetism. I think she 
has lived a bit of a soap opera in public. But more than that, she seems very 
accessible in terms of her life. She is very, exceedingly honest on the air." 
</P>
<P>
And Ferrare says it is that very openness that can get her into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who are truly annoyed with it," she says. "I get 
negative mail. 'I'm pushy. I'm too loud. I should keep my opinions to myself. 
I'm stupid. I don't know what I'm saying.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm sure Phil Donahue gets the same thing, although I'm sure they don't 
say he's stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare laughs at that one, but not too heartily. Yes, she says, the idea that 
she is a jet-setting bimbo, all show and no substance, still bothers her. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get 100 letters just, 'I love you. Terrific. You're funny. You make my 
day. You cure my allergies. I can walk again.' I mean, all kinds of things. And 
then I get one letter saying that you should get her off the air, she 
interrupts too much, she's got a loud mouth. I don't like her. She's too fat, 
all kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
"And this one letter used to destroy me. It doesn't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Weitzman, who aside from being Ferrare's best friend is an associate 
producer on "A.M. Los Angeles," says that before she knew Ferrare, she, too, 
was prepared to dislike her. 
</P>
<P>
"She is much more Beverly Hills than I am," Weitzman says. "She loves 
everything frilly and with bows. She oohs and ahhs over presents. We are 
complete opposites that way. But we are in sync on another level. And she's 
given me a softer edge." 
</P>
<P>
Thomopoulos says his wife has done that for him too, making him "a more open 
human being," albeit by embarrassing him somewhat in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see me, I'm blushing," he says in a telephone interview during 
which he confirmed Ferrare's account of their first dance and, later, their 
first kiss. 
</P>
<P>
(Thomopoulos, however, describes their meeting in 1978 this way: "She walked 
into the office and I saw this rather attractive, officious-looking woman, very 
elegant and so forth, and I was very busy and I said, 'Now, what does this 
dilettante want?' ") 
</P>
<P>
"There is no guile to Cristina," Thomopoulos adds. "There are no two sides to 
her. If she doesn't like you, she will tell you directly. If you ask her a 
personal question, she will tell you directly. . . . There is this uncensored 
quality about her." 
</P>
<P>
And Woody Frazier, producer of the "Home Show," says that when somebody is as 
forthright as Ferrare is on the air, "they're going to be a lot of people who 
say they don't believe that. 
</P>
<P>
"Cristina is the kind of person who I would think is misread by a lot of women 
out there. A lot of women probably think she is this rich bitch. She is not. 
She is just the reverse. And, as you begin to watch her, you realize that she 
is this real person, this genuine individual." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she has just grown into Cristina," Weitzman adds. "She is not Mrs. 
John DeLorean, not Mrs. Tony Thomopoulos. She is Cristina Ferrare."

SURPRISINGLY, EXHIBITS OF NUDES STILL CAUSE SOME ANXIETY LOCALLY

The way our bodies look is central to our lives. As infants, we explored them; 
as children, we were curious about the way they differed from our siblings'; as 
adolescents, we monitored them for signs of puberty. Even as adults, we spend a 
remarkable amount of time scrutinizing them for signs of age or fitness or 
sexual appeal. 
</P>
<P>
So it isn't surprising that the human body has occupied a central place in the 
history of Western art. The tradition of the nude, dating back to the sculpture 
of the ancient Greeks, has continued in the sculpture, painting and photography 
of our own time. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising -- especially in an age of explicit advertising imagery, 
movies and television shows -- is the prudishness that grips some people when 
they come face to face with nudity in art. But several recent events suggest an 
undercurrent of anxiety about the subject in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, after adverse remarks by the public, a painting of a nude 
male figure was removed from a prominent position in Newport Beach City Hall 
and banished to an office. Last week, when the Orange County Center for 
Contemporary Art announced the June opening of its new satellite gallery at 
Hutton Centre in Santa Ana, the good news was tempered by Hutton Development 
Co.'s requirement that the art contain no nude or political subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
And during the past couple of months, teachers at two Orange County elementary 
schools -- Meadow Park in Irvine and Stoneybrooke Christian in Mission Viejo -- 
have decided not to allow their students to tour the David Park exhibition at 
the Laguna Art Museum because several of the paintings in the show are of male 
and female unclothed figures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I don't want kids to understand that artists paint nudes," said 
Sherry Morel, Stoneybrooke's administrator. "But we're a Christian school and 
our values are such that nudity in any form, even though it might be considered 
art by some, is inappropriate for our students to be exposed to. . . . If 
children see an abstract male nude with a penis (in a museum), that does not 
allow us to train them in the context of character development. . . . The 
bottom line is, things having to do with sex education or human anatomy we're 
attempting to keep in the context of family discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the special concerns of a religious school, however, the central 
issue seems to be how to keep the most obviously curiosity-provoking aspect of 
the art -- the sight of naked people -- from dominating a child's 
interpretation of the work and crowding out its aesthetic virtues. 
</P>
<P>
That is a ticklish problem, particularly for adolescents, and its implications 
are not restricted to art. I can remember quite vividly watching a modern-dance 
company perform in tights on the stage of my junior high school. My eyes were 
riveted to the crotches of the male dancers, revealed in surprising 
three-dimensionality by their tights. That unintentional spectacle frankly 
overwhelmed any other thoughts I might have had about the performance -- which 
was never discussed or explained in any way by the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with nude subjects in art in a fruitful way does not mean turning a 
museum experience into an illustrated lecture on sexual function. Nor does it 
mean prudishly pretending that sexuality was of no concern to the artist. 
Rather, a good teacher or museum docent frankly acknowledges an artist's 
fascination with the shapes and textures and colors of the human body, and 
explains how this raw material became the stuff of an imaginative work of art. 
</P>
<P>
For Park, the lines and curves and postures of the human body were an endlessly 
intriguing subject. In his painting, "Bather With Knee Up," a boy stands in 
profile with his hands resting on his upraised right thigh. This stance clearly 
reveals his penis; in fact, Park even calls attention to it with a thick stroke 
of paint in a flesh-color lighter than the boy's thighs. 
</P>
<P>
Park also emphasizes the shape of the boy's buttocks with a couple of swipes of 
bright orange paint. Another vertical line brings the eye to the inner curve of 
the thigh. Still another thick brush stroke dwells on the curve of his left 
hand. Deft black brush strokes delineate the recess of his left ear, the 
placement of his lower lip and the patch of shadow under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Although the boy is recognizable as a naked human being standing in front of a 
pool rimmed with trees, Park felt free to emphasize certain areas of his body 
and downplay others because he was interested in setting up visual rhymes and 
rhythms -- lines and curves creating abstract harmonies that are both related 
to the way the body really looks and compelling for their own sake. That's the 
sort of information that children -- or anybody else -- needs to understand 
what the painting is really about. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna museum, docent chairman Gail Waters said that children viewing 
the Park exhibit "normally go straight to the painting that has the nude." But 
docents "simply explain that artists have been painting nude human figures 
since the beginning of time." The focus of their informal question-and-answer 
sessions is on "art in its context, on the figure as sort of a vehicle for the 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
For younger children, Waters said, the issue of nudes in art is "even easier 
because they (aren't aware of) the problems of their parents' hang-ups yet." 
</P>
<P>
Fear of provocation or contamination by art runs deep, particularly in people 
who have little contact with or knowledge of art. Interestingly, male nudity 
seems to inspire even more worry and alarm than the female variety, and in any 
case it has come to be considerably rarer. Although there have been great 
representations of male nudes in the history of art (like the Apollo Belvedere 
and Michelangelo's "David"), since the Renaissance, "a nude" has come to mean a 
female nude. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "The Nude," art historian Kenneth Clark ventured two opinions: 
that the popularity of the female nude possibly has to do with its possession 
of more "satisfying" geometric forms, and that "the tug of normal sensuality" 
among male artists eventually gave pride of place to the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
The feminist viewpoint is, bluntly, that heterosexual men have ensured -- by 
virtue of their power in society -- that objects of their sexual desire receive 
primary scrutiny as such in works of art. It also seems entirely possible that 
the distress that male nudes cause some audiences may have to do with a 
homophobic undercurrent in our society. 
</P>
<P>
But in an art-world context, shunning works as innocent as nudes -- for any 
reason, at any age -- is the mark of a provincial mentality. One of the 
benchmarks of Orange County's maturity as a regional cultural center will be 
reached when columns like this are no longer written.

A gatekeeper said today that he refused police orders to open an outer gate and

were crushed to death. Fans and officials said police opened the barrier.

South Yorkshire police, who were in charge of Saturday's club semifinal at 
Hillsborough stadium, came under mounting attack as Liverpool ordered a week of

Fans and officials said officers responded inadequately and far too slowly when 
spectators were crushed against a steel anti-riot fence in a standing-room-only 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Gatekeeper Jack Stone told the Yorkshire Post that he refused police orders to 
open a 16-foot-wide outer gate. Survivors said about 4,000 fans outside were 
pushing at turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
Stone would not confirm survivors' reports that police officers opened the 
concertina gate. But he told the newspaper: "You know as well as anyone whose 
fault it was."

DIB SUPPORTS BERNARDI IN RUNOFF 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, facing a June 6 runoff against 
firefighter Lyle Hall in the northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District, 
picked up a key supporter today: Al Dib, a prominent businessman who finished 
third in last week's primary. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Bernardi, the council dean with 28 years there, also announced 
at a City Hall press conference that, if reelected, he will not run for another 
term in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi finished first in the primary with 42% of the vote but fell short of 
the 50%-plus-one vote required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who finished 
second with 26%. Dib, former president of the Arleta Chamber of Commerce, 
received 12% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he is not running again after this term, which tells me he will not 
owe developers and special interest groups anything," Dib said of Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Dib, the only Republican in the nonpartisan race, is expected to sway business 
and GOP support to Democrat Bernardi.

Authorities today identified the man found dead in his Mission Viejo home 
Sunday as David Werner, 72, a retired stockbroker. He died from suffocation and 
multiple stab wounds to the upper body, according to the results of a 
preliminary autopsy released this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Werner was found dead in his bedroom about 1 a.m. Sunday morning by his 
40-year-old daughter Deborah, who also lives at the home. (Story, Part II, Page 
3.) 
</P>
<P>
Werner's single-family home in the 27000 block of El Moro was ransacked, but 
there was no sign of forced entry. Police have not yet determined anything 
missing, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and his daughter moved to the quiet residential Mission Viejo 
neighborhood about a year ago.

AIRCRAFT CRASHES AS DRUG KINGPIN LEAPS ABOARD; WOULD-BE ESCAPEE AND PILOT

A helicopter plucked a drug kingpin from a prison yard today but crashed as it 
took off, seriously injuring the inmate and the pilot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter went down about 10 a.m. after a propeller caught concertina wire 
atop the wall at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin (Barry) Kramer, a champion powerboat racer serving a life sentence, 
and the pilot, whose identity was not immediately known, were taken to Jackson 
Memorial Hospital after the escape attempt, U.S. Marshal Daniel Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Prison guards immediately extracted Kramer and the pilot out of the wreckage 
and administered first aid. They were hurt quite seriously," Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, they were taken by helicopter to the hospital,"' Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that the pilot suffered head, neck and back injuries 
and that Kramer, 34, fractured his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan is the major prison for drug traffickers and others arrested for 
federal crimes in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Among about 1,000 inmates are Miami policemen convicted of running a drug 
rip-off ring and others convicted of large-scale cocaine and marijuana 
trafficking or awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Warden John Clark said that the helicopter reportedly hovered just above the 
recreation yard and that Kramer grabbed onto a ski and was either climbing into 
the craft or was aboard when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said a second inmate may have tried to climb aboard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears he was ready," Clark said. "According to witnesses, he ran to the 
helicopter and jumped on as soon as it swooped down." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot carried an identification for Charles Clayton Sterns, but the warden 
said authorities suspect that the ID may have been intended for Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was convicted in October in Illinois federal court of running a 
continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life without parole under 
the "drug kingpin" law, Horgan said. Kramer was moved here in December in 
connection with federal charges in Florida for distribution of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was exercising in a part of the prison reserved for escape risks, 
including anyone serving a life term. 
</P>
<P>
The wrecked helicopter was a two-seat Bell-model bubble type.

COURT TO RULE ON FOREIGN SEARCHES BY U.S. AGENTS

<P>
The Supreme Court, in a case involving a notorious Mexican drug-smuggling 
operation, agreed today to decide whether U.S. law enforcement agents need a 
warrant before searching on foreign soil someone who is not an American 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it will hear Bush Administration arguments that U.S. agents did 
not violate the Constitution when, without a warrant, they searched the home of 
a suspected Mexican drug smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Verdugo Urquidez was convicted in California last year of taking part in 
the 1985 kidnaping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration agent 
Enrique Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo, identified as a top lieutenant to Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro 
Quintero, is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life. He is not eligible for 
parole for 59 years, when he would be 96. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo's conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue in the case 
the Supreme Court acted on today. His appeal centered on a separate 
drug-smuggling conviction. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals properly suppressed 
evidence obtained by the DEA in its search of Verdugo's Mexicali, Mexico, home 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo was arrested by Mexican police in 1986 and was turned over to U.S. 
authorities in California. 
</P>
<P>
While he was awaiting trial, the DEA got permission from Mexican authorities to 
search the home. The agents seized a tally sheet they said shows the quantities 
of marijuana smuggled into the United States by Verdugo. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in California ruled that the evidence is inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
In another case today, the court rejected a challenge to a rule that generally 
requires Los Angeles county court employees to speak only English while at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The justices instructed the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the 
case after being told that Alva Gutierrez, the woman who challenged the rule, 
no longer works for the county court. 
</P>
<P>
The rule was adopted in 1984. It bars court employees from speaking any 
language other than English except when acting as translators or during breaks 
and lunchtime.

MERCEDES MCCAMBRIDGE'S SON'S NOTE EXONERATED HER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter found at his suicide scene, the son of actress Mercedes McCambridge 
exonerated her of any wrongdoing in his investment thefts from a Little Rock 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"Guilty: John Markle traded your account on an undisclosed discretionary basis. 
I added funds to your account, I added losses to the Stephens account," said 
John Markle in a letter to his mother about his trading practices at Stephens 
Inc. of Little Rock. "Innocent: You are clearly innocent of any wrongdoing in 
this matter. I am 100% responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Markle, 45, a broker with Stephens, killed his wife, Christine; his two 
daughters, Amy and Suzanne, and himself in their Little Rock home on Nov. 16, 
1987, police said. All of the victims, including Markle, were shot more than 
once. Police said Markle apparently wore a Halloween-type mask during some of 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Markle's letter and other documents found at his house by police investigating 
his death became public today at the state Supreme Court when the court 
dissolved a stay that had been in effect while it considered his mother's 
attempt to keep the documents from public disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
The court previously had denied her petition, but she had requested a 
rehearing. Today, the petition for a rehearing was denied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters, Diary Pages 
</P>
<P>
Documents in the file included a 13-page handwritten letter by Markle to the 
Academy Award-winning actress, pages from a diary he kept in a spiral notebook, 
letters to his lawyer and miscellaneous papers. 
</P>
<P>
The diary makes clear that in the month leading up to his suicide, Markle was 
engaged in negotiations with Stephens over how much he should pay the firm for 
his mishandling of investments that had the effect of transferring money from 
Stephens' account to his mother's account. 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the deaths, a diary entry said Markle had asked his mother 
for cash, saying he would probably be sued, ruined and eventually end up in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The diary said Stephens was demanding cash payment of about $1 million by 
Markle in the discussions about his handling of the account. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the deaths, Markle went to a gun shop to determine the value 
of weapons he owned. He left a list of weapons and the value of each for his 
attorney. It was found after Markle's death. 
</P>
<P>
Markle also was conscious of his moods, including them in diary entries, and 
often thought in terms of relying on God to help him get through his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy entries included: "Anxious about all this now," "Uncertain today. I awoke 
at 5:30 and was scared. I turned it over to God and went back to sleep until 
6:30 to take Suz to school." 
</P>
<P>
A diary entry on Oct. 27, 1987, said: "My wife Christine is the greatest woman 
alive and my children are the very, very best. Amy got an A in algebra because 
she knew it would make me happy. Suz is such a upward-looking person. None of 
these people deserve me. I have put all of their futures in jeopardy. My 
relationship with my mother has been destroyed. I fear I have placed my family 
at considerable financial risk, i.e., I am broke and they (my) children have no 
inheritance left because of my action. Christine says I have put the family 
last and I have. There really is only one choice now."

the West Bank, at a funeral for a teen-age boy shot the previous day, 
Palestinians said. It was the third death in the camp in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials confirmed the girl died from a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jabalya refugee camp resident died of complications from paralysis 
after entering Mokassed Hospital two weeks ago with severe head and neck trauma 
from an army beating, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sons of 56-year-old Fares Mohamed Salah in Jabalya said soldiers who had been 
chasing stone-throwers savagely beat their father on the stairs to their 
basement last March 27 and then left him there unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
A protest broke out near the camp, which was under curfew, when the body was 
brought and prepared for burial. Troops shot Kaed Mousa Salameh, 13, in the 
ensuing clash. He died later of blood loss and was buried before Salah. 
</P>
<P>
Angered Jabalya residents broke curfew and marched through the streets of the 
sprawling camp carrying flags and shouting nationalist slogans, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Troops shot tear gas and bullets to disperse them, wounding at least three 
protesters, hospitals reported. 
</P>
<P>
In other clashes with demonstrators in the Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded 
five Palestinians in Abasan and Beit Hanoun villages. 
</P>
<P>
The army lifted most curfews in the Gaza Strip that it held on all 650,000 
residents on Sunday to stem violence on a Palestinian "day of rage" marking the 
year since the killing of PLO leader Khalil Wazir. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli commandos are widely believed to have shot Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, 
in his Tunis home. Israel had held that the Palestine Liberation Organization 
military chief was the mastermind behind the uprising.

A poll of 800 California voters shows widespread support for stricter measures 
to curb illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border, a group that 
commissioned the survey said today. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine percent of Californians surveyed said they favored strict limits on 
the number of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 60% supported a government plan to build a four-mile 
drainage ditch along the border in San Diego County to thwart Mexican motorists 
who speed across the desert to enter the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The Federation for American Immigration Reform commissioned the poll, which was 
conducted April 6-9 by Tarrance &amp; Associates of Houston.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has officially rejected a Soviet request to

today.

The Soviet Electronic Industry Ministry asked Matsushita in late 1987 to start 
local VCR production by assembling such finished parts as cylinders exported 
from Japan, the officials said.

The Supreme Court agreed today to settle some key questions involving the 
ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
What the justices decide sometime next year in a California case could have 
big-money significance for most states and many big businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, granting an appeal by California officials, said they will review 
a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to challenge a state tax 
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the justices held that 
California may tax multinational corporations based on the businesses' 
worldwide income. 
</P>
<P>
But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent company is 
located in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The case acted on today involves multinationals whose parent company is based 
in a foreign country.

AUSTRALIAN QINTEX BOARD APPROVES PURCHASE OF MGM-UA FOR $1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia-owned Qintex Entertainment Inc. announced today that its board of 
directors unanimously approved the $1-billion acquisition of MGM-UA 
Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, in essence, will split the present MGM-UA company, and leave majority 
shareholder Kirk Kerkorian in control of the MGM portion of the business. 
</P>
<P>
The renamed United Artists Corp. would be the first big American motion picture 
studio to pass into foreign hands. Australian-turned-U.S. citizen Rupert 
Murdoch owns 20th Century Fox Film Corp. through his News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have turned their attention on Hollywood to prepare for the 
deregulation of European television in 1992 and for new international satellite 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
"The consolidation of United Artists with Qintex Entertainment will create a 
formidable new company with strength in filmed entertainment production and 
worldwide distribution, and one of the largest and most attractive feature film 
libraries in the world," said Christopher C. Skase, chairman of Qintex Group of 
Australia, parent company of Qintex Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment is a TV production company that financed part of the CBS 
miniseries "Lonesome Dove" and is the nation's largest independent production 
and distribution organization in the TV entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
United Artists, one of seven major film studios in the world, holds the rights 
to such films as "The Pink Panther," the James Bond series and Rocky films. The 
company recently has released box office hits including Oscar-winning "Rain 
Man," "Moonstruck," and "A Fish Called Wanda" and is producer of television's 
"thirtysomething" and "In the Heat of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
MGM-UA lost $39.5 million in the first quarter of its 1989 fiscal year. The 
loss was attributed to increased interest expense and high write-offs on movies 
in production and already released.

Apple Computer Inc. will work toward cultivating a low-end, less pricey 
Macintosh personal computer for the office environment, the company's chief 
executive officer told a user conference today. 
</P>
<P>
John Sculley said managers and office workers can use the versatile Macintosh 
for functions as diverse as designing graphics or linking all company employees 
on an electronic mail network. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from a machine that was a curiosity and excited the imagination to a 
machine with full functionality," Sculley told a conference aimed specifically 
at business users of Macintosh, first introduced by the Cupertino, Calif., 
company in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's top manager said creating inexpensive and smaller Macintosh models that 
can perform the same office tasks as the most powerful version now available 
will be a top priority for the $4-billion company in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley speculated that the inexpensive machines of the '90s, as powerful as 
today's high-end models, will be priced between $1,500 and $2,000. Versions of 
the powerful Macintosh IIx currently cost more than $7,500 each.

Thomas Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and his

U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg allowed Gioiosa, 31, to remain free on bond. 
If convicted, Gioiosa could face maximum penalties of 38 years in prison and $2 
million in fines. 
</P>

The five-count federal indictment accuses Gioiosa of income-tax evasion for the 
years 1985 and '86, and charges that he conspired to arrange cocaine deliveries 
from Florida to Cincinnati between January, 1985, and January, 1987.

Mike Greenwell hit a two-run homer as the Boston Red Sox rallied for five runs 
in the eighth inning today to beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles scored two runs in the ninth but fell short in their bid to win 
consecutive games on the road for the first time since August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Burks led off the Boston eighth with a triple off Brian Holton, 1-2, who 
replaced starter Jose Bautista at the start of the seventh. Greenwell then hit 
his fourth homer of the season, a 420-foot blast into the bleachers in right 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rice followed with a single that extended his hitting streak to 11 games. 
Danny Heep singled one out later, sending pinch runner Randy Kutcher to third 
and knocking Holton out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Mark Williamson then walked Jody Reed and Rick Cerone to force in a 
run. Williamson was replaced by Kevin Hickey, who struck out Wade Boggs before 
giving up a two-run single to Marty Barrett that gave Boston a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles opened the ninth with three consecutive singles off Lee Smith, 1-1, 
who replaced starter Wes Gardner in the eighth. The third single, by Randy 
Milligan, drove in Cal Ripken and made it 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stanley relieved Smith and got Francisco Melendez on a fielder's choice 
before pinch-hitter Jim Traber made it 6-4 with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley then earned his second save by retiring Rene Gonzales on a game-ending 
fielder's choice. Gardner went seven innings, allowing four hits and matching 
his career high with eight strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first on a double by Barrett, a pair of walks and 
a sacrifice fly by Rice.

In case the New York Mets did not quite get the message from Davey Johnson's 
postgame meeting Sunday following their 5-3 loss to the Cardinals, Darryl 
Strawberry made it as unmistakable and emphatic as the two home runs he ripped 
in the game. Strawberry followed Johnson's outburst with a coarsely worded 
session with reporters in which he charged that his teammates are not taking 
their jobs seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys here act like we're in Little League," Strawberry said. "Just 
because we won last year can't help us this year. Some guys have got to start 
sacrificing. We're here to play ball, not play cards and golf. . . . You can 
play cards and all the golf you want in the winter. Maybe that's fine for 
relaxing, but when you're a last-place team, you should be thinking about 
getting the job done on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Strawberry exploded after the Mets had sunk to last place and five 
games out seemingly without any concern. The team is hitting .223, but when the 
Mets had an off day in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, nobody showed for extra 
hitting. Instead, several players hit the golf course, just as they had done 
after a short workout Monday. Many of them played as many as 45 holes. 
</P>
<P>
And their clubhouse before each game has the look of a back room to a poker 
hall, with games of casino, hearts and solitaire to be found for all. Fully 
one-third of the team are regular card players. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Johnson) has got a right to be (ticked) off," Strawberry said. "We didn't 
play well in spring training. Some guys didn't take spring training seriously. 
They took it as a joke. The same thing . . . is happening in the regular 
season. It's no joke. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to do something. . . . How embarrassed do you feel to be in last 
place after being National League East champs a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of how we approach the game. We feel intimidated. Guys feel 
like they can't get a hit. That's what it seems like. We should have won the 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like everybody's looking for me to do it all the time. Other guys 
have got to come through." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry has hit three home runs in the past two games and is batting .282. 
He does not play cards or golf.
