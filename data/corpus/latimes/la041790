<P>
The bleachers, barricades and rubberized guard rails have been set up along the 
course of this weekend's Grand Prix race through Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if someone can just remember to take down those 35 m.p.h. speed-limit 
signs on Shoreline Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Secessionist talk is spreading through L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington, whose dissidents have formed the New Wilmington Committee, is the 
latest province threatening to revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Like some malcontents in neighboring San Pedro, the Wilmingtonites claim their 
once-independent territory virtually was seized by L.A. earlier this century so 
that the city's harbor could be built. 
</P>
<P>
Other satellites speaking of declaring their independence include Westchester, 
Venice and Van Nuys. A Venice Town Council member said earlier this year that 
"Venice is a potential Poland" that could spark the revolt by the others. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, in the end, L.A. will shrink to its 19th-Century dimensions, and 
Western Avenue will no longer be a misnomer. It was once considered the western 
end of town. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought L.A.'s 72-year-old leader, Tom Bradley, was the county's oldest 
mayor, you weren't close. That honor went to La Canada Flintridge's Edmund J. 
Krause -- until Monday, when he retired at 88. Krause was, in fact, the 
nation's oldest mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The octogenarian was so full of energy that one of his daily customs was to 
drive through the city, taking pictures of potholes. The photos would then be 
sent to the county, along with a request for road-repair funds. 
</P>
<P>
Krause also headed the city with the longest name in the county, owing to the 
union of La Canada and Flintridge in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Headline writers would have preferred something along the lines of La Flintada. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's only right that Zsa Zsa Gabor perform some community service for the 
now famous cop-slapping incident. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not forget that she has some public service saved up. 
</P>
<P>
Surely you remember that in 1958 she served as chairman -- there was no such 
thing as a chairwoman back then -- of the holiday traffic campaign sponsored by 
the Greater Los Angeles Safety Council and the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
It was another side of Zsa Zsa -- friend of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
At an on-ramp to the Ventura Freeway, Marilyn Young passed a youth holding a 
handmade sign that declared: 
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
While film legend Greta Garbo tried to stay out of the limelight, the pioneer 
Swedish director who discovered her suffered through a peculiar kind of 
anonymity on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
His name was inscribed as "Maurice Diller" in 1960, occasioning semi-serious 
speculation that the plaque had perhaps been intended for Phyllis Diller or 
Barry Diller or Jerry Stiller. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, just before a visit by Sweden's royal family, that nation asked 
the Chamber of Commerce for a correction. The star was reinscribed as Mauritz 
Stiller.

Philippe's, the 82-year-old downtown cafe, claims that the French dip sandwich 
was invented on its premises in 1918. A customer's roll was dropped 
accidentally into a roasting pan, but he took it as was. The diner returned the 
next day and asked for his roll to be dunked again. The dish caught on. The 
customer, so the story goes, was a policeman called Frenchy.

THE DWP TIMID? YOU'RE KIDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is more than a little irony in the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power's being criticized for timidity in seeking new sources of water. Ever 
since the city grabbed the Owens River early in this century, Los Angeles has 
been branded as a water pirate. Even today, the mere words Owens Valley trigger 
outrage and fear. 
</P>
<P>
The department was faulted in an audit that the City Charter requires every 10 
years. The $1.2-million study by a consulting firm also said the department has 
relied too much on its membership in the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California for a backup source of supply. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows the city's water supply has dwindled in recent years, while 
demand has increased because of population growth. The department has at least 
worked with the Environmental Defense Fund and the Mono Lake Committee to 
replace water the city is losing in the Mono Basin for environmental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism of DWP for failing to develop major new water supplies reveals an 
ignorance of Southern California water development. In 1928, the city of Los 
Angeles became the major organizer and underwriter of the Metropolitan Water 
District for precisely that purpose -- initially to get water from the Colorado 
River and later, from Northern California via the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
MWD is short of water these days, too. So the city cannot draw unlimited water 
from MWD without causing considerable anxiety among other MWD customers like 
Orange County, and particularly San Diego County, which relies on Metropolitan 
for the bulk of its supplies. But Los Angeles also has invested $540 million of 
tax money in MWD since 1928 just so that it would have a fallback source of 
supply in the event of a dilemma such as it faces today. 
</P>
<P>
Answers to the region's water problems won't be found in ill-informed 
finger-pointing. Southern California officials have long agreed that importing 
additional water should be handled by a single agency, the MWD Water District. 
Should the Los Angeles DWP go out now in search of a major new source of water, 
the department would only find itself in competition with itself.

DANGERS OF OVERPOPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the article by Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich ("One Potentially 
Lethal Disease," Op-Ed Page, April 4), I cannot help but feel that it is ironic 
that we spend millions to aid the starving of the world when half of the time 
the food does not touch the hungry lips due to lack of transportation and 
communication in the rural areas, or the load goes to the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't we spend these dollars on educating the Third World countries with 
respect to birth control? Overpopulation, no matter where, is a global problem 
and that should be our main concern.

GASOLINE TAX

<TEXT>
<P>
I have always found the Reagan and Bush administrations' inability to logically 
distinguish between a tax and a user fee to be hilarious, in a sad and cynical 
sort of way. Apparently, if a Democrat wants to raise revenues, it's a tax. If 
a Republican wants to raise revenues, it's a user fee.

SCOFFLAW-ISM AS A GROWTH INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to unpaid parking tickets in Los Angeles, scofflaw-ism has become 
a growth industry. The last five years have seen a quarter of a billion dollars 
of unpaid penalties and fines accumulate as tens of thousands of drivers 
ignored millions of tickets. About one-third of that debt may be uncollectable 
for a number of reasons, high among them is a disturbing lack of information in 
Department of Motor Vehicles records about where the legal owners of the 
vehicles can be found. That still leaves more than $162 million in debt that 
probably could be captured. In the last year, though, only $4 million in 
delinquent fees were in fact collected. The city's failure to do better than 
that has meant an enormous revenue loss, the effect of which has been to 
deprive every resident of needed services -- for improved policing, say, or 
more adequate street repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, as reporter Penelope McMillan found, high officials seemed 
largely unaware of the magnitude of the problem until The Times began asking 
questions. Over the last five years, since parking enforcement passed from the 
Police Department to the city Department of Transportation, parking-ticket 
revenues quintupled to $90 million. A most satisfying increase, no doubt. But 
also, perhaps, an inducement to complacency. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as Parking Administrator Bob Yates acknowledges, is that "the 
system has been a bit archaic for many years." In truth, methods for tracking 
and collecting from violators -- a job now contracted by the city to a private 
firm -- are wholly inadequate. Part of the problem lies in Sacramento. The DMV 
is supposed to ensure payment of delinquent fines as a condition of vehicle 
registration renewal. But many vehicles owned by violators aren't registered. 
In other cases, owners' addresses prove to be out of date or even nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
With a little will and effort there are, of course, other ways to trace law 
breakers, just as there are ways to encourage greater compliance with parking 
laws. Right now, for example, the city makes no effort to prosecute serious 
violators, some of whom are responsible for more than 100 unpaid tickets. Yet 
it's obvious that the costs of more tenaciously pursuing parking-ticket 
scofflaws would be recouped many times over. The flaws in the system now stand 
revealed. What are city officials going to do about fixing them?

This was a very private choice. It is, therefore, very disturbing to hear 
bioethicists criticize that decision and those parents on suspiciously 
unbecoming grounds. 
</P>
<P>
If it is wrong to have more than one child or a large family in order to 
protect the family unit, civilization has had it wrong since man moved off of 
the savannah and into caves. For billions of people throughout the world and 
for a million years before there was a lady bountiful or a welfare state, 
having many children was, and remains today, social security and child support 
and Meals on Wheels all rolled into one. If one child has to go to work in 
order that the family may eat and pay the rent or even so that siblings may go 
to school, is it any concern of professional do-gooders?

THIS IS A STORY OF TWO COUSINS, AND WHY THEY'LL NEVER MEET; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET EMIGRATION: MEANSPIRITEDNESS CRAWLS THE EARTH INTENT ON SMOTHERING 
JEWISH LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA OZICK, Cynthia Ozick is the author of numerous articles, critical 
essays and books. Her latest is The Shawl (Knopf, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is about my two boy cousins: Imri, 14, born into Hebrew's native landscape 
in sun-dazzled Jerusalem, and Alexander, 13, born into mellifluous Russian in 
snowy Moscow. As a citizen of Israel, Imri grew up without a minute's worth of 
domestic anti-Semitism, whether from government or gutter. Alexander has lived 
with both kinds since the day of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
Though separated by distance, language and social experience, Imri and 
Alexander appear to be close -- very close, in fact -- at least in age. But 
even here they are divided. Imri, who will always be thought of as a galloping 
boy of 14, would now be a young man of 22 if Yasser Arafat's gunmen had not 
murdered him on the Tel Aviv coastal road a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Neither boy ever knew of the other's existence. Yet my two boy cousins, who at 
first glance have nothing in common -- one is in Moscow, the other in his grave 
-- might have met one day and learned of their connection. To tell the truth, 
they are connected even now, though not by their undiscovered cousinship. What 
is the connection? Official Arab meanspiritedness -- a meanspiritedness so vast 
that it crawls over a continent, from capital to capital, lobbying on behalf of 
smothering Jewish lives. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander and his mother have been attempting to emigrate from the Soviet 
Union, where as Jews they are beginning to feel more directly threatened -- 
physically endangered -- than ever before. In Moscow, Jewish gravestones have 
been vandalized and synagogue windows smashed. The anti-Semitic network that 
calls itself Pamyat (Memory), and arouses memories of czarist pogroms while 
promising fresh depredations, has been allowed to hold a rally in Red Square; 
one of its publications, the Journal of the Public Committee, charges the 
Israeli medical rescue of Armenian earthquake victims with having spread AIDS. 
And Mikhail Gorbachev has just appointed Valentin Rasputin, Pamyat's 
ideological mentor, to his new President's Council. In January, 30 Pamyat 
stalwarts yelling anti-Semitic fulminations through a bullhorn invaded a Moscow 
writers' meeting and pledged to come back "next time" with machine guns. In 
Leningrad, a Jew was found murdered in his flat, a Star of David cut into his 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that Alexander and his mother are being unnecessarily 
panicky. It is noteworthy that such pundits do not reside in the Soviet Union, 
nor have they heard (as I did this morning) Alexander's grandmother cry out on 
the telephone from Moscow, "Save my children! Save them! Save my children!" 
Unquestionably, my cousin Alexander is a boy who does not feel welcome or safe 
in the land of his birth. He and his family have done nothing to harm that land 
and have asked for no more than the right to live peacefully and productively. 
Alexander, you can be certain, has never thrown a single stone or Molotov 
cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander now has a chance -- in principle -- for exodus to freedom, genuine 
freedom, which for him means the opportunity to come to maturity in a 
democratic society where domestic anti-Semitism is unheard of. There is only 
one country in the world nowadays where no one, under any imaginable 
circumstance, no matter what the burden or what the crisis, will blame a Jew 
for being a Jew; only one country that has its arms out to Jews in travail 
without strings of any kind and with an unprecedented generosity of the spirit 
of haven. That country is Israel. And though the Soviet Union has told 
Alexander -- in principle -- that he can go wherever there is a polity willing 
to take him in, Alexander remains trapped in Moscow. A year ago, Soviet 
authorities promised direct flights from the Soviet Union to Tel Aviv; that 
promise is not being honored. 
</P>
<P>
And meanwhile Yasser Arafat, backed by official Arab consensus, moves from city 
to city across the face of Europe, an apparition of meanspirited roving, 
turning up here and here and here -- Romania, Austria, Czechoslovakia -- with 
the single-mindedly obdurate purpose of choking off the reunion of Jewish 
cousins, of setting up stumbling blocks before fleeing, of jamming stones into 
Alexander's passageway out of his Soviet tomb. 
</P>
<P>
One can ask why. The current lies are not acceptable. It is not because Arafat 
is afraid that Alexander will go to high school in Hebron or Nablus instead of 
in Tel Aviv. Arab officialdom has always been opposed to Jewish deliverance. I 
remember my grandmother's tears as she stood weeping into her Yiddish newspaper 
in our Bronx kitchen in 1939, literally beating her breast over the British 
"White Paper," a decree that sent ships crammed with desperate Jewish refugees 
back to Nazi Germany, and soon enough into the ovens -- a British brutality 
prompted by pressure from Arafat's predecessors in an identical campaign. There 
was no West Bank issue then. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is something different about this contemporary Arab 
meanspiritedness. After all, it is not 1939, and jubilant German cousins have 
broken through a wall of tyranny so that both family branches can know freedom. 
What is different now, I think, lies not so much in Arab resistance to Jewish 
reunion -- that is unchanged, and as bitter as ever -- as in an emerging 
psychological element. What the Arabs refused to do themselves -- the succor of 
their own cousins -- they will not allow anyone else to do. "Generosity is the 
flower of justice," Hawthorne wrote, and the Arabs, beginning in 1948, have 
accumulated a long record of withholding justice from their cousins. The newer 
politics of Palestinian nationalism may serve that record inthe Arab mind; but 
this repression was never more publicly evident than right now. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel at this very moment, there is singing and dancing at Ben-Gurion 
airport, and cakes and embraces, in celebration of the arrival of those Soviet 
Jews who have managed to leap over Arab-instigated obstacles to their journey. 
The refugee newcomers are flooded with flowers and bed linens and baby 
carriages and hot dinners and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, by contrast, dealt with their refugee cousins as if they were 
refuse, thrust them into inhumane camps and penned them there in misery for 
three generations, while opposing any attempt at amelioration from any 
direction. The object was to turn human beings into political instruments -- an 
object that has notably succeeded. As the Holocaust is Europe's 20th-Century 
shame, so are these used and abused cousins of the camps the Arabs' shame. 
</P>
<P>
"Selfishness is the only real atheism," Israel Zangwill said. To such 
clarifying wisdom one might add that selfishness is eager to spawn more 
selfishness. It is this uncharitable psychological element -- Arab shame (or 
perhaps shamelessness) over Arab ungenerosity -- that is incarnate in Arafat's 
malevolent scurryings from capital to capital as he tries to prevent Jews from 
saving their cousins. Here is Alexander's tragic connection with his cousin 
Imri. The Palestine Liberation Organization ordered Imri's murder; it was PLO 
thugs who cut the boy down. Now the PLO orders Alexander's entrapment; this 
time the thugs belong to Pamyat. But the desire to snuff out Jewish freedom is 
the same, and so is the source.

HERE'S AN IDEA TO FOOL WITH, AL;

<P>
RAIDERS: A STADIUM THAT TAKES TO THE HIGH SEAS BEARING THE PIRATE LOGO COULD 
SEEK TRIBUTE UP AND DOWN THE COAST. 
</P>

By HERB McLAUGHLIN, Herb McLaughlin is the managing partner of Kaplan 
McLaughlin Diaz, an architectural firm with offices in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco.

<TEXT>
<P>
Think a minute, Al. You may be able to save that Oakland deal yet. Why not 
propose a joint venture to build a floating stadium? Oakland has always been 
innovative. And this way the city can profit from your insatiable wanderlust. 
</P>
<P>
Al wants Oakland, in effect, to pay for a second stadium. So, why not build a 
new one that will give the city a big return on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
With a floating stadium, Al and Oakland could collect subsidies from more than 
16 waterside towns in the Bay Area in one season alone. But Al's never been 
limited by geography or tradition. Bluebeard had the islands of the Caribbean 
to raid. Oakland and Al could have all the coastal cities of California -- and 
perhaps Portland thrown in, too. 
</P>
<P>
And this approach wouldn't require any changes in that one constant of the 
Raider's persona -- the pirate logo. In fact, it would be even more 
appropriate. The problem, hitherto, has been how to pillage more than one city. 
</P>
<P>
With a suitably powered floater, Al could motor along and, in one season, be 
subsidized not only by Oakland but also Los Angeles, Monterey and Santa Barbara 
-- anybody with a waterfront. Why not continue his negotiating pattern and take 
money home from both ends of California?

<P>
In an age when the entire identity of a community seems to be formed by sports 
teams, why not let other cities in on the splendid prospect of hosting one? 
This version of the Ark of the Raiders would not be lost, but rather 
ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League talks of expanding the game to Europe and Japan. 
The stadium could motor on over to Osaka for a game or two in August, then load 
up with Toyotas to be dropped off in Hawaii. In Honolulu, it could board 
pineapples and tourists and slush back on to its home base in California. 
</P>
<P>
Stadiums look like boats anyhow. Best of all, they really need to act like 
boats -- most float on watery lowland soil. Like boats, they should be able to 
rotate so that inept wide receivers and outfielders will never have the excuse 
of the sun getting in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
There already are examples of large-scale floating structures, the most obvious 
being dry docks. They look like sports facilities; all we need to do is round 
off the shape a bit to fit football's needs. 
</P>
<P>
And, how exciting it would be for the spectators to do a wave. The stadium 
would move in tandem.

Drug firms: Eli Lilly &amp; Co. reported record first-quarter net income of 
$341 million, up 20% from year-earlier figures. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a record $1.24 billion, a gain of 18%. The Indianapolis firm 
attributed the results to a significant rise in worldwide sales of 
pharmaceutical products, led by the antidepressant Prozac. Kalamazoo, 
Mich.-based Upjohn Co. posted first-quarter profit of $114 million, an advance 
of 10%. Sales grew 4% to $773 million. The results were attributed to 
cost-control measures instituted throughout 1989 and in the first quarter.

Boise Cascade Corp.: The office products and building supply company's net 
income for the first period of 1990 was $33.6 million, off 57% from the record 
results of first-quarter 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was $1.07 billion, down about 3% from last year. The Boise, Ida.-based 
firm said the decline in income was the result of continuing adverse market 
conditions for the company's paper business. The office products segment 
reported record sales and operating income for the quarter.

Banks: Some major banks reported lower first-quarter earnings because of shaky 
U.S. real estate loans and nonperforming loans to Brazil and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp. said its earnings fell to $44 million, down 66% from a 
year earlier, because of deteriorating real estate loans. Chase raised its 
provision for real estate loan losses to $225 million from $150 million the 
year before, cutting into net income. In addition, the bank received almost no 
interest payments from Brazil. Manufacturers Hanover Corp. reported a 7% 
decline in profit to $96 million for the quarter. Net income from nonperforming 
loans to major refinancing countries, including Brazil and Argentina, was $18 
million less than in the previous year's first quarter.

O.C. EARNINGS: LOSS OF $3.7-MILLION REPORTED FOR 1989 BY BRISTOL RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bristol Research Corp., a Costa Mesa-based computer products company, reported 
a loss of $3.7 million for 1989, contrasted with a loss of about $500,000 in 
1988. Sales dropped to $3 million from $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the declines resulted from substantial price erosion on the 
company's commercial IBM AT-compatible products, product returns caused by 
defective components supplied by a third party, and the write-off of obsolete 
inventory.

Petitioners: Some Wellesley College students oppose Barbara Bush as 
commencement speaker because, they say, she's a college dropout getting by on 
her husband's coattails. The First Lady will speak June 1 at the Wellesley, 
Mass., school. "To honor Barbara Bush . . . is to honor a woman who has gained 
recognition through the achievements of her husband, which contradicts what we 
have been taught," asserted a petition signed by 150 if the school's 2,200 
students. Bush dropped out of Smith College after two years to marry George 
Bush.

Drug Strategy: Real estate czar Donald Trump spoke on the war on drugs to Miami

in order to win the war (and) to take the profit out of these drug czars."

JACK SMITH: ON DUMB DOGS, DUMB BIRDS AND DUPLICITOUS CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It should be of little consolation to us that other animals are not as smart as 
we are. 
</P>
<P>
I do not mean to write another essay on the intelligence of animals; whole 
libraries have been written on it, and I have contributed my share. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, given the superior intelligence it obviously has, our own species acts 
in such self-destructive ways that it has, in the long run, little to 
congratulate itself for. 
</P>
<P>
We take addictive drugs, we have children we don't want; we rape and murder one 
another; we neglect our children, we overeat, we kill ourselves in our cars, we 
poison the air and our lakes and streams, we make war, we steal, and, 
compounding it all, we believe in reincarnation, the notion evidently being 
that if we had a second chance we'd do better. 
</P>
<P>
I mean to comment on the stupidity of other animals only as it has been 
revealed to me by creatures of my own acquaintance in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, we like to wonder at the intelligence of dogs and horses, and are 
constantly making them the heroes of our myths. But horses are among the 
stupidest of animals, and dogs aren't much brighter. I haven't made up my mind 
yet about cats. Perhaps it is because they have so many human characteristics 
that one thinks of them as being smarter than they are. 
</P>
<P>
For example, cats are duplicitous, greedy, insolent, predatory, selfish, 
pugnacious, lazy and utterly without morals; to that degree they are more human 
than most other species, but still not very bright. 
</P>
<P>
That suggests to me that most of our human traits do not derive from our 
superior intelligence, but from our ignoble instincts. I don't want this to 
degenerate into a pseudo-scientific paper. My conclusions are based only on my 
own observations, and to that extent they are scientific. 
</P>
<P>
Take birds. For the last several days a bird has been pecking at the window 
just beyond my computer. I keep the blinds closed, to shut out the light, but 
that mirrors the window's outside surface. 
</P>
<P>
Why does this little bird spend hours every day pecking at the window? 
Obviously, it sees itself reflected in the mirrored surface and imagines that 
its image is another male, intruding on its territory. I assume the bird is a 
male because males are usually territorial, which causes male human beings to 
make war. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, this little bird is too stupid to realize that there is no other 
bird. He is merely pecking at himself. Wouldn't you think that this bird would 
sooner or later realize that he's pecking at his own reflected image? After 
all, every time he pecks at the window his beak hits a hard surface, not 
another bird. I have an idea he will not give up until mating season is over. 
</P>
<P>
Now take our dog, Suzie. She is a large light brown German shepherd type with 
black markings. Someone put her in our yard a few years ago. She is healthy, 
strong and alert. I assume that, for a dog, she is smart. 
</P>
<P>
However, we have a problem with her that I think we wouldn't have if she had 
even a minimum of self-preserving intelligence. Our entire yard is fenced, 
including a smaller portion that used to be the dog yard. But she keeps 
escaping. A couple of years ago I found that she was squirming under the 
chain-link fence around her yard. I paid $280 to have the fence extended 
underground. That stopped her for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Now she is getting out again. We have given her the freedom of the main yard, 
thinking that might deter her. She gets out. We don't know how. Neighbors are 
always phoning and telling us to come and get her. She can't be trusted. 
Sometimes she seems to be getting out just for the hell of it. She doesn't go 
anywhere -- just turns up on the front porch. 
</P>
<P>
In desperation we have had to tie her to a long cord in her yard -- within 
reach of water and her doghouse. She doesn't like it. At night we let her in, 
then tie her up again in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, if she were intelligent, wouldn't she realize that getting out is 
what causes her to be tied up? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she thinks she's a cat.

YOUR BODY: STUDY SHOWS VITAMIN B MAY LOWER STROKE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vitamin B may reduce the risk of stroke in some people, say the Oregon 
researchers whose study is published today in the journal Stroke. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles stroke experts, while noting that the study has merit, say it 
is too soon to conclude that Vitamin B therapy is effective for reducing the 
risk of stroke, which afflicts a half million Americans a year. (A stroke is an 
interruption in the blood supply to the brain; nearly 150,000 victims die 
annually.) 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin B may reduce stroke risk, the Oregon researchers say, by breaking down 
abnormally high levels of an amino acid called homocysteine. (Amino acids are 
the "building blocks" of proteins.) 
</P>
<P>
In their study, Dr. M. Rene Malinow, professor of medicine at Oregon Health 
Sciences University, Portland, and his colleagues found high levels of 
homocysteine in one-third of 99 patients who had suffered strokes, transient 
ischemic attacks (a stroke "warning"), or who were at high stroke risk because 
of high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking or hardening of the arteries. The 
homocysteine levels in these 33 patients were 1.5 times higher than levels in 
31 healthy control subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how this elevated homocysteine may increase stroke risk isn't known, 
according to Malinow, who said four or five other studies have suggested the 
same association between elevated homocysteine and increased stroke risk. One 
possibility: "The elevated levels of homocysteine may injure the endothelial 
cells lining the blood vessels," said Malinow. 
</P>
<P>
Malinow believes the blood test to measure homocysteine, now available only at 
a handful of U.S. facilities, should be more widely available. Until then, 
Malinow says, consumers at high risk of stroke might consider requesting this 
test. If their homocysteine levels are elevated, and pernicious anemia (caused 
by a Vitamin B-12 deficiency) has been ruled out, taking Vitamin B may be wise. 
He recommends two milligrams a day of folic acid, which is a member of the B 
vitamin family. 
</P>
<P>
"One or two milligrams of folic acid a day probably won't hurt, providing there 
is no pernicious anemia (the symptoms of which may be masked by taking folic 
acid)," said Dr. Richard Wright, senior staff cardiologist at St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center, Santa Monica, emphasizing that the concept needs 
further study. "We need more study about the effects of folic acid therapy not 
just on amino acid levels, but on stroke prevention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mark Fisher, USC associate professor of neurology, agreed: "I don't believe 
that increased levels of homocysteine represent a proven independent risk 
factor for stroke. It's a good study, but bears further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Until more evidence is gathered, consumers can concentrate on tried-and-true 
stroke prevention measures, Wright said. "Keep blood pressure under control," 
he said. "Don't smoke, eat a nutritious diet and exercise."

ART BUCHWALD: THE NAKED TRUTH IN CINCINNATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I never saw a Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
I hope I never see one. 
</P>
<P>
But I can tell you this right now. 
</P>
<P>
I'd rather live in Cincinnati than be one. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor that an exhibit of nude baseball player cards was coming to 
Cincinnati hit the town like a tornado. Following the Mapplethorpe photographic 
showing, people were quaking with fear. 
</P>
<P>
Where the rumor started no one knows, but by the time it reached downtown, 
people were telling each other: "They're going to show Pete Rose in the buff." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has a law specifically forbidding the display of baseball nudity on 
the grounds that it is offensive and generates controversy. This includes not 
only the Cincinnati Reds but visiting teams as well. It specifically forbids 
card trading of all players who are not in full uniform. That is why the news 
of a nude baseball player show caused so much alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities warned that if any baseball cards were hung in a public place, the 
police would take videotapes of them, which would then be used in court. The 
sheriff and the mayor said that they would not stand by and see first and 
second basemen exposed to the elements. They promised arrests and jail terms 
whether the players were posing in left field or at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement officer said that Cincinnati is the baseball card capital of 
the world. "Anybody who would show a naked shortstop deserves to have the book 
thrown at him." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are those who maintain that displaying a nude player on a 
card is a form of free expression -- and preventing the public from seeing them 
is censorship. They feel that the city fathers not only want to do away with 
nudity on baseball cards but nudity on Nintendo games as well. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the baseball card issue has become a constitutional one. 
The people who want to ban them swear that the cards are pornographic -- pure 
and simple -- and that the community has a duty to stop them from being 
exhibited. The other viewpoint is that it doesn't matter if they are baseball 
players or weightlifters, they have as much right to be displayed in a museum 
as members of Jesse Helms' family. 
</P>
<P>
What makes it all so sad is that no one actually has seen a nude player on a 
baseball card. At first it was believed that the entire New York Yankee team 
had posed without clothes. Then that rumor changed to the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
But there is still a question of whether the pictures exist or not. 
</P>
<P>
This has not stopped Cincinnati citizens from lining up in front of the 
Baseball Card Museum to get a look at the exhibit. Police estimate that at 
least 56,900 people have been waiting -- not counting 4,000 undercover agents 
from the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a right to see Dave Winfield without his clothes on," a female art 
lover declared, "before they take him away." 
</P>
<P>
Her companion said, "I drove all the way from Louisville, Ky., to get a peek at 
Yogi Berra in his birthday suit." 
</P>
<P>
It's been so long since the whispers about the baseball cards were first heard 
that many art patrons are befuddled. That's why the rumor of them has split 
Cincinnati wide open. 
</P>
<P>
You can't tell other folks what they can or cannot see without them getting mad 
at you. 
</P>
<P>
You may be curious about where I stand on all this. Personally, I don't like 
pictures of nudes. I prefer people with their clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I read the Victoria's Secret catalogue from cover to cover.

Over a weekend that saw no new releases knocking holdovers out of the Top 5 box 
office spots, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" had weekend sales of $14 million, 
pushing its total gross to nearly $73 million. Paramount Pictures' "Crazy 
People" earned $3.3 million at 1,389 screens, for sixth place, and a 
per-screen-average of $2,417. 
</P>
<P>
(The film, which opened last Wednesday, has a cumulative gross of $4.2 
million.) Columbia Pictures' "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" earned an estimated 
$1.2 million on 321 screens, for about $3,800 per screen and tenth place. 
</P>
<P>
* In limited release on 36 screens, Miramax's unrated "The Cook, The Thief, His 
Wife and Her Lover" -- a controversial odyssey about food and sex, revenge and 
violence, set in a posh restaurant -- earned about $430,000 for a high 
per-screen average of almost $12,000.

PORTER RANCH REPORT LINKS JOBS, HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city consultant's report paints a rosy picture of how the massive Porter 
Ranch development would provide jobs, shopping and housing that would reduce 
the need for long commutes by thousands of residents of the San Fernando Valley 
area and eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
But the report, the latest chapter in a continuing debate over the 20-year 
project, also noted that tailoring a development to improve a regional 
jobs-housing balance has never been tried. It says that projecting the 
affordability of homes or income levels of workers is too speculative to 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared for the Los Angeles city Planning Department, is expected 
to be released later this month. A copy was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the firm's report concluded that the Porter Ranch development would 
draw workers and shoppers from predominantly residential areas of eastern 
Ventura County, such as Simi Valley and Moorpark, contributing to a better 
balance of jobs and houses in a region extending from eastern Ventura County to 
the Ventura Freeway Corridor and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The report defined that region as everything within a 30-minute commuting 
radius of the Porter Ranch site in Chatsworth. Last year, the Porter Ranch 
project came under criticism from the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
for creating too many jobs in an area that it said already has a balance of 
jobs and houses. That would run counter to SCAG's goal of reducing commuter 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch Development Co., which wants to build nearly 6 million square 
feet of commercial space and 3,395 residences on a scenic mountain slope north 
of the Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth, has maintained all along that the 
1,300-acre project will shorten regional commuting times by creating jobs and 
shopping opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE, a Porter Ranch residents' group, has disagreed, saying the proposed 
commercial complex is simply too big for the area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is awaiting action by the Los Angeles City Council. Earlier this 
year, a council committee ordered that a supplemental environmental impact 
study analyze several key issues in detail, such as how the proposal would 
affect the balance of jobs and housing in the San Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
As a part of that environmental study, a Los Angeles consulting firm, Hamilton, 
Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler, delved into the jobs-housing question for the city 
Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute commuting radius the study employs -- which reaches into Ventura 
County areas that SCAG did not consider -- "makes far more sense to us than the 
one-sided type of analysis that SCAG was doing," said Frank Fielding, senior 
city planner for the San Fernando Valley. He added, however, that city planners 
still are evaluating the consultant's conclusion that Porter Ranch would 
improve the jobs-housing balance. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures seem to show that at this point in time, but we're still working 
on it," Fielding said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Chipello, executive director of PRIDE, said he continues to believe Porter 
Ranch will not promote a jobs-housing balance. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole goal of jobs-housing balance is not to create larger commercial 
centers that create longer commuter distances," Chipello said. "It's a 
dinosaur. It's an idea we need to get away from." 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report also noted that planning a development to improve a 
region's jobs-housing balance is a new and untested endeavor. No national, 
state or regional standards exist for such a policy, which "requires a period 
of testing and experimentation," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, achieving an "optimal" jobs-housing balance requires balancing 
workers' wages with their ability to afford housing in the same area, the 
report said. The report estimated the number of jobs the project would create 
at 21,358. 
</P>
<P>
But the report declined to project wage levels and housing prices, saying such 
an exercise would be too speculative. Instead, the report referred to the 
developer's examination of those factors at today's levels, which showed Porter 
Ranch workers would be able to afford housing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Fernando, a SCAG senior planner, said that although his agency has not 
yet seen the report or officially commented on it, he believed some projections 
of housing prices and wage levels should be attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying is it's hard to do that, but I don't think that's a valid 
way of settling it," Fernando said.

TRUE BELIEVERS TAKE A PIECE OF ZEKE'S HEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A light drizzle Monday disrupted plans by Mountain View Cemetery to begin 
hauling away Zeke the Sheik's Gargantuan dung heap. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't discourage dozens of Zeke's friends and amateur gardeners from 
coming by for their own piece of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
All morning, well-wishers were lined up in front of the 30-foot-high mound next 
to Zeke's Altadena farmhouse, hoping to salvage some of the steamy, 
chocolate-colored soil by shoveling it into pickup trucks, garbage cans, 
buckets and sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Some paused to sign a petition describing the one-acre jungle of fruits and 
cacti fueled by the fertilizer as "an educational experience." Others shelled 
out a few bucks for T-shirts featuring a photograph of a turban-clad Zeke -- 
the alter ego of 47-year-old Timothy Dundon -- framed by one of his earthy 
musings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I believe in the pile," said Jim Helliwell, 35, a ceramic 
tile setter and organic gardener from North Hollywood, as he loaded his van 
with dirt. "To me, this is something sacred." 
</P>
<P>
At first, cemetery officials, who years ago gave Dundon permission to spread 
the fecund mass atop one of their vacant lots, said they would send out a work 
crew to haul away what's left of the pile as soon as the weather breaks. But 
later in the day, they were given a 10-day extension by the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services, which has condemned the hill as a health hazard 
and illegal dump. 
</P>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court judge on Friday granted the cemetery a temporary 
restraining order blocking Dundon, or anyone else, from interfering with the 
removal of the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably not a bad guy in his own funny way," Cranston P. Montgomery, an 
attorney representing the cemetery, said of Dundon. "But the county is 
concerned that what he's built there is not entirely sanitary or desirable." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he was drafting a letter to Dundon, indicating that the dirt 
would be taken and spread over a vacant lot owned by the cemetery about a half 
mile away. He said Dundon would be given access to the soil if he wants to 
continue sharing it with friends. 
</P>
<P>
But Dundon, who 17 years ago began cultivating the mixture of household 
garbage, animal droppings and lawn clippings from Mountain View's graveyard, 
vowed to continue fighting for control of his hill. 
</P>
<P>
A Pasadena public relations specialist is donating her time to his cause. And 
the stream of support continues from people who would rather haul the richness 
of the mammoth heap to their own homes than see it go to waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The county wanted to kill this," said Dundon, standing in the rain next to his 
creation. "But life is indestructible. It's like the pile is having babies, 
sending out the seeds to make little piles everywhere."

BRODERICK DEFENSE SEEKS NON-LOCAL JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's attorney filed a formal challenge Monday to 
the San Diego bench, contending that no San Diego County Superior Court judge 
can preside over his client's murder trial without there being an appearance of 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
Jack M. Earley said that San Diego judges will appear to be biased because one 
of Broderick's alleged victims, her ex-husband, was a prominent malpractice 
attorney and one-time president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. who often 
fraternized with members of the bench. Earley asked to have the case assigned 
to a judge from another county. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are basically that it's a close-knit legal community, and that 
that causes a problem with any judge hearing the case because people fairly 
well know each other," Earley said. "By keeping a judge in the county here, 
they create a legal boondoggle that otherwise would be completely erased. Why 
would you jeopardize a four- to six-week trial when the easy procedure is to 
bring someone in from out of county and eliminate all those questions?" 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is accused of shooting Daniel T. Broderick III, 44, and his 
28-year-old wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, early on the morning of Nov. 5. She 
has pleaded not guilty, and her trial has been set for July 16. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jesus Rodriguez did not make Earley's declaration public Monday, but, 
after the hearing, Earley summarized it. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said there are people in the legal community who have indicated "that 
Betty Broderick will burn for this offense." He noted that Daniel had worked 
for San Diego's oldest law firm, Gray, Cary, Ames &amp; Frye, and that some of 
his former colleagues are now judges. Earley added that one judge, Thomas 
Ashworth III, had told prosecutors that he feared Betty. 
</P>
<P>
These details would likely "have an effect on the other judges, knowing that 
prominent members want to make sure that she gets convicted," Earley said, 
</P>
<P>
adding that San Diego judges might be influenced in their decisions because 
they know their future assignments could depend on how other judges view their 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said he expected that judges would be called as witnesses to testify 
about Betty's mental state throughout her divorce. He also plans to challenge 
decisions made during the Broderick divorce by local judges. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a number of ex parte orders, restraining orders and jailing of Betty 
Broderick that will be challenged and some judge is going to have to sit and 
judge credibility," he said. "They have a power to admit or not admit certain 
evidence. So there might be evidence that never gets before the jury because 
they want to save embarrassment for a fellow judge or the court system." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez will rule on Earley's motion April 25.

PRESIDENT OF BANK SENTENCED IN SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: STEVEN SMITH OF THE NOW-DEFUNCT WESTLAKE THRIFT &amp; LOAN JOINED AN 
ELABORATE SCAM THAT EVENTUALLY CLOSED HIS INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The former president of the defunct Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan was sentenced 
Monday to two years in federal prison and fined $20,000 for his role in a 
phony-loan scheme that drained the Westlake Village institution of more than $4 
million and ultimately forced it to close, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Smith, 44, of Thousand Oaks, is scheduled to begin his prison sentence 
May 15. He pleaded guilty in December to charges of conspiracy, bank fraud, and 
misapplication of bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorney, I. Mark Bledstein of Encino, called the sentence fair even 
though he had sought a maximum one-year prison term. Bledstein said Smith 
expressed remorse when he appeared Monday before U.S. Dist. Court Judge Richard 
A. Gadbois Jr. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was sorry for himself, for his family, and most importantly, for 
the stockholders in the bank," said Bledstein. "We're hoping he'll be paroled 
after doing one-third of the time." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Atty. David C. Scheper, Smith became involved in an existing 
conspiracy in early 1987 when he discovered the thrift had already approved 
more than $2 million in bogus loans to Walter Vladovich, a Riverside 
businessman bent on establishing the country's largest chain of video-rental 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of "blowing the whistle" on the scheme, Scheper said, Smith went along 
with Vladovich's plan and approved another $2 million in phony loans, 
apparently in the hope that a successful Vladovich would eventually repay the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
"He chose a criminal course rather than one that might have minimized the 
damage," said Scheper. "A bank failure is a disaster for so many people." 
</P>
<P>
The thrift went out of business in July, 1988, but the true nature of its 
troubles was not made public until last December, when a 26-count federal bank 
fraud indictment was returned naming Smith and Vladovich, among other 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich -- described by Scheper as the "big fish" in the scheme -- pleaded 
guilty last month to charges of conspiracy, unlawful payment of bribes, and 
bank fraud. He faces up to 45 years in prison and $2.25 million in fines when 
he is sentenced July 23. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scheper, Vladovich and members of his sales staff processed more 
than 800 phony loans that were eventually funneled into his would-be video 
empire. The loan packages were submitted to Westlake Thrift on behalf of people 
who supposedly were trying to open video rental businesses. 
</P>
<P>
One source has told The Times that initially, Vladovich tried to recruit people 
to apply for the loans, including California Highway Patrol officers. But the 
patrol officers asked too many questions, the source said, and many of the 
loans were eventually written to fictitious persons. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Schneider, the bank official with whom Vladovich began his phony-loan 
scheme in 1984, has pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy and fraud. He 
is scheduled to be sentenced May 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Times recently learned that the FBI's two-year investigation into the 
Vladovich case and the demise of Westlake Thrift has turned to the thrift's 
defunct parent company, United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, which the state 
closed in December for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Targets of the FBI's probe into possible bank fraud include United Community's 
former chairman, Phil Chase of Thousand Oaks, and board member Olen B. Phillips 
of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, an airline pilot who was also a board member at Westlake Thrift, is 
also being investigated by state and Ventura County officials for alleged fraud 
in real-estate transactions.

RELIGIOUS ACTIVISTS LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR GAY RIGHTS REPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of religious activists launched a campaign Friday to repeal the 
city's new gay-rights ordinance as the San Diego City Council formally enacted 
the measure that bars landlords, employers and private businesses from 
discriminating against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
The newly created San Diego Citizens for Equal Rights has 30 days from Monday's 
routine second City Council vote on the Human Dignity Ordinance to gather 
28,293 signatures of registered voters calling for a citywide referendum on the 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's leaders promised to gather thousands of those signatures 
with the help of a growing coalition of San Diego churches and said they are 
seeking the support of Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher. Organizations 
opposed to abortions also will participate in the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't get 40,000 (signatures), I'm sure we can get about half of it 
through our volunteer base" in area churches, said political consultant Barry 
Jantz, chairman of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the signatures might have to be gathered with the help of paid 
petition circulators. 
</P>
<P>
The group is seeking 40,000 signatures to ensure that it collects enough valid 
signatures to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, said ministers in 30 to 40 participating churches will use their 
pulpits to preach against the ordinance and predicts a 10-point victory if his 
organization succeeds in getting the referendum on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will attempt to raise about $40,000 to qualify the measure for 
the ballot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said the ordinance's supporters want "to totally remove the 
heterosexual ethic from center stage and make homosexuality a viable lifestyle 
option. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want it acceptable. We don't want it as a viable life alternative," 
Sheldon added. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the ordinance said after the first vote on the ordinance two 
weeks ago that they, too, have already begun raising money and building an 
organization to campaign against repeal of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote adds San Diego to a list of California cities including Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Barbara and Oakland that have approved 
laws barring various forms of discrimination against gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which will take effect in 30 days if the petition drive is 
unsuccessful, outlaws discrimination against homosexuals in employment, housing 
and real-estate transactions, education, business establishments and the 
provision of city facilities and services. Violators would face civil penalties 
from lawsuits brought by victims of bias. 
</P>
<P>
If the drive succeeds, the council can rescind the law, call a special election 
or place it on the November general election ballot.

CENSUS COUNT LAGS; RESIDENTS URGED TO RETURN FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With nearly two out of every five San Diego households not yet returning their 
census questionnaires, census officials, hoping to save both time and money, 
made a final pitch Monday to encourage local residents to mail in the forms. 
</P>
<P>
In the three weeks since census forms were mailed out nationwide, about 61% of 
San Diego County households -- slightly above both Southern Californian and 
national averages -- have returned the questionnaires, census officials said at 
a downtown news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to reach their 70% return-rate goal, thereby reducing the number of 
census takers needed to visit homes that fail to respond, census administrators 
stressed Monday that there is still time for people who have not yet mailed in 
their questionnaires to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next week, census takers will begin door-to-door visits to homes that 
have not yet returned the questionnaires, Michael Weiler, assistant regional 
census manager for operations, said. That task is expected to last through 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too late to return the questionnaires," Weiler said. "We're at a 
critical point in the census process. Every additional questionnaire that comes 
in . . . will save us something in terms of resources and cost." 
</P>
<P>
To promote that message, public service announcements, featuring speakers 
ranging from President Bush and Miss America to actors and religious leaders, 
will be aired on television stations here and across the nation next week. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, for every 1% of the census questionnaires that are not returned, it 
will cost about $10 million to hire census takers to personally visit those 
residences, Weiler explained. The estimated cost per house for the on-site 
visits is about $10, he added. 
</P>
<P>
With about 400,000 San Diego households remaining to be counted -- compared to 
the nearly 600,000 that have returned the forms -- it could cost up to $4 
million if census takers need to visit each of the homes that, as of Monday, 
had not responded. But, if census officials reach their 70% return target, a 
goal contingent upon nearly 100,000 homes mailing in the forms within the next 
week, the cost would be reduced by about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the cost of tabulating San Diego County's population is estimated at 
$7.7 million, a figure based on the assumption that the 70% target will be 
achieved, said Dan Conway, a census spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's 61% census questionnaire return rate to date ranks slightly above 
Los Angeles' 57% rate and 1% behind Orange County's mark, according to census 
figures. The average return rate for the 10-county Southern California region 
is 58%; the national average is 59%, Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Language barriers, skepticism over the census data's confidentiality and simple 
procrastination are among the major factors that census officials say prevents 
people from returning the questionnaires. Others, officials said, might dismiss 
the census forms as a kind of governmental junk mail -- unaware, perhaps, that 
the decennial calculation of the nation's population is used to apportion 
congressional seats and allocate tens of millions of dollars in federal 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"When we think about the 1990 census, three words best describe that process -- 
it's important, it's easy and it's safe," Weiler said. Seeking to allay 
concerns about the privacy of the census material, Weiler reiterated that the 
information included on the census forms is not shared with any other 
governmental agency. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's news conference, census officials encouraged individuals who have 
not yet returned their census questionnaires but still have the forms to return 
them within the next week to avoid the time and expense of dispatching a census 
taker to their home. Persons who have discarded or misplaced the forms they 
received last month, however, should call the local census office for a 
replacement, fill it out and keep it until a census taker picks it up, Weiler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to carefully control replacement questionnaires so there aren't 
duplications," Weiler said, explaining why officials prefer that the 
replacement forms not be mailed to census offices. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,600 temporary census takers will be needed to visit homes in San Diego 
and Imperial counties from which questionnaires are not returned, Weiler said. 
Although about two-thirds of those jobs have been tentatively filled, officials 
still need to hire about 800 workers, Conway added.

2 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two youths believed to be involved in a gang-related drive-by shooting have 
been arrested, Oxnard police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths, ages 15 and 17, shouted gang slogans as they pulled up beside a 
car carrying four boys at Saviers Road and Channel Islands Boulevard in Oxnard, 
said Sgt. Gary Amar of the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The four boys fled in their car as the two youths chased them, Amar said. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger in the youths' car pointed a shotgun at the four boys and fired 
once into the door on the driver's side of their car, Amar said. No one was 
injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The four victims contacted police, who stopped the shooting suspects' vehicle 
shortly afterward and arrested the two youths, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA TERESITA HOSPITAL TO QUIT MEDI-CAL 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, saying they have lost millions 
of dollars treating Medi-Cal patients, have announced that they will drop out 
of the program effective Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The 283-bed hospital is reimbursed by the state for less than half of what it 
costs to care for its Medi-Cal patients, hospital Administrator Michael 
Costello said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital lost about $1.1 million caring for Medi-Cal patients last year 
alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Teresita notified the state Department of Health Services last week that 
it will leave the program. A 120-day notification is required. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Teresita was the fourth San Gabriel Valley hospital to terminate its 
contract since 1988. The action leaves that area with 11 acute-care hospitals 
under contract to treat the San Gabriel Valley's estimated 60,000 Medi-Cal 
patients, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no alternative," Costello said. "It is impossible to provide care and 
be paid less than the cost to deliver that care."

TRASH CLEANUP TO MARK EARTH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Earth Day coming up on Sunday, Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle figures 
it is time for city residents to stop talking trash and start walking or 
running with it. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m. today, the public is invited to the Harbortown Hotel parking lot at 
1050 Schooner Drive. 
</P>
<P>
From there, volunteers will work their way over to the Channel Islands National 
Park Headquarters, picking up garbage as they go. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people are expected to participate in the Twilight Trash Bash, which 
is sponsored by the city and by the Inside Track store, which Tuttle owns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to talk about doing something about the environment, but people are 
too busy taking care of their own needs," said Tuttle, who is an avid runner. 
"This will give people what they need for fitness, and it will also help clean 
up at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle suggested possible courses that people can follow either by walking or 
running and scooping up trash. The most direct route is 1 1/2 miles from start 
to finish. Another route is about three miles long and goes past a city 
sewage-treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Over by the entrance of the plant, it's a mess," he said. "That's where most 
of the people will be concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
Participants will be supplied with trash bags, but Tuttle recommends that they 
bring work gloves. Prizes will be awarded to the holder of the ugliest and most 
unusual trash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be the grungiest, the piece that's been out there the longest," 
said Tuttle. "I really don't know what I'll be looking for. I'll have to play 
it by ear, but I'll know it when I see it." LEO SMITH

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTY RECYCLES TON OF MATERIAL PER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recycling at the Ventura County Government Center has saved an average of 1 ton 
of material each workday for four months, including enough paper to spare 850 
trees, according to the county Solid Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
A report on today's agenda of the Board of Supervisors says that by recycling 
trash since December, the county has saved 150 cubic yards of landfill space, 
kept 3,000 pounds of pollutants out of the air, and conserved energy and water. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental effort is in response to a state law requiring local 
governments to recycle a significant part of their waste by the year 2000. 
Materials saved in special recycling bins placed throughout the administration 
building in Ventura include paper, glass, aluminum and cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
In her report, Kay Martin, the county's solid waste manager, asked the 
supervisors to adopt a broader recycling program that would require all 6,000 
county employees to use paper products more efficiently and to use recycled 
paper products at work. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that employees use both sides of a sheet of paper, post 
memos rather than circulate them, eliminate duplicate mailings and 
subscriptions, and try to buy reusable products. 
</P>
<P>
The plan should cut paper use by 25% to 50%, saving $112,500 to $225,000 a 
year, Martin said. That would make up for about $45,000 a year in extra costs 
for higher-priced recycled paper. DARYL KELLEY

600-ACRE BLAZE IGNITED BY CAMPFIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
An unattended campfire caused a fire that continued to burn Monday in the Los 
Padres National Forest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 280 firefighters battled the fire, which had spread to 600 acres 
Monday, said Earl Clayton, a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Split into 15 hand crews and four helicopter crews, they dropped water on the 
fire, cut firebreaks and dug trenches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in an area where the terrain is extremely rugged," Clayton said. "We 
couldn't get to the fire by engines. . . . The roads are almost impassable." 
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters have suffered minor injuries, primarily from heat exhaustion, 
since the fire began Friday, Clayton said. Damage to acres of pinion and 
juniper pine is estimated at $300,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By 4:30 p.m. Monday, 90% of the fire had been contained, Clayton said. The 
cloud cover that moved in Monday morning helped slow its spread, Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The really unusual thing about this fire is that it occurs here in April, not 
in June and July," Clayton said. Because of the four-year statewide drought, 
the fire danger is the most severe in a century in the national forest, he 
said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEAK LINKS STOP 'VIPER' IN ITS TRACKS; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC MOUNTAIN: THE NEW 'WORLD'S TALLEST LOOPING ROLLER COASTER' HAS BEEN 
TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF A FAULTY 800-FOOT CHAIN THAT HAULS 
CARS TO THE TOP OF RIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At least for the moment, Magic Mountain's Viper has lost its venom. 
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed $8-million roller coaster, the subject of an intense 
publicity campaign, was taken out of service during Easter weekend, just seven 
days after it opened, because park inspectors discovered signs of stress in the 
chain that hauls the cars to the top of an 188-foot-high drop. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Simmons, a spokeswoman for Six Flags Magic Mountain, said the problems 
did not pose a threat to riders. It is not uncommon for rides to have technical 
problems during their first month of operation, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors discovered what appeared to be indications of metal fatigue in some 
links in the 800-foot-long chain during a routine daily inspection Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The links were not weak enough to break, and even if they had, the cars would 
freeze on the track because they are unable to roll backward, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, engineers decided to install a new chain rather than replace 
the weak links. Simmons said the links would be sent to a laboratory where 
inspectors will try to determine what caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors with the Los Angeles County Department of Building and Safety 
certified Viper as ready for occupancy before the ride opened. Once operating, 
amusement park rides are inspected by the department on schedules that vary 
from once a month to once a year, depending on the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said signs were posted at the marquee, ticket booths and other key 
locations to alert patrons before they entered that Viper was not operating. 
</P>
<P>
Viper is billed as the world's tallest looping roller coaster. It took 1 
million pounds of steel and 60,000 tons of concrete to build. At the bottom of 
the first 115-foot-long drop, the 28-passenger cars hit speeds of 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The ride's debut April 7 was hailed by roller coaster enthusiasts who came to 
Valencia from across the country to celebrate its opening. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said the ride should be operating again this weekend.

TEEN KILLED IN SHOOTING ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA CHONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed early Monday on a freeway near East Los 
Angeles while riding in a car with five friends, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rivera of Bell was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, which 
was traveling north on the Long Beach Freeway near Bandini Boulevard and 
Slauson Avenue, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Two bullets were fired from another car carrying two men. One of the bullets 
struck Rivera in the head, fatally wounding him, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
"Drive-by shootings can happen anywhere," Estrada said. "We don't know whether 
this was actually gang-related or not. There's not enough information at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Rivera did not belong to a gang, but they believe that some 
of the five people in the car with him were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was triggered by an incident a few minutes earlier at the freeway 
on-ramp near Atlantic Boulevard and Florence Avenue, Estrada said. As Rivera 
and the other occupants were halted at a stop sign, another car pulled up and 
the occupants shouted something in Spanish at them. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some sort of exchange, but we don't know what," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The occupants of the car Rivera was in did not understand what had been said, 
but drove away and entered the freeway, deputies said. The other car -- 
described as a late-model, burgundy-colored Chevrolet Camaro or Firebird -- 
passed them and shots were fired, Estrada said.

STATE LAW PROPOSALS TARGET SLUMLORD RENTS, BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THREE BILLS SEEK TO COUNTER THE DETERIORATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN 
CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR URBAN CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos unveiled a legislative package Monday aimed 
at cracking down on slumlords by threatening to seize their rents and place 
control of their buildings in the hands of private property managers. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to counter the deterioration of affordable housing in California's 
major urban centers, the package of bills was conceived by Roos and Los Angeles 
City Atty. James K. Hahn with the help of the city's Housing Enforcement Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
As housing costs spiral throughout the state, "a decent place in which to live 
is rapidly becoming a scarce commodity in many inner-city neighborhoods," Roos 
(D-Los Angeles) said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the legal remedies available to city and state officials involve 
financial penalties and jail sentences, but many buildings remain in disrepair 
and are infested by vermin, lack hot water and heat and pose severe fire 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most controversial part of the package is a bill that would enhance 
the power of judges to appoint a receiver, or private property manager, to 
oversee renovations of slum buildings whose owners have refused to bring their 
properties up to code, Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow the receiver to seize rents and pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said that facet of the package is likely to face stiff opposition from 
banks, savings and loans, mortgage companies and others in the finance industry 
who believe that placing a substandard property into receivership could inhibit 
its sale to a new owner and allow the receiver to stop making mortgage payments 
until the repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
A second bill would prevent the sale of a property in violation of slum laws 
unless the money needed to make repairs is set aside in an escrow account. A 
third bill would prohibit slumlords from using their substandard buildings as 
collateral for other loans. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said the number of rental units that do not meet basic health and safety 
standards in Los Angeles climbed from 14.5% in 1977 to 23% in 1988, or about 
165,000 units with 450,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, about 19% of the apartment dwellers in that city and county 
live in substandard buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a growing success in prosecuting slumlords, Hahn said his office has 
seen "more and more surreptitious real estate deals involving sophisticated 
owners transferring slum properties like hot potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Often these transactions were accomplished with the blessing of a lender or 
with lenders claiming that they had no ability to do anything about the 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office filed a massive lawsuit last year after uncovering an alleged 
conspiracy on the part of dozens of lenders and slumlords to use loopholes in 
the law and real estate transfers to avoid making repairs and at the same time 
extract maximum profits.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PIRU; 
</P>
<P>
FRUIT PACKER SELLING TONS TO PACIFIC RIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away in the tiny town of Piru is a multimillion-dollar industry with an 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
An average of 1,000 trucks stop each month at the Fillmore-Piru Citrus Assn. 
packing plant on Main Street. Up to 20 tons of premium fruit departs Piru in 
each load, bound for destinations as distant as Singapore and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very aggressive in targeting Pacific Rim markets," said association 
President Ken Creason, noting that Ventura County citrus is so popular in Japan 
that the FPCA provides copies of its brochure printed in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The original packing plant of the 94-year-old association was destroyed by fire 
and rebuilt in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the operation seems typical of today's factories. Conveyor belts rumble 
from room to room, and a busy fleet of forklifts empties 1-ton "field boxes" of 
fruit into a giant hopper. On an average day, the packinghouse processes about 
700,000 pounds of oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Some equipment is specific to the industry. A computerized sizing device scans 
each orange with an electronic eye, determining in seconds its diameter. The 
machine flips the piece on to the appropriate conveyor belt and relays 
up-to-the minute data to a central computer. 
</P>
<P>
The perfume of oranges is everywhere, from the holding rooms where field boxes 
are stacked according to the ranch where they were filled, to the chilling 
rooms, where 40-pound cartons of fruit await shipment. In the wash and wax 
room, a different odor pervades the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sodium lauryl sulfate -- the same thing used as a base for nearly every 
shampoo on the market," said Ralph Holland, the resident chemist. 
</P>
<P>
The association belongs to Sunkist Growers, which markets the citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Creason spends about a quarter of his time in the field, visiting with the 
association's member growers. 
</P>
<P>
More than 460 ranches totaling 10,000 acres keep the packing plant open 
year-round. During the peak Valencia season between May and October, the 
Fillmore plant is open for business as well. 
</P>
<P>
Technology and marketing have reshaped much of the citrus business Creason knew 
in the late 50s, when he worked in orchards as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the progress he has seen in more than 30 years with the industry, 
one thing remains the same: Oranges are still plucked from the tree by hand.

KRISHNAS WIN REPRIEVE ON SELLING TEMPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Hare Krishna religious sect will 
not have to sell temples in San Diego and elsewhere to satisfy a $5-million 
judgment involving an Orange County mother and daughter, at least until after 
the court considers whether to hear an appeal of the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' decision upholds a ruling last week by Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor, who had blocked a California Supreme Court justice's order that the 
Hare Krishnas must sell some of their assets to pay the award. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County jury in 1983 had awarded $32.5 million to Marsha George of 
Cypress and her daughter, Robin George, in their lawsuit against the Hare 
Krishnas. The mother and daughter claimed that the Hare Krishnas had coerced 
Robin George into running away from home and joining the sect at age 14, then 
hid her from her parents as they searched the country for her. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge, James A. Jackman, reduced the award to about $10 million, and 
the 4th District Court of Appeal further reduced it to $2.9 million plus 
interest, which amounts to more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to meet in early May to decide whether to 
hear the Hare Krishnas' appeal of the case. 
</P>
<P>
If the high court does not hear it, the case reverts to Judge Jackman for 
administration of the payment to Marsha George and her daughter, whose married 
name is Robin Westerkamp. If the court does decide to hear the case, said the 
Georges' attorney, Lynde Selden II, it could be "another two years" before the 
issue is decided. 
</P>
<P>
A state judge last month ordered that the Krishnas sell enough assets -- which 
could include five of its temples, including ones in San Diego and Laguna Beach 
-- to pay off the mother and daughter. But the Hare Krishnas argued that the 
sale would destroy the sect and amount to an interference in its religious 
freedom.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER'S DEATH BLAMED ON RAIN, BALD TIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain-slick pavement and bald tires were partly to blame for the death Monday of 
a 24-year-old Glendale motorist whose car skidded off the southbound on-ramp to 
the Glendale Freeway at Mountain Street and plunged down a 50-foot embankment 
onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The motorist was "traveling too fast for the weather conditions" and missed by 
inches a guard rail that would have blocked the skidding vehicle, said 
California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tami Low. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had hit the rail, he would have stayed on the ramp and probably been 
alive," Low said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorist, who was alone, was traveling east on Mountain when the car 
skidded as he turned right onto the ramp. The vehicle overturned twice down the 
embankment before landing on its wheels on the freeway. CHP officers said all 
four tires on the 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix were bald. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose name was being withheld pending notification of relatives, 
was pronounced dead at the scene. No other vehicles were involved. Two lanes of 
the freeway were closed for two hours after the 11 a.m. accident.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STRANDED TRUCK'S CB GETS HELP FROM TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sylmar woman and her teen-age son whose truck became mired in mud in the 
mountains near Castaic used their citizens band radio to summon help -- from 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Thompson, 49, and her son Daniel, 17, were rescued after a Houston 
resident, Wayburn Castleschouldt, telephoned sheriff's deputies in Santa 
Clarita to tell them of the Thompsons' plight. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. John Baylis said Thompson and her son were driving in the 
mountains near the Senega Campground, near Templin Highway and the Golden State 
Freeway, when a sudden downpour turned the dirt road to mud and their pickup 
truck became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
"The mud caved in on the car. For them to walk six miles to a phone in that mud 
would have been extremely difficult," Baylis said. Baylis said that after 
failing to move the truck for about an hour, the Thompsons began calling for 
help on their CB radio. 
</P>
<P>
Their calls went unanswered for several hours, but their signal eventually was 
picked up by Castleschouldt in his truck. 
</P>
<P>
"There were big canyon walls and they couldn't get anybody local," Baylis said. 
"The signals were bouncing all the way around, and then they shot out to the 
air, then it hit something and bounced down to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"They are pretty lucky. They could have been stuck there for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in a helicopter sighted the mother and son, landed and led them to a 
waiting sheriff's car a short distance away, Baylis said. Their truck, however, 
will be stuck for several days.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN A LITTLE OUT OF LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youthful enthusiasm has turned into immaturity during Tustin City Councilman 
John Kelly's 3 1/2-year tenure as he and his cohort, Councilman Earl J. 
Prescott, have continually disrupted city business. Kelly was defeated in last 
week's city election; tonight's meeting is his swan song. But he is not going 
quietly, as his astonishing behavior Friday at an anti-abortion demonstration 
at a Tustin abortion clinic showed. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly had a right to participate. But like other demonstrators, he was well 
aware of the risk of being arrested for his cause. Despite this, he attempted 
to interfere with Police Chief Douglas Franks, who was overseeing the arrests 
of some of the demonstrators. Kelly actually ordered Franks to stop the 
arrests. "You still work for me," Kelly told Franks angrily. "This is 
insubordination." Franks correctly exercised his own judgment as the city's 
chief law enforcement officer, and Kelly was among the 48 who were arrested for 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
There is much wrong with Kelly's conduct. First, Chief Franks doesn't work 
directly for the councilman but for the city, whose council's majority makes 
personnel decisions. Second, Kelly was blatantly attempting to intimidate a new 
police chief. Third, it was hardly insubordination to enforce the law as Franks 
is sworn to do. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott says he will ask for an investigation by the council and the district 
attorney's office into the arrest of Kelly. Both agencies should ignore his 
request. If there is any investigation, it ought to be of Kelly's attempt to 
interfere with the police chief's performance of his duties. Kelly, after being 
defeated for council, told a reporter, "I'm only 28 and I'm white and single. 
I've got a life ahead of me." He also said he may run again for public office. 
If his behavior on Friday is any indication, he should take the opportunity of 
being out of office to do some growing up.

Wilbur Garrett was fired as editor of National Geographic magazine after months 
of mounting tension with Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president and chairman of the 
National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
The move was cast as a resignation when it was announced to ranking editors. 
William Graves, assistant editor for expeditions, will replace Garrett. Sources 
said Garrett and Grosvenor had been on a collision course over the editor's 
efforts to adapt the 102-year-old magazine to a changing, and younger, 
readership. Another conflict was Garrett's resistance to cutting staff and 
editorial spending during a period fo belt-tightening.

Schools were unable to open in 145 of the state's 606 districts as thousands of 
teachers went on strike to protest the Legislature's failure to pass a 
$230-million school improvement package that would raise faculty salaries. 
</P>

Hundreds of teachers lobbied for the stalled measure and picketed the state 
Capitol in Oklahoma City, joining a crowd of demonstrators estimated at 10,000. 
"If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a legislator," read 
one sign.

MORNING BRIEFING: YOU MIGHT SAY MILLER TOOK A CHIP SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC golf analyst Johnny Miller got off a zinger at the PGA Seniors Championship 
that surely didn't endear him to the pros at the Heritage tournament, which was 
telecast by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's broadcast partner, Bryant Gumbel, remarked Sunday that the caddies of 
Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Lee Trevino, were famous in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Said Miller: "Probably more famous than the guys leading at Heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Think Payne Stewart is laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Add golf: Said Peter Jacobsen when asked why the European pros do so well in 
big U.S. tournaments: "We get spoiled on the PGA Tour. The Americans are used 
to playing on thick grass and perfect greens. When you play in Europe, you've 
got to dig it out of hoof marks and jeep tracks. No wonder they do so well." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What active major league player had the most runs batted in during 
in the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: From Hubert Mizell of the St. Petersburg Times: "So 
ticked is Leo Durocher at not being elected to the baseball Hall of Fame, the 
former infielder/manager has ordered lawyers to decline if the 84-year-old 
'Lip' is elected after he dies." 
</P>
<P>
Feller's pitch: Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller claims he threw harder than 
Nolan Ryan does, although Ryan's fastball has been clocked at 100.9 m.p.h. and 
Feller's at 98.6 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Feller told the New York Times: "My fastball was timed by photo-electric cells 
at home plate, but by then the ball was losing speed, maybe as much as 15 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"That was long before the radar gun they use today. The radar gun gives you the 
average speed of a pitch from the mound to the plate. On a radar gun, I would 
have averaged 105 to 107 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Free spirit: World B. Free, one of the NBA's all-time gunners, was seen at a 
Philadelphia 76er game passing out cards that said: "World B. Liquors." 
</P>
<P>
Hat trick: University of Kentucky basketball Coach Rick Pitino, who coached the 
New York Knicks last season, concerning his supposedly strained relationship 
with Knick General Manager Al Bianchi: "I never had a relationship with Al when 
I was the coach, I don't have a relationship with Al now and I won't have a 
relationship with Al down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Dave Winfield, with 1,438 RBIs. Note: If Jim Rice is signed by 
any team, he would be the leader with 1,451. 
</P>
<P>
Add Winfield: From former shortstop Tony Kubek: "Every shortstop and second 
baseman will tell you that Dave Winfield is the most feared baserunner in the 
league, and take care to get out of his way. For a big man, he can fly. Gene 
Michael, the Yankees' third base coach, told me Winfield's speed makes him look 
good. He knows how to cut the corner at third and put on a burst that gets him 
home with a slide that could be violent." 
</P>

dislike." HARLEY TINKHAM

<P>
Colombia, which will play the United States Sunday at Miami's Orange Bowl in a 
game between two World Cup soccer teams, will first be tested at the Coliseum 
tonight at 8 against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent appearances at the Coliseum, Colombia won the Marlboro Cup 
in February with victories over the Soviet Union and Guadalajara of Mexico. Its 
most celebrated player is Rene Higuita, who last year was voted South America's 
outstanding goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, disqualified from the World Cup because it used over-age players in a 
junior tournament, has not lost in eight games at the Coliseum since 1986. Five 
of its starting players are from the country's No. 1 professional team, Club 
America of Mexico City.

BRANDENBURG ASSISTANT LEAVES SDSU FOR DRAKE

Maury Hanks, assistant basketball coach at San Diego State University, resigned 
Monday to accept a similar position at Drake University. 
</P>
<P>
Hanks will work for Rudy Washington, who was named coach at Drake April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hanks first met Washington 10 years ago when Washington was an assistant coach 
at USC and Hanks was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get the opportunity everyday to work with your best friend and the 
opportunity to rebuild a program," Hanks said. "Anyone who grew up around Los 
Angeles basketball knew Rudy Washington. He helped me get my job at Clemson." 
</P>
<P>
Hanks, 28, was an assistant at Clemson for two years before coming to SDSU as a 
part-time assistant in 1987 -- Coach Jim Brandenburg's first season. He is the 
third assistant and last from Brandenburg's original staff to leave SDSU in the 
past year. Charles Bradley and Kevin McLeod left after the 1988-89 season, 
Bradley going to Brigham Young and McLeod to Weber State. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision to leave San Diego and San Diego State," Hanks said. 
"I know people will think I'm crazy for leaving here to go to Des Moines, Iowa, 
but the situation was right." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Washington nor Brandenburg were available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really sorry to be losing Maury as he's been an integral part of the 
Aztec staff in my three years here," Brandenburg said in a news release. "I 
wish him the best of luck at Drake and in the future."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BREWERS HAVE A FIELD DAY ON PATRIOTS DAY AT FENWAY, WIN, 18-0 
</P>

<P>
The Milwaukee Brewers recorded the most lopsided shutout in club history, 
pounding out 20 hits and beating the Boston Red Sox, 18-0, Monday at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you get that buzz saw going and you have no control," Milwaukee 
Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Joe (Morgan, Boston manager) felt he had no control. And I had no 
control. That's quite rare for us. We usually have a way of grinding them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots Day crowd of 35,478 was the largest crowd at Fenway since Patriots 
Day in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Dave Parker had three doubles and a single, Greg Brock two doubles 
and two singles. Gary Sheffield, Edgar Diaz and Brock drove in three runs 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee had nine doubles and one triple, but no home runs. Every starter 
except Dale Sveum got a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just on a roll today," said Parker, who signed as a free agent after 
helping the Oakland Athletics to the World Series championship last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Ted Higuera (1-0) gave up two hits in 6 1/3 innings. Tom Filer and 
Dan Plesac finished the combined three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, bothered by injuries last year, allowed only a single by Ellis Burks 
leading off the fifth inning and a single by Tony Pena. He struck out three and 
walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Mike Boddicker gave up six runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings and 
Dennis Lamp followed by giving up three runs and four hits in 1 1/3 innings. 
Rookie Dana Kiecker gave up four runs in 1 1/3 innings, and Mike Rochford gave 
up four runs in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those days," Boddicker said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 runs by the Brewers were one short of the team record, set against 
Boston on May 31, 1980. The 18-0 loss was one run short of the worst shutout 
defeat for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The major league record for the largest shutout was the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
22-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 16, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Baltimore 2 -- John Cerutti pitched five shutout innings and the 
Blue Jays went on the beat the Orioles at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Cerutti gave up three hits, struck out five and walked none. Frank Wills 
allowed three hits in two innings before Tom Henke got the final six outs for 
his first save. One of the hits off Wills was a two-run homer by Cal Ripken in 
the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Tibbs, making his first appearance since July 2, gave up seven hits and 
four runs in five innings. He had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff last 
Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 6, Kansas City 3 -- Cory Snyder hit three doubles and the Indians 
knocked out Mark Gubicza in a four-run second inning en route to a rain-delayed 
victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the first 14 Cleveland batters reached base against Gubicza, who was 
charged with six hits and six earned runs in 1 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti went five innings for the victory, giving up 10 hits and the 
three Kansas City runs. Al Nipper relieved in the sixth and pitched three 
scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Orosco walked the only two batters he faced in the ninth before Doug 
Jones came on for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
The game was interrupted by rain for 41 minutes in the bottom of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, Minnesota 3 -- Jeffrey Leonard and Ken Griffey Jr. hit two-run 
homers off David West at Seattle as the Mariners ended a five-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 3-2, Harold Reynolds drew a leadoff walk in the third inning and 
Griffey hit West's next pitch for his second home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle starter Randy Johnson got the victory despite giving up two home runs. 
He yielded five hits in seven innings before Bill Swift opened the eighth. Mike 
Schooler went the final 1 1/3 innings for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
It was Schooler's 50th career save in his 110th game, breaking the American 
League record of 50 in 122 games by Cleveland's Doug Jones. The St. Louis 
Cardinals' Todd Worrell holds the major-league mark of 50 in 109 games.

JOHNSON STRIKES BACK, METS ROUT CUBS, 10-1 
</P>

<P>
Frank Viola extended his scoreless streak to 13 innings and a struggling Howard 
Johnson doubled twice to drive in three runs as the New York Mets beat the 
Cubs, 10-1, Monday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson struck out four consecutive times Sunday night in Montreal and the 
first two times at bat Monday against Steve Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth inning, he drove a changeup just out of the reach of the third 
baseman Luis Salazar for a run-scoring double to give New York a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"My only thought in the sixth inning was to move the runner (Keith Miller) up 
to third," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
His two-run double an inning later off reliever Jeff Pico was the beginning of 
the end for the Cubs. Pico had two out and none on when the Mets started the 
rally that turned the game into a rout. Before it was over, Mike Marshall hit a 
two-run triple and Mark Carreon, playing for injured Kevin McReynolds, added a 
two-run homer as the Mets opened a 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Carreon and Marshall had three hits apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Viola struck out eight, walked none and allowed four hits in six innings before 
Alejandro Pena relieved for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson allowed three runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Atlanta 3 -- Barry Larkin, who has at least two hits in all six 
games, keyed a three-run first inning with the first of his four hits at 
Atlanta as the Reds remain the only unbeaten team in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati jumped on Pete Smith for four hits in the first and made it easy for 
Jack Armstrong, who ran his scoreless string to 11 innings before the Braves, 
losers of four in a row and five of six, scored in the sixth inning on Lonnie 
Smith's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong allowed five hits, no walks and struck out three in seven innings. 
Rob Dibble pitched the final inning for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo, Billy Hatcher and Larkin, who was four for five, ran their hitting 
streaks to six games. Larkin, batting .571, is 16 for 28. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Philadelphia 4 -- The Montreal Expos took advantage of four walks 
and Spike Owen's first home run to score three runs in the seventh inning and 
beat the Phillies at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-2, Owen homered off Terry Mulholland, who gave way to Jeff Perrett, 
who loaded the bases on walks to pinch-hitters Mike Aldrete and Larry Walker, 
and a bunt single by DeLino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines singled home pinch-runner David Martinez to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Frohwirth relieved Parrett and issued back-to-back walks to Tim Wallach 
and Andres Galarraga to force home Walker with the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Pittsburgh 4 -- Terry Pendleton had a two-run double, and Jose 
DeLeon and five relievers combined on an eight-hitter as the Cardinals won at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Oquendo and Vince Coleman also had RBIs as St. Louis ended a six-game 
losing streak against the Pirates that dated to last year. 
</P>
<P>
John Smiley, still recovering from off-season elbow surgery, retired the first 
two hitters before Todd Zeile walked and Pedro Guerrero singled. Pendleton 
doubled down the right-field line, scoring both runners when the ball struck 
the bullpen fence and bounced away from Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals made it 4-0 in the fourth on doubles by Bob Brunansky and 
Oquendo, and Coleman's RBI single.

MWD MAY OFFER REBATES TO ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To encourage saving water, a committee of the Metropolitan Water District on 
Monday recommended paying millions of dollars in rebates to water agencies that 
get customers to cut use by more than 5% this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which officials expect to be approved by the MWD board today, would 
rebate $100 for every acre-foot of water that local agencies conserve between 
June 1 and Sept. 30. If successful, the program would bring an estimated $10 
million to the 27 Southern California water agencies served by MWD. 
</P>
<P>
The money could be passed along to retail customers as rewards, could pay for 
"water cops" to enforce conservation rules, or could be used to offset lower 
water sales, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is a great persuader," said MWD General Manager Carl Boronkay, who urged 
adoption of the rebate program. "In order to get the money, they have to get 
demand down. Just how they do that, we don't dictate. . . . We're leaving it to 
their imagination." 
</P>
<P>
The rebate program is the centerpiece of MWD's plan for dealing with an 
estimated 10% to 12% shortage in water supplies this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The MWD, which supplies about 60% of the water consumed by 15 million residents 
in the six-county region, anticipates being short about 200,000 acre-feet of 
water because of severe drought conditions that have reduced water supplies 
from the Sierra Nevada and Colorado River. An acre-foot is enough water to 
cover an acre to a depth of one foot, or 326,000 gallons -- roughly the amount 
of water used by two families in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed "Drought Action Plan '90," MWD will also spend an estimated 
$2 million on advertising, $500,000 on conservation kits and $500,000 on 
low-flow plumbing fixture rebate programs. 
</P>
<P>
The agency estimates that those measures can cut overall water consumption by 
about 100,000 acre-feet, or roughly 5% of total use. Conservation would be 
measured by comparing this summer's use against 1989 figures, adjusted for 
population in creases. 
</P>
<P>
Any cut above the 5% target by its member agencies will qualify for the 
conservation rebate. 
</P>
<P>
For some agencies, that could be a considerable amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power uses about 700,000 acre-feet of 
water annually, and Mayor Tom Bradley has said that if residents do not 
voluntarily save 10% of that amount, he will seek a mandatory rationing system. 
If the city meets that goal, DWP could collect about $3.5 million in rebates 
from MWD. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Jensen, a DWP spokeswoman, said the funds probably would be passed 
along to city residents in the form of lower water rates. Based on 1989 total 
revenues of $294 million, the rebate would reduce billings by 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Passing along savings may help keep the public happier with conservation than 
they were in the 1978 drought. At that time, water rates in many communities 
went up as usage went down, and water agencies struggled to meet their fixed 
business costs. 
</P>
<P>
Boronkay said he is hopeful that the rebate program will help local water 
agencies, serving more than 300 communities across Southern California, to 
develop programs for cutting use voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Besides paying $10 million in rebates, the agency could lose an additional $25 
million in revenues if usage drops 10%, a spokesman said. The MWD, one of the 
largest water agencies in the nation, has about $150 million in cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cost of the rebates, MWD would like to conserve more than 10%, so 
the agency can increase its water reserves in case of a fifth year of drought. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to give the carrot and save the stick for a more drastic 
situation," said Boronkay. During earlier droughts, MWD also adopted a punitive 
pricing schedule that charged higher rates to water agencies that failed to cut 
use by 10%.

THIN BLUE LINE DRAWN IN LAX TURF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: AIRPORT OFFICERS FEEL THREATENED BY A BEHIND-THE-SCENES TAKEOVER 
ATTEMPT BY THE LAPD OVER WHO WILL PATROL THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles International Airport's independent police force, which four years 
ago was rife with corruption and internal problems but has since undergone a 
multimillion-dollar overhaul, now faces a new threat -- a behind-the-scenes 
takeover attempt by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the aggressive turf war is who will patrol the airport, one of the 
busiest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the future of the 222-member Airport Police Department -- one 
of the largest police agencies in Southern California -- underscores fears 
among many specialized police officers in the city and county that both Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block are conducting 
back-door campaigns to expand their empires. Critics contend that an effort is 
under way to put numerous smaller, specialized police agencies -- such as 
housing authority police, harbor police and transit police -- out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of reminds me of corporate takeovers," said Larry Malmberg, president 
of the 35,000-member Peace Officers Research Assn. of California. "Maybe 
they've been taking lessons from T. Boone Pickens and Donald Trump." 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Block deny any such attempt, saying they are only interested in 
upgrading the quality of police service in the region. "As far as any attempt 
on our part to eliminate the agencies or take over other agencies' 
responsibilities, that's not an issue that's been given any thought to," Block 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who has intervened in the 
dispute, has acknowledged that the recent moves may be the first step in that 
direction. "The mayor is concerned about the proliferation of non-LAPD agencies 
within the city, namely the airport police, housing police and others," 
spokesman Bill Chandler said. "It is possible that this may be the first place 
we look, but not the only one." 
</P>
<P>
Waged quietly in private meetings, the LAPD campaign to replace the airport 
police began in February, when Gates suggested to officials at the city 
Department of Airports that his officers, who maintain a small, 31-member 
detail at the airport, take over all law enforcement duties there. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD officers have complained about a lack of professionalism among airport 
police officers, saying in an internal report that "deficiencies have existed 
over a long period of time." But airport officials say they are satisfied with 
their force's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has ordered an ad hoc committee to study Gates' idea, which is opposed 
by the airport officials. The panel, made up of three LAPD representatives and 
four airport officials, met for the first time Thursday in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuvering has infuriated airport police officers, particularly because 
Gates' proposal comes after the airport department spent $1.7 million for a 
consultant to revamp the force. The airport department also spent $3 million 
for a new police station, $1 million for a new firing range and, within the 
last four years, has been allotting $3 million to $4 million a year in salaries 
for newly hired officers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disheartening," said LaPonda J. Stanford, president of the Los 
Angeles Airport Peace Officers Assn., which represents 182 union officers at 
the airport. "The airport has spent a lot of money, millions of dollars to 
professionalize us. . . . If they (LAPD) were going to take us over they should 
have done it four years ago and $7 million ago." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials, too, say they are stumped by the timing of the plan. "I am 
baffled," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the vice president of the Airport 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran created a stir two years ago when he suggested that the LAPD might be 
brought in to replace the airport police. But he now says there is no need for 
such a move. "We've really gone through a major overhaul to make that a 
first-class police department and we believe we have done that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other so-called "limited-authority," or specialized, police agencies, the 
airport police are considered peace officers under California law. They are 
trained at the same academies as sheriff's deputies and LAPD officers, are 
permitted to carry guns and to make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, such independent departments share jurisdiction with a municipal 
police force. At the airport, the officers -- who also operate alongside 
federal drug agents, customs officials, immigration authorities and FBI agents 
-- handle traffic flow, parking violations and routine arrests, while LAPD 
officers conduct criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared by Airport Police Chief Gilbert Sandoval -- 
himself a former LAPD lieutenant -- the LAX officers responded to 29,499 calls 
last year and made more than 1,100 arrests, including 350 for felonies. 
</P>
<P>
The officers consider themselves regular cops. "We have theft, we have burglary 
from motor vehicles, we even have an occasional rape," Stanford said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford and other specialized police officers said they sense a lack of 
respect from the LAPD, from sheriff's deputies and even citizens who, they say, 
often confuse them with private security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at, for instance, RTD police or the school police and they go, 
'Well, you're not real police,' " RTD Officer Shari Barberic said. 
</P>
<P>
Those feelings surfaced two weeks ago when -- under pressure from Bradley and 
the county Board of Supervisors -- the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District voted to hire sheriff's deputies, rather than its own transit police, 
to patrol the new light rail line that will connect Los Angeles to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the transit and airport police have claimed that Gates and Block 
are conspiring to force them out of business and take advantage of the money 
that pays their salaries -- money that comes not from taxpayers but from 
revenues generated by the independent city agencies that employ the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a real case of empire-building," Barberic said. "Obviously, 
we wouldn't even be here as specialized agencies if local law enforcement had 
been responsive to these specialized needs in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
According to Malmberg, limited-authority police forces have flourished because 
municipal law enforcement agencies have always been too strapped to handle the 
needs of airports, harbors and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these districts have brought in men and women as district police 
offices, have trained them and educated them and they have good, professional 
peace officers working there," Malmberg said. 
</P>
<P>
But both Block and Gates said they are concerned that, as Block said, "there 
have been too many small, specialized, limited-authority law enforcement 
agencies created." Gates, through a spokesman, expressed a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
In an unsigned internal report obtained by The Times, LAPD officers outlined a 
litany of gripes about the airport police. The report alleged that airport 
police officers write unacceptable reports, conduct improper investigations, 
use "questionable field tactics" and respond to calls outside the airport. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it complained that airport officers are usurping LAPD's duties and 
have on at least two occasions told nearby hotels and businesses that they -- 
and not the LAPD -- are the primary police force at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Although LAPD Cmdr. William Booth would not say who authored the document, he 
did confirm that it was "put together by some of our staff people . . . (and) 
it does pertain to issues that we feel need to be discussed by the committee. 
Those are real problems that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
But Donald Miller, deputy executive director of the Department of Airports, 
said the report is rife with inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
"Without going item by item, we feel that almost the entire report is 
distorted," he said. "We don't give any credibility to the report." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials and even their own police officers acknowledge that four 
years ago, the report would have indeed been accurate. "We were a police force 
in disarray," Stanford said. "Even I would have to admit that." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the force was torn apart by citizen complaints, charges of racial 
discrimination against minority officers and an LAPD investigation that 
uncovered evidence of embezzlement, extortion, conspiracy to commit bribery and 
misappropriation of public funds by officers, including its former chief. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Airports then hired consultant Joseph T. Rouzan, the former 
chief of both the Inglewood and Compton police departments, to revamp the 
beleaguered force. Rouzan, a former LAPD captain, completely reorganized the 
airport department, arranged for the officers to receive additional training 
and helped bring in new management. 
</P>
<P>
Rouzan said he cannot understand why the LAPD is complaining. "My whole program 
was to pattern that agency as close as possible to the Los Angles Police 
Department," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO FELONY CHARGES FOR OPERATION RESCUE 
LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No felony conspiracy charges will be filed against two Operation Rescue leaders 
and two other anti-abortion activists who were among 246 people arrested 
Saturday during a demonstration outside a Mid-Wilshire family planning clinic, 
prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the cases were referred to city prosecutors for the possible filing of 
misdemeanor trespassing charges, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said there was insufficient evidence to file felony conspiracy charges 
against Joseph Foreman and Jeff White, two regional leaders of the group, and 
David Douglass and William Lundy. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Qualls of the city attorney's office was unable to immediately say whether 
charges yet been filed against any of the arrestees.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TODDLER LOST AT CARNIVAL IS FOUND AFTER 16 
HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old boy missing for 16 hours after disappearing from an Easter 
carnival at a Sunland park was found Monday morning wandering in a Panorama 
City parking lot about 10 miles away, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Salazar of Panorama City was found unharmed and was reunited with his 
parents at Sunland Park about 10:15 a.m. Authorities earlier had reported that 
the family was from Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is unlikely that the boy walked from Sunland to the 8400 block of Van 
Nuys Boulevard in Panorama City, police stopped short of calling Jesse's 
disappearance a kidnaping and on Monday were still investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Tim McBride said detectives were investigating a 
report that Jesse had been seen earlier with a group of people at the shopping 
center where he was found.

WHEN AFRICANS WITHER, BORDIN WINS IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is by now a familiar sight: the start of a marathon, one of sport's most 
grueling trials, and runners from Africa shoot off the line, sprinting, with 26 
miles to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
It is a style uniquely African, and one that has proved ultimately successful. 
The world record-holder, Belayneh Dinsamo of Ethiopia, grinds down his 
opposition in this manner. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when eight African runners started Monday's 94th Boston Marathon at a 
shocking pace, there was little surprise. That the pace was not maintained was 
no surprise, either. Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania led the race to a halfway time of 
1 hour 2 minutes 1 second, an improbable 2:04 pace. 
</P>
<P>
Gelindo Bordin of Italy has seen it before, too. The Olympic champion resisted 
the urge to go with the leaders and, after their energy or legs failed them, 
Bordin patiently moved up, utilizing the fast pace to win in 2:08:19, a 
personal best and an Italian record. The world record is 2:06:50. 
</P>
<P>
The stampede at the start was an impressive sight on a warm, sunny Patriots 
Day, with more than a million spectators lining the streets to watch this 
annual spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
"It never ceases to amaze me the aggressiveness and the abandon with which the 
Africans attack a marathon," said Rob de Castella of Australia, who won here in 
1986. He placed fifth Monday. "They just go as hard as they can and keep on 
going as long as they can. It's inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
The women's race had no such wild abandon. Prerace favorite Rosa Mota of 
Portugal won in 2:25:24. Uta Pippig, who fled East Germany just before the fall 
of the Berlin Wall, was second in 2:28:03, and Maria Trujillo of Phoenix was 
third in 2:28:53. Kim Jones of Seattle, ranked No. 3 in the world, was fourth 
in 2:31:01. 
</P>
<P>
John Campbell of New Zealand set a world master's record in placing fourth in 
2:11:04. Campbell, 42, bettered Jack Foster's record of 2:11:19. Mustapha Badid 
of France won the men's wheelchair race in 1:29:53 and Jean Driscoll from 
Champaign, Ill., won the women's wheelchair race in 1:43:17. 
</P>
<P>
Bordin and Mota each won $50,000, and Mota became Boston's first female 
three-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
Ikangaa, 29, has a history of finishing second in big races. In 1988, he was 
passed by Ibrahim Hussein in the last steps of this race: Hussein won by one 
second. Ikangaa was the runner-up here last year, losing to Abebe Mekonnen of 
Ethiopia. Mekonnen also beat him by 11 seconds in Tokyo in 1988, and Ikangaa 
was beaten by three seconds in Fukuoka in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Asked the obvious question about placing second here for the third year in a 
row, Ikangaa paused then said: "Yes, it is very disappointing. But I will keep 
trying until I win." 
</P>
<P>
Bordin and the rest of the field watched in amazement as a pack of nine 
runners, including Salvador Garcia of Mexico, bolted from the start, covering 
the first mile in 4:26. 
</P>
<P>
The usually effusive Bordin had this simple assessment of the strategy: "Those 
guys were crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Bordin went with the leaders for the first few miles, while de 
Castella headed up the distant second group, a more sensible group he would 
later say. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were running fast, because I was running fast and they were out of 
sight," de Castella said. 
</P>
<P>
The lead pack was, for most of the race, an all-African group. In fact, it was 
an all-Rift Valley group, with two runners each from Tanzania, Kenya and 
Ethiopia. Ikangaa moved into the lead at four miles, and the group settled into 
an easy rhythm, passing water and sponges among themselves and, despite the 
torrid pace, looking comfortable and in control. 
</P>
<P>
The group was more than a minute under world-record pace early and showed no 
sign of breaking up. In the group were these surprises: Kip Kimeli of Kenya, 
the 1988 Olympic 10,000 meter champion; Tesfaye Tafa of Ethiopia, running in 
his first marathon, and Simon Robert Naali of Tanzania, a once-lightly regarded 
runner who placed third at the Commonwealth Games in January. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 miles, Naali dropped off the pace. Of those in the lead group, only 
Ikangaa and Hussein -- old adversaries in this race -- looked prepared to keep 
the pace as it was. Their half-marathon time of 1:02:1 was one of the fastest 
halfway marks ever. Steve Jones of Wales ran 1:01:42 in Chicago in 1985, but 
most runners say that such a pace frightens them. 
</P>
<P>
Bordin was hanging back, 46 seconds behind at the midway point, still not 
believing the pace. "I thought, 'This is crazy,' " he said. "I ran too fast the 
first half. If someone would run a 2:04, I would shake his hand. But I really 
thought something would happen." 
</P>
<P>
It did. Ikangaa first broke off from his pack, but as he gathered himself for 
his own long kick, his body unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
At 16 miles, Ikangaa made his move, dropping Hussein and pushing the pace for 
two more punishing miles, just to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to keep that pace," Ikangaa said. "I was thinking of a record. About 
that time, someone held up a sign that said we were on 2:05 pace. I was 
thinking 2:07." 
</P>
<P>
Such thoughts were short-lived, however. Running alone and squinting into a 
bright sun, Ikangaa had no idea what was unfolding behind him. Hussein and 
Naali dropped out. Bordin was methodically picking off the remnants of that 
first pack and came within sight of Ikangaa. Someone shouted to Ikangaa that 
Bordin was behind him, and both raced up Heartbreak Hill with six miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
Bordin passed Ikangaa just after they crested the hill. Then it was Ikangaa's 
turn to be left behind. The Tanzanian was unable to go with Bordin, he said, 
because of a cramp in his left calf. At that point, he began to worry about 
being caught for second. 
</P>
<P>
He never was as he finished in 2:09:52. Rolando Vera of Ecuador, running in his 
first marathon, was third in 2:10:46. 
</P>
<P>
Mota emerged from an emotional week, culminating in a long-sought agreement 
with the Portuguese federation. The agreement allows her to choose where and 
when she will run, a freedom she has not enjoyed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Mota said she was unsure if she could set aside her emotions in time for the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very nervous before the race because I didn't know if I could 
concentrate with everything that has happened," she said. "When I started 
running, I forgot everything and ran a good race. I came here today to win, not 
break my fastest time."

WEBSTER STRIVES TO STAY COOL AS STANLEY CUP CHASE HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Webster and Terry Crisp, a study in contrast. 
</P>
<P>
One is moving on in the Stanley Cup playoffs, while the other might be moving 
out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Webster appears calm, almost studious on the bench, while Crisp is fiery, 
emotional and loud. 
</P>
<P>
Webster is the epitome of decorum in public; Crisp was embarrassed during the 
series between the Kings and Calgary Flames by getting caught wiping his nose 
with his necktie on television. 
</P>
<P>
But don't be fooled. While Crisp may wear his emotions on his sleeve, Webster 
feels as much pressure in this, his first Stanley Cup playoff as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Still recovering from inner-earsurgery, he has been advised to avoid stress, 
but that's not possible this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Overtimes, double overtimes, games without Wayne Gretzky -- these are not 
situations conducive to reducing stress. 
</P>
<P>
So Webster sits on the bench and gulps down the antacid tablets stuffed into 
his pocket by his wife, Carole. 
</P>
<P>
But occasionally, the pressure boils over. 
</P>
<P>
Such as last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were in their Culver City practice rink, finishing preparations for 
Game 6 of the series against Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was in a meeting with General Manager Rogie Vachon and assistant coach 
Rick Wilson when he suddenly stormed out. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon and Wilson later insisted they couldn't imagine what had precipitated 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Webster hurried past several club officials and reporters on his way to his 
car, parked in an adjoining alley. 
</P>
<P>
Two reporters approached the car, but Webster hit the gas and sped out onto 
Sepulveda Boulevard and roared away. 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, he left a number of shaking heads and dropped jaws. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter finally reached him that night, Webster was his usual calm 
self. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a bad day," he explained. "I needed to let off a little steam. I 
took a long walk and I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
These may be the best of times for the Kings, but not when you've got your 
hands on the controls. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's biggest source of stress all year has been the midseason trade that 
brought Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom to the Kings from the New York Rangers 
for Bernie Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls has been on Webster ever since, blaming him for the trade and 
questioning his knowledge of the game, his coaching techniques and his right to 
make the move. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has seethed, but refused to respond publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, after the Kings had eliminated the Flames in six games, Nicholls struck 
again, telling The National newspaper, "What is surprising is that the Kings 
could be coached into playing some defense." 
</P>
<P>
When that remark was relayed to Webster, he replied, "They (Granato and 
Sandstrom) certainly have added what we needed to beat Calgary, speed, 
character and the willingness to do something for the team instead of worrying 
about personal satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
While Webster must now worry about his future in the playoffs, Crisp must worry 
about his future with the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Calgary were demanding his head even before the series ended. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't much more popular with some of his players, who felt he was a 
martinet. 
</P>
<P>
One, who asked that his name not be used, said before the series ended: "We 
can't lose. We either win the Stanley Cup or we get rid of Crisp." 
</P>
<P>
As he returned to Calgary, Crisp was still angry about the non-goal, the shot 
by Doug Gilmour in the first overtime of Game 6 that appeared to edge its way 
over the goal line before goalie Kelly Hrudey smothered it. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Denis Morel disallowed the goal, the Kings finally winning in the 
second overtime on Mike Krushelnyski's blind shot, fired as he lay on his 
stomach in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp, who almost knocked down the side boards as he yelled at Morel Saturday 
night, was still fuming when he talked with a Calgary reporter on the flight 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's compounding a lie," Crisp said of Morel. "One lie leads to another. You 
know the pattern. He told our guys, 'It didn't go over the line. There was no 
whistle.' Now, he's backpedaling (claiming he did blow a whistle). I mean 
that's a $700,000 call, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes I can accept. This isn't sour grapes. It's fact, point-blank, 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp added that even Webster had backed him up. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what Tommie Webster told me," Crisp said, "when we were shaking 
hands. He said, 'Crispie, that goal was yours.' Looked me right in the eye and 
said it." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the remark, Webster said he couldn't remember his exact words, 
but wouldn't rule that out. 
</P>
<P>
Said Crisp: "I could take this if, in my heart, I knew we'd lost. We won that 
game. We should be heading back home, readying ourselves to play Game 7. He 
(Morel) took it away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Kings' ailing defensemen, Tim Watters or Tom Laidlaw, are 
expected to play in Wednesday's opener of the best-of-seven Smythe Division 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw, sidelined since March 17 because of an injured lower back, is listed 
as very doubtful. Watters, sidelined since Game 4 of the series against Calgary 
because of a severe ankle bruise, is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Both John Tonelli (knee injury) and Dave Taylor (strained shoulder) are day to 
day.

OILERS WIN, 4-1, EARN CHANCE TO GET EVEN WITH KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Lamb scored a breakaway goal late in the first period at Edmonton to put 
the Oilers ahead to stay as they defeated the Winnipeg Jets, 4-1, Monday night, 
becoming only the seventh team in NHL history to win a playoff series after 
trailing by three games to one. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who blew a 3-1 lead and lost to the Kings in the Smythe Division 
semifinals last year, will get a chance to avenge that loss in the division 
finals beginning Wednesday night at the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb took a pass from Glenn Anderson and beat Stephane Beauregard at 17:52 to 
give the Oilers a 2-1 lead. After a scoreless second period, Esa Tikkanen gave 
Edmonton a two-goal lead at 5:09 of the final period before Lamb set up Jari 
Kurri's fourth goal of the series with 2:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead when he beat Beauregard, one of the Jets' 
two rookie goaltenders, at 8:54 of the opening period. But Thomas Steen fired a 
wrist shot from the right wing past Bill Ranford 27 seconds later for the Jets' 
lone goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ranford stopped 26 of 27 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the sixth for the Oilers in as many NHL playoff series with the 
Jets, who won only one of 19 games in the first five. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were 4-2-2 against the Kings during the regular season. The two 
teams have not met since Feb. 28, when they brawled their way to 356 penalty 
minutes in Los Angeles' 4-2 victory at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Minnesota 2 -- Wayne Presley and Jeremy Roenick each scored in the 
second period and the Blackhawks rolled to victory over the North Stars, 
winning their Norris Division semifinal series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, the regular-season Norris Division champion, will open the division 
finals at home Wednesday night against the St. Louis Blues, who eliminated the 
Toronto Maple Leafs in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Presley tied the score, 1-1, three minutes into the second period and put the 
Blackhawks ahead to stay at 4:06 with his fifth goal of the series. Both came 
from directly in front of goalie Jon Casey, the second on a short wrist shot 
during a delayed penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Roenick knocked in his own rebound at 12:41 for a 3-1 lead, then scored again 
at at 14:06, giving him five goals for the series. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Greg Millen stopped 30 of 32 shots for Chicago.

Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas' courtroom fight with promoter Don King was 
postponed again, at least until April 30. 
</P>

Bobby Clarke was fired as vice president and general manager by the 
Philadelphia Flyers after the team's poorest season in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flyer president Jay Snider made the announcement at a hastily called news 
conference. "After much discussion over months, we had fundamental 
differences," Snider said. "We had the same goal -- to win the Stanley Cup. We 
disagreed on how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who played for the Flyers for 15 years and was their all-time leading 
scorer, was vice president and general manager since May 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During his six years as general manager, the Flyers won three Patrick Division 
titles and two Wales Conference championships, but this season finished under 
.500 for the first time since 1971-72.

PERESTROIKA STOPS AT THE MEDAL STAND; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPICS: SOVIET SPORT OFFICIALS SAY POLITICAL REFORMS WON'T UNDERCUT THEIR 
NATION'S DESIRE FOR THE GOLD. 
</P>

<P>
When asked last week whether elite sports in the Soviet Union will survive the 
country's restructuring, known as perestroika, Alexander Kozlovsky, deputy 
chairman of the country's state-controlled sports committee, Goskomsport, 
responded with a story. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was touring Leningrad a few years ago, when a friend asked why the 
beautiful Summer Garden, built in 1720 by Peter the Great, was not destroyed 
during the Russian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Summer Garden is part of the history and the culture of the 
country," Kozlovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
He paused to make certain his message had gotten through. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply have to understand that elite sports is very important to our 
popular culture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Olympic movement in 1952, the Soviet Union has won more 
medals than any other country. In ice hockey, soccer, track and field, 
gymnastics and figure skating -- sports once dominated by other countries -- 
the Soviets have become a power. They have even won the Olympic gold medal 
twice in men's basketball. Their latest challenge: baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Although there might be significant reductions in the Olympic movements of 
nations such as East Germany, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and 
Poland as they reconsider the role of sports, sports leaders here are intent 
upon maintaining the Soviet Union's position at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard so that changes in the country do not affect us," said 
Nikolai Rusak, chairman of Goskomsport. "We think it is very easy to destroy a 
system that has been successful for many, many years. But it would be very 
difficult to reconstruct." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vitaly Smirnov, one of two Soviet members of the International Olympic 
Committee: "I hope we will survive. You realize what is going on in other 
Eastern European countries, and it is a pity. Sports are an important part of 
Soviet life. 
</P>
<P>
"People here don't want to lose at big sports." 
</P>
<P>
But as the Soviet Union grapples with one crisis after another -- independence 
movements among the republics, ethnic strife, political turmoil, an increase in 
crime, food shortages -- the importance placed on elite sports is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a speech at the Kremlin, a deputy prime minister said, "The 
brightness of gold medals is so strong that we are unable to see the problems 
in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism is directed toward Goskomsport for its emphasis on 
producing Olympic champions at the expense of mass sports. In a country that 
has the right to participate in sports written into its constitution, 
Goskomsport officials acknowledge that there are swimming pools for only 10% of 
the people and indoor gymnasiums for only 30%. Kozlovsky, a deputy chairman, 
said there are so few tennis courts that even his daughter is unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
Even recreation that does not require expensive facilities, such as jogging, is 
difficult because sporting goods factories, like most factories in the Soviet 
Union, do not manufacture enough products. Quality running shoes, as did blue 
jeans in the past, bring a premium on the black market. Asked recently what she 
would most like to have from the West, one dedicated jogger said, "Socks." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel guilty because we have not worked out a system for mass sports," Rusak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Goskomsport officials said they cannot afford to finance recreational 
sports. They said they already pay more money in taxes than they receive from 
the government, managing to stay in the black through lotteries, the sale of 
publications and sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
"The health of the nation, this is an affair of the state," said Marat Gramov, 
chairman of the national Olympic committee and an IOC member. "But the state 
has not taken this responsibility upon itself." 
</P>
<P>
Goskomsport officials have suggested a compromise. They said they will organize 
mass sports if the government will finance them. Even if that is approved, they 
expect to be frustrated. Of 600 small, prefabricated gymnasiums they sent to 
villages throughout the country last year, Kozlovsky said most were never 
assembled. Of those that were, he said, many were used for storage. 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for recreation, however, is only one problem confronting 
sports in the nation. As in virtually of all phases of Soviet life today, the 
situation is chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As republics seek independence, so do their sports teams. All Lithuanian 
teams, including two first division basketball teams that have some of the best 
players in the country, have withdrawn from Soviet leagues. Georgian soccer 
teams have also withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Individual sports federations, confident they can support themselves 
through Western sponsorships, are threatening to divorce themselves from 
Goskomsport. Soccer declared its independence but included only its first three 
divisions, leaving its three lower divisions to fend for themselves. 
Goskomsport officials fear that independent federations will no longer take 
responsibility for the early development of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trade unions, which have sponsored schools and clubs for elite athletes, 
are withdrawing their funds because members, in a time of economic hardship, 
want to decrease their dues. Lokomotiv, the union for railroad workers, closed 
its sports center last November in Donetsk, a city in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
That school's most famous alumnus, pole vaulter Sergei Bubka, was at 
Goskomsport offices in Moscow last week to sign papers for a loan that will 
enable him to re-open the center. Not always accommodating to the media in the 
past, he was gracious when he agreed to meet with U.S. reporters. He asked them 
to help him procure Western sponsors for his venture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Given their freedom by the government to sell their services abroad, 
athletes are turning professional and leaving the country. Although sports 
officials have devised a plan that allows athletes to retain 50% of their 
earnings if they give 30% to Goskomsport and 20% to the government, many 
athletes have bypassed the system. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it works in their favor. Sometimes, it does not. A women's 
basketball team in the Soviet Union traded one of its players last year to an 
Italian team for a bus and several pairs of sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The team needed the bus," Kozlovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attendance has decreased dramatically in some sports. Two games earlier 
this month in Moscow to determine the Soviet league's runner-up each drew fewer 
than 500 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We think what influences this is the social factors, the way of life," Rusak 
said. "We have problems with food supplies. After working all day, people have 
to run around to shops looking for food. This takes a lot of time."

PRINTER DISCOVERS THE KEY TO MAKING MAPS ON CLOTH; 
</P>
<P>
MANUFACTURING: TEXTILE PRINTING EXPERTS TOLD THE ENTREPRENEUR IT COULDN'T BE 
DONE, SO HE FOUND A WAY, AND HIS BUSINESS PROSPERED.

The key to Rick McEwan's growing cloth-printing business is precision: His 
topographical maps on bandannas are just as legible as their counterparts on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
His firm, Visual Dialogues, has also printed a photograph on T-shirts that only 
dragster specialists would appreciate: The photo shows a car accelerating so 
abruptly that its front wheels are off the ground. And on the rear tire, you 
can see the stress ripples in the sidewall more clearly than in a glazed-paper 
poser from the same photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Now McEwan is negotiating with a New York publishing company that says it has 
always been told by the textile-printing industry that map-quality precision 
couldn't be achieved on cloth. 
</P>
<P>
But McEwan does it, defying the experts who said it couldn't be done. 
</P>
<P>
Why should maps be on cloth? 
</P>
<P>
As defense against wind and rain, backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts 
love them. 
</P>
<P>
And why would anyone want tire sidewall ripples on T-shirts? 
</P>
<P>
For advertising aimed at auto buffs, traditionally more vulnerable to a 
well-turned-out T-shirt than to a printed poster. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan achieves his precision with screen printing. That's not the same as the 
method used in most T-shirt shops, where designs are printed before the 
customer's very eyes. The latter is a heat transfer, sticking color to cloth. 
It fades with washing. 
</P>
<P>
Screen printing puts ink into the fabric. It lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Each screen deposits tiny dots. At Visual Dialogues they are mostly 110 to 133 
dots per inch. The dots go into the most tightly woven fabrics McEwan can find, 
although some dots inevitably land in the voids where the threads aren't. 
Visual Dialogues is working on 150 per inch for a new line of maps on cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The Screen Printing Assn. International says few textile screen printers 
venture beyond 65 dots per inch, but McEwan says 85 is fairly common. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Visual Dialogues printed more than 20,000 mostly six-color 
trademarked Bandanamaps Its three dozen designs are mostly topographical maps 
of national parks, with a few cities such as San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The T-shirts showing the tire sidewall were a black and white custom job for an 
automobile company. 
</P>
<P>
Visual Dialogues also has a line of artistic or decorative -- if not poetic -- 
patterns with names such as "Powder Skier" and "Touch the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
McEwan printed his first Bandanamap three years ago at his Grass Valley home. A 
graduate of San Francisco Art Institute with a master's degree from San 
Francisco State University, McEwan experimented with painting, drawing, silk 
screening and photography. He won the first prize for photography at the 1983 
California State Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a useful map, not just a souvenir," he said during a recent tour of 
the plant. But equipment and materials fell short. "I would call up the makers 
and they would say I was asking for the impossible. I just came to the 
conclusion not to listen to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"I rebuilt the press. I altered the ink. I modified everything. I pulled a lot 
of hair out -- so to speak -- while doing it. . . . I don't feel there are any 
obstacles, only opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
As the 2,400-square-foot plant into which Visual Dialogues moved last June, 
McEwan demonstrates. 
</P>
<P>
His two silk screen presses look like whirligigs, each consisting of six 
bandanna-sized frames sticking outward and upward from spokes on a hub. 
</P>
<P>
He spreads a bandanna on a horizontal platen and reaches up for a frame whose 
bottom is covered with a tightly stretched polyester screen. It harbors a gob 
of unctuous yellow ink. 
</P>
<P>
The screen comes down flat on the bandanna. Grabbing a squeegee, McEwan forces 
yellow ink through the screen into the bandanna. He raises the frame back to 
storage position, rotates the whirligig to the red-ink frame and brings it down 
to a precise fit. The key word is "precise." 
</P>
<P>
The image emerges as McEwan repeats the process through all the colors. 
</P>
<P>
McEwan says sales rose from about $80,000 in 1988 to $150,000 in 1989, "and I 
can see that doubling again." 
</P>
<P>
Bandanamaps sell for around $7 each in national park gift shops and sports 
stores. Mail-order prices range from $4.95 to $7.95 for bandannas and $8.50 to 
$13.95 for T-shirts -- long- and short-sleeved -- and up to $18.95 for a sleep 
shirt.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Japanese stocks remain in the doldrums, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
continues to advance and is only 47 points shy of its Jan. 2 all-time high of 
2810, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego stocks remain lethargic, with a few exceptions. HomeFed Corp., 
the parent of HomeFed Bank, gained $1.625 after reporting excellent earnings in 
the first quarter of $1.48 per share, versus $1.31 for the corresponding period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The stock is still down 40% from its 1989 high of $47.50 and is selling at a 
30% discount from tangible book value, which is more than $40 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the expectations of doom in California real estate be so horrendous that 
HomeFed stock should be selling at these levels?" Katz asked. 
</P>
<P>
Five San Diego stocks managed new highs this week. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Cubic Corp., also undervalued on a book value and earnings 
basis. The stock gained $1.75, reaching a new 1990 high of $20.875. 
</P>
<P>
Mission West Properties made a new high of $9.50 on trading volume of only 
2,200 shares. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is controlled by Intermark, last week announced the sale of 
its High Bluff Del Mar office building that will result in an after-tax gain of 
$2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
DH Technology, which was favorably mentioned in last week's Barron's magazine, 
continued to move up, reaching a new high of $16.875. The largest gainer of the 
week was Magma Power, which gained $3 to a new high of $37 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Smith Laboratories, which is merging with closely held Columbia Hospital Corp., 
hit a new high of $3.81. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy statement recently mailed to shareholders for the May 16 meeting to 
approve the merger has 332 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Other good gains last week included Molecular Biosystems, up $1.875, and Price 
Co., gaining $1.50 after rebounding from its 1990 low of $34.50.

TECHNOLOGY: BIOMAGNETIC TECHNOLOGIES' 'PHYSICISTS' TOY' HAS EVOLVED INTO AN 
INSTRUMENT THAT COULD REVOLUTIONIZE TREATMENT OF BRAIN DISORDERS. THE COMPANY 
AND A MUCH LARGER COMPETITIOR ARE SCRAMBLING FOR A MARKETABLE USE FOR THE 
TECHNOLOGY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1960s, a group of UC San Diego physicists developed an experimental 
tool called a magnetometer to measure the Earth's magnetic fields. After seeing 
that there was ample demand for the device from other physicists, they formed a 
company now known as Biomagnetic Technologies to manufacture the product. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, that initial scientific device, which was once dubbed a 
physicist's toy, has evolved into a biomedical instrument that could 
revolutionize how doctors diagnose and treat brain disorders. In the process, 
Biomagnetic Technologies has been recognized as a pioneer in magnetic source 
imaging, a method of devising a map of the brain and its functions. 
</P>
<P>
But the publicly owned company is now in a product development race with 
Siemens, a much larger West German-based conglomerate, to come up with a 
marketable use for the technology. At stake is a huge market. There are 44 
million Americans afflicted with functional brain disorders who conceivably 
could benefit from such a device, the company maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Biomagnetic Technologies recently introduced a prototype product called a 
biomagnetometer that, by measuring magnetic fields created by the brain's 
electrical activity, could give doctors a "window" into the workings of the 
brain, heart and neuromuscular system. 
</P>
<P>
A wide range of studies are under way at various medical centers throughout the 
United States and Europe concerning its usefulness in diagnosis and treatment 
of brain and heart ailments such as epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and 
sleep disorders. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we prove applications, the (company's) growth could be very, very fast," 
said Biomagnetic Technologies President Stephen O. James. "We've got a unique 
technology that no one else has right now. It gives us time to try to 
commercialize this." 
</P>
<P>
The biomagnetometer is a computerized scanning device that consists of 37 
independent magnetic field detectors housed in a thermos-like container. By 
measuring the magnetic fields, medical researchers can understand not only the 
source of where that electrical activity occurs in the brain but whether it is 
normal or not. 
</P>
<P>
For example, epileptics whose seizures cannot now be managed by medication 
sometimes choose to have a portion of their brain surgically removed. The 
biomagnetometer has the potential to pinpoint the location of the brain tissue 
that causes seizures, helping save as much healthy brain tissue as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The market for such a product could far exceed that of magnetic resonance 
imaging, a medical instrument that provides an anatomic picture of the brain 
but is limited in that is does not measure brain function, James said. The new 
technology would complement magnetic resonance imaging and existing diagnostic 
high-tech devices such as ultrasound and computerized scans. 
</P>
<P>
Electroencephalograms (EEGs), for example, measure electrical activity, but 
their signals are imprecise because they are altered by tissue and distorted by 
currents within the brain. In addition, the procedure for some patients can 
take up to two weeks and cost upwards of $20,000 when electrodes are implanted 
in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic source imaging, however, is considered non-invasive, as having no 
potentially harmful effects on patients. Procedures could cost patients as 
little as $5,000, James said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial clinical results have been encouraging, said Dr. Christopher Gallen, a 
senior research associate at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic. Scripps 
and Biomagnetic Technologies recently signed an 18-month research collaboration 
agreement, the focus of which is to determine whether the detection of the 
magnetic fields can help in diagnosing and treating epilepsy, stroke and 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to make it live up to in practice to what it's promised in 
principle," Gallen said. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the implications for the medical community are enormous, Gallen 
said. The biomagnetometer is potentially revolutionary because it provides the 
"ability to look at brain activity on a millimeter basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the more precise measurements, clinicians and researchers hope to develop 
more specific and effective treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best opportunity I've ever had to work on something potentially so 
important," Gallen said. "It has the potential to tell about the basic 
underlying nature of our humanness." 
</P>
<P>
That the technology could be used to manufacture a medical device has come as 
something of a surprise to the company's founders. 
</P>
<P>
The company was founded in 1970 by UCSD physicist John Wheatley and colleagues 
to develop magnetic sensing devices used for a variety of laboratory and 
commercial purposes, including the detection of subterranean mineral and oil 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific instrument, called a magnetometer, is still sold by the company 
to physicists, said Gene Hirschkoff, vice president for technology who has been 
with the firm since its inception, when it was called S.H.E. Corp. Hirschkoff 
and several others now with the company were students of Wheatley, who died in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the turning point for Biomagnetic Technologies came in the mid-1970s, when 
medical researchers approached it about using the magnetometer to study the 
brain. By 1982, refinements of the device had allowed UCLA researchers to 
pinpoint the location of brain tissue that was causing a patient's epileptic 
seizures. That breakthrough led to the company's strategic refocus. 
</P>
<P>
James was recruited by the company's board of directors in 1984 to help the 
company develop medical applications of what became known as "biomagnetism." At 
the time, he viewed the company as "an entrepreneur's dream" because no one 
else possessed the technology, James said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Biomagnetic Technologies has sold more than 50 of its devices at 
prices of up to $2 million or more. The company's market is highly specialized, 
consisting of about 450 advanced medical research centers in the United States, 
Western Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But other medical equipment manufacturing firms are now moving in. Siemens 
Medical Systems, a large West German-based medical equipment manufacturer, is 
Biomagnetic Technologies' closest competitor, according to trade analysts. 
James acknowledges that he can "hear the hoofbeats" of Siemens and others. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Freiherr, principal owner and medical technology market analyst for the 
consulting firm of Silver Spring-based Gregory Freiherr Inc., said that 
Biomagnetic Technologies is staking out future ground in a very narrowly 
defined market. 
</P>
<P>
Siemens, with its strong corporate backing and foundation in the medical 
equipment industry, is formidable competition, Freiherr said. "Who's going to 
come out on top in the future is anybody's guess," Freiherr said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the first head-on battle between Siemens and Biomagnetic Technologies 
ended favorably for the San Diego company. It occurred last year when both were 
vying to sell a magnetic source-imaging machine to a research institute funded 
by the West German government. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart fell into my stomach, though, because traditionally the German 
government has been very gracious in supporting Siemens," James said. "We were 
facing a situation where I thought we would be at a great disadvantage, that 
the cards were really stacked against us. But we went ahead and bid anyway. I 
figured, frankly, we had nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Ten German "referees" were assigned by the West German government to determine 
who had the better system. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all German referees, and it was a German researcher and German 
government money," James said. 
</P>
<P>
The results? Nine out of the 10 referees chose the Biomagnetic Technologies 
instrument, James said. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat them under the most difficult of circumstances. And we charged our 
full price, we didn't try to win the situation by trying to discount the 
equipment or offering other incentives," James said. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-million order was the first sale of the company's prototype. Delivery is 
slated for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that success, Larry Haimovitch, a medical technology analyst with the 
San Francisco-based investment banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; 
Birney, said the biomagnetometer "still (has) some ways to go. . . . It has to 
be proven that it has a real role in day-to-day medicine. It also needs to come 
down in price. It's a very exciting technology that needs to be seasoned." 
</P>
<P>
James concedes that his company is in something of a race against time. If 
Biomagnetic Technologies takes five years or more to come up with a marketable 
product, rather than the two- to five-year period that the company now targets, 
the company will have a hard time raising sufficient funds to remain operating. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got a very fair chance right now," said James, noting that the 
company has $20 million in cash in the bank, much of it raised in its initial 
public stock offering last summer. "We're very well financed for being a small 
company. There are not very many companies that have twice as much cash in the 
bank (as) annualized revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of an early version of the biomagnetometer generated $10 million in 
revenue in the fiscal year that ended September, 1989, up from $6.7 million in 
1988 sales. But the company suffered a $5.5-million loss last year, largely 
because of development costs related to the new prototype. The company also 
wrote off $1.5 million in inventory as obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs more than 130 scientists, engineers, technicians and sales 
personnel in Sorrento Valley.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PINKERTON'S RIVAL SUES OVER PERSONALITY TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pinkerton's Inc., a large security guard company based in Van Nuys, said it was 
sued by rival Guardsmark Inc., which alleged that Pinkerton's engaged in unfair 
and deceptive trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
The suit reportedly stems from Pinkerton's use of a "personality assessment" 
test used to screen security guards. Guardsmark, a security services concern 
based in Memphis, Tenn., claimed it has licensed the test from the University 
of Minnesota and that Pinkerton's is not licensed. 
</P>
<P>
Guardsmark's suit seeks to stop Pinkerton's from using the test or advertising 
its testing program. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this lawsuit to be entirely without merit," Gerard S. Brown, 
Pinkerton's executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS EXPECTS $41-MILLION LOSS FOR '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. said it expects to report a 
$41-million loss for 1989 and that it needs a $55-million line of credit and a 
$15-million cash infusion to keep operating. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo-based company, which is one of the nation's biggest wheelchair 
producers, previously had indicated that it would post a major loss for the 
year because of restructuring costs, inventory writedowns and start-up costs 
for new products. 
</P>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings said its controlling stockholder, Industrial Equity 
(Pacific) Ltd., recently made an $8.1-million investment in the company in 
addition to its original stock purchases, and that it is willing to provide yet 
another $15 million in cash that the company needs. 
</P>
<P>
That second investment is subject to several conditions, including the 
company's ability to get the $55 million in credit from its banks, the company 
said. Industrial Equity is controlled by New Zealand financier Ronald Brierley. 
</P>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings, at Industrial Equity's request, also proposed to 
consolidate its Class A and Class B common shares into a single class, subject 
to shareholders' approval. Each Class B share has 10 times the voting power of 
the Class A stock, and Industrial Equity currently owns about 51% of the Class 
B shares.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DAMON GROUP TO SELL UNIT FOR $12 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damon Group Inc., which recently changed its name from American Magnetics 
Corp., said it agreed to sell its electronic products business to the U.S. 
subsidiary of a European company, System 4 International B.V., for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale completes the transformation of the Sherman Oaks company from an 
electronics concern making card readers, like those used to operate bank teller 
machines, to a medical testing lab business. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation began last spring when American Magnetics acquired control 
of Massachusetts-based Damon Corp., a company that operates a string of labs 
that perform medical services like urine and blood tests, in a deal worth about 
$317 million. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, American Magnetics' chief business was making the card readers. But 
after the acquisition of Damon, the company's sales came 80% from medical 
services, 19% from electronics and about 1% from commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the electronic card reader business completes Damon's strategic 
shift.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MICROPOLIS REPORTS LOSS OF $1.1 MILLION FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Micropolis Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer data-storage equipment, said 
it lost $1.1 million in the first quarter, compared with a $13.3-million loss a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss came on a 6% drop in Micropolis' revenue -- to $75.9 million 
from $80.6 million -- in the quarter ended March 30. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the loss on a shortage of circuit boards used in producing 
its disk drives. Micropolis said orders for its products, however, were running 
about 10% ahead of a year earlier.

About 2,000 people marched to a Soviet air force base to protest the accidental 
explosion of two missiles, the East German news service ADN reported. 
Demonstrators gathered at the Tutow base near Neubrandenburg to demand a halt 
to the use of live ammunition by planes on training flights and to call for the 
closing of the base, ADN said. It said the demonstration was prompted by an 
accident last week in which two missiles from a Soviet fighter plane exploded, 
damaging five farm silos.

RUSCHA: GOOFY, POPULAR, PROFOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE MCKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling into town in the early '60s from his native Oklahoma, Ed Ruscha 
established himself as the fair-haired boy of West Coast art, and it doesn't 
look as though that's ever going to change. Women love him (he's handsome, 
witty and has the bashful good manners of a Midwesterner), critics find his 
style of Pop Conceptualism suitable for heavy theorizing, he's extremely 
prolific, and his work -- which is amazingly, consistently good -- is wildly 
popular. Why do people like this art so much? The answer to that question can 
be found in a survey of Ruscha prints on view at the Richard Green Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Ruscha's work is visually quite yummy. He has an impeccable sense 
of composition and a delightfully whimsical feeling for color. However, the 
fundamental appeal of his work lies elsewhere; it's the posture this art 
strikes that's so seductive. 
</P>
<P>
This showcase of 90 works dating from 1962 through 1990 finds Ruscha exploring 
a diversity of themes (loneliness, language and desire to name a few). However, 
regardless of where he shifts his gaze, he greets the world with the same wry 
smile, a goofy pun, a blank stare. It's hard to think of an artist with a 
lighter touch, yet his work has soul and the weight of deep intelligence as 
well -- and therein lies the genius of this art. Ruscha acknowledges the 
considerable difficulties of being a human being in the 20th Century -- he's 
clearly tuned in to the Zeitgeist -- yet his work is virtually Angst free. 
Consequently, it's oddly reassuring and soothing. 
</P>
<P>
In perusing this show, one is struck by the fact that despite Ruscha's high 
profile, he remains something of a mystery. Like Jasper Johns (whose work 
Ruscha's resembles in several significant ways), Ruscha has always kept his own 
private agenda out of his work and it's impossible to gauge his ideology or 
personal travails from his cryptic visual wordplay. It's safe to conclude, 
however, that he has a rather black sense of humor. In a 1978 print titled 
"I've Never Seen Two People Looking Healthier," for instance, we find two 
minuscule human figures dwarfed by a vast landscape; they look crushed, 
insignificant and not remotely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
In seeing 28 years of Ruscha's work marching down the wall in chronological 
order, one also observes this artist to be evolving in a rather unorthodox 
fashion. Typically, artists get the heavy Sturm und Drang out of the way during 
early and mid career, and then go lyrical. Now in his early 50s, Ruscha seems 
to be growing increasingly bleak and stormy with the years. The bright Popsicle 
colors of his early work have disappeared, and we now find him working in a 
dark, chiaroscuro style, doing haunted portraits of howling coyotes and lonely 
suburban houses, and giving his work titles like "Yesterday's Treasures" and 
"Time Is Up." His work has always had an edge, but the edge seems to be getting 
sharper as of late. At 2036 Broadway, Santa Monica, through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
From Pop to Pound: Pioneering Appropriationist Richard Pettibone spent the '60s 
turning out miniature replicas of Pop masterworks, and he still resorts to 
brazen borrowing as his chief mode of art making. But, where he once recycled 
the work of his contemporaries with a cynical sneer, he now regards his primary 
sources with deep respect. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pettibone's new body of work on view at the Michael Kohn Gallery, is 
essentially a mash note to Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi, the 
furniture-making traditions of the Shaker community, and the great irascible 
crank of American letters, Ezra Pound. At a glance this might seem an 
ill-matched trio, but Pettibone succeeds in synthesizing them into a cohesive 
whole by underscoring the fact that they share a common approach to the notion 
of transcendence; the qualities of rigor, devotion and simplicity are 
characteristic of each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Fashioning lovingly crafted psuedo-Shaker end tables that are either inscribed 
with passages by Pound or treated as pedestals for miniature replicas of 
Brancusi sculptures, Pettibone might appear to have wandered far afield from 
his earlier work with these pieces -- which he describes as metaphors for 
religious beliefs. In fact, the work makes perfect sense. Pettibone's work has 
always questioned the importance of originality, and similarly, the Shaker 
tradition views art as an act of service and selflessness rather than a vehicle 
for the assertion of one's own personality. (Having spent the past 21 years 
living in the New York countryside alongside various Shaker enclaves, Pettibone 
is well acquainted with Shaker philosophy and has amassed a collection of 
Shaker pieces, one of which -- a chair -- is included in this show). 
</P>
<P>
Brancusi was revered for his ability to reduce natural forms to a simple 
symphony of volumes and planes, and Pound, of course, was a notoriously arcane 
and ambitious intellect who spent his life in furious pursuit of the sublime. 
Pettibone quotes from Pound's "Cantos," the epic poem that occupied him 
throughout his life, as well as from Pound's controversial translation of the 
writings of Confucius. Pound showed a slight lapse of judgment during World War 
II when he came out in support of the Fascists -- a faux pas that earned him 
several years in a mental hospital. Nonetheless, the extremity of some of his 
ideas and his willingness to scream them to the heavens have made him an 
inspirational, if increasingly obscure figure to romantic souls everywhere. 
It's a pleasant surprise to encounter him in an art gallery, and Pettibone does 
a masterful job of interweaving the brilliance of Pound with the beauty of 
Brancusi and the Shaker tradition. The cumulative effect of this show is 
comparable to Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet"; it's like a profound and 
encouraging pep talk. At 920 Colorado, through May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Imitation of Life: New York artist Dennis Levinthal, whose work is on view at 
the Pence Gallery, is one of the current crop of artists smitten with the body 
of thought popularized by French theoretician Jean Baudrillard. Mass media have 
infiltrated our collective psyche to its very core, goes the battle cry of this 
ideological revolution. Movies, history, fact, fiction and our private dreams 
have merged to form a rancid puddle of second-hand experience. The mythologies 
that once gave meaning to human experience have been enlisted as sales tools 
and debased, and Joseph Campbell isn't around anymore to direct us to a new set 
of fables. Yes, the water is indeed rising at an alarming rate as the media -- 
voracious beasts that feed on our dreams -- grow increasingly sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Levinthal expresses his distress about this state of affairs in 
computer-generated photographs of plastic toys (it makes an odd kind of sense, 
using patently fake materials to explore issues of authenticity). Previous 
series found Levinthal exploring World War II, and the West; this time out he 
tackles eros and the American woman in a series titled "American Beauties." 
Little plastic dolls with Betty Grable bodies (some in bathing suits, some 
nude), Levinthal's beauties pose on patches of sand washed in eerie lighting -- 
the sky is black over this imaginary beach and these gals appear to be 
sunbathing on the moon. The dolls are anonymous and interchangeable and 
Levinthal's treatment -- the lighting, the photographic quality he achieves, 
etc. -- serve to embalm the myth under examination here. Drained of texture and 
dimension, reduced to a cheap bit of plastic, the fantasy of the American 
beauty is laid to rest. Admirably skillful though Levinthal is -- he makes his 
point quite effectively -- he doesn't leave the viewer feeling particularly 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are sculptures by James Ford. Gleaming with sci-fi grandeur, the 
works pulsate with the cruel power of instruments of torture. They feel creepy 
-- as well they should, as they take as their central theme the making and 
administration of medication. Hard hit by AIDS, the art world is increasingly 
turning to the themes of human mortality and the failure of science, and Ford 
asserts these concerns in the forms he favors -- basins, flasks, globes, 
blades, beakers and needles. He then doubles back and disguises his theme in 
his use of sensual materials -- rusted steel, buffed ebony, polished copper and 
aluminum. An attractively subtle artist, Ford is overt in just one piece; "Big 
Needle," a menacing spear with its tip poised against a mirror, is an 
exquisitely clear metaphor for the rituals of illness. At 908 Colorado Ave., 
through May 19.

A BATTLE FOR THURSDAY NIGHT IS SHAPING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mysteries of ABC's groundbreaking "Twin Peaks" series are twofold for TV -- 
whether it will encourage more original shows, and whether it's a flash in the 
pan or will hold up in the ratings, thereby providing a crack in NBC's potent 
Thursday lineup led by Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrows were raised last week when "Twin Peaks," a droll Gothic soap opera set 
in the Pacific Northwest, made a muscular ratings debut. The two-hour pilot 
ranked No. 5 for the week, with 33% of the national audience. 
</P>
<P>
But what really made ABC and other network executives sit up and take notice 
was when the first "Twin Peaks" episode in its regular time slot, 9-10 p.m. 
Thursdays -- against the virtually impregnable "Cheers" -- also did well. 
</P>
<P>
It lost to "Cheers" respectably, with 26% of the audience compared to 33% for 
the veteran sitcom, but beat "Grand" and registered an excellent 27% tune-in 
for the entire hour. 
</P>
<P>
This week's national ratings, scheduled for release today, will reflect last 
Thursday's impressive showing by "Twin Peaks." But the remaining half-dozen 
episodes this season, starting this Thursday, may be more indicative of the 
show's staying power because many viewers undoubtedly tuned in last week to see 
how the cliffhanger of the April 8 debut was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. That's the whole idea. This a continuing mystery, and the appeal of 
the show is in its original style and characters and its observations of human 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has the most to lose in ratings competition if "Twin Peaks" holds steady 
because the much-talked-about series has already shown that the Thursday lineup 
anchored by "The Cosby Show" and "Cheers" may finally be vulnerable. And since 
it's the night that is the backbone of NBC, any real challenger is dangerous to 
the No. 1 network. 
</P>
<P>
How "Twin Peaks" fares from here on in is especially important because "The 
Cosby Show" is in its sixth season, "Cheers" is in its eighth and neither will 
be around forever. Cosby is a franchise-maker: "Family Ties" became a hit 
following it, and "A Different World," now in that coveted slot, would never 
have gotten off the ground except for Cosby's show. 
</P>
<P>
Even if "Twin Peaks" holds on, Thursdays will continue to be NBC's for the 
foreseeable future. But, besides showing that inroads can be made 
competitively, "Twin Peaks" also came along at a critical juncture -- the month 
before ABC, CBS and NBC decide on their fall prime-time lineups. And it just 
could be that the Big Three networks, under fire for a previously lackluster 
season, may get the message that viewers are wide open to new ideas and 
original programming. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly significant at a time when viewers are defecting to cable, 
VCRs and independent stations. Last Thursday's "Twin Peaks" showed how one show 
can have an effect in reversing that trend. During the first half hour of "Twin 
Peaks," 70% of the national audience was watching the three networks, compared 
to 64% the week before. The second half hour had a three-network audience of 
65%, compared to 60% for the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
"If that keeps up, maybe it can help bring people back to network TV," said an 
ABC official. 
</P>
<P>
Further indicating how an original show can have an impact all on its own, 
"Twin Peaks" succeeded last Thursday even though it was scheduled on a 
low-rated ABC night and then was plopped down between two series with less than 
spectacular audience appeal, "Father Dowling Mysteries" and "PrimeTime Live." 
Yet "Twin Peaks" did well, and therefore perhaps has already served its purpose 
as a sign-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's strategy going into the Thursday kamikaze mission was simple: "Cheers" 
will automatically get one-third of the audience, and the rest of the viewers 
are looking for something different, so let's give them something different. 
The strategy worked in its first try, at least. 
</P>
<P>
And ABC is attempting to spread the image of that difference by encouraging 
viewers to tape "Twin Peaks" -- a clever acknowledgement that "Cheers" has a 
dedicated audience, but one that might be won over by an opportunity to watch 
both shows. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's Thursday outing also broke the myth that only younger TV viewers 
are looking for something different. While "Twin Peaks" did well with the 
audience of women 18-to-49 coveted by sponsors, it did even better with women 
older than 50. Fewer men tuned in than women, but the audience was about the 
same for both young adult and older males.

D'OYLY CARTE'S 'MIKADO' AND 'PIRATES' DUE IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain will present 
Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The Pirates of Penzance" Oct. 16-21 at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusive engagement will be the first visit by the company to the United 
States since 1978 and is part of the Festival of Britain/Orange County 
co-sponsored by the South Coast Plaza mall in Costa Mesa and the British 
consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Originally formed in 1876 by Gilbert, Sullivan and impresario Richard D'Oyly 
Carte, the company was considered the bastion of authentic G&amp;S tradition 
for 107 years. But the D'Oyly Carte closed in 1982, after suffering increasing 
criticism for stagnant productions and declines in vocal and musical standards 
as well as box-office and subsidy woes. 
</P>
<P>
The present company, which is run by Richard Condon, was launched in 1988 with 
part of a $1.7-million bequest from the late Dame Bridget D'Oyly Carte, 
granddaughter of Richard D'Oyly Carte. Bridget D'Oyly Carte died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
OCPAC President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday that "Mikado" and "Pirates" will 
be presented to American audiences because "they are the two operas the company 
resumed production with (in 1988) and . . . these were the only two available 
for export." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said that the Center would be interested in bringing the D'Oyly Carte 
back, but probably could not afford another exclusive visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously subsidizing (this engagement) to a larger extent . . . than we 
would if they were on a national tour," Kendrick said. "We could not do this 
again. There would have to be a national tour." 
</P>
<P>
Four performances of each opera will be presented in Orange County: "The 
Mikado," directed by John Wells, at 8 p.m., Oct. 16-19; "Pirates," directed by 
Keith Warner of the English National Opera, at 2 and 8 p.m. on Oct. 20 and 21. 
The company is bringing its own orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets, priced at $12-$39, will go on sale approximately six weeks before the 
engagement. Information: (714) 556-2787.

GROSS LEADS SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the search continues for a music director for the Santa Monica Symphony, 
hopes for finding one might have risen since Sunday night at Civic Auditorium. 
That's when Allen Robert Gross, the third of four contenders this season vying 
for the post, led the ensemble competently, if not exceptionally. 
</P>
<P>
As a conductor, Gross approaches a score cautiously, but still lets the 
orchestra produce a spirited, full sound under good control. His is a style 
that painstakingly attempts to indicate most entrances and nuances, no matter 
how insignificant, and actually succeeds much of the time, crisply and lucidly. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the evening, Dvorak's flowing, sentimental Eighth Symphony, 
received intelligent attention as Gross tautly shaped every phrase. Although 
the performance sometimes sacrificed Romanticism for sturdy architecture, a 
pleasing balance between the two was preserved. 
</P>
<P>
A few minor mishaps, especially by the horns, caused more than a few grimaces. 
Yet under the circumstances -- inside a boomy hall complete with screaming 
children, audience members continually wandering the aisles and even the 
occasional pop of a soda can opening -- one had to marvel at the overall 
quality of the free event. 
</P>
<P>
In Mozart's Flute Concerto in D, careful attention to phrasing and tempos 
produced a more deliberate, though ultimately convincing, reading than usual. 
Flutist David Shostac raced through the three movements with agility, but found 
less inspiration in giving the work a pronounced stylistic direction. 
</P>
<P>
Gross opened the evening with a dramatic performance of Beethoven's "Egmont" 
Overture. GREGG WAGER

SOVIETS RAISE OBSTACLES TO NEW ARMS PACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. TOTH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union in recent weeks has been backing away from or qualifying a 
number of important arms control deals, including the agreement for a ceiling 
of 195,000 U.S. and Soviet troops in Central Europe, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and non-government experts blame the problem on a new assertiveness 
by the Soviet military. Worried about the nation's security as its East 
European alliance crumbles and a unified Germany emerges, the Red Army has 
pushed Moscow to reopen old issues that were considered settled and raised new 
ones to bedevil the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "cracks the whip soon," as one 
official put it last week, the new Soviet positions could prevent him and 
President Bush from agreeing in principle on the START nuclear arms reduction 
treaty at their May 30 summit meeting. They could also prolong negotiations on 
the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) talks beyond this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze have tended to 
dismiss the new obstacles, many of which arose during Shevardnadze's visit here 
two weeks ago, as minor problems that crop up inevitably in the closing phases 
of negotiations. But U.S. officials are concerned that they may present serious 
new difficulties, and they fear that the rising influence of the Soviet Defense 
Ministry may not be a passing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"A danger to Gorbachev exists in the potential coalescing of three very unhappy 
groups in the Soviet Union," explained a senior U.S. analyst. "The nomenklatura 
(privileged party and government bureaucrats); Russian nationalists, 
particularly in the non-Russian republics, and the military. 
</P>
<P>
"He's being extra careful now not to alienate any of them, taking greater 
account particularly of the military's positions," the official added. "It's an 
open question how long it will last." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that the CFE negotiations have been slowed down by German 
unification," according to Harvard Prof. Joseph Nye, an arms control expert, 
who said that the Soviets see the CFE as their best means for controlling 
German armament. "It's implausible that they would set limits on U.S. and 
Soviet forces and not on the unified German army as well." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing this view, Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the private Arms Control 
Assn., said, "The Soviets don't care where the question of unified Germany's 
forces will be settled -- at CFE or the 'two-plus-four' talks on German 
unification -- but they want a handle on it as their first priority." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III believed that all of the CFE troop issues 
had been settled in Ottawa in February. At that time, the superpowers agreed 
that each could station up to 195,000 soldiers in the central zone of Europe -- 
mainly in East and West Germany -- and the United States could have an extra 
30,000 around the periphery of the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
But later, the Soviets, at the CFE talks in Vienna, said the 195,000 figure was 
contingent on establishing an overall ceiling of all forces in the central 
region, not just those belonging to the United States and the Soviet Union. 
More specifically, they want a limit of 750,000 troops for the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, including all West German, American and other allied 
troops, and an equal limit on the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow made little effort to hide the fact that its larger purpose was to use 
the CFE negotiations to set a limit on the forces of a unified Germany, which 
seems likely to become part of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
The West German military consists of about 450,000 men and women, while East 
Germany has had about 150,000 in its armed forces, for an all-German total of 
about 600,000. The Soviets want a unified Germany to have no more than 300,000 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
When the United States complained that the Soviets were reneging on the Ottawa 
agreement, Moscow backtracked to accept the 195,000-troop ceiling as firm for 
U.S. and Soviet forces, U.S. officials said. But its CFE negotiators continue 
to insist that an overall ceiling of about 750,000 be set for each side in the 
central zone. The central region includes West Germany, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position is that such a ceiling should be negotiated in future CFE 
talks. U.S. officials also refuse to allow the issue of personnel to be raised 
within the "two-plus-four" talks because it would smack of imposing a troop 
ceiling on the unified Germany. The "two-plus-four" talks involve East and West 
Germany and the four major victors in World War II: Britain, France, the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Nye argues that the German unification issue has also made the Soviet military 
skittish on the START treaty, which Bush and Gorbachev promised to initial at 
the May 30-June 3 summit and then formally sign later this year. 
</P>
<P>
But most U.S. officials believe Soviet reversals on nuclear issues are more a 
reflection of the longstanding objections of the Soviet military to some START 
terms, as well as a new effort to limit the threat of U.S. cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet military has also complained that it was not represented at a key 
U.S.-Soviet meeting in Moscow in February when major Soviet concessions were 
made, according to knowledgeable U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, it now insists that Marshall Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former army 
chief of staff but now Gorbachev's military adviser, no longer represents the 
Soviet military chiefs when he attends negotiations, as he did in February. 
</P>
<P>
In a small but embarrassing example, Akhromeyev in February agreed that U.S. 
B-52 bombers could carry up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) but that 
they be counted against the START weapon ceilings as if they carried only 10 
ALCMs. U.S. negotiators then proposed that Soviet bombers, which are somewhat 
smaller, could carry 16 ALCMs but only be counted as carrying eight weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev waved aside the offer of 16, saying the Soviet bombers could carry a 
maximum of 12. Surprised, U.S. diplomats agreed that the number should be 12. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Soviets want the right to carry up to 16 missiles on their bombers. The 
U.S. side will agree, since it proposed that number initially. 
</P>
<P>
Other Soviet changes were not so benign. Until now, the Soviets had agreed that 
only those bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons were to count against the 
START ceilings. Now the Soviets want to count all heavy bombers, including 
those configured to carry only conventional bombs or even electronic gear. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also proposed for the first time that within the overall START 
ceiling of 6,000 nuclear weapons, a sub-ceiling be put on the number of ALCMs 
and ALCM-carrying bombers. Until now, START sub-ceilings have been only for the 
more dangerous ballistic missile warheads, and each side would have been free 
to opt for more ALCMS by cutting back on ballistic missile warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The most egregious of the Soviet reversals, however, deals with sea-launched 
cruise missiles (SLCMs), which are not formally part of the START agreement but 
which are to be handled in parallel with that treaty. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Soviets agreed that each side would make a public declaration 
of how many weapons it intended to build. Now the Soviets want a legally 
binding agreement, a ceiling on the number that may be built and verification 
provisions to ensure compliance, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A final issue that could complicate the START talks in the next six weeks is 
the possibility of banning multiple warhead (or MIRV) missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In a personal letter to Gorbachev last month, Bush proposed that land-based, 
mobile MIRV missiles be eliminated from both arsenals. This would eliminate the 
10-warhead Soviet SS-24 missiles that are carried in railroad cars and prevent 
deployment of the 10-warhead U.S. MX missiles on railroad cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev did not reject or accept the proposal per se, according to officials, 
although he noted that MIRV missiles on submarines are also mobile. "He just 
seemed to be saying, 'Don't complicate my life with this issue now,' " one U.S. 
official said.

EARTH DAY -- BIG BUSINESS JUMPS ON THE BANDWAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a ragtag band of environmentalists kicked off Earth Day 20 years ago, it 
was as much a protest against "The Establishment" as an affirmation of 
environmental consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
There were teach-ins and protest rallies. Sledgehammer-wielding students 
smashed gas-guzzling cars and buried them on campus to protest air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of that first mobilization could not have predicted that two decades 
later Earth Day 1990 would become one of the biggest marketing gimmicks since 
Burma Shave's rhyming roadside signs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a veritable feeding frenzy among corporations about what roles they 
will play on Earth Day," said Joanna Hanes, senior vice president at Daniel J. 
Edelman Inc., a nationwide public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
From aerosol spray cans and plastic garbage bags to plant foods and disposable 
diapers, Big Business has jumped on the environmental bandwagon in a big way in 
anticipation of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
A British airline is promising to plant a tree for every passenger who flies 
between Los Angeles and London in 1990 to reduce global warming and combat 
deforestation. The steel industry is extolling its product as "100% 
recyclable." 
</P>
<P>
A manufacturer of hair care products tells the press how it helped clean up 
damage from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. (Its shampoo was used on 
oil-covered sea otters). McDonalds restaurants prepares to launch a 
$100-million program -- dubbed "Mac-Recycle, U.S.A" -- to remodel its eateries 
and build new ones with recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
How did Earth Day move from street theater and hand-lettered picket signs to 
Madison Avenue in just 20 years? Is business truly concerned about a world in 
distress or is all the hoopla just another marketing strategy aimed at 
capitalizing on the latest rage? 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders insist that their interest is genuine. They say their 
environmental activism is prompted by demands by consumers and stockholders 
alike for environmentally sound business practices and products. At the same 
time, by becoming involved, corporations build credibility and influence 
government policy, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day is providing them with an unrivaled opportunity to get the message 
across. The effort, however, is not without its skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Rifkin, an environmental activist who heads the Foundation on Economic 
Trends in Washington, laughed when he recently opened his mail to find a 
pamphlet advertising a conference on how companies can change their image with 
"green lifestyling" and "green imagery." 
</P>
<P>
"Give me a break!" Rifkin said. "What's happening is everyone's moving into 
green. I don't have a problem with that, but you've got to bear witness to the 
coming of the kingdom here. You've got to pay your dues." 
</P>
<P>
Christina L. Desser, executive director of Earth Day 1990, has similar 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Desser rails against advertisements such as the one placed by an auto maker 
that depicted a snow-capped mountain peak and evergreen trees. Above the 
picture was a headline proclaiming 20 years of "environmental progress" since 
Earth Day 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they are marketing cars is every bit as obscene as using scantily clad 
females," Desser fumed. "I think it's going to backfire on these corporations 
that think a plain, green wrapper is going to turn them into an 
environmentalist in the public's eye."

Indeed, after protests from environmentalists, the Mobil Corp. last month 
decided to remove the word "degradable" from boxes of its Hefty plastic trash 
bags, conceding that it was irrelevant that a chemical added to the product 
causes it to break down in sunlight. Most of the bags wind up buried in 
landfills anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, 706 new "green products" have hit supermarket shelves, 
a rate 20 times higher than for all other new product introductions combined, 
according to Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd., a Naples, N.Y., product 
research firm. Most were organically grown foods and beverages, followed by 
products with biodegradable or photo-degradable contents or packaging, and 
detergents and cleaners with little or no phosphates. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing so-called green products in just about every kind of product 
category," the research firm's president, Richard Lawrence, said. 
</P>
<P>
A survey last July by the Michael Peters Group, a leading product and design 
consultant in New York, found that 77% of Americans say their buying habits are 
influenced by a company's environmental reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would ignore the figures at our peril," said Simon Williams, 
president and chief executive officer of the Michael Peters Group. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, StarKist Seafood Co. announced it would no longer buy tuna 
caught with nets that also kill dolphins. The StarKist announcement was quickly 
matched by two competitors, Bumble Bee Seafoods and the Van Camp Seafood Co., 
which markets Chicken of the Sea. The three companies account for 75% of tuna 
eaten in the United States. The moves were widely hailed by environmental 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Also last week, Shell Oil Co. introduced the first reformulated premium 
unleaded gasoline, saying it would reduce carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons -- 
one of the major ingredients of photochemical smog. Arco introduced a 
reformulated regular gasoline last year. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies are joining a veritable who's who of American businesses -- 
Colgate-Palmolive, Lever Brothers, 3M, Du Pont Co. and Proctor &amp; Gamble 
among them -- who have rallied under the environmental banner. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very good, solid business reasons why certain firms are going to 
want to be more cooperative with the environmental movement than they were in 
the '70s," said Gary Miller, a professor of political economy at Washington 
University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons go far beyond marketing. Over the years, environmental regulations 
imposed on businesses have increased their costs dramatically. Businesses have 
been in the position of merely reacting to the initiatives by government and 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Now, corporations say they want to become more involved in creating the laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the environment important? I say yes, emphatically yes," Kenneth Derr, 
chairman and chief executive officer of the Chevron Corp., told 300 employees 
in San Francisco last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Compliance is no longer enough. We have to look ahead, anticipate change and 
anticipate problems," Derr said. "It is clear the concept of integration of 
environmental planning is critical to the business planning process." 
</P>
<P>
Even before many companies jumped on the environmental bandwagon, the Chemical 
Manufacturing Assn. put a voluntary waste reduction program into effect. Later, 
when the federal government moved to impose waste reduction standards, it 
adopted many of the guidelines that had been created by the 177-company 
association in 1986. The federal standards took effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We got ahead of the issue. We can comply with this law," said Bryant 
Fischback, staff environmental consultant with the Dow Chemical Co. in 
Pittsburg, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
More and more businesses also are learning how to avoid environmental problems 
before they occur. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in developing crisis management skills -- how to deal with a crisis 
and how to avoid it in the first place -- has doubled over the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very, very hot," said crisis management expert Howard Marder, a 
senior vice president of Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., one of the world's largest 
public relations firms. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to be considered polluters, people who are adding to the 
problems. . . . The burden on companies is tremendous in terms of their image, 
if nothing else, but also in terms of the way they are affected when people go 
to buy a product," Marder said in a telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
A poor public image can also be disturbing to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, for example, California Controller Gray Davis, one of the trustees 
for two California public employee pension funds, met with Exxon Chairman 
Lawrence G. Rawl to push for what Davis called sounder environmental policies. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl had reason to listen. The two California public employee pension funds 
have a combined $86-billion investment portfolio, including Exxon stock. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the concerns over maximizing profits and keeping ahead of the 
regulators, some business leaders say they just want to do what's right when it 
comes to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bottom-line profit-oriented argument for a lot of this, but I think 
if it weren't for the fact that there are people in business firms that are 
sympathetic in the first place they wouldn't be able to explore these kinds of 
actions," economist Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
That claim still may be a hard sell to some environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have this as a cosmetic movement," said Arctic explorer and 
environmentalist Will Steger. "Everybody's taking on the cause. But it can't be 
a powder puff cosmetic. We as individuals and corporations have to take 
(environmental ethics) into our core. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Until that time arrives, Earth Day Executive Director Desser said, "Beware of 
the companies who have discovered that green is the color of corporate choice."

LENINGRAD REFORMERS WON -- NOW THE STRUGGLE BEGINS

LENINGRAD, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something revolutionary happened this spring in the city where, 73 years ago, a 
band of determined Russian Communists led by V. I. Lenin seized power. 
</P>
<P>
They finally lost it. 
</P>
<P>
The comrades' undoing was anger at barren store shelves, perks for the powerful 
and the shoddy state of many architectural glories in the former capital of the 
czars. 
</P>
<P>
In the freest municipal elections ever, party apparatchiks who held sway for 
decades were trounced by a coalition of democrats, radicals, ecologists, reform 
Communists and overt anti-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
For many who live in this cradle of the Russian Revolution, it was another day 
in local history that seemed fated to shake the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Our victory can be compared to the February Revolution of 1917 (which forced 
Czar Nicholas II to abdicate)," fledgling Deputy Alexei G. Lushnikov said with 
conviction. "Our margin is so one-sided, the question of fighting the 
conservatives isn't even posed now." 
</P>
<P>
Partisans of the Democratic Elections 90 coalition took more than 60% of the 
seats on the 400-member city council, or Lensoviet. And immediately after 
convening, the deputies distanced themselves from their predecessors by 
observing a minute of silence for all who have died for democracy and human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Things in Leningrad have finally come full circle: To call someone a Bolshevik 
in this chamber is now an insult," observed local journalist Oleg Nesterov, who 
watched the inaugural proceedings from the gallery. One Soviet newspaper 
marveled at the "strange picture" of "lots of bearded men in jeans and 
pullovers" occupying the plushly upholstered seats of power. 
</P>
<P>
If this were a perestroika-era remake of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," there 
would be no doubt about the ultimate triumph of the righteous in politics. But 
what has happened in this city of 4.4 million since the first Lensoviet session 
April 3 shows that winning power is not the same as wielding it -- and it bodes 
poorly for progressives in other Soviet cities, including Moscow, who were also 
victorious in last month's local elections. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad's vast Communist Party machine, though stunned at the polls, may 
still be the most potent force in urban life. 
</P>
<P>
But a greater shock to the victors is this: Within a week of the Lensoviet's 
inaugural meeting, the anti-Establishment coalition, which had united 40 
organizations from the pro-democracy Leningrad People's Front to veterans of 
the World War II Nazi blockade, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the causes of its demise were rival ideologies, jockeying for power and 
some deputies' growing fears that others were seeking to impose their will by 
maneuvering to be elected the chamber's vozhd, a Russian word for "leader" that 
was applied to Stalin and Lenin and thus has chilling associations for many. 
</P>
<P>
"The democratic movement is disintegrating because of contradictions between 
its leaders," progressive Deputy Pavel F. Kopeikin said. "But the problem is 
that people like me who are against the vozhd principle don't have a vozhd of 
their own." 
</P>
<P>
The man Kopeikin says would be vozhd is economist Pyotr S. Filipov, 44, whose 
consuming desire to become Leningrad's new mayor has done a lot to sunder the 
electoral alliance he helped forge. His nemesis turned out to be a co-founder 
of the Leningrad People's Front, chain-smoking geologist Marina Y. Salye. 
</P>
<P>
"The democrats have divided into those like Filipov who are willing to 
compromise with the existing apparat and even become its members, and those 
like Marina who think a radical overhaul of the system is indispensable and no 
compromise with the old order possible," said Vitaly V. Skoibeda of the 
avowedly anti-Communist Democratic Union opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Filipov, a pro-reform member of the Communist Party, wants to get on 
with the business of governing, even using old-time party hacks if they can get 
the job done. Salye, more radical, wants to reinvent the entire structure of 
municipal government. 
</P>
<P>
Five days into the session, as the bearded Filipov was demanding in his brassy 
voice that the Lensoviet proceed by passing rules of order before tackling 
other business, Salye was planning a demonstration to protest the Kremlin's 
treatment of Lithuania and an attack by Soviet soldiers that killed 20 Georgian 
demonstrators a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't succeed with this rally, we won't succeed with anything," the 
stocky, gray-haired mineralogy expert told a circle of followers gathered 
outside the Lensoviet's chamber. 
</P>
<P>
His voice dripping with scorn, Filipov said later: "I understand why somebody 
would go to a rally to become a deputy of the Lensoviet. But I can't understand 
why anybody would become a deputy to go to a rally." 
</P>
<P>
The progressives' schism has meant virtual paralysis in government. A week 
after the minute of silence, work on forming the Lensoviet's standing 
committees was still bogged down. A new mayor hadn't been elected. The rally, 
however, drew an estimated 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
How Communist Party leaders intend to deal with the new city fathers is a 
matter of concern to many. At Smolny, a former school for girls from the 
aristocracy that Lenin made his command post during the Russian Revolution, 
about 1,000 full-time party functionaries staff a political machine that would 
put Boss Tweed's to shame, the voters' verdict notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain the party machine will sabotage or torpedo the decisions of the 
Lensoviet," declared novice Deputy Lushnikov, 23. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already two centers of powers -- the party, which has it de facto, 
and the Lensoviet, which has it de jure. There must be a transfer. I'm sure it 
won't be friendly." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the party has kept a chokehold on city life here, as elsewhere in 
the Soviet Union, through the practice of nomenklatura, which allowed 
apparatchiks at Smolny to choose the holders of top jobs in government and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
That meant a huge patronage network in the Soviet Union's second-largest city, 
where more than 900,000 people, from the grandmothers who sweep courtyards to 
schoolteachers, are employed by the "urban economic system." 
</P>
<P>
How loyal the products of such ideological patronage will be to the principle 
of democratic government remains to be seen. City party boss Boris V. Gidaspov 
has declared his willingness to hand the reins of economic power over to the 
Lensoviet and said all agencies in his 500,000-member party organization were 
ready to offer "help and support." 
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper in which he made the offer, Leningradskaya Pravda, was 
suddenly claimed as exclusive party property this month after decades of 
co-publication with the Lensoviet and a regional governing council. To many 
Lensoviet deputies, it seemed like the first salvo in their war with Smolny. 
</P>
<P>
"The party will interfere to sow havoc in our work, so we are running from one 
fire to another and can't get anything accomplished," Skoibeda, 28, predicted. 
"The structures of democratic city government are only being invented here, but 
the Communist Party has existed for decades." 
</P>
<P>
However, in its first battle of wills with the powers that be, the new 
Lensoviet emerged victorious -- at least for now. The issue was who runs the 
city's television station, famed nationwide for its pioneering outspokenness 
but still a cog in the Gostelradio state broadcasting system controlled by 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies voted to give live TV time to controversial government prosecutor 
Nikolai V. Ivanov, who electrified the country with charges of corruption in 
high places, including the Politburo, and who has since been fired and kicked 
out of the Communist Party. Ivanov, a member of the Soviet Congress of People's 
Deputies, is being probed by that body and wanted to defend himself against 
charges of official misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the Lensoviet's demand, the chief of Leningrad's state-owned 
broadcasting committee, Boris M. Petrov, asked for advice from Gostelradio 
headquarters in Moscow. He received back a telegram saying Ivanov's appearance 
on television would be unacceptable and refused him access. 
</P>
<P>
The Lensoviet deputies reacted with anger. "Either we continue to function as a 
body of government power, or we surrender before the officials who are trying 
to hamper our work," Sergei Dekterev, television journalist and newly elected 
deputy, declared. 
</P>
<P>
Petrov was hauled before the council to justify his actions. He argued that his 
committee's legal status made him subservient to Moscow as well as to the 
Lensoviet, but he was jeered by the deputies. By a 216-4 vote, with 24 
abstentions, they voted to fire Petrov, put his deputy in charge and compel 
Leningrad TV to put Ivanov on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bearing a text of their resolution, 15 deputies accompanied Ivanov to the TV 
studios, where shortly before midnight he was brought before a camera and 
allowed to show videotapes of his investigations. Clearly, he hoped these would 
refute charges that he had threatened witnesses and jailed them without due 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady moment for the new Lensoviet. Some deputies are now talking 
about laws to abolish privileges like special food parcels and limousines for 
party officials. Others want to declare Leningrad a "free city" with the right 
to direct ties with foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Some even propose stripping Lenin's name from their city on the shores of the 
Gulf of Finland, since they equate the importance of their peaceful triumph 
with other, bloodier political upheavals here -- the abortive 1905 workers' 
uprising, the February Revolution in 1917 that ended czarist rule and the 
October Revolution that same year that brought Lenin's Bolsheviks to power in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should this city, which throughout history has experienced four 
revolutions, now bear the name of the author of just one of them?" Lushnikov 
asked. "Moscow has never changed its name, not to Stalingrad or Brezhnevgrad, 
and I don't think it will become Gorbachevgrad. So why our city?"

GERRY SPENCE MADE HIS REPUTATION TAKING ON 'UNWINNABLE' CASES. DEFENDING IMELDA 
MARCOS MAY BE HIS BIGGEST GAMBLE YET.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a moment, the heavy spring snowfall obscured the views of skyscrapers 
beyond his apartment window, reminding Gerry Spence of home. Wyoming. The 
ranch. The natural habitat of a lawyer who wears a 10-gallon Stetson to court. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no sign of a Grand Teton forest outside this glass. Not here, 
five floors above East 47th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that." He pointed down at the street, into the shadows of the urban 
towers toward a small concrete plaza. It was a single budding tree. He pondered 
the hint of green on the city's otherwise gray, wet landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the first tree I've seen in this town." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Spence, 61, the cowboy lawyer who's here to defend exiled Philippine 
first lady Imelda Marcos against federal fraud and racketeering charges, is 
finding out just how far away he is from Jackson and the sanctuary of Wyoming 
cottonwoods. 
</P>
<P>
He was never farther from home than during last week's opening round of his 
first trial in New York. Foul weather and angry insults greeted his arrival 
with Mrs. Marcos at the steps to the federal courthouse. Nor did his homespun, 
country style hold up well inside, in a courtroom with more pinstripe than 
buckskin. 
</P>
<P>
Spence clashed with the judge, suffered damaging surprises at the hands of a 
skilled prosecution team and stumbled so badly once during his opening 
statements that he appeared to insult, of all people, the jury. 
</P>
<P>
It was, he conceded, "the worst opening" of his long and storied career. 
</P>
<P>
A three-month case, or longer, as this is almost certain to be, leaves plenty 
of time to recover -- "to dig out of this damn deep hole." 
</P>
<P>
But Spence's biggest obstacles aren't likely to be his early blunders so much 
as the massive documentary evidence that supports the government's criminal 
charges, the hundreds of thousands of pages of bank records, telexes, receipts, 
memos, contracts and reports that federal prosecutors say tell a story of 
thievery "on an incredible scale." 
</P>
<P>
Another substantial dilemma is the specter of Ferdinand E. Marcos. Some of the 
government's strongest evidence implicates the dead dictator, making the safest 
defense for his widow the "ignorant wife defense." But Mrs. Marcos, still 
dressed in mourning black, won't have her lawyer shifting blame on her late 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a woman who believes her husband was totally innocent of the charges 
that were made here," Spence told the crowded court last week, in a dramatic 
preamble to his ill-fated opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, a rainstorm raged, and a loud wind howled through partially opened 
windows. Spence raised his baritone volume above the eerie din: "He's dead. His 
lips have been sealed by death. He can't defend himself." 
</P>
<P>
Then, stepping beside the tearful Mrs. Marcos, he spoke for her as he 
proclaimed: "You can do what you wish with me, but . . . you cannot do this to 
that great man, she says, and I want you to defend him -- and so we will." 
</P>
<P>
Unique Arguments 
</P>
<P>
But brave rhetoric masks a troubled case. Faced with often overwhelming factual 
evidence, Spence is left making some rather novel defense arguments concerning 
intent and motivation. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About allegations the Marcoses looted the Philippine treasury by 
transferring public funds to secret bank accounts around the world and making 
hidden investments in New York real estate: Spence told jurors the money was 
actually being invested overseas as a contingency fund to finance a return to 
power if the Philippines fell to communist insurgents. He said creation of what 
was "loosely referred to as a communist takeover fund" was all done with the 
knowledge and encouragement of the CIA and then-Vice President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About allegations of bribes and kickbacks: Spence told the jury that what 
looks like a kickback in America was, in the Philippines, actually a sort of 
"tax" or user fee that President Marcos extracted from "those industries that 
would most benefit from the communists not taking over the country. . . . Large 
corporations. He made them pay." 
</P>
<P>
 -- About allegations that the Marcoses defrauded their country and then 
exported the fruits of that fraud to New York and California: Spence told 
jurors the Marcoses could not have broken the laws of the Philippines since 
Marcos wrote those laws. After declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos ruled by 
decree. "What he was doing in the Philippines was done in accordance with his 
law since he was the law." 
</P>
<P>
 -- About allegations that Imelda Marcos used the national treasury to finance 
shopping sprees for jewelry, art and shoes: Spence said the image of "this 
obscene, ugly spender, this greedy person who couldn't be satisfied with a few 
pairs of shoes," is the fiction of vicious media. He told jurors that much of 
her spending was to acquire gifts for foreign dignitaries and souvenirs to take 
home to thousands of local officials in the Philippines. And most of the shoes, 
gifts from shoemakers, "weren't her size." 
</P>
<P>
Defending Lost Causes 
</P>
<P>
The hallmark of Gerry Spence's legal career has been the lost cause, the 
unwinnable case. 
</P>
<P>
He once took on a client who had shot his ex-wife in front of eight witnesses 
just to prove that he could win a case with someone "so obviously guilty that 
the public will demand he be hauled away without even a trial." 
</P>
<P>
It took several years and multiple trials, but Spence eventually won acquittal 
arguing that the man had been, but was no longer, insane. The client was free 
for nearly a year before he was killed when he tried to kill another man. 
</P>
<P>
Spence's national reputation was made in 1979 when he won an initial 
$10.5-million civil damage award from energy conglomerate Kerr-McGee Corp. on 
behalf of the family of Karen Silkwood. Many years later it was reduced to 
$1.38 million. 
</P>
<P>
(Silkwood, a laboratory analyst at the company's Crescent, Okla., nuclear plant 
who had been protesting what she viewed as sloppy practices in handling 
plutonium, died in a one-car accident in 1974 while reportedly on her way to 
deliver incriminating documents to a New York Times reporter. The documents 
were never found.) 
</P>
<P>
Spence, arguing with towering rhetoric, told jurors she was "married to cancer" 
because of her plutonium exposure. He repeatedly referred to attorneys for 
Kerr-McGee as "the men in gray." 
</P>
<P>
It was classic Spence: converting the legal conflict to an emotional and moral 
contest between the good guys and the bad guys, between the Christians and the 
gladiators, between "the little people" and the "greedy corporations." 
</P>
<P>
As a young lawyer he had worked for insurance companies, defending them against 
liability claims. It wasn't quite what his mother had in mind for him -- she 
wanted him to pursue a gospel ministry. Instead he pursues "the divine mist" of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Something akin to a religious experience dramatically altered Spence's legal 
career. He compares it with Saul's conversion on the road to Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
He was in a supermarket when he encountered a man who had been injured by a 
drunk driver. Spence, representing an insurance company, had fought the man's 
damage claim, and won. 
</P>
<P>
But Spence couldn't savor his legal triumph in that grocery aisle. All he saw 
was a crippled old man. The next morning he decided: "I'm quitting the 
insurance business." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a lucrative conversion. He has won staggering jury awards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he won a $52-million verdict against the McDonald's Corp. hamburger 
chain for a vendor after the chain declined to honor an oral contract to buy 
his ice cream. (It later was settled for $15.5 million). His clients have won 
numerous judgments ranging from $3 million to $5 million. One of those, a 
$4.75-million malpractice verdict against a Utah physician, also changed the 
nursing standards of that state, giving nurses more rights to intercede when 
they witness improper treatment by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Spence also got a federal court in Cheyenne to award the 1978 Miss Wyoming 
$26.5 million in a libel suit against Penthouse magazine. That was his earliest 
huge judgment, making him a much sought after plaintiff's attorney. The award 
was reversed on appeal, but Spence has never been short of clients since. 
</P>
<P>
For civil litigation, he commands hefty contingency fees, as much as 50%, but 
most of his criminal defense work is pro bono, free. 
</P>
<P>
'Lone Ranger Lawyer' 
</P>
<P>
As a champion of plaintiffs hopelessly outgunned by adversaries with big 
corporate legal staffs or defendants unable to afford a first-rate attorney, 
someone dubbed Spence "the Lone Ranger lawyer," riding to the rescue of the 
little people. He once sent a rival attorney a package of legal documents that 
included a single silver bullet. Critics accuse him of sometimes turning legal 
proceedings "into horse operas." 
</P>
<P>
One reward for his success and notoriety is freedom. Spence can be picky about 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
"A lawyer who has a choice ought not take cases he can't get his guts into. You 
gotta love your client. A jury can soon tell if you care. They won't if you 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
He has avoided celebrity clients, looking instead to be the hired gun of the 
underdog. 
</P>
<P>
So it came as a surprise to some when Spence took the case of Imelda Marcos, 
once among the richest and most powerful women in the world. Even now, living 
in luxurious exile in Hawaii, she can hardly be called one of "the little 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Spence sees Mrs. Marcos differently, through a prism provided by his wife, 
Imaging. "She told me to think about how lonely (Mrs. Marcos) must be -- her 
husband dead, she's in a strange country, in a great deal of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
With Imaging's encouragement Spence flew to Honolulu and met what he calls "a 
very decent and courageous woman." He took her case for a fee, which he will 
not discuss. Now Spence rides to her defense in court, on camera and on the 
streets of New York. 
</P>
<P>
No picture of Mrs. Marcos on the courthouse steps is taken without the woman in 
black holding the strong arm of the 6-foot, 2-inch cowboy in the tall Stetson. 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't you treat her as a human being?" he demands of reporters whose 
coverage of the Marcoses has been, he says, "vicious and unfair." He paces his 
apartment angrily considering the morning headlines strewn across a coffee 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman has become a public sacrificial lamb for the media." 
</P>
<P>
He snatches the tabloid copy of New York Newsday, gripping it as he would a 
villain seized by the throat. "Did you see this?" 
</P>
<P>
The front page is dominated by a picture of Mrs. Marcos under the one-word 
banner headline: "OINK." 
</P>
<P>
It's a story about allegations she used a Philippine bank branch in New York as 
her "personal piggy bank." Spence is not amused. 
</P>
<P>
"A headline like that hurts me. I look at that and feel physical pain." 
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos will probably make the long walk from the defense table to the 
witness chair before her trial is over. Spence says it may be the only way to 
show the jury that "this lady, this caricature of greed and evil, is a good and 
decent human being." 
</P>
<P>
But he concedes the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are naturally reluctant to turn over their clients, guilty or 
innocent, to the cross-examination of a prosecutor. Spence has instructed some 
of his clients to keep a low profile even at the defense table, suggesting to 
one murder client for whom he was seeking a finding of insanity that he simply 
stare at his shoes through the entire trial. 
</P>
<P>
"What a terrible place to have to show who you are: in a courtroom of people 
leering at you. A judge looking down on you. You can't tell your story, you can 
only answer questions. And you're cross-examined by someone who hates you and 
wants to destroy you." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Spence is trying to put the black hat on the government prosecutors, 
casting them as persecutors of a lonely widow. 
</P>
<P>
"A trial should be a search for the truth." Instead, he says, it's a search for 
obscure documents in a library of evidence. Spence has been on the Marcos case 
only a few months and is clearly frustrated by the daunting bulk of 
investigative material. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding what we need in all that is like looking for a marble in a gravel 
truck." 
</P>
<P>
Last week his incomplete knowledge of the documents could have been responsible 
for his stumbling into areas of cross-examination that permitted prosecutor 
Charles LaBella to introduce surprising and damaging follow-up testimony. In 
one case, a witness said he was physically threatened by a Marcos confidante to 
protect the first lady's business secrets; another, a Marcos banker, said the 
late dictator tried to curb his wife's free spending habits by ordering 
government banks to stop giving her money. 
</P>
<P>
He also is up against a very well-prepared prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
LaBella, 39, who directed the federal investigation since 1987, and his 
associate, Debra Livingston, 31, had to contend with White House and State 
Department considerations to get the politically sensitive indictment in the 
first place. They bring the same kind of passion to the prosecution that Spence 
brings to the defense. And, so far, they know the evidence better. 
</P>
<P>
One question mark has to be the appeal of the Spence style and rhetoric to a 
New York jury. It would seem he can only improve on his opening day 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first trial in New York," he told jurors in his introduction. "I am 
a long ways from home. And I am going to make some mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
He was right. 
</P>
<P>
Spence ignored Judge John F. Keenan's increasingly sharp warnings to talk about 
the evidence of the case and instead set out to tell his version of the story 
of Imelda Marcos: victim of World War II atrocities, witness to beheadings, 
wounded in the war, there when MacArthur returned, sang "God Bless the 
Philippines" to Irving Berlin, drank water out of foxholes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sustained objections rained down like the storm outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Spence went too far for Keenan. The lawyer started to tell the jury 
that Mrs. Marcos "certainly . . . is not being provided in this case with a 
jury of her peers anymore than, I suppose . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston was on her feet, objecting. Keenan barked: "Sustained!" into his 
desktop microphone and then addressed the jury emphatically: 
</P>
<P>
"You are a jury of her peers. Under the laws of the United States and the 
Constitution of the United States you are properly sworn to judge this case and 
to decide and pass upon the guilt or innocence both of Mrs. Marcos and Mr. 
(Adnan) Khashoggi (her co-defendant)." 
</P>
<P>
Spence could only stand and wait, his potentially insulting proposition left 
dangling, as the judge continued: 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we took five days to pick the jury and did it as carefully as we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was Spence's turn again. He had to explain even if it risked 
angering the judge again. He spoke contritely. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I don't mean to suggest you are not a proper 
jury. She wants to be tried by you. I don't mean that at all. But it is like 
Mrs. Bush being tried by a Philippine jury." 
</P>
<P>
"Objection!" 
</P>
<P>
"Sustained. Desist from that, sir!" 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Spence remembers his first fight. He was a boy, "chosen out," in the 
parlance of the playground. Challenged to an adolescent duel. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to fight; I was afraid to run. I just had to think about it all 
day until school was out and then go face it. It was the longest day I'd ever 
known." 
</P>
<P>
He's had many "longest days" since. Every trial, every day in court, is like 
that first boyhood test of nerve. "There's still a scared little lawyer inside 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Except now the stakes are higher. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal case, whether in Wyoming or New York, is "deadly combat," he says. 
The prize for success is the same in country courts or the city: 
</P>
<P>
The winner "gets to keep the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
And when the lawyer in the Stetson heads west again at the end of this trial, 
he intends to be riding into the sunset with the dictator's widow.

OAKLAND MAY RESCIND DEAL WITH RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: MAYOR WILSON WILL ASK THE COUNCIL TONIGHT TO SCRAP ITS APPROVAL 
OF PLANS TO RETURN THE TEAM TO THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson announced Monday that he will ask the Oakland City 
Council when it meets tonight to rescind its approval of the current deal to 
bring the Raiders back to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson said he still thinks the team's return is a good idea and that 
the council will discuss what new negotiations might be undertaken, he feels 
that if the return "isn't dead, it's dying." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he had informed the Raiders Monday afternoon that he would urge 
the City Council to accept 33,189 petition signatures filed last week by 
opponents for a referendum on the Raider deal as valid and put the matter on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But, he told a news conference, Raider negotiator Jack Brooks curtly informed 
him that under no circumstances were the Raiders prepared to see the city's 
offer, recently revised downward from about $660 million to $486 million, voted 
upon by the populace. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Brooks had pointed out to him that no agreement had been formally 
executed, that the Raiders have signed nothing and that, therefore, there 
really was nothing for voters to vote upon. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a longtime promoter of the deal, said he accepted this reasoning and 
therefore altered his position Monday afternoon, deciding simply to ask the 
council to rescind the agreement as it now stands. 
</P>
<P>
If negotiations do resume with the Raiders, Wilson said, he feels it should be 
on a basis of no municipal ticket sale guarantees to the team. In the currently 
proposed agreement, those guarantees would have amounted to $428 million, and 
the city and county would have been responsible for selling 36,000 premium 
seats each year. Had they not sold them, the city would have been liable to pay 
the Raiders with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor and others talked about the Raider deal dying, there seemed 
to be considerable confusion in Oakland on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After Wilson spoke about a council decision tonight, his press secretary, Carol 
McArthur, said it was unlikely any decision could be made final tonight because 
the matter had not been put on the agenda early enough. 
</P>
<P>
But, McArthur said, the council can discuss the matter tonight and make its 
feelings known. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don Perata, who along with the 
mayor had been a major backer of the Raiders' return, expressed consternation 
that Wilson had not informed him in advance of what he was going to announce 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said angrily that as far as he is concerned, the Raider deal is finished 
because he doesn't think he can work with Wilson any more. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is opposed for reelection this year by two potentially powerful 
candidates, Assemblyman Elihu Harris and City Councilman Wilson Riles Jr., who 
both oppose the Raider deal. In recent days, Wilson became more and more 
concerned that turning down the referendum on technicalities, as the city 
attorney wanted, would have been politically devastating. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wilson said he had concluded that the only fair thing was either to 
put the matter on the ballot or rescind the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the proposed referendum were jubilant Monday. "I'm glad the mayor 
and a majority of the City Council have finally recognized the strong feelings 
of the voters," said Frank Russo, an Oakland attorney who led the referendum 
drive. "They basically negotiated a deal the public could not accept." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said the latest 
developments in Oakland "open a tremendous window of opportunity for Los 
Angeles to retain a professional football team and infuse large amounts of 
private money to renovate the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Mayor Tom Bradley may have more to say later in the week about 
plans to keep the Raiders in the Coliseum, which he said would not be 
demolished as some have proposed, but would be substantially changed in its 
seating arrangements. A plan for changes at the Coliseum is being negotiated 
with the Raiders by the Coliseum's lead private manager, Spectacor Management 
Group of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Coliseum Commissioner Richard Riordan said, "I have felt the last 
month very strongly that the Raiders will remain in L.A. I now feel the odds in 
favor of L.A. have gone up dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, a legislative committee in Sacramento prepared to consider 
today a bill introduced by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) that would 
call for a popular referendum in Los Angeles on any deal with the Raiders to 
demolish or alter the Coliseum in a major way. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said he felt nothing would be done to the Coliseum that would require 
such a referendum, even if the Torres bill was to pass.

DOG FIGHT;

GROOMERS PROTEST STATE CURBS ON DENTAL CLEANING

<P>
As a remarkably well-behaved group of dogs looked on, groomers and their 
supporters gathered on the Capitol steps Monday to protest new state 
regulations that would allow only professional veterinarians or their 
technicians to clean animals' teeth. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, promulgated by the Board of Examiners in Veterinary 
Medicine, will take effect in three weeks and will allow non-veterinarians to 
use only such devices as "doggy tooth brushes," while the use of metal scrapers 
would be limited to vets and their assistants. The groomers say this would take 
them out of the tooth-cleaning business. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen or so canines, ranging in size from Yorkshire terriers to golden 
retrievers, listened quietly as Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) denounced 
the proposed rules as "nothing more than a special-interest grab at a monopoly 
in a particular market that should not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Bronzan has introduced legislation that would undo the veterinary board's 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
This is the latest skirmish in a bureaucratic struggle that has continued for 
more than two years, involving several state agencies, a Superior Court judge, 
various lawyers and lobbyists and even the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Examiners in Veterinary Medicine contends that only veterinarians 
are able to clean animal teeth properly (though the work is usually done by a 
technician working under a vet's supervision). 
</P>
<P>
Vets usually anesthetize the animal to work below the gum line, and charge $60 
to $100 for a service that includes cleaning, polishing and an oral 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
Dog groomers claim that they can do just as good a cleaning job, without 
anesthetic, charging $20 to $40. "Dozens and dozens of animals have died as a 
result of anesthesia" for tooth cleaning, said Cindy Collins, a Costa Mesa 
groomer. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Hill, executive officer for the Board of Examiners in Veterinary 
Medicine, said in an interview, "Deaths of animals caused by anesthesia are 
much less than those caused by peridontal disease." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the veterinary board approved similar rules but they were vetoed by 
Michael A. Kelley, director of the state Department of Consumer Affairs, who 
said they would "preclude the public from being able to obtain a legitimate 
service at an affordable cost." 
</P>
<P>
This year, after meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian and members of the 
veterinary board, Kelley withdrew his opposition. "I decided to defer to the 
professional opinion of the five veterinarians on the board," Kelley said 
Monday.

SPRAYING URGED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: PANEL ALSO CALLS FOR AERIAL MALATHION APPLICATIONS OVER HANCOCK PARK 
AND THE CITY OF WALNUT. OFFICIALS SAY ACTION IS NEEDED IF QUARANTINE IS TO END 
QUICKLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A state panel of scientists recommended Monday that 19 square miles of 
Woodcrest in Riverside County be sprayed with malathion at least eight times to 
eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies infesting commercial orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also proposed that aerial pesticide spraying begin over parts of 
Hancock Park in Los Angeles and the city of Walnut, citing new fly discoveries 
during the past week. A decision by the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture is expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
If accepted, the territory of Southern California under treatment with aerial 
applications of malathion would be expanded to 430 square miles, in an 
infestation that is approaching its ninth month. While the state previously 
announced it would wind down spraying by May 9, the deadline will not apply to 
the Riverside County spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendations were decided during an emergency conference call 
prompted by the discovery of four Medflies last week. Some officials have 
become frustrated by the flurry of fly finds. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the end to all this?" asked James R. Carey, one of five entomologists 
on the Medfly Science Advisory Panel. "No one sees it." 
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended that areas around Hancock Park and Walnut be sprayed with 
malathion twice and then treated with the release of millions of sterile 
Medflies, which are used to disrupt the breeding cycle of wild flies. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wallace, Riverside County agricultural commissioner, said multiple 
malathion sprayings were recommended for Woodcrest because of the shortage of 
sterile flies and the need to take more aggressive action to protect the area's 
commercial citrus crops. 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials declared a 71-square-mile quarantine zone around 
Woodcrest on Friday that covers about 95 growers. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said multiple aerial sprayings will eradicate the Medfly faster and 
allow the state to lift the quarantine sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Panel member Roy Cunningham said the area around Woodcrest probably would be 
sprayed eight to 12 times, starting as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
He said if no more flies are found there, spraying probably would continue for 
at least 3 1/2 months. While Woodcrest is a farming community, the 
recommendation to spray met with mixed responses from residents and even some 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said he is concerned that so many residential neighborhoods would be 
sprayed along with the fruit orchards. Also, he said, most growers there use a 
style of farming that shuns pesticides in favor of the release of beneficial 
insects to prey upon harmful pests. He said malathion spraying will hurt the 
delicate ecological balance that the growers have developed during the past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make me happy, but this is a bad situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus grower Larry Topham agreed that few farmers relish the prospect of 
malathion spraying after working for decades to reduce the amount of pesticides 
on their fruit. But he saw no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to throw away 20 years of work," he said, "but if push comes to 
shove, you're going to spray." 
</P>
<P>
Many farmers are more worried about whether the quarantine will be lifted 
before the mid-summer harvest of grapefruit and Valencia oranges. 
</P>
<P>
The growers sell much of their fruit to Japan, a country that state officials 
say will not accept fruit from a quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroyuki Kobayashi, a Japanese consul in Los Angeles in charge of agricultural 
issues, said he is aware of the quarantine, but said no decision has been made 
on whether fruit from the Woodcrest quarantine will be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"We are watching," he said. "Just now, I don't have an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who was in Los Angeles on Monday, refused to answer 
questions about the malathion spray program during a press conference he called 
to voice his support for an unrelated ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also said he would not comment on whether he believed the malathion 
spray program would end in previously infested sectors by May 9. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fair question to ask, but not the right time," Deukmejian said. He 
referred Medfly questions to the state Department of Food and Agriculture and 
said he would discuss the issue at a "general subjects" press conference on 
Thursday.

HOSPITAL KILLING SUSPECT SHOWED SIGNS OF TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: RECORDS SAY FATHER WENT TO COURT TO BEGIN PROCESS OF HAVING SON 
COMMITTED FOR MENTAL PROBLEMS. PETITION WAS LATER WITHDRAWN.

<P>
The man accused of shooting four people in a Mission Bay hospital emergency 
room has had psychiatric problems dating back at least 25 years, when his 
father went to court to have him examined for mental illness because he was 
"very hyperactive" and "on the verge of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Bradford Warren Powers Jr., 46, was held Monday in the San Diego County Jail 
and is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon in Municipal Court on two 
counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Powers turned himself in to authorities about an hour after he allegedly opened 
fire Saturday in the emergency room of the Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, 
killing a nurse and student trainee, and wounding the on-duty physician and the 
father of a patient, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez said police interviewed Powers and his family and 
learned that he was angry over the death Saturday morning of his father, 
well-known architectural illustrator Brad Powers Sr. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred about eight hours after the elder Powers died in the 
emergency room. His relatives then returned to their La Jolla home, where they 
began discussing the emergency room death. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he was angry (at the hospital) just like they were," the sergeant 
said. "They were all angry. But there was no conversation about him going to 
the hospital and shooting these people. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, he just got up and left, and the next thing you know he's in his car 
and drove to the hospital. He just disappeared and they didn't even know he 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez described Powers as someone who "cared about his father very, very 
much." And witnesses said that the hospital assailant, when he walked into the 
emergency room, yelled, "You killed my father!" 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Powers has been suspected of suffering mental problems 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, his father filed a petition in San Diego Superior Court to begin the 
process of having his son tested for mental illness with the possibility of 
having him committed to county authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford Powers Jr. at that time was 21, single and unemployed, and he was 
examined by Dr. Carl E. Graner. 
</P>
<P>
"Graner states that he is in an acute psychotic episode and appears to be on 
the verge of violence," the father's petition said. "He refused medication and 
hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Powers then described his son's behavior at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that, when he arrived home from a training cruise a week ago, he was 
very hyperactive and talkative and talked on and on about abuses he underwent 
on the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that a doctor accused him of malingering when he was in fact in great 
pain. He talked hour upon hour about this and would talk on no other subject. 
We took him to a medical doctor, who found nothing physically wrong with him 
and recommended a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
The father said that his son was treated briefly in a local hospital, and then 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"But (he) refused to take the prescribed medicine," the father's petition 
added. "He was admitted to the psychiatric ward as an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Two court-appointed doctors were lined up to conduct examinations, but the 
father withdrew his petition just five days after he filed the request. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if the younger Powers subsequently sought or received 
psychiatric treatment. Family members declined to talk to The Times on Monday.

King Birendra gave in to opposition demands for democracy Monday by permitting 
a newly legalized coalition to form a provisional government, which promptly 
named its acting president as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Nepali Congress party announced that Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, 
its acting president, would head Nepal's first government in 30 years not set 
up by the monarch. 
</P>
<P>
Birendra, who promised reforms after two months of bloody pro-democracy 
demonstrations, earlier Monday dissolved the National Assembly and dismissed 
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, although Birendra asked Chand to stay on 
in a caretaker capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The concessions followed the king's decision April 8 to lift the 29-year-old 
ban on political parties in an effort to appease the pro-democracy movement, 
which included violent clashes between protesters and police. 
</P>
<P>
Birendra had proposed that the leader of the Nepali Congress party, Ganesh Man 
Singh, 75, be the new prime minister but Singh declined on health grounds and 
proposed Bhattarai's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the party said it and the Movement for the Restoration 
of Democracy -- an alliance of seven Communist parties -- agreed on the 
appointment of Bhattarai, 65, who had been Speaker of the Parliament when it 
was dissolved three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai told reporters that he will present the names of the members of his 
government to the king today. 
</P>
<P>
He called his new job "a very, very challenging task for which I was not at all 
mentally prepared. Still I am glad that my friends and comrades have reposed so 
much . . . confidence in me for which I am thankful to them all." 
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said the new government's first priorities will be to improve the 
economy and relations with India. 
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai also said his government plans to compensate the families of those 
killed by security forces during the seven-week democracy campaign and 
reorganize the police force to limit its powers. 
</P>
<P>
The new government will have the task of conducting elections under a 
multi-party democracy.

STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUE, MANDELA SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: A SELLOUT CROWD OF 72,000 IN LONDON GATHERS TO CELEBRATE HIS FREEDOM 
FROM PRISON.

<TEXT>
<P>
African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela on Monday declared to a 
potential worldwide television audience of 1 billion that apartheid in South 
Africa will be ended only by "struggle," including international sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the stage of a sellout concert before 72,000 people at London's 
Wembley Stadium to celebrate his freedom, he told television viewers in 60 
countries: "Reject any suggestion that the campaign to isolate the apartheid 
system should be wound down." 
</P>
<P>
But expressing surprising optimism at the pace of reforms, he predicted: "It 
will not be long now before we see an end to the apartheid system. The dreams 
of millions of people to see our country free and at peace will be realized 
sooner rather than later." 
</P>
<P>
Calling for the transformation of South Africa from being "the skunk of the 
Earth" to an "exemplary oasis" of democracy, good race relations and freedom 
from poverty and human degradation, he said: "It will be a proud day for 
humanity when we are able to say that the apartheid crime against humanity is 
no more." 
</P>
<P>
He reminded his audience that there are still political prisoners in South 
African custody, saying: "We should, therefore, treat this day of celebration 
as one of re-dedication to the continuation and intensification of the struggle 
for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
The program was not televised in the United States, where it was deemed too 
political, or in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In a thinly veiled attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who 
eased sanctions on South Africa earlier this year in response to political 
reforms there, Mandela said: 
</P>
<P>
"It is only those who support apartheid who can argue that the Pretoria 
government should be rewarded for the small steps it has taken, such as our 
release, and the unbanning of the ANC and the other organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher lifted a ban on new British investments, without waiting for the 
approval of her partners in the 12-member European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here, Mandela called the British policy "absolutely disastrous" 
and spurned an open invitation to meet the prime minister during his two days 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was staged to celebrate Mandela's release in February from 27 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entertainers were Bonnie Raitt, Neil Young, Simple Minds, Soul II 
Soul, the Neville Brothers, Peter Gabriel, Anita Baker, Tracy Chapman, Jackson 
Browne, Johnny Clegg and actor Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela said: "The transformation of our country into a 
non-racial democracy . . . will only become reality as a result of struggle, 
including the struggle represented by the international sanctions campaign. . . 
. The apartheid crime against humanity remains in place. It continues to kill 
and maim. It continues to oppress and exploit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All of us must, therefore, refuse to be demobilized, even if those who seek to 
demobilize us plead that they are doing so out of a new-found concern for the 
oppressed and out of the goodness of their hearts."

STATES PAY BIGGER SHARE FOR HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: NEW SURVEY ALSO FINDS INCREASE IN GAS TAXES. THE FINDINGS RAISE 
DOUBTS ABOUT BUSH'S CALL FOR LEGISLATURES TO PLAY A GREATER FUNDING ROLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
State and local governments are bearing an increasing share of the burden of 
rebuilding the nation's highways and bridges, and states have raised their gas 
taxes 122 times since 1980, according to a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey was simply intended to provide statistical information, it 
raises questions about the feasibility of the Bush Administration's recent call 
for states and local governments to play an even greater role in highway 
construction and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The Road Information Program (TRIP), a nonprofit Washington-based 
transportation research institute, said its survey found that state and local 
governments bore 77.6% of the cost of highway improvements in 1988, compared to 
74% in 1980. That represented state expenditures of $53.53 billion in 1988, 
compared to $28.54 billion in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that states have already boosted their gas taxes by an 
average 84% -- from 8.6 cents a gallon in 1980 to 15.8 cents a gallon by Jan. 
1, 1990. Some states have raised their gas taxes three or more times during 
that period, including Wisconsin (five times), Minnesota and Indiana (four) and 
South Carolina and Nevada (three), the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, TRIP's findings were hailed by proponents of a June ballot 
initiative to double the state's 9-cent-a-gallon gas tax over five years. If 
voters approve Proposition 111, the revenues generated would be dedicated to 
highway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better Transportation, a 
group that favors Proposition 111, said the report shows that California lags 
behind the nation in increasing its gas sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
"Some states already have 20-cent gas taxes," he said. "We're hoping to get to 
18 cents over the next five years. This helps illustrate the differences 
between states." 
</P>
<P>
TRIP collected the data contained in the report by surveying highway 
departments in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as using 
information supplied by the Federal Highway Administration, the American Assn. 
of State Highway and Transportation Officials and other government and private 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"This report is a response to the Administration's saying that the states have 
to pick up more funding responsibility," said Sally Thompson, a TRIP researcher 
and the report's author. "What they've been calling for may not be possible 
since the states have been picking up the responsibility all along." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released the 
Administration's national transportation policy, which outlined the 
deteriorating status of the nation's infrastructure but offered no federal 
programs or methods to pay for needed repairs. Instead, the policy urged state 
legislatures to offset a diminished federal role by increasing state taxes, 
seeking private-sector involvement and employing innovative financial deals for 
highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
But TRIP's report said many state governments are already trying to compensate 
for less federal aid with the kind of programs called for in the 
Administration's national transportation policy. 
</P>
<P>
It added that the states are just as strapped for money as the federal 
government, and often end up using highway funds for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"Money collected from user charges such as motor-fuel taxes and registration 
fees is being diverted to unrelated areas, such as mass transit, education and 
law enforcement," the report said. "In fact, 18 states considered legislation 
(to allow diversions of highway funds) in 1989 and 11 passed legislation." 
</P>
<P>
TRIP researchers asked state officials to list their "top three highway" 
priorities, and 30 of the 41 responding to the question "spoke of the need for 
stronger federal support," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The state officials' response was "in direct contrast" to the Administration's 
"call for an increased state role," Thompson said. However, the report also 
noted that "states are reluctantly accepting the fact that the federal 
government is not going to provide the regular, adequate highway funding they 
desperately need -- not now and not in future years." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that state officials are strongly opposed to increasing 
the federal gas tax to reduce the deficit, as has been suggested in Washington 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"A total of 41 respondents said such a tax would have a devastating impact on 
their highway programs," the report said. It noted that 29 states passed 
resolutions last year opposing a federal gas tax increase to reduce the budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are more inclined to support the spending of federal motor fuel 
taxes already collected and held in the Highway Trust Fund, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see (the Administration) spend down the Highway Trust Fund," 
Art Taylor, a spokesman for the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, 
said in an interview. "Once that money is spent down, we're not opposed to the 
federal government raising its gasoline tax." 
</P>
<P>
The fund has a surplus of about $10 billion and it grows yearly since receipts 
continue to outpace expenditures by about $2 billion a year.

Thousands of children frolicked on the White House lawn Monday, hunting wooden 
eggs and rolling real ones in a rite of spring that converted the presidential 
estate into a playground. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush joined briefly in the fun, blowing a shiny whistle to start the 
Easter Egg Roll in which his 3-year-old granddaughter, Marshall Bush, was 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
There were no winners or losers in the 10-yard races. All participants got 
wooden eggs bearing the names George and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The same prizes could be found without too much scrutiny under hay strewn about 
in pens elsewhere on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the eggs bore the signatures of Michael Jackson and other famous White 
House visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes' pet projects were not forgotten. Some guests got Virginia pine 
saplings, and all the children took away canvas sacks crammed with books and 
other souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Some families waited hours to get in; other groups, such as the four children 
brought from a shelter in nearby Alexandria, Va., had special passes that let 
them right in. 
</P>

The lawn teemed with clowns, minstrels, an Abraham Lincoln look-alike, balloon 
artists, dancers, bands, a yo-yo master and other entertainers, among them TV 
puppeteer Shari Lewis.

LEBANON: EVEN RESIDENTS OF SHELL-SHATTERED BEIRUT SHUN THE BEKAA VALLEY, HOME

BAALBEK, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their violent, shell-shattered capital of Beirut, Lebanese think twice 
before traveling east to the Bekaa Valley. Whatever lies over the snowy ridges 
of the Lebanon Mountains is, Beirutis say, bad news. 
</P>
<P>
The shady reputation has fallen hard on the long, bountiful valley where 
coastal Lebanese and foreign tourists once came for leisurely outings. 
</P>
<P>
"This (word-of-mouth) advertising is killing us here in Baalbek," complained a 
local cabbie. 
</P>
<P>
However placid the valley seems, its bad name is understandable. Lying within a 
two-hour drive of Beirut, the area is deep into the production of narcotics, 
provides sanctuary for cells of foreign guerrillas and is laden with Syrian 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-mile-long trough of the Bekaa stretches northeasterly through the length 
of Lebanon, bounded on the west by the 8,500-foot heights of the Lebanon 
Mountains and on the east by Syria's Anti-Lebanon range. The valley floor is 
seldom wider than 10 miles and makes up most of the country's arable land. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese legend holds that Noah's Ark landed near the village of Tibnin in the 
southern Bekaa and that the biblical patriarch is buried near Zahlah, the 
valley's largest city. Nearby stands the Caves de Ksara winery, the biggest in 
the Middle East, where bottles bear the legend: "Born in the land of Noah, the 
first biblical winegrower." 
</P>
<P>
The 130-year-old winery, founded by Jesuit priests, is still a major exporter, 
sending its Ksara label as far as Glendale, Calif. But in recent years, the hot 
cash crop in the Bekaa has been narcotics: hashish and opium. 
</P>
<P>
And here in Baalbek, where camera-toting tourists once whiled away their 
afternoons in the Roman temples of ancient Heliopolis, the prominent visitors 
are now an estimated 1,000 or more Iranian Revolutionary Guards, dispatched by 
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini at the start of the 1982 Israeli invasion 
of Lebanon. Khomeini termed Baalbek the jumping-off point for a new Islamic 
conquest of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
His guardsmen never came close. The easternmost of Israel's three-pronged 1982 
assault pushed into the southern Bekaa, rolling back Syrian forces, the 
Iranians' protectors. Israeli warplanes, after knocking out most of Syria's air 
force in furious dogfights over Beirut on the second day of the invasion, 
leveled the Syrian SAM-6 anti-aircraft positions in the Bekaa on the third day. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the Bekaa remains firmly under control of the Syrian army, 
first sent into Lebanon as a peacekeeping force in 1976, the year after 
beleaguered Lebanon's still-running civil war began. There is not a major 
crossroad in the Bekaa without a Syrian checkpoint, and the Syrians permit no 
local militias to establish one. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the estimated 40,000 or more Syrian troops in Lebanon are based in the 
Bekaa. Their main base is at Majdel Aanjar, just off the Damascus-Beirut road. 
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians know precisely what goes on in the valley," said a Western 
diplomat in Damascus, the Syrian capital. "Nothing can escape that apparatus." 
</P>
<P>
That includes the reported proliferation over the last decade of camps of armed 
outsiders, from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in their barracks near Baalbek 
to smaller groups that, according to Western intelligence officials, have 
trained elsewhere in the valley under Syrian protection. Some accounts have 
suggested that the Bekaa houses a sort of Olympic Village of foreign guerrilla 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities have accused the Syrians of providing Bekaa bases for 
guerrillas of the nationalist Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret 
Army for the Liberation of Armenia. U.S. intelligence officers say the 
terrorist Japanese Red Army operates out of Lebanon, and Middle East-based 
diplomats put them somewhere in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian-supported Palestinian dissident forces are known to have bases in the 
southern Bekaa. According to an Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem, an 
Israeli air strike in the Bekaa in March, 1989, one of several in the region in 
recent months, was directed at a base of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
That Syrian-shielded group was pinpointed as the chief suspect in the December, 
1988, bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
According to Beirut press reports, some of the foreign guerrillas were 
established near the small town of Yanta, north of Rachaiya, in the southern 
Bekaa near the Syrian border. One report now puts the Armenian guerrillas 
outside Sidon, a southern Lebanese port. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our understanding that these groups are not situated in bases per se," 
said the Damascus-based diplomat. "They don't have barracks with guerrilla 
flags flying from a mast. More likely they are in some little village and get 
together to practice field-stripping rifles and that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, their reported presence adds to the image of the Bekaa as an 
anything-goes area. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Baalbek, where the presence is Iranian and where the Lebanese Shiite 
Muslim terrorist faction known as Hezbollah was nurtured under Iranian 
guidance, the foreign influence is bothersome but often mundane. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for instance, no alcohol sold in the city, and the local women keep 
their heads covered in the Muslim fundamentalist style. 
</P>
<P>
Baalbek's three television stations also illustrate the situation: The 
commercial channel runs to foreign film programming, including some American 
movies, with Arabic subtitles. The Hezbollah station offers a heavy menu of 
religious programs in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
The third channel is run by the Iranians, with most shows broadcast in Persian, 
Iran's language. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old boy named Mohammed said he can watch Tom and Jerry cartoons on 
the Iranian channel but misses some of the Persian nuances. His father tunes in 
on the Lebanon Broadcasting Co. (LBC) telecasts from Beirut. LBC is run by the 
right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces, and its ads promote whiskey, lingerie and 
other fast-lane products now largely absent from Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ruins of the Roman temples, for 25 cents admission, bearded Shiite 
youths and their chador-clad girlfriends stop in the shadows of the ancient 
columns for a moment of privacy from religious social strictures. 
</P>
<P>
But everything is up to date in the Bekaa when it comes to narcotics. Opium 
poppies are planted in the spring, and there are no sectarian boundaries in the 
trade. Watered by the runoff from the Lebanon Mountains, the colorful poppies 
will cover the foothills later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Opium and the traditional Indian hemp -- the cannabis variety that produces 
hashish, an oil that is usually smoked in a cigarette or pipe and is the 
long-favored narcotic of the Arab world -- have made the farmers of the 
northern Bekaa rich. A narcotics agent based in Cyprus said the valley's 1988 
crop produced 5.5 tons of raw opium. But hashish is still the biggest 
moneymaker. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wide-open trade out there in the valley," the narcotics agent said. "No 
big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Here in the Bekaa itself, farmers say that hemp, for instance, is primarily 
grown by Shiites, processed in part by Maronite Christians and shipped out of 
the northern port of Tripoli by Sunni Muslims. And all along the way, the 
narcotics agent said, everybody takes a cut. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time a load of heroin makes its way through all the militia roadblocks 
to a southern port, each militia assessing a tax, " he noted, "the on-board 
delivery price has been driven up 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Why the burgeoning drug trade? 
</P>
<P>
"Look," the narcotics man explained. "Money is power in Lebanon. Money buys 
guns, and guns are power. It's like gang warfare in L.A."

<P>
CHUCK WEBSTER IS THE CRISIS MANAGER FOR BRITISH PETROLEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Chuck Webster arrived in Huntington Beach last February, he had a huge job 
of containment on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 gallons of British Petroleum oil was gushing from the slashed 
hull of the tanker American Trader, threatening to ruin a popular stretch of 
Orange County beaches. As BP's crisis manager, it was Webster's responsibility 
to see that damage to the coast -- and to his company's reputation -- was 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
On both counts, BP received high marks -- unlike Exxon Corp., which last year 
took a drubbing for its response to the vastly more extensive spill of its oil 
in Alaska. Webster, with a bit of help from cooperative weather conditions, 
managed to turn an environmental disaster into a public relations success. 
</P>
<P>
He proved that, these days, it is simply smart business to show sensitivity to 
the public's deepening environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a philosophy and this is it," Webster said. "If you can work in a 
collaborative fashion with people from the federal level down to the local 
community, getting the best ideas on the table in an atmosphere of respect, 
then you can get the job done sooner and with less impact on the environment. 
This beats trying to find solutions in an atmosphere of chaos and 
finger-pointing." 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Webster, who is based in Cleveland, was particularly skillful 
in handling the news media, releasing up-to-the-minute information on every 
facet of the accident and subsequent cleanup. "For a company to try to hide 
something," he said, "it's going to come out." 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who spent Earth Day 1970 in Vietnam, said he believes that the 
environmental evolution that some companies are undergoing is a reflection of 
their work force. 
</P>
<P>
"As society has become more attuned to the environment, so are the people who 
are employed by businesses," he said. "We are campers. We are bikers. We are 
hikers and swimmers. We think a lot about the environment that we will leave to 
our children." JOEL SAPPELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 16, KILLED BY SHOTS FROM CAR ON 
FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed early Monday on a freeway near East Los 
Angeles while riding in a car with five friends, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rivera of Bell was in the front passenger seat of the car, which was 
northbound on the Long Beach Freeway near Bandini Boulevard and Slauson Avenue, 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Two shots were fired from another car carrying two men and one of them struck 
Rivera in the head, fatally wounding him, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether this was actually gang-related or not," Estrada said. 
"There's not enough information at this time." 
</P>
<P>
But investigators said Rivera and the others in the car did not belong to a 
gang.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARTIAL SERVICE RESTORED AFTER FIRE AT 
CABLE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Partial cable television service was restored to more than 20,000 households in 
the Inglewood and Westchester areas within eight hours of a multimillion-dollar 
fire that destroyed electronic equipment at Continental Cablevision's 
Westchester facility Monday morning, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Vice President John Gibbs said that 42 of the 52 channels were back 
on by mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
He said the blaze caused $7.5 million damage to the plant and electronic 
equipment. City fire officials estimated damage at $5.5 million and said they 
had not determined the cause of the blaze, which took nearly 100 firefighters 
76 minutes to control. 
</P>
<P>
The fire affected service to customers in Westchester, Lennox, Ladera Heights, 
Viewpark and Windsor Hills. Gibbs said the rest of the signals should be back 
within four days.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRIENDS TAKE A PIECE OF ZEKE'S DUNG HEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A light drizzle Monday disrupted plans by Mountain View Cemetery to begin 
hauling away Zeke the Sheik's Gargantuan dung heap. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't discourage dozens of Zeke's friends and amateur gardeners from 
coming by for their own piece of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
All morning, well-wishers were lined up in front of the 30-foot-high mound next 
to Zeke's Altadena farmhouse, hoping to salvage some of the steamy soil. 
</P>
<P>
Some paused to sign a petition describing the one-acre jungle of fruits and 
cacti fueled by the fertilizer as "an educational experience." Others shelled 
out a few bucks for T-shirts featuring a photograph of Zeke, the alter ego of 
47-year-old Timothy Dundon. 
</P>
<P>
Cemetery officials, who years ago gave Dundon permission to spread the fecund 
mass atop one of their vacant lots, said they will send out a work crew to haul 
away what is left of the compost pile as soon as the weather breaks.

ISGRO CLAIMS HE'S 'FALL GUY' IN MCA PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE RECORD PROMOTER HAS BEEN INDICTED ON A BEVY OF CHARGES, 
INCLUDING RACKETEERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense lawyer for a Glendale man accused of record industry racketeering 
asserted Monday that his client was "the fall guy" for a government 
investigation of MCA Records that had gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Re, the lawyer for Joseph Isgro, made the charge in a hearing on his 
motion that an indictment against Isgro, 42, be dismissed on the grounds of 
government misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The government has denied that it engaged in any misconduct or that there was 
anything improper about the case against Isgro. In a court filing, two Justice 
Department officials assert that Isgro's motion "seems to have been gleaned 
from newspaper clippings" about the MCA probe and that, in any case, that 
controversy is irrelevant to the charges against Isgro. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge James M. Ideman said he would hold a full hearing on 
the motion on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
Isgro, once one of the nation's leading independent record promoters, was 
indicted by a federal grand jury last Nov. 30 on a bevy of criminal counts, 
including racketeering, conspiracy to defraud Columbia Records, making 
undisclosed "payola" payments to radio stations, mail fraud, filing false tax 
returns, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to impede the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail. If convicted of all the charges, 
he faces 200 years in prison and $1.4 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Re has alleged in court documents that the government's investigation of Isgro 
stemmed from a squelched investigation of MCA's relationship to alleged mobster 
Sal Pisello, who was convicted of tax evasion. Re asserted Tuesday that the 
government ended the MCA probe for "political reasons" and decided that it had 
to indict Isgro to justify the wide-reaching investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that several ranking Justice Department officials, including Robert 
Brosio, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told Marvin Rudnick, an 
attorney with the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force here, to 
halt his investigation of MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rudnick was urged to investigate Isgro, according to Re's brief, which 
also alleges that Los Angeles Police Department officials supplied information 
to Rudnick about Isgro. The brief further alleges that some of the LAPD 
personnel in question had close ties to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Rudnick successfully prosecuted Pisello. However, he was removed 
from further responsibilities on the case and eventually was fired by the 
Justice Department. He currently is in private practice in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what Re is alleging has been reported in accounts in various newspapers 
and on the CBS program "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Re has subpoenaed both Rudnick and another former strike force lawyer, Richard 
Stavin, to testify about the government's handling of the case. Both were in 
court Monday and both said they would be back on May 21. In the past, both have 
been highly critical of the Justice Department's handling of the record 
industry probe. 
</P>
<P>
Rudnick did not offer any opinions on Isgro's guilt or innocence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Justice Department have denied in the past that an 
investigation of MCA was prematurely suppressed. They have refused to discuss 
Rudnick's firing, saying it was a personnel matter. On Monday, Justice 
Department lawyer William Lynch and Assistant U.S. Atty. Drew Pitt of the 
Strike Force declined any comment, as did Brosio. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lynch and Pitt have issued a sharp reply to Re's allegations in legal 
papers they filed recently. They assert that Isgro's motion "seems to have been 
gleaned from newspaper clippings which featured a disgruntled former Justice 
Department employee who was discharged," a clear reference to Rudnick. 
</P>
<P>
"The only impropriety suggested . . . is that a former prosecutor was prevented 
from pursuing an investigation of a corporate entity other than Mr. Isgro," the 
government's reply brief continues. "The government denies that such was the 
case but, even assuming this was true, it furnishes the defendant, Isgro, with 
no defense on his charges." 
</P>
<P>
An MCA spokesperson declined comment, saying, "We are not a party to this 
litigation."

DATAPRODUCTS TO BE SOLD FOR $160 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of Japan's Hitachi Group said Monday that they agreed to buy 
Dataproducts Corp. for about $160 million in cash, about three months after a 
New York investor group abandoned a bid for the Woodland Hills computer-printer 
maker because it could not raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies, Hitachi Koki and Nissei Sangyo, will form a joint venture 
corporation that plans to acquire Dataproducts through a $10-a-share tender 
offer. Hitachi Koki -- which is 24% owned by Hitachi Ltd., a large Japanese 
electronics company -- makes power tools and scientific instruments, as well as 
computer printers. Nissei Sangyo, a trading company owned 57% by Hitachi, is 
the Hitachi Group's primary marketing arm. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts stock closed Monday at $9.625 a share, up $3.25 in trading on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger, approved by Dataproducts' directors, should give the 
company some long-sought stability, said Dataproducts Chairman Jack C. Davis, 
who will stay on as chief executive of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're able to focus on the business and not have to worry about some other 
outside disruption," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the earlier takeover bid by DPC Acquisition Corp., 
Dataproducts last year embarked on a restructuring that led to the layoff of 
nearly 11% of its workers and the sale of its headquarters property to raise 
cash for a $40-million stock buyback. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the Japanese companies and Dataproducts had discussed selling 
Dataproducts' New England subsidiary, which makes printers for the military. 
Dataproducts had planned to sell the unit last year in the restructuring but 
abandoned the attempt because of the slowdown in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that otherwise, "our first premise is to continue operating the way 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
In January, DPC announced that it could not raise enough money to finance its 
proposed $190-million, $10-per-share takeover of Dataproducts, blaming "current 
disarray in the financial markets." The DPC deal was to be partly financed by 
junk bonds, as well as bank loans and cash.

Sports Daily Plans Expansion: The National, the sports daily that has been 
publishing editions in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles for the past 2 1/2 
months, plans to begin editions this summer in San Diego and San Francisco, 
publisher Peter Price said. Price said in a telephone interview that he expects 
that the San Diego edition will start by July 1 and a San Francisco edition 
will be launched in July. He said the newspaper plans to add at least one city 
a month to its lineup during the last five months of the year but was not ready 
to identify the cities.

REEBOK PICKS INFINITI AD PRODUCER AS NEW AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reebok International on Monday awarded its estimated $40-million advertising 
account to Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, the Boston-based agency that 
created the controversial campaign for Infiniti cars. 
</P>
<P>
Hill Holliday replaces Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day/Mojo, which in February 
announced that it and Reebok had agreed to break off their three-year 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Chiat/Day/Mojo, which will continue to handle Reebok's international 
advertising, was later asked to submit a presentation, said an agency spokesman 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Hill Holliday President Jack Sansolo, who was visiting the agency's Los Angeles 
office on Monday, said his firm's presentation to Reebok called for a 
significantly different campaign than that created by Chiat/Day/Mojo. But he 
would not reveal any details of the new advertising, which is scheduled to 
break during the back-to-school season. 
</P>
<P>
Reebok "was looking for the best work that would take them over the long term," 
said Sansolo. "Everyone here is very excited." 
</P>
<P>
Reebok will become one of Hill Holliday's three largest accounts, which include 
Hyatt Corp. and Infiniti, Nissan Motor Co.'s new luxury automobile division. 
The agency's campaign to introduce Infiniti created a stir because it featured 
images of forests, streams and rocks, but no cars. More recent ads feature the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms competing for the Reebok account included Levine, Huntley, Schmidt 
&amp; Beaver; Waring &amp; LaRosa, and DDB Needham Worldwide.

Axa Midi Requests Continuance: The company that is attempting to buy Farmers 
Insurance Group of Los Angeles asked to delay regulatory hearings on its 
purchase of Farmers for about 60 days so that it can restructure its bid. 
</P>
<P>
The request follows rejection of Axa Midi Assurances' takeover offer by the 
California Department of Insurance, which maintained that the bid was too 
highly leveraged. Axa Midi must obtain approvals from insurance regulators in 
nine states to complete the deal. Axa plans to buy Farmers from a group led by 
Sir James Goldsmith.

ROCKWELL 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT DECLINES FROM YEAR EARLIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International earned $173.4 million on sales of $3.15 billion in its 
second quarter ended March 31, a decline in net income but a small increase in 
operating profit over the same period last year, the El Segundo firm said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said prior-year second-quarter earnings were $270.7 million, which 
included a $104-million after-tax gain on the sale of its Measurement &amp; 
Flow Control division. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace sales and earnings were down compared to the same period a year ago, 
while the firm's electronics segment was up on strength across a number of 
commercial and industrial segments. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results for the first six months were better than we anticipated when the 
fiscal year began," said Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive. "Based 
on our current assessment of the economy, our outlook for the full 1990 year is 
for modest earnings-per-share improvement over 1989, before last year's 
40-cents-per-share gain from the sale of a business." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace earnings declined in the 1990 period because the comparable 1989 
period "benefited from more favorable contract adjustments in aircraft and 
space programs," the company said. Rockwell's aircraft, space systems and 
defense electronics segments all showed declines in sales. Its graphics and 
automotive groups reported higher sales.

IBM POSTS STRONG 1ST-QUARTER RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an overall strong demand for its computer products, International 
Business Machines said Monday that profit in the first quarter jumped 9% to 
$1.04 billion while revenue rose 11% to $14.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the news pleasantly surprised some quarters of Wall Street and sparked 
a modest rally in the stock market, several analysts cautioned that IBM's 
performance was not as strong as the comparison to the first three months of 
1989 would seem to suggest. The year-ago quarter was a decidedly poor one for 
the company, these analysts noted. 
</P>
<P>
They added that they do not expect IBM to sustain the same pace of sales and 
profit growth for the remainder of the year. And they cautioned against drawing 
any conclusions for the rest of the electronics industry, which has been facing 
tough times in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM still has fundamental problems," said Steven Cohen, an analyst with 
SoundView Financial in Stamford, Conn. "This quarter is nice to have, but I'm 
not calling it a turnaround. . . . And IBM isn't any bellwether for the rest of 
the technology industry." 
</P>
<P>
Since hitting an annual profit peak of nearly $6.6 billion in 1984, IBM has 
been struggling to fight off a variety of domestic and international 
competitors challenging its wide-reaching computer operations. Over the last 
three years, the company has eliminated 6,500 jobs, induced nearly 20,000 
workers to take early retirement and transferred about 20,000 more workers from 
desk jobs to the sales force to trim costs and generate more business. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the job of overhauling and refocusing the world's largest computer maker 
has proven vexing. Last year, the company jolted Wall Street twice with 
lower-than-expected earnings, in the first quarter and again in the third. In 
response, analysts have lowered their sights for the company and were generally 
unprepared for Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
But William Easterbrook, an independent analyst who has been tracking IBM for 
years, said Wall Street should have realized that the company's poor 
performance in the first quarter last year would allow sales and earnings for 
the same period this year to stand out disproportionately. In the year-ago 
quarter, IBM earned $950 million on sales of $12.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Easterbrook noted that the second quarter of 1989 was exceptionally strong, and 
that the company is unlikely to exceed it by the same percentage posted in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean the company suddenly isn't doing as well. These are just 
quarterly numbers," Easterbrook said. "Overall I believe the turnaround 
strategy is sound. It's just that there is more work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Still, investors cheered the interim results. IBM rose $3.75 per share to close 
at $110.875 on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, where it was the most 
actively traded issue. And IBM, which is included in the Dow Jones industrial 
average, was widely credited for sparking Monday's 11.26-point rise in that 
index. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the first quarter's sales and profit were aided in part by strong 
sales of the company's top-of-the-line mainframe model, its most profitable 
business segment. Also contributing were growing sales of its new mainframe 
data storage disks and overall lower expenses due to employee reductions.

FORD SAYS BRAZIL WOES MAY SLASH ITS NET 
</P>

<P>
Ford Motor Co. said Monday that its 1990 profit could be cut substantially 
because of Brazil's economic problems, which have forced the big auto maker to 
temporarily shut down its Autolatina operations serving Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"Continuation of the present economic situation in Brazil could have a 
substantial adverse effect on Ford's earnings," the auto maker said in a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford spokesman confirmed that problems in Brazil may hurt its 1990 results 
but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ford earned $3.8 billion, or $8.22 a share, down 28% from a year 
ago, on revenue of $96.1 billion. But its Latin American operations improved in 
1989, primarily due to favorable results posted by Autolatina, a joint venture 
with Volkswagen AG. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Brazil's Congress approved a dramatic package of economic measures, 
including price and wage freezes, tax increases and monetary reforms designed 
to clamp down on inflation, running at nearly 5,000%. 
</P>
<P>
The program has caused a liquidity crisis, forcing Ford to temporarily halt 
production at Autolatina, Ford said in the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Autolatina, which held 56% of the total car market in Brazil in 1989, also has 
deferred all non-essential expenditures, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. auto industry analysts estimate that the Brazilian situation will 
cost Ford, and rival General Motors Corp., as much as a dollar per share in 
full-year earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, GM made $6.33 a share. Chrysler Corp. does not have Brazilian 
operations and is not expected to be affected by the difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were already expecting Ford and GM to report weak first-quarter 
earnings due to a soft North American car market and reduced production. Ford 
noted in the filing that first-quarter earnings will be hurt by production 
cuts. In the first two weeks of January, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler shut 
down virtually all of their North American plants to reduce bloated inventories 
of unsold new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, earnings at GM and Chrysler are also expected to be down 
significantly in the first quarter. Chrysler posted 1989 earnings of $1.55 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ford earnings outside the United States were $2.1 billion, down 3% 
from record earnings in 1988, the company said.

WEIGHTY CONCERNS AT WORK; 
</P>
<P>
MANY EMPLOYEES SWEAT RULES ON WHAT'S 'TOO FAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You think your job is tough? Consider how much tougher it would be if every 
time you clocked in, you had to tuck in your tummy, slither past your 
supervisor, and pray you didn't get sent to the scales. Too much dessert and 
your paychecks might stop. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous as it sounds, there are jobs like that, where pounds count as much 
as performance, where being called "a heavyweight" doesn't mean you're good at 
what you do. It simply means your bosses think you're too fat to do it. 
</P>
<P>
But how fat is too fat? If you do your job well, should you be disciplined -- 
or even fired -- if you happen to be too well fed? 
</P>
<P>
Should you be allowed to gain "a scosh" more girth as you get older, like those 
blue jeans ads say you inevitably will? 
</P>
<P>
Or should you be forced to remain the same weight for all your working life, as 
three flight attendants charged in an age and sex discrimination suit filed 
against American Airlines last week? 
</P>
<P>
And isn't percentage of body fat a better barometer of fitness than your weight 
in pounds, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
The answers depend on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city firefighters and paramedics are weighed every three months, 
says Capt. Richard Kampff of the medical liaison unit. If they fail to fall 
within height-weight ratios set by the department, their body fat is measured 
in a skin-fold pinch test or with a machine. 
</P>
<P>
Standards are different for men and women, since women "carry their weight and 
their fat differently than men," Kampff says. Overweight personnel are put in 
what is known in the ranks as "The Tub Club," meaning they must lose a minimum 
of two pounds a month. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds simple and sensible, right? 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Hegwer, a Los Angeles city paramedic for 10 years, doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
Hegwer weighed 130 when she joined the department, weighs 215 now, and says she 
looks "like a very square, very solid little person." (She is 5 feet 3 inches 
tall.) She adds that she is athletic, loves her job, performs it well and that 
none of her supervisors complains about the quality of her work. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical 24-hour work shift, she rushes to aid victims of assaults, 
shootings, stabbings, car crashes and cardiac arrest. Recently she and her 
partner climbed down a 70-foot hole to help Metro Rail workers after an 
accident. She regularly clambers up four flights of tenement stairs to reach 
people in the downtown area she serves, often carrying a defibrillator, medical 
kits or oxygen tank. As far as she knows, no one she ever helped has complained 
that the Angel of Mercy had too much flesh on her wings. 
</P>
<P>
But her bosses say she's too fat for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Hegwer, her union, and her union lawyer Diane Marchant, disagree. They lost one 
round in federal court, but on April 11 filed an appeal in the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. They say that paramedics should not have to conform to the 
firefighters' code since they do not fight fires, that the weight regulation is 
not uniformly enforced and is not even relevant to the job paramedics do. 
</P>
<P>
Marchant believes there are "all kinds of fitness tests available" to determine 
whether paramedics are suitable for the job. The tests used by the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department, she says, do not determine fitness and it is even 
questionable whether they accurately determine percent of body fat. Marchant 
says Hegwer is "very short and very round, but she is also very strong. And 
strength is a primary requirement for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hurtado, president of the United Paramedics of Los Angeles, agrees that 
what's needed is a different fitness standard that relates to paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, the weight standard has been used as a punitive tool by the 
Fire Department," the union official says. "When the department itself surveyed 
firefighters, 25% said they should have been in the weight program but were not 
put there. What that tells us is that there has been a certain amount of 
selectivity with respect to who is subjected to the weight-control process. 
</P>
<P>
"If, for example, they don't like the way you look, or they don't like the fact 
that you are involved in union activity, the weight-control program is one 
possible way to harass you." (Hegwer is a second vice president of the United 
Paramedics Union.) 
</P>
<P>
Don Forrest, president of United Firefighters of Los Angeles City, says the 
Fire Department needs a "more foolproof system" for evaluating firefighter 
fitness because the present one doesn't always work. "We've had marathon 
runners and weightlifters put into the weight clinic, whereas some who really 
need it never get sent." 
</P>
<P>
Forrest says immersing a person in water is the most accurate way to evaluate 
body fat, and whatever test is used should be enforced "across the board, from 
the department chief to the newest rookie." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. James Dolan, also of the Fire Department's medical liaison unit, replies: 
"Some of the criticisms are not totally unfounded because there is some degree 
of inaccuracy in almost all body-fat calculation methods. But the LAFD does 
enforce equally the department standards across all ranks of personnel." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department seems more relaxed where weight is concerned. 
"There are no weight restrictions for males or females in the Los Angeles 
Police Department," says Fred Nixon, officer in charge of press relations. "If 
we had an officer, male or female, whose weight became a hindrance or a 
detriment, then we would offer that person assistance in getting down to a more 
healthful weight level. We would not fire or suspend the person due to 
obesity." 
</P>
<P>
The United States Army says body circumference counts. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John S. O'Connor, director of training for the Army's physical fitness 
school in Ft. Benjamin Harrison, Ind., explains that a height-weight chart is 
used as a screening measure. If a person exceeds the chart guidelines, then "we 
use a circumference system in which we measure the circumference of different 
parts of the body in order to determine percentage of body fat. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't put people out of the Army for being overweight. We put them out for 
being over fat. If you're 6 feet tall and have 250 pounds of muscle, you're the 
kind of guy we like. If you have 140 pounds of fat, then you don't meet the 
criterion. The same goes for women. We index our scales by age and sex. We do 
not expect a 40-year-old female to have the same body-fat composition as a 
20-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
At American Airlines, charged in Los Angeles last week with age and sex 
discrimination by the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, most flight 
attendants are women. And all flight attendants are required to conform to 
height/weight standards set in the 1950s by the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
If a supervisor at American thinks a flight attendant looks heavy on a given 
day, she can order her to get weighed. If she thinks the attendant has shrunk 
in height she can tell her to get measured. If she has, (which happens to some 
women in middle age), then her maximum weight allowance is set even lower, 
because the chart says the shorter you are, the less you ought to weigh no 
matter what your age. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines have no weight regulations at all for their flight attendants. 
Others raise the weight limit as women get older. A 5-foot-5 flight attendant 
at United Airlines, for example, can weigh 140 at age 35 and 146 at age 55. But 
at American, a flight attendant who is 5-foot-5 must weigh no more than 129 
pounds for all of her working days. 
</P>
<P>
American flight attendant Patt Gibbs couldn't believe it. She returned to 
flight status after a four-year leave of absence in 1988, at the age of 45 with 
28 years of flying experience behind her. The Los Angeles woman says she passed 
all her basic training requirements "with flying colors." She says she was 
healthy, felt fit, looked trim. "I am an active, athletic woman. I swim, run, 
and have a commercial pilot's license." 
</P>
<P>
Her supervisor had her weighed, found her too heavy by 29 pounds, and put Gibbs 
on mandatory personal leave which meant she got no salary, no benefits, no paid 
health insurance. Gibbs says she was treated like a non-employee. 
</P>
<P>
Flight attendants returning from a leave of absence, like Gibbs, must meet the 
weight requirement for their height within a specified amount of time, or they 
can lose their jobs altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"All the pension and benefits you've worked so hard for years to build can be 
yanked away," Gibbs says. So she did what she says many others in her position 
have done over the years: Diet to the point of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs lost the 29 pounds and returned to flying at 125 pounds, although she 
says she was weak. 
</P>
<P>
Later, her supervisor ordered her to be measured. Gibbs says medical personnel 
for the airline asked her to remove her flat shoes and socks and show them the 
bottoms of her feet. "Basically, they were implying I might be wearing lifts on 
my soles," Gibbs says. She was also asked to show identification, implying, 
Gibbs thinks, that she had sent a skinny stand-in for the height/weight 
procedure. "They were insinuating 'not only are you a fat and ugly person, but 
you may also be a liar and a cheat.' " 
</P>
<P>
After measuring, she was told she had shrunk 1/4 of an inch to 5 feet 3 inches, 
so her weight requirement was lowered to 121 pounds instead of 125. More 
dieting was needed. 
</P>
<P>
She lost the extra weight, returned to work and eventually filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The EEOC suit, in which Gibbs is a plaintiff, was filed, she says, on behalf of 
all flight attendants returning from leave, whether it be for personal, 
maternity, educational, union or unpaid sick leave. (Gibbs' leave was to serve 
as president of the American flight attendants' union.) 
</P>
<P>
"American's policy inhibits women from taking personal leave in order to have 
kids, go to school or whatever else they may want to do," Gibbs says, "because 
it's possible they may never again be able to meet the company's appearance 
standard." American Airlines' written policy requires that, in addition to 
being the approved weight for one's height, flight attendants must be "free of 
bulges, rolls or paunches" in order to give "an alert, efficient image." 
Mothers returning to work after childbirth are not given enough time to lose 
weight, Gibbs says. 
</P>
<P>
An American Airlines spokesman said Friday that the "company had just received 
the lawsuit" and would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred, who is not involved in either lawsuit, says most 
companies today are "sophisticated, and not foolish enough to engage in blatant 
age discrimination," firing people by saying they are too old. "Instead they go 
off and devise schemes and seemingly nondiscriminatory business justification 
for terminating older workers. 
</P>
<P>
"But courts can see through those schemes and can determine whether they are 
simply pretexts for age discrimination." Allred adds that some companies try to 
save money by firing older workers who have higher salaries, greater seniority 
and more benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers just don't like the way employees look. Victor Valenzuelas, 
president and business manager of Local 814, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees union, says he "remembers vividly" such a case. 
</P>
<P>
A long-time cocktail waitress at an LAX restaurant was "designated overweight" 
by her employer. Valenzuela says she was "excessively heavy" and the restaurant 
uniforms were excessively short and revealing. The restaurant owner claimed 
customers didn't like what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
The case was taken to arbitration and the waitress won. "The arbitrator ruled 
she could go back to work with all contractual benefits," Valenzuela recalls. 
"But she was so fed up that she decided to change her job."

'BIGGEST BABY SHOWER' TARGETS SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Later this spring, the American Lung Assn.'s Los Angeles chapter again will 
sponsor the "World's Biggest Baby Shower" to alert young pregnant women to 
smoking's dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a creative approach," says Ron Arias of the ALA. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with a very hard-to-reach group. It's an economic and 
educational problem more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics bear that out: 20% to 40% of all women who become pregnant are 
smokers and only about 25% stop during pregnancy, experts say. The potential 
health consequences for these women and their babies are severe: 
</P>
<P>
* According to a 1989 Swedish study, women who smoke during pregnancy increase 
the risk of a late miscarriage by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
* Smoking while pregnant appears to increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome. More than 2,500 deaths of infants under the age of 1 could be 
attributed to smoking by the mother, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
* A pregnant women who smokes two packs a day reduces the oxygen supply to her 
fetus by 25%, the lung association reports. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Kenneth Kizer of the State Department of Health Services, 
however, pregnant women who stop smoking early in the pregnancy have a good 
chance to stay off cigarettes. SHARI ROAN

FESTIVE LULLABY BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the Lullaby Guild, this year's Easter parade came down a fashion runway. 
Sunday afternoon and evening the guild presented productions of the 32nd annual 
Ebony Fashion Fair at the Hollywood Palladium, raising $35,000 for the 
Children's Home Society of California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a double parade," said guild president Pat Gibson as she looked out at 
the 3 o'clock show's 1,500 guests. "There's the fashion in the audience and 
then you've got the show up on stage." 
</P>
<P>
The event isn't traditionally held on Easter, but the Fashion Fair is a touring 
show sponsored by the publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, and this was the 
only date available. At least Easter is "a time when people want to feel 
festive," said event chair Pat Williams-Graves, and what better way to be in a 
holiday spirit than by helping one of L.A.'s oldest African-American charities. 
The guild was the first black auxiliary to affiliate with the Children's Home 
Society and has raised more than $670,000 in the past 40 years to assist the 
home in placing children for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great charity and the show really sells itself," said KTLA's Larry 
McCormick, who acted as emcee. "It's a chance for the audience to come out, 
dress up and see a fashion show with a lots of dazzle and glitz." 
</P>
<P>
Though the show is primarily haute couture from designers including Yves St. 
Laurent, Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior and Bob Mackie, there are some men's 
fashion that elicits a Saturday-night-at-Chippendale's response from the 80% 
female crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are always the main attraction," said fashion writer Lori Chapman as a 
bare-chested man modeled silk leopard-skin pattern pajamas. "The fashion takes 
a back seat. You wait. When they come out in the bathing suits, they'll tear 
the house down." 
</P>
<P>
It's a miracle the Palladium survived.

The last time I saw Greta Garbo was in the mid-1970s and we really didn't get a 
chance to chat, so I never found out what she'd been up to since her retirement 
from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it was the only time I ever saw Garbo, but that line has snapped more 
heads at parties than the mention of any stock brokerage on earth. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that I physically touched the elusive Garbo certainly puts me in 
rare company indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
I had done an interview with the late Gayelord Hauser, the prince of healthy 
living and adviser from the early 1930s to the likes of Mae West, Cary Grant 
and Garbo, and he had invited me to a small gathering he was having at his 
Coldwater Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser had suggested I come early so he could show me his extensive art 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
His house sat back off the road and was reached by a driveway so wide people 
often mistook it for a street, so there was a constant flow of cars coming as 
far as the gate, then turning around and heading back. 
</P>
<P>
As I drove up the driveway, I noticed a woman in a large sun hat strolling 
through the formal courtyard behind the gate. When she saw me, she darted 
behind a pillar and watched me pull up. When I got out of the car and was 
obviously coming in, she took off at a dead run toward the guest house. 
</P>
<P>
A bit later, as Hauser was mixing some refreshments, I asked, "Who was that 
crazy lady running around the yard when I arrived?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," he said, very matter-of-factly, "that's Garbo." 
</P>
<P>
"Greta Garbo?" said I. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes; she's very funny around strangers," he said, and began describing a 
Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the other 20 or so guests arrived and the party went on, but at no point 
during the evening was there any mention or sign of the lady in the guest 
house. 
</P>
<P>
I finally gave up on the idea of having a drink and a little chat with the 
elusive Swede. It was time to go anyway, so I did. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway down the hill, I realized I had forgotten a package of photos Hauser 
had given me, so I turned around and went back. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, from what I could gather later, once the party had narrowed down to 
just a few of Garbo's old friends, Hauser had sent a maid to tell her the coast 
was clear. As the maid was delivering her message, I was reentering the main 
house. 
</P>
<P>
I retrieved the package and walked out the front door and -- smack! -- 
physically ran face dab into Garbo. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently remembering an extremely important previous engagement, she gasped, 
threw her hands in front of her face, then turned and ran lickety-split across 
the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Slam! went the door, and I could hear locks latching and saw lights go out. 
</P>
<P>
And that's how I ran into Greta Garbo at a party one night.

A witness at the fraud trial of Imelda Marcos testified today she removed 
documents from the former Philippines first lady's palace that revealed Marcos 
and her husband kept Swiss bank accounts registered under false names. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Dr. Angelita Reyes, said she went to the Malacanang Palace in 
February, 1986 -- shortly after Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his 
wife fled the "People Power" revolution that elevated Corazon Aquino to the 
presidency -- and rifled through some of the papers the couple left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Among the documents Reyes said she found were signature cards indicating the 
Marcoses had at least two Swiss bank accounts under the pseudonyms "John Lewis" 
and "Jane Ryan." 
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos, 60, is on trial for allegedly plotting with her late husband to 
divert money stolen from the Philippines treasury into real estate and art 
investments in Manhattan and around the world.

LITHUANIA EMBARGO BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
NATURAL GAS CUT ORDERED BY SOVIETS

Soviet officials ordered drastic cuts in natural gas supplies to Lithuania 
today, putting into force a threatened economic embargo to break the Baltic 
republic's drive for independence, Lithuanians said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials also plan to cut off oil and gasoline to the republic 
Wednesday, Lithuanian officials said. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had 
given Lithuania until Sunday to repeal laws enacted since the republic's 
Parliament declared independence March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told British radio that he had not 
expected such a "brutal" move from Gorbachev but that it will not weaken the 
republic's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"We can survive in poor conditions," Landsbergis told Independent Radio News in 
London. "We survived in war conditions, in terrible postwar conditions, without 
any gas, without any oil. . . . We will survive." 
</P>
<P>
A telegram from the Soviet Western Trans Gas company to the Lithuanian gas 
company said Moscow had ordered the supply of natural gas to the republic 
"sharply curtailed" beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Juodenienie, a secretary for Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene, said that the 
telegram was sent to Lithuania's gas authority rather than to the government 
and that officials did not immediately know whether the cut had already taken 
effect and what percentage would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The telegram was read in the republic's Parliament as the legislators were 
debating a response to Gorbachev's ultimatum. A Lithuanian government spokesman 
said the response would probably not be voted on until Wednesday but stressed 
that the republic will not rescind its independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said he is watching to see if shipments are 
actually cut off to Lithuania and considering "appropriate responses." He did 
not specify how the United States might respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly these announcements are contrary to the approach that we have urged 
and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union," Bush said. "I would simple 
repeat that what we need is dialogue, discussion and a peaceful resolution of 
this great difficulty there." 
</P>
<P>
Juodenienie said the Lithuanian government received a telephone warning from 
the Druzhba, or Friendship, enterprise that supplies oil to Lithuania, saying 
that deliveries of oil and gasoline will be curtailed beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian residents formed long lines at gasoline stations in recent days to 
fill up for what they fear might be the last time. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas, in an interview before the 
reduction of gas supplies was announced, said if Moscow "cut the tap," there 
would be serious problems in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural gas (for heating) will disappear in 20 days, and the situation with 
electricity is the same," Ozolas said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania has been talking to Scandinavian and other Western countries about 
helping out if Moscow cut off energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene sent Gorbachev a telegram Monday seeking a meeting to negotiate 
Moscow's objections to laws enacted by Lithuania.

REV. ABERNATHY, DR. KING'S CLOSEST FRIEND IN '60S, DIES

The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who fought for civil rights alongside his 
friend Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s, died today in a hospital at the 
age of 64. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy died at Crawford Long Hospital, which he entered three weeks ago for 
an electrolytic imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said his heart stopped during a lung scan, and he died while 
in an operating room. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy, a Baptist minister whose grandfather was a slave, was criticized 
last year by many for discussing King's alleged extramarital affairs in his 
memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy was King's closest friend and associate until King was assassinated 
in 1968, and helped King found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy caused a furor in the civil rights community last fall with a 
controversial autobiography, "And the Walls Came Tumbling Down," which referred 
to King's alleged extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy mentioned in his book that King dallied with various women April 3, 
1968, his last night alive. He became the first of the civil rights inner 
circle to openly discuss King's alleged marital infidelities, which had been 
chronicled by several biographers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, King, Abernathy and several other black clergymen formed the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference to boost their struggle for civil rights for 
blacks in the South. 
</P>
<P>
King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968, and shortly 
thereafter Abernathy assumed the fallen leader's position as SCLC president. He 
held the position for nine years, as the focus of the civil rights movement 
shifted from voting rights and civil rights to such economic issues as full 
employment and anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned in 1977 to campaign for Congress but was defeated in the Democratic 
primary.

COURT REJECTS USE OF PEYOTE AS A RELIGIOUS RIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled today there is no constitutional right to take the 
hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, voting 6-3, said Oregon officials may deny unemployment benefits 
to two fired drug counselors who ingested small amounts of peyote in Indian 
religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the First Amendment does 
not permit people to break the law in the name of religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from 
compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting the conduct that the state 
is free to regulate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's drug laws do not "regulate religious beliefs, the communication of 
religious beliefs or the raising of one's children in those beliefs," Scalia 
added. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun accused the court of 
treating religious freedom for the first time as a "luxury" rather than "an 
essential element of liberty." 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices 
Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor provided the sixth vote to deny the unemployment 
benefits to the fired drug counselors. But she said in a separate concurring 
opinion that the five other justices in the majority went too far in limiting 
religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Peyote is a cactus "button" containing the hallucinogen mescaline. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Galen W. Black and Alfred C. Smith said using small quantities of 
peyote in a church service is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities 
of wine in Christian religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials said that if peyote is permitted in church ceremonies it 
will create a wedge for allowing other drugs, such as marijuana, to be used by 
other religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon officials also argued that creating an exception for peyote would be a 
violation of constitutionally required separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
In another decision, the court made it more difficult for employers to withdraw 
recognition of a labor union representing striking workers after new employees 
are hired to break the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Today's 5-4 decision in a Texas case reversed a federal appeals court ruling 
that said the National Labor Relations Board must presume that strikebreakers 
oppose the strikers' union. 
</P>
<P>
"Replacements may in some circumstances desire union representation despite 
their willingness to cross the picket line," Justice Marshall wrote for the 
court.

Scientists for the first time have found a gene that appears to be linked to 
alcoholism, providing strong new evidence the disease affecting 18 million 
Americans is caused at least partly by heredity, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A study of tissue from the brains of 70 human cadavers concluded the gene was 
present in 77% of alcoholics and absent in 72% of non-alcoholics, researchers 
reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first reported link between a particular gene and the presence of 
alcoholism in individuals, although there has been a growing body of evidence 
suggesting a role for heredity. 
</P>
<P>
The findings could lead to better ways to identify people at risk of becoming 
alcoholics and a greater understanding of the underlying causes of the disease, 
which could lead to new treatments and preventive measures.

BAKER RULES OUT RETURN TO POLITICIZED UNESCO

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today ruled out the possibility of an 
early U.S. return to UNESCO membership, saying the U.N. body is still 
mismanaged and excessively politicized. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said in a report to Congress that UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor 
continues to be haunted by his reputation as a "well-intentioned but poor 
administrator." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago the Reagan Administration withdrew from UNESCO, known formally as 
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Britain and 
Singapore quickly followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed membership would cost the United States about $50 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said UNESCO at this stage "does not possess the characteristics of a 
well-managed and focused organization." 
</P>
<P>
A principal U.S. complaint over the years has been that UNESCO tries to limit 
press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said in his report that Mayor, after some highly encouraging comments on 
that subject, has since equivocated by stating that press freedoms must be 
"balanced" against the desires of governments to control the flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said UNESCO resolutions heavily biased against Israel and often 
based on false information continue to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that instead of imposing personnel cuts, as he had promised, Mayor 
has proposed a restructuring plan that would create 33 new posts at an 
estimated cost of $6 million. The plan has plunged UNESCO into its worst crisis 
in six years, Baker said.

President Bush, who braved rain and 35-m.p.h. winds to play golf in Bermuda 
during the weekend, is suffering from a cold, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush has had a cold for several days, 
even before he traveled to Bermuda Friday for a meeting with British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taking cold medicine," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the President's voice is still "a little raspy" but he is 
getting better. 
</P>
<P>
Bush leaves Thursday on a four-day trip to Florida with a side journey to 
Birmingham, Ala. He plans to meet with French President Francois Mitterrand on 
Key Largo, Fla., on Thursday and do a lot of fishing during the weekend.

HOUSING STARTS DECLINE 9.3%, STEEPEST DROP SINCE JAN., 1989

Housing starts fell 9.3% in March, their second consecutive monthly drop and 
the steepest in more than a year, as the pace returned to late 1989 levels 
after spurting during unusually warm weather in January and February, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million units last month, down from a 
revised 1.46 million units in February. 
</P>
<P>
The February rate first had been reported at 1.48 million units. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in starts in March was the biggest since a 12.4% drop in January, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had been expecting the drop after construction starts jumped 23.2% in 
January, the warmest on record, after declining 5.5% in December, the fourth 
coldest since the government began keeping records 96 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although starts slipped 7.1% during February, they remained well above the 
level of the last 11 months of 1989 as the unusually warm weather continued. 
More normal temperatures returned in March and that, combined with double-digit 
mortgage rates, produced last month's decline in construction, analysts said.

Avon Products Inc. has asked a federal court to void the purchases of Avon 
shares made by Chartwell Associates, an unfriendly investor group that has 
acquired a 16% stake in the door-to-door cosmetics company. 
</P>
<P>
Chartwell, whose members include representatives of Avon rival Mary Kay 
Cosmetics Inc. of Dallas, the Fisher real estate family of New York and oil 
heir Gordon Getty, has purchased more than 9 million shares of Avon common 
stock for about $312 million over the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan late Monday, Avon 
alleges that Chartwell made "false, incomplete and misleading" public 
disclosures in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding 
the group's purchase of Avon shares. 
</P>
<P>
The "true, undisclosed purpose for their investment in Avon is to acquire an 
unfair competitive advantage for the benefit of Mary Kay . . . at the expense 
of Avon, its employees and its public shareholders," the suit said.

GRETA GARBO'S BODY IS CREMATED AMID SECRECY

Legendary film star Greta Garbo's body has been cremated secretly according to 
her wish, it was disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Chapel said the cremation had taken 
place on the order of Miss Garbo's family. 
</P>
<P>
The city medical examiner's office confirmed that it had given permission for 
the cremation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all very private at the request of the family," said Robert Lewis of 
Campbell's, which was in charge of arrangements for Miss Garbo. "They were 
carrying out Miss Garbo's wishes for complete privacy in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Garbo, 84, died Monday at New York Hospital. She had been undergoing 
thrice-weekly dialysis treatments for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Her remains may be buried in a family grave in Stockholm, the Swedish newspaper 
Expressen reported today. The newspaper quoted Miss Garbo's only surviving 
relative, niece Grae Reisfeld, as saying it was her aunt's wish to be buried in 
Sweden, and she had also expressed that desire to Swedish diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Expressen quoted Reisfeld of Passaic, N.J., as saying the cause of death was 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart could not take any more, and there were complications," Reisfeld was 
quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Her frugal ways and good financial advice built the star's holdings into a 
fortune, according to the Post, which reported she owned several buildings in 
Beverly Hills, an extensive art collection and her East Side co-op. 
</P>
<P>
Who will inherit the large estate remains unclear. Miss Garbo left no will. 
</P>
<P>
The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to the 
Rogosin Institute. Miss Garbo underwent dialysis at the nonprofit facility, 
which is affiliated with New York Hospital.

NBC TOP NETWORK LAST SEASON; 'ROSEANNE' TIES 'COSBY' AS NO. 1 SERIES;

NBC was the top network for the 1989-90 television season, it was a split 
decision between "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne" for No. 1 series, and there 
was a mysterious drop-off in general television viewing, according to 
end-of-season figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-week prime time season ended Sunday with NBC way out in front, posting 
its fifth consecutive win with a 14.6 rating and a 24 share, according to the 
A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC was second with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share, and CBS was 
third with a 12.2 and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
In evening news, ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings was the new 
champ, with a 10.9 rating, with "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather demoted to 
second with a 10.0 rating. "NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw was third with a 
9.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
The question of which show was on top of the list was a matter of whether or 
not you counted a "Roseanne" episode broadcast outside of its regular time 
period. NBC and ABC called the win for ABC's "Roseanne," while CBS gave it to 
NBC's "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise," said Bob Niles, NBC vice president of research, in 
announcing the season-end statistics at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The three-network share of homes using television -- HUT levels -- was down 
from the 1988-89 figure of 67%. 
</P>
<P>
David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of planning and research called the 
decline "unprecedented and unexplained" and said CBS was pressing Nielsen for 
more data. 
</P>
<P>
The top new program for the season that aired six or more times was ABC's 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which had a 20.9 rating and a 32 share. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" on ABC won as most-watched made-for-television movie. Top 
miniseries of two or more parts was ABC's "Small Sacrifices." The most-watched 
theatrical movie was "Lethal Weapon" on NBC. The Academy Awards on ABC won as 
top entertainment special. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of prime time, CBS was the daytime winner, with "The Young and the 
Restless" topping the chart. In morning programming, ABC's "Good Morning 
America" was top-rated, with NBC's "Today" show falling off after Deborah 
Norville replaced Jane Pauley. CBS was third. 
</P>
<P>
TOP 10 SHOWS The top 10 regular series for the 1989-90 season, according to the 
A. C. Nielsen Co., were:

A coalition of artists, executives and record companies are urging makers of 
compact discs to "Ban the Box" -- the disposable plastic and paper packaging in 
which most CDs are sold. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Olivia Newton-John, Kris Kristofferson and The Grateful Dead, along 
with Rhino Records, Fantasy Records and Rykodisc, have lent their names to the 
group, which is calling for an end to the environmentally damaging packaging. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to encourage development of a plan, supported by labels and 
retailers, that will result in an end to disposable packaging in the first half 
of 1991," said Robert Simonds, chief financial officer of Rykodisc and a member 
of the Ban the Box coalition. About 250 million CDs are expected to be sold in 
this year in the United States, the only country still to package CDs in the 
6-by-12-inch boxes.

Less than a year after retiring from basketball, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has 
bounced back into the public eye with an executive producer berth on the motion 
picture "Recruiting Violations." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar was tapped for the project on the basis of his basketball 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
The movie centers on the relationship between a white college basketball coach 
and a top black recruit who fails to show up on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar will be involved in development of the screenplay and packaging of 
the film, said Rob Fried, whose Fried Films is making the movie for Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The former Los Angeles Lakers star won't be appearing in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't foresee that. I just want to do this on the production end and get my 
feet wet that way," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar is currently touring with his book "Kareem," and he expresses 
mixed feelings on the possibility of a motion picture version of the book.

Mike Wallace, veteran correspondent for CBS' "60 Minutes," turns 72 on May 9

And age can help, he told TV Guide in its April 21 issue.

"I'm old enough and experienced enough so that people are more willing to talk 
more openly to me than they used to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a strange difference in the last few years in the manner an 
interview with me is perceived. I'm considered less of a threat."

He said he can feel sorry for colleagues trying to start a television news 
magazine: "When I started with '60 Minutes' in 1968, no one was watching. That 
took away a lot of pressure."

Johnny Carson's first wife says she can't survive on the $13,500 he pays her 
annually and is suing for more, her attorney said.

<P>
Joan (Jody) Carson, Carson's wife of 14 years and the mother of his three sons, 
is asking him for $120,000 a year, said celebrated matrimonial lawyer Raoul 
Felder.

Jody Carson, who told her story on the syndicated television show, "A Current 
Affair," Monday night, said she has been forced to move around and even stayed 
with her mother in a nursing home for several months last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in a small apartment in New York, living off the little I've saved," Jody 
Carson, 63, told columnist Cindy Adams in today's New York Post. "I've had lots 
of illness. Not just physical. I've been in a mental-health facility for panic 
disorders." 
</P>
<P>
Since his marriage to her in 1949, Carson has divorced and remarried three 
times. Carson reportedly earns $40 million a year.

Shawn Burr and Greg Adams scored two goals apiece as Canada rallied from a 1-3 
deficit to beat the United States 6-3 today in the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the second in two games for the Americans. They were crushed by 
Czechoslovakia 7-1 in their opener Monday.

Although Canada won the game, it probably lost Joe Nieuwendyk for the rest of 
the tournament. The high-scoring Calgary center injured his left knee halfway 
through the first period. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the hospital to have it diagnosed there, so we don't know the total 
extent of the injury," Team Canada coach Dave King said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I doubt he will play again in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Canada, runners-up behind the Soviet Union last year, moved to 2-0 in the 
preliminary round-robin portion, while Team USA fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, winner of a record 21 world championships, earlier defeated 
winless West Germany 5-2 for its second straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk, who was checked along the boards by U.S. defenseman Jimmy Johnson 
of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was carried off the ice on a stretcher and taken to 
a hospital. The incident occurred at 11:25 in the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk had arrived only a few hours earlier from Toronto with fellow Flames 
Al MacInnis, Doug Gilmour and Theoren Fleury. The defending Stanley Cup champs 
were upset by the Kings in the first round of the NHL playoffs last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play very well after Joe's injury," King said. "But we were able to 
come back. We scored five straight goals, but the U.S. still never gave up and 
played really strong." 
</P>
<P>
Team USA plays the Soviet Union on Thursday, a team the Americans haven't 
beaten in international hockey since the 1980 Olympics, and could miss the 
medal-round for the fourth straight time. The U.S. last made the playoffs in 
the 1985 tournament in Prague, when it finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor still hopes to add three more NHL players, possibly goalie John Casey, 
Neil Broten and Mike Modano of the Minnesota North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spots open for one goalie and two skaters," Taylor said. "We're also 
talking with Gary Suter from Calgary." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Rota, a Canadian team official, said Nieuwendyk suffered knee ligament 
damage and "will probably fly home to Canada tomorrow or Thursday."

CLEMSON GETS NCAA RECAP ON VIOLATIONS

Clemson officials have received the case summary of the NCAA investigation into 
the school's football program and are preparing for their hearing before the 
Committee on Infractions in Kansas City on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A case summary is a compilation of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s 
allegations, the university's response and the NCAA enforcement staff's 
response to the Clemson response. It provides all the parties an indication of 
the issues to be discussed in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to get on with it," said Nick Lomax, university vice president for 
student affairs. "To say I'm glad the day is here, no; we wish it had never 
happened. But we're ready to deal with it and get it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-man Clemson entourage going to the hearing will include former head 
football coach Danny Ford and his attorney, Thomas McCutchen Sr. of Columbia. 
Ford resigned as the head coach Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
New head football coach Ken Hatfield is also scheduled to attend, as are 
university President Max Lennon, athletic director Bobby Robinson, senior 
associate athletic director Dwight Rainey, faculty athletics representative B. 
J. Skelton and two university counsels, Ben Anderson and Paul Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
D. Alan Williams, chairman of the Committee on Infractions and the faculty 
athletics representative at the University of Virginia, has resigned from 
hearing the case to avoid a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia and Clemson are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. If the ACC 
decides to impose other penalties on Clemson after the NCAA's action, Williams 
would have a vote in that. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to step aside leaves five members to rule on the Clemson case, 
with Milton R. Schroeder, a professor of law at Arizona State University and 
the next senior member of the committee, serving as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to announce a decision on the Clemson case within 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Jan. 4, the NCAA charged the Clemson football program with 14 
rules violations ranging from cash payments to players of between $50 and $150 
to improper recruiting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, one charge has been dropped and two others have been amended. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Robinson nor Lomax would say whether any other charges were dropped or 
amended in the case summary, but Lomax said the summary "clarified" the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done our best to this point, not only in what we have provided in 
written form, but also our oral presentation," Lomax said. "We will have done 
all we can do by the time we leave Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson officials would not speculate on the outcome of Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"After seeing some of the other reports (of committee decisions), I couldn't 
speculate," Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Maryland basketball program received severe penalties despite 
university officials being confident that they had cooperated with 
investigators.

Gil Coleman was named the new basketball coach at Central Washington University 
today, even as former coach Dean Nicholson clouded the waters with reports that 
he may rescind his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, 33, signed a one-year contract and is the first non-Nicholson to lead 
the NAIA school's basketball program since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Nicholson was named coach that year and his son, Dean, succeeded him in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy affirmative action guidelines, Coleman, an assistant coach under 
Nicholson last season, will have to reapply for the position next December when 
the school begins a nationwide search for a permanent coach, Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
The school's announcement made no mention of reports that Nicholson plans to 
take back the resignation he offered April 2, after a university auditor found 
that he improperly distributed more than $65,000 of his basketball camp 
revenues to 49 players over the last three years.

CANDIDATES RALLY AROUND THE ENVIRONMENTAL BANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republicans have conceded the issue before, but concern for the environment has 
become so important in politics that it no longer belongs only to Democrats, 
says Orange County's conservative congressman Robert K. Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
"The root word of conservative is conservation," said Dornan (R-Garden Grove), 
explaining why he has recently joined the call for a ban on additional offshore 
oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect any hard-core environmentalists to believe that Bob Dornan has 
become one of them . . . but now we're getting to a place where (the 
environment issue) belongs to everybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As environmentalism blossoms this year in California politics, Orange County 
may be one of its most unusual gardens. It is the place where a beautiful and 
threatened coastline is represented in Washington and Sacramento by a 
conservative delegation that is traditionally pro-business and against 
government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Times Orange County Poll, that delegation is hearing an 
increasingly louder voice from their constituents about protecting the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three percent said in the poll that the environment is either "somewhat 
important" or "very important" when they decide whether to support a political 
candidate. And there was virtually no difference between Republicans and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
About 77% in the poll said their interest in the environment has increased in 
the past few years. Again, there was no statistical difference between the 
major parties. 
</P>
<P>
At the county level, respondents also gave their county leaders an average 
grade of C-minus for their performance in managing growth and protecting the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan's call to place restrictions on oil companies wanting to drill offshore 
was seen by many as evidence of the power in so-called "green politics." Dornan 
attributed his switch to the diminishing threat from the Soviet Union. In a 
more peaceful world, Dornan said the United States could afford to rely on 
foreign oil "and not endanger the coastline." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) says the country still needs to be 
more energy-independent. In a speech last November, Dannemeyer referred to 
environmentalists as "grass-eaters and daisy pickers" and he called for an 
increase in domestic oil production, including offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the congressman said that the public's focus on environmental issues 
has not changed his position. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there is an oil spill it is hyped up considerably by those who 
oppose offshore oil drilling," said Brett Barbre, the Dannemeyer spokesman. 
"But you ask people: 'How did you get here, did you come by car? How do you 
cook your food at home?' " 
</P>
<P>
All over Orange County, though, the environment has become a banner for 
politicians and candidates seeking office. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is sponsoring an initiative drive that 
would ask voters in November to prohibit fishing fleets from using gill nets 
because of the risk to dolphin, whales and sea lions. "It's very personal with 
me," she said. "(It's) because of the animals." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, Mayor Thomas J. Mays is running for the state Assembly as 
a candidate virtually created by the single issue of the environment. Mays was 
ubiquitous in the media during the days after February's tanker spill off 
Huntington Beach, sparking speculation about his political future. 
</P>
<P>
Barely a month later, when Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) said he 
would not seek reelection, Mays entered the race for the 58th Assembly 
District. The seat includes Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and coastal Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as my race goes, environmental issues will be a big part of the 
campaign," Mays, a Republican, said. "I think especially after the oil spill, 
we need to start concentrating on the environment a little bit more. It's 
pretty obvious how quickly we can lose something valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellis, campaign manager for another candidate in the Assembly race, 
Republican Peter von Elten, said the Huntington Beach oil spill is a big reason 
why voters in that area are more environmentally minded in this election. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil spill heightened consciousness, which is why Peter has agreed not to 
take any money from oil companies or companies involved in tanker shipping, and 
why he's come out for double-hulling and frequent mapping of the ocean floor," 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Building tankers with double hulls is believed to help guard against ruptures. 
Mapping the ocean floor became an issue after the Huntington Beach spill, in 
which the ship was pierced by its own anchor in relatively shallow water that 
Coast Guard officials said had not been measured and mapped in more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Another Republican candidate in the 58th District race said he realizes that if 
the race focuses on the environment, he faces a tough campaign. Long Beach City 
Councilman Jeff Kellogg's family has run a local onshore oil-drilling company 
for 50 years, and Kellogg himself has worked for the company as an oil hand and 
then director of drilling operations during the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were my opponents, obviously I would make it look like I was the captain 
of the Valdez," Kellogg said, referring to the Exxon tanker that caused the 
disastrous Alaskan oil spill last year. Kellogg quit the business to run for 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is . . . we specialized in the past 20 years in drilling in 
environmental situations. When we came in with our equipment . . . we 
soundproofed and landscaped everything. We made sure there was no impact on the 
drill site." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg said he could support increased offshore drilling under certain 
conditions, but not near any environmentally sensitive areas such as the 
Huntington Beach wetlands. "Even where you allow it, you never compromise your 
environment," he said. "You take every precaution in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Also vying for the Assembly seat are two other Republicans, Long Beach 
Councilwoman Jan Hall and Long Beach physician Sy Alban, Democrat Luanne Pryor 
and Libertarian Scott Stier. 
</P>
<P>
In another coastal Orange County Assembly race, one of the legislators targeted 
statewide by environmentalists is being challenged in a Republican primary by a 
woman who plans to use the issue as one of her major weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Badham, daughter of former Rep. Robert Badham (R-Newport Beach), is 
running against Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) for a seat that 
represents some of the county's most pristine shoreline, including Laguna 
Beach, Dana Point and part of San Clemente. 
</P>

In its election-year analysis, the California League of Conservation Voters 
named Ferguson as one of the state's "Filthy Five" legislators for having one 
of the worst records on environmental votes. 
</P>
<P>
"When the assemblyman from the 70th District is named an ecological Neanderthal 
. . . I'd have to question his concern for the environment," Badham said. "I am 
very environmentally minded . . . and will advocate it through my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was not available this week, but he has dismissed the league's rating 
as a partisan attack from a liberal-oriented group. 
</P>
<P>
In one inland Assembly district where two Democrats are battling in a primary, 
one candidate has laid claim to the environmental vote. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson was once appointed to a state environmental panel by former Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. and he works as an environmental planning consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the No.1 issue in the district, no question about it," said Larry Remer, 
Yudelson's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there is a Valdez or a recall of Perrier, it reminds people of how 
fragile our complex society really is," Remer said. "All that stuff is 
cumulative and has seeped into people's consciousness over the past 20 years, 
so there is a sense in the public that the environment is a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
Remer said Orange County has so far been distinguished by its unwillingness to 
protect the environment. Even with the increased focus, he said, "I still don't 
think we can get a bond measure passed in Orange County for mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the electorate is changing. "I would expect to see challenges to 
the Board of Supervisors in the next decade based clearly on environmental 
grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson is running against a former federal prosecutor who says crime and 
drugs are actually the biggest issues in the 72nd Assembly District, which 
includes parts of Anaheim and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The seat is held by freshman Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Steins, Prosecutor Tom Umberg's campaign manager, said he was uncertain of 
his candidate's environmental positions and they have not played a large role 
in campaign strategy. But he countered, "The most effective advocate for the 
environment is the one who can beat Curt Pringle." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle also said crime is the most important issue to residents of his 
district. He said the environment "has the potential" to become a major issue, 
partly because malathion spraying in the district has sparked active opposition 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
All three candidates -- Pringle, Umberg and Yudelson -- have protested the 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But Pringle has not jumped on the environmental bandwagon to call for more 
regulations to protect the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the views we hear from very liberal people are such liberal points of 
view that the ramifications would be devastating," he said. "They may look like 
they're being environmentally sensitive, but they are representing some very 
extreme views." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach political consultant Harvey Englander said he believes that the 
political strength of the environment varies significantly from district to 
district in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"People's political minds turn to environmental issues when there aren't other 
crises being perceived, particularly in the press," Englander suggested. "It's 
an issue that's going to change in every locality." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran is another Orange County politician who has built his 
career largely around his environmental activism. He has been recognized 
nationwide for his city's strict regulations on the use of chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the level of understanding about our various environmental crises is 
at an all-time high and the demand for effective political and governmental 
action is also stronger than ever," Agran said. "I think it's a logical 
recognition by voters that cleaning the air cannot be left to General Motors 
and cleaning our shore cannot be left to Exxon."

WATER USE UP 27% BY O.C. GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At a time when Orange County supervisors are asking residents and cities to cut 
water use by 10% in the face of a statewide drought, county government has seen 
its own consumption sharply increase over the past nine months, according to 
records obtained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Year-to-date totals compiled by the General Services Agency show that county 
water use for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was 45.8-million 
cubic feet, up from 35.9-million during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
That information -- contained in a monthly statistical review of utility 
expenses -- suggests that, at least for this fiscal year, county officials are 
unlikely to meet the same conservation goals they are asking others to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
The county's water use equates to more than 342 million gallons this year, 
contrasted with about 268 million last year, representing a 27% jump in what is 
the fourth year of a dire statewide water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the increase, officials said, is the result of new county facilities, 
among them an expanded communications center, new fire stations and other new 
operations. Weather through the first nine months of the fiscal year has also 
been hotter and drier than it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's discouraging," said Scotty Stewart, the county's chief of facility 
environmental systems. "We put on some additional square footage in the last 
year, and that stuff can nickel and dime you to death. It all adds up." 
</P>
<P>
The county employs about 15,000 workers who are spread out in more than 150 
buildings, from high-rise offices to fire stations, jails and public libraries. 
But while much of the increased water use is the result of added space, some 
areas of the government are simply using more water. The civic center grounds 
in Santa Ana have soaked up more than 70,000 gallons of extra water this year, 
and the John Wayne Airport terminal has used 653,000 additional gallons in the 
current fiscal year, at least in part because of construction work there, 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Hall of Administration, where the supervisors have their offices and 
where there's been no expansion in the current year, water usage is up 7,862 
cubic feet -- or 58,807 gallons. That's a 6% increase for the building. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, regarded as the board's most outspoken proponent 
of water conservation, last week urged her colleagues to update a 1988 water 
conservation resolution that asks all county residents to cut back their own 
water use by 10%. The board voted unanimously in favor of those voluntary 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wieder nor several other supervisors were available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the board urged "every householder, farmer, businessperson 
and governmental entity in the county to reduce their water use by 10%." 
Monday, however, officials acknowledged that growth may make it impossible for 
the county government to meet that target this year. 
</P>
<P>
R.A. Scott, director of the General Services Agency, called a 10% reduction in 
the county's consumption rate "a reasonable goal" but added that it may be hard 
to achieve an overall water savings because the county is quickly adding new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we can do is give it a good shot on the square footage basis, but 
overall it's going to be tough," Stewart said. "We're committed to saving 
everything we can. I don't know if that's going to come to 10%." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, who had 
urged the supervisors to adopt the voluntary restrictions, acknowledged Monday 
that weather and growth will make the 10% reduction a difficult goal in some 
areas. But they reiterated their call to conserve, despite the challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to make it more incumbent on people to try a little harder," 
said Tim Skrove, a spokesman for the district.

COUNCIL SEEKS CLOSURE OF OIL TERMINAL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH OFFICIALS PETITION THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO 
SHUT DOWN THE MOORING SITE WHERE FEBRUARY'S SPILL ORIGINATED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council announced Monday night that it will ask the State Lands 
Commission to shut down the offshore oil loading terminal where a giant oil 
tanker impaled itself on its own anchor Feb. 7, dumping 394,000 gallons of 
Alaskan crude on the city's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door session, Mayor Thomas J. Mays said each of the seven 
council members will write a letter to the commission urging that it eliminate 
the terminal where tankers unload oil for Golden West Refineries, which owns 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Mays also announced that the city will try to get out of its 49-year lease with 
Golden West and force the company to relocate its offshore operation. The city 
leases the land for the pipeline that leads from the terminal to the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach facility is the only marine terminal in Orange County. The 
State Lands Commission has final jurisdiction over offshore pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also said Monday that they will file a formal claim with 
British Petroleum, which owned the spilled oil, and American Trading 
Transportation Co., the New York firm that owns the tanker, for $528,000 in 
unreimbursed cleanup costs. Members further said they are studying the 
possibility of joining the state in a special damages suit against the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said the state suit would help the city recoup "long-term costs, such as 
harm done to the environment and the city's tourism market." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be pursuing all of these things over the next couple of days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No estimates have yet been tabulated for any of those costs, which could 
include potential income the city lost from parking lots and meters while the 
beaches were closed, harm inflicted on the environment and wildlife, and 
marring of the city's public image. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives for American Trading have said before that they would reimburse 
cities for expenses directly related to the emergency response and cleanup. 
However, company officials have yet to state publicly whether they also are 
willing to pay cities for such additional costs as environmental damage and 
lost parking revenues. 
</P>
<P>
City Finance Director Dan Villella said the $528,000 represents the city's 
costs for police helicopter operations, cleanup equipment and supplies, a film 
about the disaster, food for employees and volunteers, and overtime and 
benefits to lifeguards, fire officials and other workers. 
</P>
<P>
In exploring legal avenues, city attorneys have considered as a possible model 
a 1988 court ruling in which Shell Oil Co. was ordered to pay $19.7 million in 
damages related to a Bay Area oil spill that year, Deputy City Atty. Robert C. 
Sangster said. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, stemming from a suit filed by eight government agencies, 
included a $1.7-million "special damages" settlement to be divided among Solano 
and Contra Costa counties and the cities of Benecia and Martinez.

TARDY TAXPAYERS TOY WITH THE LAST MINUTE

Doug and Karen Kaito spent the better part of four months procrastinating, even 
though they stood to collect a few hundred dollars from Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to miss the excitement," Doug Kaito said when asked why he 
decided to wait until the last minute to file his income tax return Monday 
night. "We live for the crunch." 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other reluctant taxpayers, the Kaitos spent part of the 
evening sitting in their car, waiting to turn over their completed tax forms to 
postal workers who shivered in the night air behind the general mail facility 
on Sunflower Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch of getting tax forms in the mail before the midnight deadline has 
become a yearly ritual that taxpayers, tax preparers and postal workers have 
come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Orange County on Monday, countless people hurriedly searched for tax 
forms, sought out accountants and stood in line with fellow procrastinators to 
beat the deadline and the interest that invariably accompanies a late filing. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers were given a one-day extension this year because the normal due date 
of April 15 fell on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In order to help ease the crunch Monday night, postal employees in eight post 
offices in Orange County worked overtime, postal officials said. Many were 
expected to remain on duty until at least 2 a.m. as they sorted, canceled and 
bagged the tons of tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sunflower Avenue facility, postal officials estimated that 400 postal 
employees would have to cancel as many as 3 million pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be here until the wee hours of the morning," said postal supervisor 
Joseph Galvez, who watched the seemingly unending line of cars that stretched 
around the outside of the post office. 
</P>
<P>
Galvez said that early this morning, some taxpayers who missed the midnight 
deadline will park outside the loading dock and ask to have their tax forms 
collected and mailed. Not to worry, he said, "we never turn a customer away." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Sunflower Avenue facility Monday evening, the atmosphere was 
festive, as workers directed cars through the maze of orange traffic cones that 
stretched along the street and behind the postal center. 
</P>
<P>
As customers handed stacks of tax forms and other mail to postal employees, pop 
music emanated from the van of a popular Los Angeles-based radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really fun," said mail processor Rollina Patnaude, who was 
experiencing her first year on the front lines. "I'm all riled up. It's like a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
Mail processor Mary Stewart, on duty for the second year in a row, said she 
dreaded Christmastime more than tax time. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets really crazy then," she said, as she danced to a Top 40 tune. 
</P>
<P>
At the 13 H&amp;R Block income tax offices in the county, tax preparers 
answered nonstop questions about tax returns, handed out thousands of extension 
applications and prepared hundreds of tax returns while clients waited. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bombed all over the district," said H&amp;R Block district manager Lee 
LaMar. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, many tax preparers and postal employees said most 
people do not wait until the last few hours because they owe money. A majority 
of procrastinators are due a refund but wait until the deadline simply because 
of a traditional aversion to taxation. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't like the idea of paying taxes," LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one watering hole in Orange County attempted to ease the misery for 
some taxpayers who may think they were gouged by the government. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cabo Coast, a new bar and grill in Irvine, the management invented a 
series of drink specials to help taxpayers drown their financial troubles. 
Wearing black uniforms -- "we're in mourning," said bartender Mike Byrne -- 
employees served concoctions such as the Loophole, the Audit and the Fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a stiff margarita, customer Devon Kile lamented how her 
fiance had just filed a tax return that showed he owed $26,000 in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really depressing subject," she said. "We're just relaxing now and 
trying to forget about the day."

A pregnant San Bernardino woman was hospitalized early Monday after she got 
into a scuffle with Disneyland security officers during which, her relatives 
claim, she was "body-slammed" to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland officials deny that the woman, Kimberly Richardson, 23, who was 
about two days overdue to give birth, was manhandled and say they intend to 
press shoplifting charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said the park has filed a complaint alleging that Richardson 
shoplifted a telephone address book valued at $2.50 as she was about to leave 
the compound around 12:05 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth acknowledged that security officers "stopped" 
Richardson on a "shoplifting inquiry." However, he said, "We deny all 
allegations that a woman was assaulted by Disneyland security personnel." Roth 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's cousin, Latonya Walker of Redlands, said she, Richardson and two 
other cousins were about to leave Disneyland just after midnight when the 
incident occurred. Walker said five plainclothes security officers pushed 
Richardson through the turnstile and slammed her to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw her to the ground . . . a second time and then they pinned her 
down," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson began to scream "Help! Help! What's going on?" Walker said. "Then, 
one of the plainclothes men said, 'That's not the one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walker and another cousin, Roxanne Moore, denied that Richardson or any member 
of their party had stolen anything. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that after a crowd had gathered to watch the commotion, uniformed 
security officers arrived and advised their plainclothes colleagues to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said, "I yelled out, 'Do you all see what they are doing to us?' But they 
were telling the people who gathered around to leave. They were saying that 
they had everything under control." 
</P>
<P>
As the cousins were being interrogated by the uniformed security officers, 
Richardson managed to slip away, Moore said. Walker said Richardson later told 
her that she fled because she thought the plainclothes officers were the same 
men who had hurled racial slurs at them earlier in the day. Richardson and her 
cousins are black. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Jack Parra said a patrol officer who responded to a call 
from Disneyland officials later found Richardson walking in the vicinity of the 
Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Parra said the officer directed Richardson and her relatives to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where Richardson was examined in the obstetrics emergency 
room. UCI spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Richardson suffered a bruised knee, 
adding that both Richardson and her unborn baby "are in stable condition." She 
was transferred to the St. Bernadine County Hospital in San Bernardino on 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Parra said Disneyland officials have filed a complaint alleging that Richardson 
shoplifted a Chip N' Dale telephone address book from a souvenir stand. 
</P>
<P>
Parra said Disneyland officials told police that Richardson "slipped and fell" 
when she attempted to flee from the custody of the park's security officers. He 
said the case is under investigation, the results of which will be turned over 
to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who traveled from Fremont to visit her pregnant cousin, said they had 
decided to visit Disneyland to try to induce labor in Richardson. "Her doctor 
told her that she should do some walking since she was about two days overdue," 
Moore said. "So she walked there for about seven hours and rode It's a Small 
World a little and we were about to leave when this happened.

Five Orange County schools are among winners of the 1989-90 California 
Distinguished Middle and High School Awards, which recognize schools that have 
dramatically increased average scores on California Assessment Program tests. 
</P>
<P>
The winners were announced by Bill Honig, state superintendent of public 
instruction, at a meeting of the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
They are Buena Park Junior High, Santiago Middle School in Orange, MacArthur 
Fundamental Intermediate School in Santa Ana, Hewes Middle School in Santa Ana, 
and LaPaz Intermediate School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were broken down into four categories: outstanding performance on 
CAP tests; "significant improvement" in CAP scores; excellence in both 
performance and improvement, and continued high performance. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Junior High, Santiago Middle School and MacArthur Fundamental were 
cited for outstanding performance. Hewes was honored for significant 
improvement in the school's average CAP scores, and LaPaz received its award 
for excelling in both performance and improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The schools will be honored at the fifth annual California Distinguished School 
Awards Ceremony on May 24 at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are also eligible to participate in the 1991 National School 
Recognition program run by the U.S. Department of Education. Winners of that 
competition will be announced by the White House in June. TONY MARCANO

NEW QUARTERS FOR HOMELESS TO OPEN

<P>
Two more homeless families in Orange County will have a place to stay today 
with the opening of a building at the New Vista Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The building will open this morning after a ceremony expected to be attended by 
volunteers who made the addition possible, as well as Orange County Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez and Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the shelter came via an all-volunteer effort by the Building 
Industry Assn. of Southern California and area contractors and suppliers. The 
added living area, built over a new garage, will allow the shelter to house 
eight families at a time instead of the current six. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers donated all the building materials and labor and furnished the two 
new bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchen, said Barbara Johnson, executive director 
of Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, which operates the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"They've really gone first class," Johnson said. "They've gone all-out to make 
it really nice." 
</P>
<P>
The donated value of the labor and materials for New Vista Shelter is about 
$105,000. The largest contributor was Superior Framing Systems Inc. of Yorba 
Linda, which donated $15,000 worth of labor. 
</P>
<P>
New Vista provides shelter to temporarily homeless families, allowing them to 
save money for an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding the shelter is the third of five projects by the Building Industry 
Assn. in Orange County to increase the number of beds for the temporarily 
homeless.TOM McQUEENEY

CENTER FOR SENIORS MAY CLOSE DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Crippled by mounting debts and a dwindling cash flow, a day-care center for the 
elderly in Anaheim soon may be forced to close just 18 months after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Anaheim VIP Health Care Center is one of the few centers in the 
North County that offer both medical assistance and social activities for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of 24 clients of the center, situated in the northwestern corner of the 
city, live with working relatives and need some place to spend their days. A 
few live in board-and-care homes and visit the center a few days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they would go if we close," said Shirley Cohen, executive 
director of the Anaheim-based Feedback Foundation, the nonprofit organization 
which operates the center. "It's more than just a place to park (seniors) for 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Ward, 94, has been coming to the center every weekday since it opened. 
She said she loves the activities and the food, and she plays the piano for the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a place where you meet people and you have friends," Ward said. "There's 
a happy way about everybody here." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's daughter, Carolyn Weigand, a visual arts instructor at Golden West 
College, said she doesn't know where she would take her mother if the center 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a real nit-picker, and I wouldn't take her anywhere that wasn't perfect," 
Weigand said. "This place is perfect -- it's happy, clean and it smells 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Along with transportation to and from seniors' homes, meals and typical social 
activities that most centers offer, the VIP Center also maintains a medical 
care facility which offers physical and occupational therapy. A social worker 
also is available to help clients research the various programs and benefits 
available. 
</P>
<P>
But late Medi-Cal reimbursements, clients with lower incomes and a lack of 
donations have left officials of the 18-month-old center with little hope that 
they can stay open beyond the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have focused where the needs are, but that's not where the bucks are," said 
Shirleen Jones, the center's program director. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clients are Medi-Cal recipients, and that system is typically 
sluggish with reimbursements, Jones said. In addition, the center offers a 
sliding fee schedule, and most of those paying directly for the center are of 
low income and pay less than the operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said it costs about $50 a day per client to operate the center, but many 
clients without Medi-Cal pay as little as $10 a day. 
</P>
<P>
She said the center was established in Anaheim because of the lack of senior 
day care centers with medical facilities in the North County. It now serves a 
variety of seniors, from those who have suffered strokes or Alzheimer's disease 
to those who simply want some daytime company and activity. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation also operates a center in Santa Ana, which is facing less 
serious financial difficulties, and runs the Meals on Wheels program, 
distributing about 3,000 meals daily. 
</P>
<P>
One other senior day-care center exists in Anaheim, but it does not offer 
comparable medical care. The city has plans to establish an additional senior 
care facility.LISA MASCARO

HIGHWAY CLOSED FOR EXCAVATION ON BLUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several delays, a mile-long section of El Camino Real was closed Monday 
as work crews began heavy excavation work on the unstable bluffs edging the 
coastal highway. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the north-south artery into the city will be closed for up 
to a month as 310,000 cubic feet of earth are removed from the crumbling 
cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
The highway was closed during February when city workers noticed that the 
bluffs were riddled with large crevices. 
</P>
<P>
The closure created traffic jams as motorists looked for alternate routes and 
merchants located near the barricaded highway complained that their businesses 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Michael W. Parness said crews on the project will work six days a 
week, 12 hours a day until it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost the owner of the area above the highway, the 
Lusk Co., a development firm, about $2 million.

CITY FORBIDS RELEASE OF EMPLOYEE NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members who release the addresses of city employees for private 
and political use can now be slapped with a misdemeanor charge under an 
ordinance the council approved Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richards L. Norton, who introduced the ordinance, said the new law 
protects the privacy of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the ordinance 6 to 1, despite vigorous opposition from 
Norton's nemesis, Councilman Daniel E. Griset, who had called the ordinance "a 
cute political ploy." 
</P>
<P>
Griset protested that the restriction was too narrow and would make common 
criminals out of council members. If found guilty of violating the ordinance, 
council members could face a $600 fine. 
</P>
<P>
City employees are already protected by the state law, which prohibits the 
release of confidential information about employees, Griset said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal stems from a dispute between Norton and Griset, who were competing 
for a council seat in the 1988 election, over whether the city could legally 
release the addresses of its employees. Griset had sent letters to about 300 
police officers, decrying the police union's endorsement of Norton. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance prohibits the release of addresses and telephone numbers from 
personnel records by city council members for private, business, or political 
use. LILY ENG

PEOPLE: COUPLE FIND THEIR PLACE IN EARLIER TIME 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nights and weekends, John and Carrie Oliver live in another time and proudly 
covet their strange kind of alter ego life. 
</P>
<P>
They and an estimated 60,000 others are members of the worldwide Society of 
Creative Anachronism who seek happiness by living a make-believe life based on 
the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they greet other members with such terms as Milord and Milady, and 
if that isn't acceptable, they might invite each other to an honorable mock 
fight to the death with wooden swords. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of attract a different type of person, people who don't fit into the 
mundane modern world," said Oliver, an Anaheim cable television employee who 
goes by the name Lord Colin Mordrake, the swamp dragon, after he leaves work. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie is a computer company administrator and is called Lady Nikki Zotsdrake 
in her other life. She met John on an isolated field of combat in Colorado 
where she was clad in a highly polished suit of armor. 
</P>
<P>
"I killed 10 combatants there," boasted Carrie, who was decked out in a 
medieval costume and loads of gold chains as she strolled one recent Saturday 
around Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the park had been transformed into the mythical Kingdom of Caid. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband added: "When they are dressed in armor you can't tell whether it's 
a man or woman fighting. My wife is an itty-bitty thing, but she held her own 
during the course of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Elegantly clad women and men who were trying to live a different life for a day 
were quartered in colorfully decorated tents for the happening there. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators milled about wondering what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I joined because we were looking for a simpler life than the one 
we have to live in today's society," said John, who gave up judo and karate to 
fight with a wooden sword. "I end up with a lot less bruises fighting with a 
wooden sword." 
</P>
<P>
He finds the mock fighting "fascinating. We all try to entertain each other 
because we like to do it. We all keep in mind it is just a game or else it 
could get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining, John said, he belonged to a number of community and service 
organizations that didn't meet his personal needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have jobs, but we're looking for something else," he continued. "The 
Middle Ages and the philosophy of that time is what we like to foster. In the 
world today everyone seems to have that us-versus-them philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
When the group meets, the Olivers say, "We're armed with an attitude and 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the mock fighting, they added, "everyone in the society is friendly and 
polite, even to the newest members. We are a very polite society when we battle 
or meet each other." 
</P>
<P>
He said when a gentleman meets a lady at their gatherings, he is prone to kiss 
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
The society holds most of its gatherings in isolated areas, but meets at times 
in more populated areas to attract new members. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people that see and know of us, the more members we can get," said 
John, whose main hope is to become knighted by the group. 
</P>
<P>
It is the most prestigious honor besides becoming king. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd also like to become king," he confided. 
</P>
<P>
If it isn't enough to have police officers knock heads with firefighters to 
draw spectators at the third annual Orange County 911 Football Bowl on April 27 
at 7 p.m. at Orange Coast College, the sponsors are offering other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
One will come in the form of a silent auction the same evening. 
</P>
<P>
The items up for auction will include an autographed Wayne Gretsky hockey 
stick, a Rams helmet signed by quarterback Jim Everett, a team-signed Lakers 
basketball, a team-signed Angels baseball and a Chuck Norris autographed karate 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds go to Drug Use Is Life Abuse Foundation and the Olive Crest 
Treatment Center for abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't draw a crowd, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be in 
attendance to help give out official Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to children 
in attendence.

SOUTHLAND NOT INTERESTED IN GOP CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ORANGE COUNTY, SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES ARE ALREADY BOOKED FOR 
AUGUST, 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of Republican leaders are California dreaming these days but are more 
likely to wake up somewhere else in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The dream involves putting the party's 1992 national convention in the 
electoral heart of the nation's largest state. Republican National Committee 
Chairman Lee Atwater, particularly, has been pushing the idea of holding 
President Bush's expected August, 1992, renomination somewhere in Southern 
California, said sources familiar with Atwater's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, however, the Southland is not interested. 
</P>
<P>
The latest blow came from Orange County, in a letter Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter 
wrote last month to Atwater to tell him the city would not be able to bid on 
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
The letter came after both Los Angeles and San Diego officials had made clear 
to Democratic and Republican leaders that their cities would not be interested. 
</P>
<P>
The question of finding a site for a convention that will not be held for 
nearly 2 1/2 years may seem premature. But, in fact, such massive undertakings 
take so long to plan that the decisions are fast approaching. The Republicans 
have set June 1 as the deadline for cities to bid on being host to the 
convention, and Democrats may already have announced their choice by then. For 
now, no California cities are in the running for either party's convention. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who has been fascinated by California politics, reportedly had been 
particularly keen on having the convention in Orange County, the GOP's largest 
vote base in the state. The move for the first time would have put a national 
convention in a suburban area, allowing the GOP to symbolically focus on the 
slice of American demography that represents the party's greatest strength. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials have spent considerable time discussing the "political" pluses 
and minuses of various sites, said Charles Black, a prominent Washington-based 
GOP consultant and close friend of Atwater. And, he added, the benefits of 
holding a convention in Southern California are "obvious." 
</P>
<P>
But "question number one is who can logistically put the convention on, and 
question number two is who is going to bid," said Black. Until those questions 
are answered, "neither Lee nor the President are leaning one way or another. . 
. . Anything you hear is pure unadulterated rumor." Earlier this year, GOP 
officials inquired about Anaheim's convention center, said City Councilman Irv 
Pickler. "The inquiry came in," but "we have sort of begged off." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Bill Snyder, president of the Anaheim Area Visitor and 
Convention Bureau, is that the city already had too much hotel and convention 
business booked for the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Associations and large convention groups have made decisions five, six, and in 
some cases nine years ahead," Snyder said. "There's no way you can try to 
'unbook' that number of groups and come off without deep, deep scars in the 
association business." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego officials had offered the GOP a similar explanation for why their 
city was not interested, GOP sources said. Los Angeles, by contrast, might be 
interested at some point, but not in 1992. The city's convention center will be 
undergoing expansion that summer, and the work will not be finished until early 
1993, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of eight cities met with GOP officials last month to discuss 
possible convention bids. Three of the cities -- New York, Cleveland and 
Houston -- also are bidding on the Democratic convention. The other five that 
have expressed interest so far are Atlanta, which was the site of the 
Democratic convention in 1988, Detroit, Kansas City, Miami and St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The party's site selection committee will spend the summer visiting the cities 
that bid, and the final decision will be made in January. In the absence of a 
California bidder, Houston, as one of Bush's adopted hometowns, and the two 
cities in Florida, the home of Bush's son Jeb, are favorites in early 
handicapping. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democrats, who were burned four years ago when the GOP beat them 
in the race to sign a convention contract with New Orleans, have adopted a 
speeded-up schedule this year. Ironically, although California cities are 
turning up their noses at a convention, a number of cities are lobbying hard 
for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic site selection committee already has been wined and dined in New 
York, Cleveland and Houston, and plans to complete its tour with a trip to New 
Orleans next week. The committee will meet in mid-May to make a recommendation 
to party Chairman Ron Brown, who is expected to announce his decision in late 
May or early June.

MALATHION SPRAYING URGED FOR WOODCREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN and ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state panel of scientists recommended Monday that 19 square miles of 
Woodcrest in Riverside County be sprayed with malathion at least eight times to 
eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies infesting commercial orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also proposed that aerial pesticide spraying begin over parts of 
Hancock Park in Los Angeles and the city of Walnut, citing new fly discoveries 
during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the state Department of Food and Agriculture is expected this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
If accepted, the territory of Southern California under treatment with aerial 
applications of malathion would be expanded to 430 square miles, in an 
infestation that is approaching its ninth month. While the state previously 
announced that it would wind down spraying by May 9, the deadline will not 
apply to the Riverside County spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendations were decided during an emergency conference call 
prompted by the discovery of four Medflies last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scattered showers Monday forced cancellation of malathion spraying 
that had been scheduled for a 26-square-mile area of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, including some parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had not decided by Monday afternoon when to reschedule the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Orange County's only other spray zone -- a 36-square-mile area 
that includes parts of nine cities near Garden Grove and Westminster -- are 
scheduled to get their fifth dose of malathion on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After this week's scheduled applications, each Orange County region is to be 
sprayed once more, the Brea area on April 30, and Garden Grove on May 3.

PSYCHIATRIST TEMPORARILY BARRED FROM PRACTICING

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge has temporarily suspended the medical practice of Dr. 
James Harrington White, the consulting psychiatrist for a Sierra Nevada youth 
camp that sponsored the outing on which seven people drowned in Convict Lake 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Eileen Moore issued the temporary restraining order Friday 
at the request of the state attorney general's office. The judge made her 
decision after viewing sexually explicit videotapes of the Newport Beach 
psychiatrist and an adult patient. 
</P>
<P>
The order is in effect until May 1, when the judge will consider extending the 
suspension of White's license pending the outcome of a California Medical Board 
hearing on whether to suspend or revoke his license. 
</P>
<P>
White, 47, who has a private practice in Newport Beach, was arrested March 15 
at his Newport Beach office on charges of sexually abusing a 29-year-old male 
patient. The patient alleged to Newport Beach police that White drugged him 
with prescription medicine and then performed oral sex on him. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged sexual acts were depicted in a 20-minute videotape that police had 
seized from the doctor, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
White, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges of sexual abuse, on Monday 
deferred comment to his attorney, Timothy J. Stafford of Santa Ana. Stafford 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police seized the photographic evidence in simultaneous raids the 
day of White's arrest at his Newport Beach clinic, his Corona del Mar home, and 
his other residences in Palm Desert and Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Moore said Monday that she viewed two videotapes after ordering her 
courtroom doors locked at the request of White's attorney. In her order, she 
said the videotapes supported the state's contention that White's continued 
practice of medicine "endangered" the public welfare. 
</P>
<P>
White is free on $200,000 bond pending disposition of the criminal case. On 
March 20, Harbor Municipal Judge Christopher W. Strople reduced White's bond 
from $500,000 but barred him from practicing medicine while the case was being 
decided. About a week later, however, Strople lifted the order with the 
stipulation that White practice under supervision of another psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
After the criminal charges were filed, the California Medical Board opened an 
investigation into whether White had violated terms of his medical license by 
engaging in sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office -- representing the California Medical 
Board -- last week took action in Orange County Superior Court to prevent White 
from practicing medicine until the board completes its review. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, White was consulting psychiatrist and a member of 
the faculty's board of directors at Camp O'Neal, a private facility for 
delinquent and troubled youngsters. During a Feb. 19 outing at Convict Lake, 
three teen-agers and two camp counselors fell through the ice and drowned in 
Convict Lake. Two other men who tried to rescue them also fell through the ice 
and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
State social services officials suspended the camp's license on March 16, 
accusing the operators of repeatedly violating care and treatment regulations 
and failing to properly supervise the three youths who drowned.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: BRUNDAGE GETS TOUGHER; SO DOES THE COMPETITION

<P>
Jennifer Brundage, pitcher at Irvine High School, is used to a little success. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore last season, she was selected The Times' softball player of the 
year. This season, she has a 16-2 record and an 0.27 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Brundage, The Times' Athlete of the Week, was selected the most valuable player 
of last week's Woodbridge tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the award) meant the most this year because of the quality teams that we 
played," Brundage said. "The tournament has a reputation of being one of the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament, Brundage won five games from Saturday to Wednesday. The last 
two games went into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's championship semifinal, Brundage allowed five hits, but struck out 
12 and walked none in a 10-inning 2-0 victory over Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Brundage struck out six, walked three and allowed five hits as 
sixth-ranked Irvine defeated second-ranked Kennedy, 3-2, in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting tired from pitching so much," Brundage said. "When you get tired 
it affects the speed and how the pitch breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Brundage said it seems as if she's giving up more hits this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (batters) are getting better -- I know our team is hitting 
better," she said. "I certainly don't think they (the batters) are getting 
worse. I don't know if it's because of my year last year or because of 
coaching, but I think teams are more aggressive to hit me this year." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Lisa Limp said she is not sure if teams are doing better against 
Brundage this season. 
</P>
<P>
But, Limp said, Brundage is pitching better. "She has seven pitches and a real 
good fastball and she's a real smart pitcher," Limp said. "But when you face 
the same team (as in league) and they always have the same pitcher, as we do, 
then that's a definite advantage for the other team." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Brundage has pitched three no-hitters this season. Her error in one 
game and a walk in another kept her from having two perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
"She keeps them (batters) off balance and, like I said, she has a real nice 
fastball," Limp said. "I would guess she throws it about 65 (miles per hour)." 
</P>
<P>

Marla Pickard went three for three, including a home run, and had two RBIs to

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CASTRO STEPS OFF MOUND AND IS A HIT FOR ANAHEIM

<P>
A sore back kept Danny Castro off the mound last week, but after his 
performance at the plate for the Anaheim High School baseball team, he couldn't 
be blamed for wanting to stay off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, The Times' Athlete of the Week, had 10 singles in 14 at-bats, raising 
his batting average from .255 to .418, and drove in eight runs to help Anaheim 
win the championship of the Anaheim Lions baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the championship game against Fullerton Wednesday, Castro, a left-handed 
batter, had a bloop single that drove in two runs in the fourth inning to give 
the Colonists a 6-0 lead en route to a 9-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily for me they were falling in," Castro said. "I had a couple of bloopers 
that dropped. I guess it was my week." 
</P>
<P>
Spring break and the respite from Anaheim's Orange League schedule gave Castro 
the chance to rest his back and concentrate on hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that helped," he said, then jokingly added: "Maybe I shouldn't pitch 
anymore then." 
</P>
<P>
But Anaheim Coach Dave Torres disagrees. "I think he's a little more relaxed at 
the plate when he's not pitching," said Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a right-hander, is 4-0 with a 1.75 earned-run average and is one of 
three starters Anaheim depends on to defend its league championship. The 
Colonists (7-6-1, 4-2-1 in league) are in second place, a half-game behind 
Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
Castro isn't a hard thrower and if he continues playing baseball after high 
school, it probably will be as a first baseman, his position when he isn't 
pitching, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Andy Beisel pitched a one-hitter, striking out nine, and Sonora defeated 
Riordan, 2-1, in the first round of the Anaheim Lions tournament Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Colby French hit a three-run double in the fifth inning to break a 4-4 tie and 
Estancia beat El Modena, 7-4, in the championship game of the Pride of the 
Coast tournament Wednesday. French was four for 11 with eight RBIs in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hale pitched a five-hitter and Fountain Valley defeated Fresno Bullard, 
4-0, Monday. Hale pitched two shutout innings on Tuesday to pick up a save in a 
2-1 victory over Chatsworth in the Far West tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Schade pitched a no-hitter and El Modena beat Leuzinger, 2-0, in a 
semifinal game of the Pride of the Coast tournament Tuesday. Schade, a senior 
right-hander, hit the first two batters he faced.

TITANS ATTEMPTING TO SAVE TWO TEAMS; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON: FENCING AND MEN'S GYMNASTICS COULD STAY ALIVE IN FACE OF BUDGET CUTS 
THROUGH EFFORTS BY CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY.

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton fencing and men's gymnastics teams, clinging to life in 
the face of a proposed budget cut that would eliminate the programs, have a 
little more hope to hold on to. 
</P>
<P>
The school announced Monday that a coordinated effort by the campus and the 
community has been launched to save the programs, which the Athletics Council 
recently recommended be dropped to balance the 1990-91 athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
The campus campaign consists of efforts to pass a referendum that would 
increase the Instructionally Related Activity Fee paid each semester by all 
students. Students will vote on April 26-27 whether to raise the fee from $10 
to $15 a semester. 
</P>
<P>
If the referendum passes, an additional $240,000 would be generated annually 
for the IRA fund, which supplements co-curricular activities such as athletics, 
forensics and the student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said the department would request a 
portion of those funds for gymnastics and fencing. Fullerton President Jewel 
Plummer Cobb makes the final decision on how IRA funds are allotted. 
</P>
<P>
The community effort to save the programs includes solicitation of several 
corporate donors and a Sports Save-a-Thon, a fund-raiser scheduled for May 
17-19 at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. According to Carroll, an additional $158,000 
is needed annually to fund men's gymnastics and men's and women's fencing. 
</P>
<P>
"We very much want to save these outstanding programs," Cobb said in a 
statement issued by the school. "In the coming weeks, I will devote my serious 
and undivided attention to the athletics budget situation and strategies for 
keeping the programs in place." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb has set a May 21 deadline to raise the funds and will make a decision then 
regarding the future of the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wolfe, men's gymnastics coach, was encouraged by the school's efforts, but 
the May 21 deadline has caused a new set of problems. Wolfe had expected a 
final decision from Cobb this week and already had begun making contingency 
plans for his gymnasts should the program be cut. Nine of his 10 team members 
are underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the delay has forced him to put off those efforts, and Wolfe fears May 21 
might be too late for his gymnasts to secure scholarships at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's already late now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, in his 22nd year as gymnastics coach, wasn't overly excited by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it works, but at the same time, there's nothing concrete for me or my 
athletes," he said. "I'm not happy or unhappy. I've been on a roller-coaster 
ride, and I try not to get too caught up with things." 
</P>
<P>
The men's gymnastics team finished sixth in the recent NCAA Western Regional 
and will be sending two athletes, Bill Barham and Eli Rodriguez, to this 
weekend's NCAA championships at Minneapolis. The Titans won College Division 
national championships in 1971, 1972 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The women's fencing team won a national title in 1973. Both the men's and 
women's teams are coached by Heizaburo Okawa, who was a member of Japan's 
Olympic team in 1960, 1964 and 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I feel much better about the situation, because earlier it seemed 
like we had no chance," Okawa said. "This is a good indication that they're 
willing to save the program." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, the Athletics Council chairman, said he is cautiously optimistic the 
department will reach its goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to finding a way to make it happen," Carroll said. "We have a 
lot of irons in the fire and hope a combination of these (fund-raising efforts) 
will make it possible."

CHAPMAN'S PASTURES JUST AS GREEN TO ROLISH; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: FORMER CAL STATE FULLERTON PLAYER FINDS HAPPINESS AND 
COMPETITION AT THE DIVISION II SCHOOL.

<P>
Jason Rolish has been to college baseball's promised land. As a sophomore at 
Cal State Fullerton, he started 35 games for the Titans, who advanced to the 
College World Series in Omaha, Neb., finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of other players don't get to do that, so I felt pretty lucky to be a 
part of it," Rolish said. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed for Rolish. And it's unlikely that he will return to 
Nebraska wearing a college baseball uniform. Because of a decision he made 
after his sophomore season, Rolish left Fullerton and now plays for Chapman 
College, a Division II team in a three-way race for the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, in terms of prestige, Chapman, with only one Division II title (1968), 
is a step below Cal State Fullerton, which has won two Division I national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
And even though Rolish, who once hit a home run in the Louisiana Superdome, now 
plays in more humble ballparks, he is just as happy. This season, he is hitting 
over .300 and starting in center field for Chapman, the No. 16 team in last 
week's Division II poll. 
</P>
<P>
Rolish has no regrets about the move. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California baseball, there is really no difference between 
colleges from (Chapman) on up, because anyone can be beaten," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Chapman tests that premise in a game against the Titans tonight at 
Fullerton, Rolish said he'll probably be more excited than usual. Chapman has 
defeated five of its eight Division I opponents this season, including the 
Titans once. 
</P>
<P>
These nonconference games are important to the Panthers' baseball program, 
which plans to move into Division I in 1992. But for Rolish, the games have an 
added significance because of the circumstances surrounding his departure from 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Rolish said he and Titan Coach Larry Cochell didn't get along. Cochell, who 
replaced Augie Garrido after Rolish's freshman season at Fullerton, said Rolish 
wouldn't accept coaching decisions that meant he wouldn't be playing as much as 
he would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his differences with Cochell, Rolish said he was prepared to return to 
the Titans his junior season before a meeting with Cochell in late June. 
</P>
<P>
After reminiscing about the season with Cochell at the meeting, Rolish asked 
the coach what he had planned for him the next season. 
</P>
<P>
" 'We've given your scholarship away. We heard you were leaving,' " Rolish 
remembered Cochell saying. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, who declined to talk about the situation in detail, denied that he 
told Rolish the scholarship was given away. Cochell said he told Rolish that he 
would have to beat out Bobby Jones, who started the last 17 games of the season 
and now plays in the Angels' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said he told Rolish: "If you come back next year, you're coming back 
behind Bobby Jones. If you feel like you can get more playing time somewhere 
else, I'll release you." 
</P>
<P>
There is no argument about what happened next. Rolish went looking for another 
place to play baseball, and after considering Cal State Northridge, he accepted 
a full scholarship at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Rolish said he has no hard feelings against Cochell and doesn't 
believe the switch to Division II has harmed his chances of playing 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't noticed a big difference," he said. "Anyone can play just as well as 
the next guy, especially around here." 
</P>
<P>
Rolish signed a letter of intent to play for then-Titan coach Garrido late in 
the summer of 1986 after graduating from Servite High School. He had planned to 
play at Cypress College, but the Titans needed another catcher and despite his 
5-foot-10, 175-pound build, Rolish was one of the best prep catchers in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
His senior season at Servite, Rolish batted .500 and helped the Friars to the 
Southern Section playoffs. But it was his throwing that most impressed Servite 
Coach Mike McNary. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the strongest arm of any catcher I have ever seen," McNary said. "He 
threw out 10 guys at second on pickoffs from his knees. He was just amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Rolish was a reserve catcher for the Titans his freshman season, but he was a 
faster runner than Garrido had expected, and was moved to the outfield for the 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he'd lose his running speed as a catcher, and he's not big enough to 
look forward to a pro career as a catcher," said Garrido, now baseball coach at 
Illinois. "I felt that if we took his speed away, we would be doing him a 
disservice." 
</P>
<P>
If Rolish plays professional baseball, it likely will require another switch -- 
to the infield, said Chapman Coach Mike Weathers, who played second base in the 
Oakland Athletics' organization after graduating from Chapman in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Rolish's physical attributes won't carry him into the pros, but Weathers said 
his determination to succeed will take him a long way. 
</P>
<P>
It's his love for the game that will get him into the pros, Rolish said. 
Neither of his parents are especially athletic and neither were involved in 
interscholastic sports in high school, but baseball always has been a part of 
the Rolish household. 
</P>
<P>
Rolish's mother, Lois, helped teach the children to throw, and his father, 
Rusty, coached various Little League teams. It's hard to argue with results: 
Aamber, Rolish's sister, batted .450 as a softball player for Rosary High and 
Chad, the youngest Rolish, pitched a no-hitter while striking out 18 for 
Servite this season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jason Rolish hopes to move to the next level of success: To be paid for 
doing something he has been excelling at since he was 6. Former Fullerton 
teammates now playing professionally tell him what to expect. Some tell him 
that it is difficult to get used to playing every day. Others, such as Mike 
Harkey, now playing for the Chicago Cubs, tell him of the perks, something he 
knows about. 
</P>
<P>
"The people treat you great because you are a professional," Rolish said. 
"That's how we were treated up in Omaha and that was one of the greatest 
feelings, being popular because you were wearing a uniform."

Stock in Limbo: Trading in the stock of Southland Communications, which is 
being investigated by federal securities regulators, did not resume Monday 
after expiration of a suspension announced 10 days ago by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Securities Dealers has made no decision about whether to 
allow Southland stock to resume trading, said spokesman Enno Hobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southland issued a statement on Monday saying that, despite rumors 
to the contrary, the company retains its biggest contract to provide pagers to 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. The company also said it continues to operate and 
"does not understand the reason for the unfounded, unconfirmed rumors 
concerning the company."

A SMALL COMPANY MAKES BIG WAVES IN EXPORTS ARENA; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY AND AN ARAB SULTAN ARE CUSTOMERS OF LIFE 
SUPPORT PRODUCTS, AN IRVINE FIRM THAT MANUFACTURES SPECIAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL 
EQUIPMENT.

<P>
Life Support Products Inc., a small Irvine manufacturer of resuscitators and 
other emergency medical equipment, counts among its clients the Tokyo fire 
department, the Sultan of Brunei and the British royal family. 
</P>
<P>
Since beginning an international marketing campaign six years ago, Life 
Support's foreign sales have soared. In the last three years alone, 
international sales have risen five-fold, from $325,000 in 1987 to $1.7 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department has recognized Life Support's success in the export 
market by naming it as a recipient of its "E" award for outstanding 
contributions to bolstering U.S. trade. In May, the Small Business 
Administration's Santa Ana office will select Life Support as Orange County's 
Exporter of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the 'stop-gap' company," said Robert A. Hovee, the company's 47-year-old 
president. "Our products operate from the emergency room to the injured victim 
lying on the street. We thrive on emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
While Life Support's resuscitation systems have become standard equipment in 
emergency medical services departments in a number of major U.S. cities, 
including Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Houston, San Jose and Cleveland, 
company officials concede that they were slow to recognize the opportunity for 
doing business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We started getting overseas calls in 1984, and that was when we decided to see 
what was out there for us," Hovee said. "We gave the international market a 
hard look and decided there's money out there for us.' 
</P>
<P>
But Life Support's foreign sales didn't catch on until 1988, when it created an 
international marketing department. The effort paid off quickly when later that 
year the firm signed a five-year distribution agreement with Drager AG, a West 
German medical and safety equipment manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Hovee mapped out a strategy to expand in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent two months on each target country, intensely studying its technical 
rules covering our products and setting up demonstration booths in trade shows 
abroad," Hovee said. 
</P>
<P>
Hovee and his marketing staff traveled to each target country, scouting for 
reliable distributors to market its medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
While parceling out rights to 11 distributors in Europe and Asia was easy, 
tailoring the devices to meet foreign specifications took time, Hovee said. 
West Germany, for instance, does not allow Teflon to be used in medical 
devices. Life Support engineers had to replace the Teflon with kel-f, a 
non-flammable plastic material that turns to gas once it reaches a certain high 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
And different countries have varying requirements for the color of oxygen hoses 
used in breathing equipment. In the United States and Japan, the hoses are 
supposed to be green. In France and Britain, they're white. And in West 
Germany, they're blue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cultural sensitivities in every country that our people had to know 
before they went to train people in those countries," Hovee said. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for Life Support's export success is that some of its products 
are not made anywhere else in the world, Steve Badolato, Life Support's manager 
of international sales, said. For example, it is the only maker of a body 
splint and litter that keeps an accident victim's spine immobile to prevent 
further injury while the victim is being transported. It also claims to be the 
only supplier of a full-body pack for burn victims. 
</P>
<P>
Its latest device, AutoVent 2000, a breathing regulator the size of a Sony 
Walkman radio is widely used by the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Life Support had its origins as the Anaheim division of Robertshaw Controls 
Inc., a former Fortune 500 company that makes control devices for the aerospace 
and medical industries. After another brief ownership change, the company was 
purchased in 1983 by Burn Pac Inc., a Torrance company that manufactures 
burn-treatment systems. 
</P>
<P>
"As Life Support's business grew, it became more important to us and we 
incorporated some of Burn Pac's products into Life Support, " said Tom Zapara, 
67, the majority shareholder of Life Support who also owns Burn Pac, now a 
division of Life Support. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zapara does not see Life Support going public any time soon, he said 
the company might consider doing so if sales continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"If sales reach $20 million to $25 million with good prospects of increasing 
sales in the future, and if we can show a substantial growth in profit, we'd 
consider going public in the next five years," Hovee said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company's devices are selling well in the European market, Hovee 
said his company has no plans to build a manufacturing facility there. 
</P>
<P>
SALES OF LIFE SUPPORT PRODUCTS 
</P>
<P>
Overseas sales have grown from about 1% to more than 22% since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Projected 1990: 
</P>
<P>
Overall sales: $11 million 
</P>
<P>
International sales: $2.5 million

NASDAQ Halts Trading: Trading of Resdel Industries' stock has been halted by 
NASDAQ because the telecommunications company did not meet the exchange's net 
worth requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rossiter, the company's new majority owner, said the stock will be traded 
on brokers' "pink sheets" while he appeals the decision with NASDAQ officials. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal is likely to take months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rossiter acquired 57% of the financially troubled firm from the Phoenix Group 
International in Irvine in late January for a future cash payment of $1 million 
to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Resdel has about $17 million in liabilities for back taxes, unpaid 
medical-insurance claims and past due payments to suppliers, contractors and 
landlords, as well as a $10-million convertible note held by Reliance Insurance 
Group in New York.

Marilyn Helding, 65, the widow of a Wisconsin vegetable farmer, was afraid the 
money from her husband's estate vanished like crops in the Dust Bowl when 
Windsor Capital Corp. went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I nearly went crazy when they went under," Helding said from her home in 
Franksville, Wis. "I didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
But a few months after the small Milwaukee brokerage collapsed in March, 1988, 
Helding regained her entire stock portfolio and $45,000 in cash owed her by the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
The message: If your broker goes bust, your investment doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
The safety of customer accounts has become the focus of much attention with the 
recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with the bankruptcy court 
filings by two other brokerages in the past year and the widely publicized 
problems at several Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
After a rash of brokerage house failures in the late 1960s, Congress 
established an agency, the Securities Investor Protection Corp., to protect 
investors. The corporation has a $485-million fund that insures individual 
accounts for up to $500,000, including up to $100,000 in cash. Large brokerages 
have insurance for larger amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the protection fund, however, is a last-resort action. Should a 
brokerage go belly up, the SIPC first tries to arrange for customer accounts to 
be transferred to another firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic intention is that a customer should not lose assets or property 
because the broker with whom (he or she is) doing business has encountered 
financial difficulty," said Theodore H. Focht, SIPC president and general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
SIPC covers all forms of stock and bond holdings, but not commodities. It also 
does not guarantee the underlying value of a customer account. For example, if 
XYZ Co. is trading at $50 a share when a brokerage folds but falls to $5 at 
reimbursement time, the customer loses the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not insure you for market losses," said Irving Picard, a New York 
bankruptcy lawyer who has served as a court-appointed SIPC trustee in three 
liquidation cases. "If you think the broker defrauded you . . . that's not 
protected by the SIPC fund." 
</P>
<P>
In the 19 years since its creation, SIPC has handled 212 cases and paid $185 
million to satisfy customer claims. If a firm cannot pay immediately, SIPC will 
advance the money to customers and try to collect later. 
</P>
<P>
SIPC officials estimate that cash and securities worth $1.4 billion have been 
returned to about 240,000 investors, most through account transfers. A total of 
305 claims worth $31 million have not been satisfied, primarily because of 
legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The SIPC fund is comparable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for 
commercial banks. It is fed by required contributions from the nation's 12,000 
or so registered broker-dealers. It also has $500 million in bank credit and a 
$1-billion line with the U.S. Treasury. So far, however, neither of those 
resources has been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 brokerages also have private coverage of as much as $5 million per 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Before SIPC was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon on Dec. 30, 1970, 
self-regulatory organizations -- the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and 
the stock exchanges -- set aside funds to protect the customers of brokerages 
that failed. However, Wall Street was hit with a rash of failures in the '60s, 
when the market slumped as firms spent large sums to computerize. When its 
customer-protection kitty dried up, the New York Stock Exchange was forced to 
dip into a building fund to protect investors. Fearing the worst, the exchanges 
lobbied Congress for help. 
</P>
<P>
There were six SIPC cases last year, five of which involved a total of fewer 
than 50 claims. 
</P>
<P>
SIPC's largest payout, $32.5 million, was related to the 1983 fraud-related 
collapse of Bell &amp; Beckwith of Toledo, Ohio. The demise of Fitzgerald, 
DeArman &amp; Roberts Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., involved the greatest number of 
customer accounts -- 50,000. SIPC has doled out $5.5 million since that case 
opened in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The SIPC can become involved when a broker-dealer enters bankruptcy court 
proceedings, when a trustee or receiver is appointed to run a firm, when a firm 
fails to meet federal requirements or when it cannot demonstrate compliance.

MAN BEHIND SWATCH WATCHES WILL ENTER CAR BUSINESS 
</P>

No one knows yet if its colors will be wild, if it will revolutionize 
technology in its field, if it will win back a market progressively abandoned 
to the Japanese, or if it will be called, say, Swauto. 
</P>
<P>
For now, it's called simply the Swatch car. 
</P>
<P>
The man who proved, with a watch called Swatch, that the Japanese are not 
better at everything, is planning to enter the car business. In as little as 
three years, Nicolas Hayek promises a high-volume, high-quality car that will 
appeal to the kind of people who bought his inexpensive Swiss-made watch when 
everyone said it was time to abandon watchmaking to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hayek is serious about succeeding as an auto maker. For every person snickering 
that a car is infinitely more complicated than a watch, there is an auto 
manufacturing executive inquiring about a possible joint venture on the Swatch 
car. But Hayek freely admits that his latest project is also a lesson in 
progress for American and European manufacturers whose response to the Japanese 
is to try to shut them out. 
</P>
<P>
"People must wake up to realize that you do not win this kind of war by going 
on the defensive with customs barriers and other constraints," he says. "You 
have to fight back at their level, with a high-quality, high-volume and 
low-cost product." 
</P>
<P>
Hayek peppers his speech with references to war and with allusions, aimed at 
his fellow Europeans, to deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't misinterpret me. I love the Japanese," he says. "Without them we would 
all be sleeping very deeply, especially here in Switzerland." But he says there 
should be no misunderstanding the Japanese. "When they attack a market, they 
want it completely. By winning the high volume in the middle," he says, "they 
can move to the luxury sector," where returns are higher. 
</P>
<P>
Hayek, whose Zurich company SMH is the world's largest watchmaker, says his car 
will embody the qualities that have made his watches, and more recently his 
telephones, a success. "It will be unusual, provocative and fun," he says, 
adding that it will also be "ecological." Some observers guess that means 
electric.

ADVERTISING: CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BE AS INTERESTED IN HOW TO BANK AND SAVE

If Madonna's "Material World" was the theme song for consumer values in the 
'80s, Jim Croce's "Time in a Bottle" may turn out to be the tune for spenders 
in the '90s, if you believe data released in a survey conducted by Grey 
Advertising, a New York-based advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, dubbed "Households of the 1990s: America's New Grown-Ups," asserts 
that time has replaced money as the currency for this decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are finding themselves caught between a clock and a hard place," 
said Barbara Feigin, executive vice president-director of strategic services at 
Grey. "During this decade, consumers are going to be as interested in how to 
bank and save time as they were in banking and investing money in the 80s." 
</P>
<P>
The Grey survey, which included 477 households in major metropolitan areas 
across the country, has reidentified the once highly attractive "yuppie" market 
of yesterday as the "new grown-ups" of the '90s. This market segment, made up 
primarily of 25- to 44-year-olds, is the targeted audience of most national ad 
campaigns and as a result, their values often influence the marketing efforts 
of major advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"The values of this group have changed dramatically, and as a result, the look 
of advertising is bound to change," said Feigin. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed 72% of those surveyed felt advertising is out of synch with 
everyday life. Consumers have grown tired of the hyper-glamorous, sexually 
explicit images that proliferated ad campaigns in the past decade, and are most 
concerned with family, home and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Participants ranked having someone special in their lives, doing a good job at 
work and leading a satisfying life as top priorities. This shift in values away 
from material wealth and workaholism should be reflected during the next 10 
years in more wholesome, realistic ads. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to feel advertising was stuck in some kind of time warp," said 
Dick Karp, executive vice president of creative services at Grey. "Although 
they weren't happy with the slick, trendy ads of the '80s, they weren't 
supporting a shift back to the 'Father Knows Best' models of the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Karp said that in the '90s, consumers can expect to see more diverse households 
reflected in national ad campaigns that might show stepchildren, racially 
integrated couples and children taking on more of the shopping responsibilities 
for parents. 
</P>
<P>
Although most industry experts agreed with Grey's findings, some say that the 
study was not saying anything new and that the survey itself was in a bit of a 
time warp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a move toward a more conservative look in ads for sometime now," 
said Ken Rabasca, vice chairman and creative director of Greenstone Rabasca 
&amp; Roberts, a Melville, N.Y.-based ad agency. "I'm not sure that what 
they're saying here is all that new."

GILBERT &amp; SULLIVAN OPERAS SCHEDULED FOR O.C. CENTER

The reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain will present 
Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The Pirates of Penzance" Oct. 16 to 21 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Center officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusive U.S. engagement will be the troupe's first visit to this country 
since 1978 and is part of the "Festival of Britain Orange County -- 1990," a 
combination retail promotion and arts festival co-sponsored by the South Coast 
Plaza mall in Costa Mesa and the British consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is paying for the company's transportation, while the Center is 
assuming presentation costs, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. 
Center officials declined to specify how much the engagement will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Originally formed in 1876 by W.S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan and impresario 
Richard D'Oyly Carte, the company was considered the bastion of authentic 
G&amp;S tradition for 107 years. 
</P>
<P>
But criticized for increasingly stagnant productions and declines in vocal and 
musical standards, as well as box-office and subsidy woes, the company closed 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The present company, run by Richard Condon, was launched in 1988 with part of a 
$1.7-million bequest from the late Dame Bridget D'Oyly Carte, the granddaughter 
of Richard D'Oyly Carte. She died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said Monday that "Mikado" and "Pirates" will be presented to American 
audiences because "they are the two operas the company resumed production with 
(in 1988) and . . . these were the only two available for export." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the Center would be interested in bringing the D'Oyly Carte 
company back but could not afford to sponsor another exclusive visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously subsidizing (this engagement) to a larger extent . . . than we 
would if they were on a national tour," Kendrick said. "We could not do this 
again. There would have to be a national tour." 
</P>
<P>
Four performances of both operas will be presented in Orange County: "The 
Mikado," directed by John Wells, at 8 p.m., Oct. 16 to 19; "Pirates," directed 
by Keith Warner of the English National Opera, at 2 and 8 p.m. on Oct. 20 and 
21. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets, priced at $12 to $39, will go on sale about six weeks before the 
engagement. Information: (714) 556-2787.

STRENGTH OF HIS CONVICTIONS EMPOWERS SOVIET SPORTS CRITIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yuri Vlasov apologized for the clutter in the living room, which was filled 
with boxes from his recent move to a new apartment. Nothing appeared in its 
proper place except for the pictures of Ernest Hemingway on the walls and the 
barbells in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe himself today, Vlasov would say that he is, first, an author 
who has had seven books published and, second, a politician. But before he was 
either, he was a great weightlifter, the man who, by winning the 
super-heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, replaced Paul 
Anderson as the world's strongest man. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 54, he still looks the part. He is 6 feet 6 and has the large hands, 
arms and legs of a lumberjack. With his beard, long-sleeved wool shirt, khaki 
pants and sandals, he would seem more at home in the forest, swinging an ax, 
than in the grimy, industrialized Lyublinsky district of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the power he wields today comes from his deep, rich voice, which he 
used last May as one of 2,250 elected representatives in the Soviet Union's 
Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasov spoke eloquently against the omnipotence of the Communist Party, the 
power of President Mikhail Gorbachev and the tyranny of the Soviet secret 
police, the KGB. Such a speech seven to 10 years ago, another deputy said at 
the time, would have landed Vlasov in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the age of perestroika, when freedom of expression is -- if not 
encouraged -- at least tolerated, his comments have made him unpopular with 
party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply hostile to Leninism," he said in an interview last week. "They can 
smell this coming from me." 
</P>
<P>
The foremost critic of the Soviet sports system, he was equally candid when he 
accused the state-controlled sports committee, Goskomsport, of using athletic 
successes to promote communist ideology, spending massive amounts of money to 
win Olympic medals while ignoring recreation for the masses, misleading the 
world for almost 40 years about its use of professionals in amateur sports and 
turning a blind eye to the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
While not responding directly to Vlasov's charges, Goskomsport officials 
acknowledged that their predecessors were guilty of overemphasizing elite 
sports and that abuses occurred. They said they have made reforms in some 
areas, particularly drug-testing, and, while they intend to maintain the Soviet 
Union's Olympic superiority, they also are formulating plans to provide sports 
for all. 
</P>
<P>
But Vlasov said that the officials are paying lip service to critics from 
within the government, media and public in an attempt to buy time before they 
are forced into cost-cutting measures that could eliminate many of their jobs 
and privileges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the response from the apparatus because, generally speaking, the 
people's dissatisfaction with this kind of arrangement is tremendous," said 
Vlasov, formerly chairman of the weightlifting and bodybuilding federations. 
"If there are true reforms, hundreds of thousands of sports bureaucrats 
throughout the country will be unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"But the battlefield in this country is elsewhere. Therefore, sports remains 
the only national preserve absolutely untouched by any change under 
perestroika. The system today operates the same as it did 30 years ago, the 
only difference being that not all money earned by athletes abroad is taken 
away by the state." 
</P>
<P>
"I was once very close to the leadership of big sports, and I observed the 
bribery and corruption. . . . It is a totally rotten system." 
</P>
<P>
He was introduced to the system as an 18-year-old, first-year student at the 
nation's air force academy, which was appropriate because his primary 
discipline there, weightlifting, became part of the Cold War effort. That was 
in 1954, two years after the Soviet Union joined the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told, 'You have been been taken from a vast army of ordinary citizens, 
we are waging ideological warfare against the West, and you are the shock 
force,"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was a willing conscript. The son of a Soviet secret agent, he said he was 
conditioned throughout most his life to hate the West, particularly the United 
States. But there also were incentives for closet capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
Goskomsport officials announced in 1988 that they, for the first time, would 
give cash bonuses in both Soviet rubles and Western currency to athletes for 
their Olympic performances. But Vlasov said the practice actually began in 1949 
and was authorized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"They laid down specific rewards for any kind of record," he said. "The amount 
of the reward depended on whose record was improved upon. If I defeated an 
American record, I received maximum pay. When I beat Anderson's record in 1960, 
I received a bonus of 2,500 rubles. At that time, that was colossal. Today, 
that would be between 15,000 and 20,000 rubles ($24,750-$33,000)." 
</P>
<P>
But he also said that officials of each sport were allowed to withhold bonuses 
if they were not satisfied with an athlete's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"That turned athletes into obedient sheep," Vlasov said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the orders given to athletes by officials between the mid-'60s and 
mid-'70s, he said, was to take performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic 
steroids, as Soviet sports researchers studied their effects. He said the 
practice was stopped before the drugs were declared illegal by the 
International Olympic Committee in 1975, but he added that many athletes in 
several sports, with the encouragement of their coaches, have continued to take 
them. 
</P>
<P>
With the revelation last week that 52 Soviet athletes tested positive last year 
in Moscow's laboratory, Goskomsport officials said they are combatting the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a lie from beginning to end," Vlasov said. "If we really discontinued 
doping in this country, all of our athletes would start losing after a while. 
The sports officials would be made scapegoats. That's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Vlasov became disillusioned with the win-at-all-costs mentality in 1964. After 
winning the gold medal in 1960, he retired to concentrate on his passion, 
writing. But he had difficulty selling his work and, needing money, returned to 
weightlifting in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if he had defended his championship when his principle opponent, 
Soviet teammate Leonid Zhabotinsky, conceded defeat. Deceived into a false 
sense of security, Vlasov was hurt and angry when Zhabotinsky returned a 
half-hour later and won the competition on his final lift. 
</P>
<P>
"I was choked with tears," he later wrote. "I flung the silver medal through 
the window. . . . I had always revered the purity, the impartiality of contests 
of strength. That night, I understood that there is a kind of strength that has 
nothing to do with justice." 
</P>
<P>
Not until several years later, he said, did he realize that Zhabotinsky's 
deception was a product of the system, as were the sharp increase in the the 
use of drugs and in injuries as athletes tried to compete even when they were 
not healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"The medal is the ultimate goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he once expressed his concerns to a Central Committee member. "I told 
him that this approach to sports was creating a lot of maimed and sick people," 
he said. "He said that this is a war, and that we get people killed in wars." 
</P>
<P>
Vlasov decided then to lead the counter-insurgency. He said that he is not 
opposed to elite sports. On the contrary, he said they are important as a means 
for attracting the masses to sports. But he said that purpose has been defeated 
in a country that can provide swimming pools for only 10% of its populations 
and indoor sports facilities for only 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"Big sports in this country are parasites, leeching off the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His solution is not altogether different from the one proposed by Goskomsport 
officials. He said the government should finance mass sports, while most elite 
sports should be forced to finance themselves, primarily through sponsorship 
agreements with Western companies. The point where he and sports officials part 
is that, in his system, there would be no Goskomsport. Each sport would govern 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
With or without Goskomsport, all parties agree that the government is about to 
retire from the Olympic medal business. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire country sits on a volcano," Vlasov said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite possible all government financing will be withdrawn from sports 
within the next two or three years. The economic situation in this country is 
more serious than ever before."

NORRIS WAS WELL PAST STRIKE 3; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE RETURNS TO MAJOR LEAGUES AFTER 7 YEARS, HAVING OVERCOME HIS 
COCAINE HABIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the Oakland Athletics again, having gone seven years between major 
league appearances because of a wrenching battle with substance abuse and an 
ailing shoulder, Mike Norris peered through the mist of memory and focused on 
New Year's Day, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Norris sat by his locker in the Seattle Kingdome the other day, recalling what 
he now considers the lowest of his lows: waking up with a woman he met only 
hours before, knowing he had gone through $300 in cocaine, but being determined 
to return to the bar where he had begun his New Year's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"There I was at 10 in the morning, in the same place, wearing the same clothes, 
having the same thing to drink, when I finally realized how ridiculous and 
repulsive I had become," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
"My self-esteem was zero. I'd brought embarrassment and humiliation to my mom, 
my family and myself. I'd been arrested. I'd gone through four drug programs. 
My career seemed to be over, yet it was weird. 
</P>
<P>
"As low as I was, I knew I was finally ready to do something about it because 
I'd had enough. I was tired of it. For the first time, I truly didn't like 
myself. I mean, the Lord works in mysterious ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I go through $300 in drugs on the last day of '85 and begin '86 knowing I'm 
through with it. That's why I consider New Year's Day my new birthday. It was 
the start of my new life." 
</P>
<P>
Insistent that he has been clean since that day, Norris is beginning a new 
career at 35, a comeback that boggles the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years between appearances? The average major league career lasts about 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
And for Michael Kelvin Norris, who began his major league career by shutting 
out the Chicago White Sox in 1975 and who was 25 when he won 22 games with the 
A's in 1980, the larger question, for a time, was how long his life would last. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three things you can look forward to with cocaine: hospitalization, 
incarceration and death," Norris said. "I'd done two of the three. The only 
thing left was death. It was the next step. The only way out of the misery, the 
madness." 
</P>
<P>
The addict takes it one day at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Norris is with the A's in Anaheim, staying in a hotel that is a long way 
from the cheap motels he often woke up in with no recollection of how he 
arrived. The knock on the door is likely to be room service rather than the 
Internal Revenue Service having come to collect on back taxes. The $4.3 million 
he received on a five-year contract signed after the 1980 season is gone. He 
will be paid the major league minimum of $100,000 in 1990, but that is far 
better than the unemployment of 1987 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet is the emotional charge of climbing a major league mound again, as 
he did last Wednesday in Oakland to shut out the Minnesota Twins for two 
innings in his first big league appearance since Aug. 6, 1983, a span of 2,439 
days. 
</P>
<P>
There were standing ovations from a crowd of 27,775, and the public address 
system blared "What Is Hip" by Tower of Power, his theme during what Norris 
calls his salad days. 
</P>
<P>
"To know I hadn't been forgotten and to be pitching again in the big leagues 
was the most incredible feeling I've ever experienced," Norris said. "As high 
as I was, there was a time I'd have automatically gone out and gotten loaded, 
but I don't need it anymore and I don't think about it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone, over, past. I blame myself for all the years I could have been 
productive, but there's nothing I can do about it now. I have to take each day 
as it comes and build on that." 
</P>
<P>
Among their 27 players, the A's are carrying 12 pitchers, and Norris seems 
likely to stay when rosters are reduced to 25 or 24 players in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa usually keeps 11 pitchers, and the right-handed 
Norris has an advantage in that his screwball is particularly effective against 
left-handed hitters. 
</P>
<P>
As Gary Gaetti of the Twins noted after Norris pitched those two innings last 
Wednesday: "The first thing I thought about was screwball. The pitch, not the 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa said Norris probably would have made the club even if rosters had been 
at normal size, that he has pitched effectively every time since the start of 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can pitch him any time, in any situation," La Russa said. "He 
has the experience and the guts to pitch in the ninth if I wanted him to. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I amazed by what he has done? I guess I'm pleasantly impressed. Mike is a 
quality athlete, and guys like that are capable of amazing things, though not 
too many could make the comeback he has. He deserves a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
The A's reopened the door in the spring of 1989, inviting Norris to Arizona and 
a shot at a minor league contract. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous five seasons, he pitched a total of 69 innings -- none in 1984, 
when he was recovering from injury, and none in 1987 and '88, when he suspects 
he was being blackballed by then-commissioner Peter Ueberroth and had to abort 
two trips to the Mexican League because of arm and stomach ailments. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was almost as if he didn't play at all in those five years, because 
he pitched only 13 innings at Modesto of the Class-A California League in 1985 
before being disqualified for failing a drug test and 56 innings with the San 
Jose Bees, a California League team at that time made up of baseball outcasts, 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, however, said he never lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean this as a knock at a guy like Tommy John, because he's a great 
pitcher," Norris said. "But I kept seeing him throw his 79-m.p.h. fastball and 
signing contract after contract. That alone was a motivation for me. I kept 
telling myself, 'I can do that. All I need is a chance.' 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I felt I was as capable as a lot of other pitchers as well." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Sandy Alderson said the A's provided that chance because of 
their long emotional attachment to Norris and the belief that he had paid 
enough of a price. 
</P>
<P>
"Why make him continue to pay?" Alderson said. "Put everything aside and he's a 
good person. He needed a job and he deserved one." 
</P>
<P>
Norris spent most of the 1989 season at triple-A Tacoma of the Pacific Coast 
League, a measure of "character growth," he said, and "a humbling test of will 
in my favor." He was 6-6 with a 3.18 earned-run average and went 3-1 in his 
last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
"The more innings I pitch, the stronger my arm is getting and the more velocity 
I have," Norris said. "I'm at about 84 or 85 (m.p.h.) now. I never threw more 
than 88 anyway, so I'm not that far off. It's no secret that the screwball has 
always been my 'out' pitch, and now that I'm seeing a hitter only one time (per 
game) anyway, I'm going to go with my best pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Stone of the Baltimore Orioles won the American League's Cy Young Award 
in 1980, but no one pitched better than Norris, who worked nine complete games 
in which he gave up four hits or fewer and was second in the league in 
victories, ERA, strikeouts, complete games and innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
That was the year when Billy Martin, then the A's manager, seemed to overwork 
his young and talented rotation. Norris pitched 284 innings, almost 140 more 
than the previous year, but he doesn't believe it led to his subsequent 
shoulder problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy gave me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Norris said. "He believed in 
me when others didn't. I had a tremendous season, and if I had the chance to do 
it the same way again, I would. 
</P>
<P>
"My problems developed the next year when we were out so long because of the 
strike. I mean, everyone thought the season was over and I didn't stay in shape 
the way I should have, and when we finally came back (after missing 52 days) I 
tried to do too much too soon. Even then, it didn't really set in as to how bad 
my arm was until the following year." 
</P>
<P>
Norris finished with a 12-9 record in '81 and attempted to pitch through the 
pain in '82 and '83, producing a combined record of 11-16 and making his last 
big league appearance -- before Wednesday -- in August, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
That November, he had surgery to repair nerve blockage in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"When a doctor tells you that you have only a 30% chance of pitching again 
after being the best pitcher in the game only two years before, it's a 
tremendous blow," Norris said. "I was told not to pick up a ball for a full 
year. The problem was, I should have been coming to the park and staying in 
shape. Instead I stayed home with people I thought were my friends. I mean, '84 
was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Involved in drugs since 1979, Norris said the injury and surgery took his use 
to new levels. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested for possession at an Oakland hotel and again while driving on 
Interstate 580, the charges being dropped in exchange for his enrollment in 
rehabilitation programs that didn't help him cure his problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he start using drugs in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
"I've beaten myself up looking for a reason and never found it," said Norris, a 
San Francisco high school star who carried the weight of great expectations 
into a major league career with a hometown team, his door always open, his 
phone always ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how ignorant I was to think some people were my friends. As soon 
as my life started to go down the tubes and I couldn't do anything more for 
them, they were like rats jumping off a sinking ship. I mean, the phone 
suddenly stopped ringing, I suddenly found out who my real friends were, but I 
don't blame anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were several factors, including the superficiality of the game 
itself. There's so much idle time that it can easily happen. There was a lot of 
drug use in baseball then. It's amazing now to see how the game has cleaned 
itself up, but it became a social thing to do throughout the league then. 
</P>
<P>
"And the big lure, the big deception with cocaine, was that it was sold as an 
echelon type drug that wasn't addictive." 
</P>
<P>
Norris paused, his face tightening. 
</P>
<P>
"What it is is the closest thing to the Devil on Earth," he said. "It is the 
Devil on Earth. It is not only addictive but progressively so. I mean you can 
stop, thinking that if you start again it will be at the beginning, but it's 
really at the same level where you stopped. I don't know how many times I was 
told that but didn't want to believe it. I had to experience it for myself. It 
was frightening." 
</P>
<P>
On that morning in 1986, the first morning of the new year, Norris recognized 
that he would have to come to grips with it by himself, that he would finally 
have to live alone for a time, isolate himself, rebuild his self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the ordeal and recovery, there were friends who provided support. 
Among them, Norris said were Dave Stewart, Rickey Henderson, Claudell 
Washington and Norris' attorney, John Lence. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited his mother's unwavering love, the patience of Alderson and former 
A's president Roy Eisenhardt and a pivotal meeting in the spring of 1986 with a 
Bay Area-based flight attendant named Lenise Patrick.

Norris began an impromptu conversation on a flight from Chicago after he had 
met earlier in the day with Ueberroth in New York, been robbed by a teen-ager 
who promised to secure Norris a cab amid the snow in Manhattan and forced to 
take a later flight when he missed his original connection because of his 
futile pursuit of the thief. 
</P>
<P>
If was as if he and Patrick were destined to meet, and he said: 
</P>
<P>
"For three straight hours we talked about nothing but God and the Bible," he 
said. "She was beautiful, intelligent, different than anyone I had ever met." 
</P>
<P>
They have been together since. Norris credits her with helping him cope with 
his insecurities and providing an inner peace. His highs now, he said, come 
through religion and an awareness of spiritual and environmental beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"For five or six years I was laughing on the outside and crying on the inside," 
he said. "Now I can look myself in the mirror and say, 'You're a decent human 
being.' My self-esteem is back. I don't worry and wonder about how I screwed it 
up. The Lord has rewarded me and I think I earned it." 
</P>
<P>
The A's, of course, are monitoring his progress through random testing -- in 
the laboratory and on the mound.

UC IRVINE HIRES TOM FORD, EX-HOUSTON ATHLETIC DIRECTOR

Tom Ford stepped up to accept his Anteater lapel pin Monday at UC Irvine, 
accepting with it the job of athletic director, which has been vacant for more 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend said to me that the first thing I needed to do was to change the 
logo. Who wants to be an Anteater?" Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
He does. 
</P>
<P>
"The Anteater is absolutely a great marketing item," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Experience in fund raising was one of the key issues in Irvine's search, and 
Ford discussed it as one of his early priorities, along with evaluating the 
direction of the program and filling vacant positions in the department, 
including the jobs of fund-raiser and business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the need for fund-raising goals "critical," Ford said he would move to 
set up an annual campaign and seek endowments for some athletic scholarships. 
He also said he would develop a capital campaign for improving facilities, 
among them the school's small pool and crowded weight-training facility, which 
he termed "woefully inadequate for intercollegiate athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, 48, formerly athletic director at the University of Houston, replaces 
John Caine, who was reassigned as a special assistant to the chancellor in 
September after six years as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's athletic department had been running at a deficit for at least six 
years when Chancellor Jack Peltason and advisers decided last fall to shift 
control of athletics from academic affairs to student affairs, dictating that 
the budget must be balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, has since served as 
acting athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has a record of integrity in college athletics, successful fund raising 
and fiscal responsibility," Mitchell said, when introducing Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Ford resigned at Houston in 1986 after two years as athletic director and five 
years in other capacities at the school. According to Ford and newspaper 
accounts, he resigned because he disagreed with the university's handling of an 
investigation into alleged NCAA violations involving improper payments to 
football players under Coach Bill Yeoman. 
</P>
<P>
"I visited with the chancellor (Richard Van Horn) and learned that the school's 
thinking about the way the investigation was going to go was different from 
mine," Ford said. "In my career I didn't feel I could do anything that was not 
appropriate for the integrity of the institution. I visited with him and gave 
him a letter of resignation." Houston was placed on NCAA probation for three 
years in December 1988, and the school's 9-2 football team was prohibited from 
playing a bowl game last season. 
</P>
<P>
A selection of Ford's remarks Monday: 
</P>
<P>
On football, which Irvine does not sponsor: "Football is an important part of a 
major intercollegiate athletic program. However, at this point in time, there 
is much to concentrate on in improving the sports currently being offered. . . 
. I believe as the university grows, (football) could be an important part of 
the intercollegiate athletic program. I wouldn't see it in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
On his athletic career: 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of desire and little skill in several sports." Ford played in the 
1959 Potato Bowl at Bakersfield for the Phoenix Community College football 
team. "I coached Little League. I love to play golf." 
</P>
<P>
On winning: "Winning is important in several respects." Ford pointed to NCAA 
basketball tournament revenue and ticket revenue from increased attendance. "I 
place a great deal of emphasis on winning, although there has to be a point at 
which you evaluate the resources in comparison with those of the teams you 
compete against. . . . The academic integrity of the institution cannot be 
compromised in order to have a winning athletic program." 
</P>
<P>
After resigning at Houston, Ford worked for Raycom, Inc., as a negotiator of 
college sports television packages for two years. He also has worked for a 
consulting firm specializing in college athletics and, for the past year, he 
has been an administrator with the University of Arizona's Extended University 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and his wife, Judy, have three children -- Scott, 25, Julie, 24, and Jill, 
who is a high school freshman.

<P>
To be born and raised in these United States is to be told that, in this land 
of opportunity, you can grow up to be President. Getting straight A's and 
eating your broccoli is thought to help. 
</P>
<P>
To be born Armenian and raised in America is to be steeped in another dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us are hoping one day to have a free country again," said teacher 
Linda Bulbulian, whose classroom at Ramona Elementary School in Hollywood is 
packed with Armenian immigrant children. "Many of these children want to go 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Bulbulian's pupils on Monday met a page from their sad, proud, hopeful history 
-- although the significance of their visitor, Rafael Kazaryan, seemed lost on 
the youngsters. When students were asked if they had any questions, one eagerly 
raised his hand and announced to the class that he had seen Kazaryan on TV. 
There was no question. 
</P>
<P>
Kazaryan, a leader of Armenia's nationalist movement and the first 
non-communist vice president of the Soviet Armenia parliament, spared the 
children the harsher truths of life and politics back home. 
</P>
<P>
To the children, the 66-year-old Kazaryan -- who is on a week-long tour of the 
United States and Canada -- seemed more the gentle grandfather than the 
intellectual firebrand who challenges Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
He did not discuss with them, for example, the chemical spill last week that 
sickened more than 100 Armenians, and the assault on KGB headquarters in the 
Armenian capital that followed. Nor did Kazaryan share the tale of his 
political rise -- a path that included a six-month prison stint in Moscow in 
1988. His jail time, in a sense, carried on a family tradition: Kazaryan's 
father and grandfather had been imprisoned in the gulags of Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
For all Gorbachev's efforts in Eastern Europe, "It's a pity, but in his 
country, he is a neo-Stalinist," Kazaryan said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We have glasnost in Armenia, or we wouldn't be talking," Kazaryan said, 
referring to the opening of foreign relations. But as for internal reforms 
heralded by Gorbachev, "we do not have perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, Kazaryan would preface his remarks with the phrase, "it's a 
pity." But pity is not want Armenia wants or needs, Kazaryan said. Although its 
economy has been ravaged by the devastating 1988 earthquake and territorial 
strife with neighboring Soviet Azerbajian, Armenia needs political support and 
investment more than relief supplies, he said. "We don't want to be a beggar. 
We don't want you to pity us." 
</P>
<P>
Before stopping by Ramona Elementary, where about 300 children are first- or 
second-generation Armenians, Kazaryan met with senators in Washington, Armenian 
scholars and members of the Armenian and American press. Armenian leaders 
estimate that their community in Southern California, centered in Glendale and 
Hollywood, numbers 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
A leading physicist, Kazaryan also met with scientists and industrialists, 
hoping to lure support for his homeland's budding high-tech enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Kazaryan predicted that independence will come for Lithuania ahead of the 
five-year time schedule proposed by Gorbachev. Other Baltic states will follow, 
and Armenia's time will come later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Economic strength is one reason the Baltic states will achieve independence 
first, he said. Another, he said, is the Western perception that strife between 
Azerbajianis and Armenians is between "two wild peoples." He suggested the two 
republics could co-exist peacefully without Moscow's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it's a pity," he added, that nationalist extremists had attacked 
the KGB headquarters. He stressed in interviews that the violent incident came 
about after a recent raid on Armenian villages by Soviet soldiers and the 
chemical leak at a controversial industrial plant. 
</P>
<P>
After learning of the attack on KGB offices in a telephone call Saturday, "I 
did not get much sleep," Kazaryan said, adding that he is fearful of a stronger 
crackdown by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, Kazaryan's transformation from political prisoner to a leader of 
the Soviet Armenian government has made him a symbol of greater political 
freedom within the Soviet Union. But Kazaryan, who was jailed along with other 
members of Armenia's so-called Karabagh Committee, said his release grew out of 
a changing political atmosphere and pressure from groups such as Amnesty 
International as well as scientists in the Soviet Union and outside the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
After spending several weeks in a cell with hard-core criminals, Kazaryan 
threatened to commit suicide unless relocated. The threat worked, he said, 
because Soviet officials were fearful of scandal. "After that, I was among very 
honest thieves who were proud to be with me," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief reception at Ramona Elementary, Kazaryan told Los Angeles school 
board President Jackie Goldberg to expect more Armenian students. "It's a pity, 
but there will be more refugees, more immigrants," he said. ". . . There's only 
one way to minimize the number of immigrants -- and that's to improve 
conditions in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Armenia may be many years from independence, but Kazaryan proudly pointed out 
that the Armenian nationalists took to the streets before the Lithuanians did. 
Lithuanian leaders are said to have been emboldened by the efforts of Armenian 
nationalists -- a notion that Kazaryan finds comforting. 
</P>
<P>
Kazaryan confessed that as an 18-year-old radio operator in the Soviet army, he 
had participated in Stalin's takeover of the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity," he said, ". . . but it's true."
