Taiwan's first athletic delegation to China in four decades arrived in Beijing 
to attend the Asian Junior Gymnastics Championships. The 15 athletes, 
accompanied by 12 coaches and officials, will compete for three days starting 
Friday, according to Chan Te-chi of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. The 
visit marks the first time that Taiwan will be represented at a mainland sports 
event since 1949, when the Nationalists retreated from mainland China after 
defeat by the Communists.

Ron Miller can relax now. The 36-year-old Little York, Ill., man turned in one 
of the four winning tickets for Illinois' record $69-million Lotto jackpot. "I 
feel better now than I did yesterday," Miller said. When he realized his was a 
winning ticket in the drawing Saturday, Miller said, he "kept it on the 
headboard of the bed" all night and put it in a safe on Sunday. Miller, who is 
part-owner of a hog-buying firm in Monmouth, Ill., said he will share his 
portion of the prize with his sister and brother. Also claiming a share of the 
jackpot was a Chicago engineer who said he had a hard time convincing his 
family of his good fortune. Dan Dixon, 38, and his wife, Mary Ann, plan to 
share their winnings with her parents, brothers and sister in New Jersey. Dixon 
said the family buys chances on big jackpots all over the country, and he 
bought 15 tickets for the Illinois game. "I sat down at the kitchen table 
Saturday night and checked all the tickets except one," he said, "and then we 
got to one with a perfect match." Dixon said he called the rest of the family 
and "nobody believed me." Each of the winning tickets is worth $17.5 million, 
to be paid over 20 years at $864,000 a year. The other winners have yet to be 
identified.

 -- An earlier lottery winner is learning that good luck can be the cat's meow. 
Sheelah Ryan, winner of the biggest single jackpot in a U.S. lottery, dipped 
into her $55-million prize and donated $1,000 to University of Central Florida 
students in Orlando who are trying to find homes for more than 100 stray cats. 
"She said she is really interested in the project because the students have 
gotten involved in something positive," said Bill Morris, project coordinator. 
Ryan, 63, of Winter Springs, also has set up a foundation for needy people. She 
won the jackpot in the Florida lottery Sept. 3, 1988.

 -- Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has filed a libel suit in London 
against Time Inc. over an article in the March 13 issue of Time magazine, his 
American attorney, Leonard Boudin, said. Boudin said the suit stems from a 
report in the magazine's international edition about Greek banker George 
Koskotas' charge that Papandreou drained the Bank of Crete, in Athens, of 
millions of dollars in payoffs made to him and party officials. "The 
international edition had a little different story than the American edition of 
Time, and it was accompanied by a lurid cover (photo) showing Koskotas behind 
bars," Boudin said. Koskotas, jailed in Massachusetts, is fighting extradition 
to face embezzlement and forgery charges in Greece. A Time spokesman had no 
comment. SHIRLEY MARLOW

The ambassador to Lebanon at the time of the Iran-Contra affair said he had no 
significant role in the scandal and was involved only in getting a freed 
hostage out of the country. Reginald Bartholomew told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee that he had no advance knowledge that U.S. arms were 
swapped for the freedom of the Rev. Benjamin Weir, an American hostage who was 
released Sept. 14, 1985. "My role was restricted to logistical arrangements, at 
the request of the National Security Council," to get Weir to safety as quickly 
as possible, Bartholomew said. Bartholomew has been nominated by President Bush 
to be undersecretary of state for security affairs, science and technology.

Residents of Beirut sought shelter in basements and bunkers during citywide 
shelling as five weeks of relentless battles touched off international appeals 
for a cease-fire. The rocket and artillery barrages slammed into the Christian 
and Muslim sectors during intensified fighting around the Lebanese capital 
between Christian army units and an alliance of Druze militia members and 
Syrian troops. Meanwhile, the United States, Kuwait, Jordan and Pope John Paul 
II appealed for a truce in what has become one of the bloodiest rounds of the 
14-year civil war.

Fugitive financier Robert Vesco was added as a defendant in a drug-conspiracy 
indictment by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla. Vesco, indicted on one 
count alleging he conspired to import cocaine into the United States, is 
accused of persuading Cuban officials to allow cocaine-laden airplanes to fly 
over Cuba en route to the Bahamas and then to the United States. Vesco is 
believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982. He has been wanted in the United 
States since 1973 on charges of looting an investment firm, Investors Overseas 
Services, of $224 million. The indictment charged that in 1984 Vesco arranged 
the cocaine overflights at the request of convicted Colombian cocaine kingpin 
Carlos Lehder. The United States and Cuba do not have an extradition agreement.

HOUSING FOR YOSEMITE HIT

Environmentalists are complaining that a plan to build $10 million worth of new 
housing for concessionaire workers in Yosemite Valley could ruin the park's 
master plan. George Whitmore of the Sierra Club and Patti Schifferie of the 
Wilderness Society say the plan that calls for building a series of dormitories 
to house 452 employees of Yosemite Park and Curry Co. is in direct conflict 
with the park's 1980 general mangement plan, which calls for the eventual 
removal of artificial structures from Yosemite Valley. The project, which is 
being proposed by the National Park Service and the Curry Co. would replace 
tent cabins at four sites in the valley with multistory dormitories near 
Yosemite Lodge. Whitmore and Schifferie say the plan for the permanent housing 
represents the abandonment of the park's general management plan that took 
nearly 10 years and cost almost $2 million to formulate.

LAB CLOSED BY STATE TOLD TO PAY FOR NEW PAP TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services on Monday ordered Central Pathology 
Services Medical Group of Tarzana to contact hundreds of thousands of women 
whose Pap smears were diagnosed as normal by the lab over the last five years 
and offer to pay for new tests. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology, which last week was ordered shut down by the state for 
allegedly misdiagnosing too many Pap smears, processed nearly 700,000 smears 
last year, more than half of all smears done in Southern California. The lab 
also did Pap smears under the name Central Diagnostic Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect the public health and safety, it is necessary that all 
women, not just those residing in California, receiving Class I or equivalent 
reports (indicating no abnormalities) from either Central Pathology or Central 
Diagnostic within the last five years, need to be offered the opportunity for a 
repeat Pap smear," according to the health department's written order delivered 
to the lab Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The lab was given 30 days to contact the women and recommend that they see 
physicians about retaking the tests. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the action, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, health services director, said 
Monday that a March inspection of the lab found that 21% of its Pap smears had 
been misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sloppy operation," he said in an interview with The Times. "It was 
totally unacceptable that they had such a high error rate." The Pap smear is a 
routine test that physicians use to detect cervical cancer and other medical 
abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not worked out the mechanics of how they will pay for the testing," 
said state health spokesman Norm Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
If Central Pathology does not comply, the state will take "further legal action 
to protect the health and safety of women from erroneous Pap smear reports," 
the order said. Kizer also said his department will send out teams of 
inspectors to 10 other Pap smear laboratories in California during the next six 
weeks. "We need to get an idea of the other labs' error rates and set some kind 
of standard," he said. Kizer would not identify any of the other labs. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said the state will also begin to require continuing education courses 
for cytotechnologists who read Pap smears. And he said he would work with the 
Legislature on legislation requiring the licensing of cytotechnologists along 
with a cap on the number of slides they can read per day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanently Closed 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology said Monday that it has permanently closed and is referring 
Pap smear business to other labs. The company said in a statement that it was 
"a 27-year-old facility with a perfect inspection record to this point" and 
that it had recently instituted what it considers to be "the most stringent 
quality-control standards in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that the state health department had sent a team 
of 20 inspectors to Central Pathology after the federal government found in a 
January inspection that the lab had failed to detect a range of diseases from 
herpes to cervical cancer, according to an internal government report. The 
federal government had found an error rate of as high as 12% in a random 
sampling of 1,258 Pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Department of Health and Human Services decertified the lab from 
its Medicare and Medi-Cal programs because, among other things, the lab's error 
rate failed to meet federal quality control standards. Those two agencies 
stopped paying for Pap smears processed at Central Pathology. 
</P>
<P>
State inspectors examined 1,103 Pap smears and found 234 alleged errors. 
Central Pathology was given only 24 hours Monday to contact those 234 women or 
their physicians to notify them of the alleged errors. 
</P>
<P>
The industry average for Pap smear errors is about 5%, but some pathologists 
say top labs make even fewer mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said Monday that Central Pathology issued results for slides that were 
blank or contained too few cells for an accurate diagnosis to be made. Company 
officials have denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volume Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state officials have criticized the high volume of Pap smears that 
Central Pathology processed -- about 2,600 a day. Central Pathology, according 
to company spokesman Martin Cooper, required its full-time cytotechnologists to 
read 100 slides a day, which is above the recommended level of the industry's 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Some cytotechnologists at Central Pathology read in excess of 100 slides a day 
because the company pays $1 extra for every case above 100 examined during one 
workday. Paying per slide encourages speed over accuracy, according to some 
pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded in Early '60s 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology was founded in the early 1960s by Dr. Allen N. Levy, a 
pathologist. Levy, through a holding company called Amsterdam International, 
also owns Tarzana-based Central Diagnostic Laboratory, which performs a variety 
of medical tests including blood and urine analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cyrus Milani, Central Pathology's director, blamed Central Pathology's 
closure in a statement on "the less-than-forthcoming attitude of government 
employees, their refusal to provide specific guidance for corrective action and 
. . . media distortions and inaccuracies."

WRIGHT VIOLATED RULES 69 TIMES, ETHICS PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unprecedented action, the House Ethics Committee Monday unanimously 
accused Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) of 69 violations of House rules for 
allegedly accepting $145,000 in improper gifts from a Texas businessman and 
using sales of a 1984 book to evade limits on outside income. 
</P>
<P>
While leaders of the panel emphasized that Wright is yet to be proved guilty of 
any wrongdoing, the 12-0 bipartisan vote to bring serious charges against the 
Speaker was a heavy blow to his chances of retaining his leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
As Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, 
the committee's ranking Republican, declared that partisan considerations 
played no role in the decision, nine of the 10 other members of the panel sat 
behind them on a podium with somber expressions. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a Speaker of the House, the nation's third-highest 
elected official, has been charged with ethics violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasserts Innocence 
</P>
<P>
A confident Wright, however, reasserted his innocence and asked the committee 
to let him "confront these allegations head on, face to face" as soon as 
possible. But in the wake of the panel's unanimous decision on the action, he 
no longer could dismiss the charges as the work of Republican extremists, as he 
tried to do a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of that institution," 
Wright told a labor union convention after the report was released. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's announcement of the committee's conclusions completed the investigative 
phase of an inquiry that was started last summer when Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) and Common Cause, a citizens' group, requested an examination of 
Wright's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Based on testimony of 73 witnesses and thousands of documents, Dixon said, the 
panel supported charges in these areas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Book. Wright allegedly schemed to avoid House limits on outside earnings by 
promoting bulk sales of his 1984 book, "Reflections of a Public Man," to groups 
that sought him for speaking engagements. In lieu of speaking fees, which are 
restricted by House rules, Wright arranged bulk book sales to the groups and 
then received royalties, which are not restricted. In at least one case, the 
panel said, all the books bought were not even delivered to the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gifts. From 1979 to 1988, the committee charged, Wright accepted nearly 
$145,000 in gifts from Ft. Worth developer George A. Mallick Jr. in the form of 
an $18,000 annual salary for his wife, Betty, for four years; use of a free or 
reduced-rate apartment in Ft. Worth totaling another $53,488, and use and 
upkeep from 1983 to 1988 of a 1979 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, Wright's attorney issued a point-by-point rebuttal of the 
charges that acknowledged only possible "technical violations" of House 
reporting rules and claimed that the committee was misinterpreting key 
precedents. 
</P>
<P>
One issue was not resolved by the panel's special counsel and was left open for 
further investigation. It involves a complex oil well deal in which money 
raised from a Texas firm was used to buy out Wright's share for $350,000, or 
nearly six times his original investment. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that lawyers in the Justice 
Department's criminal division are aware of the allegations and will review the 
panel's entire report "line by line" to determine whether a criminal inquiry 
might be warranted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muted Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Reaction in the House generally was muted, with Wright's Texas Democratic 
colleagues brushing aside the allegations as frivolous and most Republicans and 
Democrats noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it really is premature to start dancing on the Speaker's grave," said 
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.). "I think we all want to maintain a sense of 
scrupulous fair play in this highly charged political situation." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) urged that Wright step aside as Speaker while 
the charges are pending, and Rep. Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) predicted that 
Wright will be out of office by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Speaker's Texas Democratic colleague, Rep. Charles Wilson, called the 
announcement "a very positive" development for Wright. "Everybody expected it 
to be very salacious and juicy -- and it wasn't," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defers Comment 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he would hold a news conference later in the week to comment on 
the results of the investigation that he initiated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to have anything to say until I've read the full report," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His non-reaction was in keeping with the lower profile he has assumed in 
connection with the Wright investigation since his Republican colleagues last 
month elected him House minority whip. 
</P>
<P>
The committee made public a 279-page report by its special counsel, Chicago 
attorney Richard J. Phelan, summing up evidence gathered in a 10-month 
investigation and listing other charges that the panel decided to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Disclosures 
</P>
<P>
It contained new disclosures that Wright's partnership with Mallick -- known as 
Mallightco -- often was penalized for being late in paying its federal income 
taxes and reported that the Speaker got more benefits from it than Mallick did. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon indicated that the panel would follow regular procedures in hearing the 
case against the Speaker before inviting him to make a personal defense of his 
conduct over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
But negotiations were under way between the committee and Wright's attorney, 
William C. Oldaker, to expedite the proceedings as the Speaker has requested. 
</P>
<P>
Under House rules, the six Democrats and six Republicans on the committee 
normally would conduct a public trial of Wright and decide whether the charges 
that they have found "reason to believe" are true indeed are supported by 
"clear and convincing evidence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Set Penalty 
</P>
<P>
If they find that the charges are proved, the committee then would decide what 
penalty to recommend to the House, if any. Punishment could range from a fine 
or reprimand to censure and, the ultimate sanction, expulsion from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the House, including senior Democrats, have said that they do 
not believe the Speaker could keep his powerful leadership post if he received 
a formal reprimand from his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
No Speaker has been the sole target of such an inquiry since the late 1800s, 
although Wright's predecessor in the office, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. 
(D-Mass.), was one of many persons mentioned in the 1977 Korean lobbying 
scandal. He was not charged with an ethics violation, however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Did Little Work 
</P>
<P>
While Wright has maintained that his wife earned her pay and the other benefits 
from her job with the Mallightco partnership, the committee said it found that 
she did little work for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not whether a spouse can work but whether she did work and earned 
the money," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to disclose the gifts, the panel alleged, Wright broke House rules 
concerning financial disclosure. It also found that Mallick's extensive 
interests in real estate, oil and gas ventures and involvement with savings and 
loan associations provided reason to believe that he has a "direct interest in 
legislation" before Congress. Persons with such interests are barred from 
bestowing gifts worth more than $100 a year to a member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Split, 8-4 
</P>
<P>
A list of votes released by the committee showed that the decision concerning 
Mallick's "direct interest" was one of the most divisive, splitting the 
committee, 8 to 4, with Democrats Chester G. Atkins of Massachusetts and 
Bernard J. Dwyer of New Jersey joining the six Republicans to form the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
On a later vote, however, all 12 members of the panel went on record in favor 
of supporting the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Members of Congress do not exist in a vacuum and should be expected to have 
personal friends with whom gifts can be exchanged," Dixon said in a statement 
read at a news conference. "However, the nature and extent of the apparent 
gifts from Mr. Mallick indicates that Rep. Wright did not exercise reasonable 
care to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, which is the hallmark of the 
House gift rule." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closest Vote 7-5 
</P>
<P>
Other preliminary votes on whether bulk sales of Wright's book were improper 
were decided mainly by 10-2 margins, with Democrats Alan B. Mollohan of West 
Virginia and Joseph M. Gaydos of Pennsylvania in the minority. The closest vote 
was 7 to 5, on a count related to a sale of books to the Fertilizer Institute. 
There was a 12-0 vote, however, on the committee's finding that Wright 
allegedly violated House rules by not reporting his wife's salary and other 
benefits from Mallightco as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also noted that most of the allegations originally leveled against the 
Speaker were dismissed by the committee, including some on which the special 
counsel had recommended that charges be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was absolved for his controversial intervention with federal bank 
regulators on behalf of two faltering Texas savings and loan associations, as 
well as his intervention with other federal agencies on behalf of Texas oil and 
gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
"While the congressman's dealings with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may 
have been intemperate, the committee was not persuaded that there is reason to 
believe that he exercised undue influence in his dealings with that agency," 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Campaign Funds 
</P>
<P>
The panel also threw out a charge that the Speaker used campaign funds to pay 
for publishing his 1984 book and another contention -- raised by its special 
counsel -- that Mrs. Wright allegedly benefited from a below-market interest 
rate on a $75,000 loan from Mallick's wife through the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Another original charge against Wright when the panel began its inquiry last 
June 9 -- that he improperly used a staff aide to help write his book -- also 
was tossed out by the panel. It said that the aide only edited Wright's text 
and could have done the work on his own time. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining allegations were shaped primarily by the special counsel, Phelan, 
who submitted his massive report to the panel on Feb. 21. He and Wright's 
attorney spent nine days in briefing the committee on their differing views of 
the case and the 12 members took another eight days to reach their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reason to Believe' 
</P>
<P>
"The statement of alleged violation . . . represents a determination by the 
committee that in 69 instances, there is reason to believe that Representative 
Wright violated the code of official conduct and other House rules which apply 
to him as a member of Congress," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
While the committee's major decisions were leaked in press accounts last week, 
the number of alleged violations and the total amount of gifts did not come to 
light until Monday, and they surprised some members. 
</P>
<P>
Also surprising to many House members was the strong show of bipartisanship by 
the committee, potentially complicating Democrats' hopes of limiting the 
political damage and preserving Wright's speakership.

BUSH UNVEILS ECONOMIC AID PLAN FOR POLAND

President Bush, declaring that "Eastern Europe is awakening to the yearnings 
for democracy, independence and prosperity," unveiled a program Monday that is 
intended to provide Poland with a modest package of trade and economic benefits 
in response to the political and economic liberalization occurring there. 
</P>
<P>
The measures include duty-free treatment of Poland's exports to the United 
States, American support for the country's efforts to reduce the cost of paying 
its $39-billion foreign debt and official encouragement for U.S. firms to 
consider stepping up their investment in Poland's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberty's 'Time Has Come' 
</P>
<P>
The move came a few hours after a Polish court gave official, legal status to 
the independent Solidarity trade union -- a key step stemming from the 
agreement reached April 5 by the union and the Polish government (Story on Page 
13). Bush declared in his speech in the midst of one of the largest 
Polish-American communities in the United States: "Liberty is an idea whose 
time has come in Eastern Europe and make no mistake about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Poles are now taking steps that deserve our active support," he said, 
recognizing the Communist government's decision to permit the first free 
elections in Poland since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, arriving in Warsaw by train Monday night, 
praised Bush's announcement, describing the President as a "brilliant 
politician." Looking relaxed despite having a cold, he said, "Bush is a great 
man and he knows the Polish situation very well." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa called the proposal for U.S. aid "quite big." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the government nor Solidarity itself issued any comment, with spokesmen 
for both sides saying they preferred to withhold comment until they had read 
Bush's speech. 
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, however, Bush did declare that the U.S. moves so far are 
largely symbolic, part of a carrot-and-stick approach that is not without its 
demands on Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to offer unsound credits. We're not going to offer aid without 
requiring sound economic practices in return. And we must remember that Poland 
still is a member of the Warsaw Pact. I will take no steps that compromise the 
security of the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"While we want relations to improve, there are certain acts we will not condone 
or accept -- behavior that can shift relations in the wrong direction: human 
rights abuses, technology theft and hostile intelligence or foreign policy 
actions against us," the President said. It was a sharp warning not just to 
Poland, but to the other members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military 
alliance, that contrasted with the tenor of the rest of the address. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a crowd gathered outside the red brick city hall on a cloudy, cool 
lunch hour in this aging suburb of Detroit, Bush said that with congressional 
approval, he would offer Poland access to the Generalized System of 
Preferences, a series of trade concessions traditionally offered to developing 
countries that allows the recipients to send their exports here duty-free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imports From Poland 
</P>
<P>
According to the White House, the United States imported $417 million worth of 
Polish goods last year, including fish, textiles, steel and ham. The United 
States sold $304 billion in goods to Poland, including grains and fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The President also said that he would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Work with other major Western nations to reschedule Poland's debt, "easing 
a heavy burden so that a free market can grow." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seek congressional approval for the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a 
quasi-official government agency that helps finance U.S. investment abroad, to 
handle transactions affecting Poland. The corporation would offer a form of 
risk insurance for private American firms investing there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Propose negotiations to ease the way for private American companies to 
cooperate with private businesses in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage "private business and private nonprofit groups to develop 
innovative programs to swap Polish debt for equity in Polish enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Under such a plan, Polish authorities would offer to buy up parts of the 
country's foreign debt at a discount and offer banks or other creditors a share 
in Polish manufacturing plants and other enterprises in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Way Is Cleared 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bush said that the United States would consider support for loans 
to Poland's private sector by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the 
World Bank that specializes in promoting foreign investment in poor countries. 
He also said that the way had been cleared by the agreement between Solidarity 
and the government for Poland to seek advice from the International Monetary 
Fund to develop programs designed to support "sound, new, market-oriented 
economic policies." 
</P>
<P>
As he sought to reward Poland for the agreement reached with Solidarity, Bush 
also encouraged similar change in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We see 'new thinking' in some aspects of Soviet foreign policy," he said. "We 
are hopeful that these stirrings presage meaningful, lasting and far more 
reaching change." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Let no one doubt the sincerity of the American people and their government in 
our desire to see reform succeed inside the Soviet Union. We welcome the 
changes that have taken place, and we will encourage, continue to encourage 
greater recognition of human rights, market incentives and elections." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reinstatement of Workers 
</P>
<P>
The measures announced by Bush on Monday reflect the Administration's strong 
support for the April 5 agreement in Poland. That agreement provides for the 
legalization of Solidarity and Farmer's Solidarity, a rural union, and the 
reinstatement of workers fired for union activities; election in June of a 
newly organized Sejm, or Parliament, with 35% of the seats freely contested, 
and a new, freely contested Senate; and creation of the office of president, 
whose occupant would be chosen by the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agreement emphasized the need to move toward a market-oriented 
economy and allows the opposition to establish a daily national newspaper and 
to gain access to state television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said that the 
Administration's new approach to Poland was drawn from the continuing review of 
East-West relations that Bush ordered when he took office three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The United States' relations with Poland have been steadily improving, since 
reaching a low point when the Polish government imposed martial law in 
December, 1981, in an effort to stamp out the Solidarity movement. The 
sanctions on U.S.-Polish trade that were imposed at that time already have been 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Hungary, Poland is being eyed by White House advisers as a site for 
a presidential visit this summer, although no plans have been set. 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Bush joined a group of local residents for a lunch of dill 
pickle soup, veal cutlet, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa and dumplings, and potato 
blintzes with onion and dill, at the Pod Orlem (Under the Eagle) Restaurant.

The Food and Drug Administration, warning of the danger of botulism food 
poisoning, ordered a halt to the manufacture of garlic-in-oil mixes that 
require refrigeration but lack proper protective agents. The agency also urged 
consumers to discard commercial and homemade garlic-in-oil mixes that contain 
little or no acidifying agents such as citric and phosphoric acid. Most garlic 
products contain these additives, as disclosed on their labels, the FDA said.

A drug commonly prescribed for sedation and relief of cold symptoms is linked 
to sudden infant death syndrome and should not be sold without a prescription, 
a public interest research group said. Public Citizen Health Research Group 
urged the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its decision allowing 
over-the-counter sales of the drug known by the trade name Phenergan. The group 
filed a petition with the FDA four months ago to block over-the-counter sales. 
FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the group's petition is under review. The 
drug is manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Company spokeswoman Audrey 
Ashby said that "in their 35 years of marketing, these syrups have been 
remarkably problem-free."

JUSTICES TO HEAR SWAGGART TAX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court, agreeing to hear an appeal from evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, 
said Monday that it will decide whether he can be forced to pay California tax 
on the sale of religious pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
The case, to be heard in the fall, may clear up a dispute over the First 
Amendment, which prohibits the government both from making laws concerning the 
"establishment" of religion and from interfering with the "free exercise" of 
religion. At issue are claims that these two prohibitions may sometimes 
conflict with one another. 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, the high court ruled in a splintered opinion that Texas 
had violated the "establishment" clause by exempting religious magazines from 
sales tax. The exemption amounted to favoritism for religion, the court said in 
a ruling that struck down such exemptions in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
Now Swaggart contends that any such tax on religious publishers amounts to 
interference with the free exercise of religion and thus violates the other 
half of the First Amendment's religion clause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Tax Policy 
</P>
<P>
California, along with the majority of states, taxes sales of religious 
literature the same as other publications, but Swaggart contends that this 
policy violates his rights. Between 1974 and 1981, Swaggart conducted 23 
crusades in California and sold thousands of books, pamphlets, records and 
tapes through the mail. He was assessed $185,167.02 in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'free exercise' clause protects the right to hear and receive the 
religious message as well as the right to preach," Los Angeles lawyer Charles 
R. Ajalat told the court on behalf of the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. To allow 
states and localities to impose sales taxes on religious literature, he said, 
could "chill" the practice of religion and endanger "religious liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for California argue in the case (Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of 
Equalization of California, 88-1374) that the state's policy does not 
discriminate either for or against religion. 
</P>
<P>
The Swaggart Ministries "is attempting to avoid paying its fair share of 
support of state government expenses by asking for constitutional exemption of 
its religious activities from fair non-discriminatory state sales . . . 
taxation which is applied equally to all sellers," state attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, the high court split 6 to 3 in favor of Texas Monthly's 
assertion that it was unfair, based on the "establishment" clause, not to tax 
religious publications. 
</P>
<P>
But three of the judges in the majority -- Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor 
and Harry A. Blackmun -- said they did not know how they would rule if a 
religious publisher insisted that a sales tax interfered with the "free 
exercise" of religion. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions Monday, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said that Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis cannot stop the Defense 
Department from sending the state National Guard to Central America for 
training. 
</P>
<P>
State militia units are part of the regular army in wartime but are generally 
under state control in peacetime. The Constitution says that Congress controls 
the militia but reserves to the states the "authority of training in the 
militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
When the Ronald Reagan Administration said that it wanted to send National 
Guard units to Honduras for training, several governors, including Dukakis, 
refused. In 1986, Congress changed the law to take away the governors' power. 
Dukakis filed suit. He lost in a district court and an appellate court, and 
without comment the justices denied his appeal in the case (Massachusetts vs. 
Department of Defense, 88-1223). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether U.S. agents can search the home of a reputed 
Mexican drug dealer without a search warrant issued by a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, had said that they 
cannot. It said that the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches 
"imposes substantive restraints on the federal government, even when it 
operates abroad." 
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, the Justice Department said that the ruling (U.S. vs. Rene 
Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, 87-1353) would hamper the U.S. war on foreign drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threw out a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that forbade judges in a 
Los Angeles County courthouse in Huntington Park from imposing an English-only 
policy on their employees. Both sides in the highly publicized case called the 
one-line high court order a victory. 
</P>
<P>
A Spanish-speaking employee who challenged the policy, Alva Gutierrez, has 
moved on to another job, and in January she signed a settlement in which Los 
Angeles County agreed to pay her $85,000 in damages and attorneys fees. But 
lawyers for the Huntington Park judges appealed anyway, urging the justices to 
overturn the 9th Circuit ruling (Municipal Court, Southeast Judicial District 
vs. Gutierrez, 88-1395). 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Supreme Court said: "The judgment is vacated and the case is 
remanded to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 9th Circuit with instructions to 
dismiss the appeal as moot." Despite that, Gutierrez has her $85,000.

JUDGES ORDERED TO OPEN COURT IN N.Y. JAIL AS SOARING DRUG ARRESTS STRAIN 
FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With prisoners sleeping on floors and a federal judge threatening to release 
inmates to reduce overcrowding, municipal judges were ordered Monday to open a 
special court inside New York City's biggest jail to speed sentencing so 
inmates can be shifted to state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sol Wachtler, chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, 
reassigned half the city's civil court judges to criminal trials and asked 
other justices to defer vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Soaring drug arrests coupled with increases in other crimes are straining New 
York's criminal justice system. Jail barges have been pressed into service, a 
homeless shelter has been converted into a prison and plans have been put forth 
to remodel the New York Coliseum -- a former exhibition hall in mid-Manhattan 
-- into a temporary jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
103% of Capacity 
</P>
<P>
The jails are now at 103% of capacity. Recently, the city advertised in 
newspapers for other buildings that quickly could be changed to detention 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, 4,598 people were arrested on felony 
narcotics charges in Manhattan alone -- a 64% increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is a lack of resources to bring those arrests to disposition," 
said Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau. "The sad truth is that some 
drug dealers receive undeserved leniency because insufficient resources 
necessitate unwanted plea bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, even though the state has increased prison space significantly, 
prison overcrowding remains a pressing problem. Unless more resources become 
available, good arrests will go unprosecuted, and drug traffickers will go 
unpunished." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Legal Aid Society, citing serious jail overcrowding, 
filed a contempt motion against the city. A legal aid lawyer took U.S. District 
Judge Morris E. Lasker on an unannounced tour of Rikers Island, the largest 
municipal penitentiary. Lasker found prisoners sleeping on mattresses on the 
floors of receiving rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, in an effort to reduce the numbers of prisoners at packed city jails, 
Lasker ordered 613 inmates be freed before their sentences were completed. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, municipal officials gave Lasker a plan to improve prison conditions 
and asked him to defer for 30 days a suit by prisoners charging the city 
violated his 1981 order against confining inmates to jail holding pens and 
gymnasiums. 
</P>
<P>
The plan submitted by Correction Commissioner Richard J. Koehler called for 
improving the processing of new inmates, adding a new admissions control center 
to identify logjams, beefing up the medical staff to conduct entrance physicals 
and quicker repair of broken cells. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Wachtler announced at a press conference that judges would be sent to 
Rikers Island to sentence 2,500 defendants who have negotiated guilty pleas. 
These prisoners can then be quickly transferred to upstate prisons. He said 
additional civil judges will be transferred to hear criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a case of musical benches," Wachtler said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, pressing for more judges and correctional facilities, stress that 
overcrowded jails are not just a New York City phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"To date," said Morgenthau, who appeared with Wachtler, "the Congress has 
funded only one half of the $2.8-billion Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988." 
Morgenthau charged that the Bush Administration, while committed to fighting 
the war against drugs inside Washington's Beltway, was ignoring New York and 
the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to recognize that drug dealing in Washington Heights is as much a 
federal concern as drug dealing in Washington, D.C.," the prosecutor added. "A 
giant first step toward a kinder, gentler America is a swifter, firmer response 
to drug traffickers."

The Supreme Court agreed Monday to settle some key questions involving the 
ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
What the justices decide sometime next year in a California case could carry 
big-money significance for most states and many big businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The court action, granting an appeal by California officials, said that the 
justices will review a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to 
challenge a state tax in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the justices ruled that 
California may tax multinational corporations based on the businesses' 
worldwide income. 
</P>
<P>
But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent company is 
situated in the United States. The case acted on Monday involves multinationals 
whose parent company is based in a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
California's business tax -- the same levy upheld in the 1984 ruling -- was 
challenged by Alcan Aluminium Limited, a Canadian corporation, and Imperial 
Chemical Industries PLC, a British corporation. 
</P>
<P>
California taxed subsidiaries of the multinationals doing business in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The California tax employs what is known as the unitary system. The method 
bases the tax on a share of worldwide earnings, payroll and property value of 
each multinational and its subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the appeal is whether multinationals based abroad have legal 
standing to challenge such unitary state taxes in federal courts in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Alcan and Imperial challenged the California tax in a federal court in Chicago, 
where the California Franchise Tax Board has an office. A federal judge threw 
out the suits on grounds that the parent companies contended that they were 
injured only in their capacity as shareholders of their subsidiaries -- and 
therefore lacked legal standing.

PRO-DEMOCRACY RALLIES FOR HU YAOBANG BIGGEST SINCE '87

In the biggest pro-democracy demonstrations since early 1987, thousands of 
students staged rallies and marches in Beijing on Monday and today in honor of 
Communist Party reformist Hu Yaobang, who died Saturday of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 students from Beijing University and the People's University of 
China held pro-democracy rallies at their campuses and in nearby streets in 
northwestern Beijing late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, about 2,000 students made a four-hour march to Tian An Men 
Square in central Beijing, carrying a banner that read: "Forever cherish the 
memory of Comrade Yaobang, the Soul of China." 
</P>
<P>
The students chanted slogans, including "Long live democracy" and "Down with 
corruption." Upon reaching the massive square, they hung the 40-foot-long cloth 
banner next to wreaths honoring Hu at the Monument to the People's Heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Students in Shanghai also held pro-democracy memorial marches, according to 
reports from that city. 
</P>
<P>
Hu, widely viewed as the most liberal member of the top Communist Party 
leadership, was dismissed from his post as head of the party two years ago for 
failing to suppress pro-democracy student demonstrations. He was allowed to 
remain on the policy-setting Politburo, but he ceased making public statements 
and did not appear to exercise significant power. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-dawn today, a young man who helped hang the banner on the monument 
shouted out a list of student demands: that the government re-evaluate Hu and 
give him proper credit for his accomplishments, that the government apologize 
for mistakes made in the course of reforms, that unspecified government leaders 
collectively resign and that Chinese citizens be allowed democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the crowd shouted out support and added demands for freedom of 
speech and press. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers called for the students to remain in the square through the morning 
rush hour to press their demands. Hundreds appeared willing to comply, and 
groups sat down on the pavement to wait. Police monitored the march and rally 
but did not interfere. 
</P>
<P>
Around sunrise, about 200 remaining students moved to the sidewalk in front of 
the Great Hall of the People, which faces the square, to stage a sit-in to 
press a revised list of demands: public disclosure of income of national 
leaders, a formal rejection of the two major anti-liberal political campaigns 
of the 1980s and rehabilitation of their victims, increased funding for 
education, abolition of restrictions on street marches, plus freedom of speech 
and press -- and the original demand for a reassessment of Hu. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the students were still sitting in front of the Great Hall, looking 
tired and somewhat sullen. They were surrounded by hundreds of curious 
onlookers, a few of whom shouted out support. 
</P>
<P>
The first major street demonstration after Hu's death came Monday afternoon, 
when about 500 students from Beijing's University of Politics and Law marched 
to the square to lay a wreath at the monument. They thrust their fists in the 
air and shouted "Long live Hu Yaobang, long live democracy, long live freedom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands Watched 
</P>
<P>
This rally quickly swelled to more than 1,000 participants, with several 
thousand onlookers. Hundreds of students remained at the monument throughout 
the evening, making short speeches advocating freedom and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Hu's death, authorities were worried that students would stage 
pro-democracy rallies late this month or in early May to mark the 70th 
anniversary of the May 4th Movement, a student-initiated campaign for democracy 
and science that began with a protest on May 4, 1919. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the protests inspired by Hu's death have peaked or 
whether they might continue to grow. So far, authorities have not taken strict 
steps to stop them, even though they have been unauthorized and thus illegal. 
Most of the dozens of wallposters praising Hu and democracy that have gone up 
at several campuses since Saturday were still up. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the rallies appeared to be only slightly frightened by the heavy 
presence of plainclothes police. Several dozen of the officers could be easily 
picked out at the Monday afternoon and evening rallies, with a smaller number 
apparent this morning. 
</P>
<P>
These officers, many of whom make no real attempt to hide their identity, play 
the role of reminding all present that they may be held responsible for their 
words or actions. Activist students, for example, may later be criticized in 
private by school officials, or they may experience difficulties in winning 
good job assignments after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
This factor didn't prevent a host of sharp anti-government barbs. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Hu) wasn't so very great, but he was greater than those who are alive 
now," declared a young man in a fashionable black jacket at the Monday evening 
rally in the square. "When Hu Yaobang was in power, the Chinese people had 
hope. But now?"

WARSAW COURT ACTS;

SOLIDARITY GETS LEGAL STATUS BACK

<P>
The independent, self-governing trade union Solidarity is legal again. For the 
second time in history, it has become the only independent trade union in the 
Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The final step in the legalization process took place Monday in Warsaw's 
provincial courts building, a soot-stained four-story maze of dim hallways and 
high black doors, in the same chamber where Solidarity's original charter was 
accepted by a beleaguered and reluctant Polish government in November, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"All workers have the right to create and gather together in labor unions 
according to their wish," said Danuta Widawska, presiding over a panel of three 
women judges as she read from court documents. "Accordingly. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Chants of "Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!" filled the courtroom where about 300 
supporters had gathered, while the three judges, their scripted moment upon 
Poland's political stage concluded, shook hands with the leaders of the 
Solidarity delegation and retreated to their chambers, ready to let the 
continuing drama unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, in what was billed as a planned response to the legalization, 
President Bush, in a speech in Hamtramck, Mich., announced a new package of 
economic aid and debt relief for Poland. There was no immediate response from 
either the government or Solidarity, with spokesmen for both sides saying they 
preferred to withhold comment until they had read Bush's speech. 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, on a visit here, welcomed Poland's move 
and said that Paris will back efforts to ease Warsaw's crippling foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, whose name was also taken up in rhythmic chant by the courtroom 
crowd, was not there -- he was home in Gdansk nursing a cold and preparing, it 
was said, for an early rendezvous with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist 
Party leader forced into an accommodation with the union he once suppressed by 
declaring martial law. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Monday's court action, Solidarity issued a statement by Walesa 
saying, "I appeal to all workers and supporters of our union to form factory 
organizations as soon as possible where they still don't exist and to report 
their membership in Solidarity or to join it." 
</P>
<P>
The legalization of the union movement followed eight weeks of "round-table" 
talks between government and union officials. The accord reached April 5 set 
out a program of democratic and institutional reforms and provided for the 
National Assembly to amend the legislation that had outlawed Solidarity in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
After the amendment, it remained only for Solidarity to petition the court for 
legal status. The court responded favorably Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the courthouse, meanwhile, there was the usual supporting cast -- the scores 
of elderly women, eyes primed for tears and hands clutching bouquets, 
gray-haired men with canes and Solidarity pins affixed to their worn lapels. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting eight years for this," said Kaszimiera Jaziewicz, who, as 
with many of her friends on the courtroom, had spent much of that time in the 
basements of Roman Catholic churches, laboring with faithful defiance for 
Solidarity's ultimate return to the scene. "We are very happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrast Noted 
</P>
<P>
Delighted as she was, Jaziewicz and others could see a sharp difference between 
the courthouse scene Monday and the one that took place on Nov. 10, 1980. The 
contrast suggested the length of the journey Poland has made -- and the 
distance it has yet to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, as an intoxicating mood of defiance swept Poland, the courthouse 
hallways teemed with Solidarity supporters, the streets were filled with 
banners and chanting crowds prepared for a triumphant march through the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as a sudden cold rain turned to snow, Warsaw's busy streets absorbed 
the handful of Solidarity enthusiasts virtually without a trace. One of them, 
on the steps of the court building, suggested staging a march. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fine," said Father Henryk Jankowski, Lech Walesa's parish priest from 
St. Brygida's in Gdansk, who had journeyed to Warsaw for the occasion. "That's 
fine, but I don't think we have enough people." 
</P>
<P>
Father Jankowski was right. In addition, the union, legalized as part of a 
bargain struck after long negotiations with the Polish authorities, has more 
pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain itself is not easy, for Solidarity must balance its determined 
calls for a reform of the country's economic system with the need to protect 
the interests of the workers in whose name the union was founded -- goals that 
are bound to come into conflict. Also, the union's activists and chief advisers 
are preparing for national elections to a newly created Senate and to compete 
for 35% of the seats in the national Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Solidarity officials present at the court proceedings Monday was 
Bronislaw Geremek, a university professor who was one of the leading architects 
of the sweeping round-table agreements signed by Solidarity and the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember eight years before today," said the ginger-bearded historian as he 
stood in the jury box of the courtroom waiting for the panel of judges to 
emerge. "I have the feeling that now we start with different conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The first of the new conditions, he said, stemmed from the Soviet Union and the 
changes brought about by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Second," he went on, "I have a feeling that on both sides, the Polish 
government side and Solidarity, we learned something. We learned how to cope 
with one another. I have the feeling that the Communist Party changed and 
Solidarity learned how to practice compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Both the government and Solidarity hope that the compromise will hold together 
for at least four more years, when -- as Geremek reminded his listeners -- the 
next elections to the Polish National Assembly will be fully free. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most important thing we decided at the talks," he said, "that the 
next elections should be simply democratic. This means that it is a promise, 
and the realization of this promise depends on the strength of Polish society." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with rising consumer shortages and mounting inflation, Polish society may 
have to bear greater hardships before any economic renewal occurs. The Polish 
government has counted on its agreement with Solidarity to pry badly needed 
financial support from Western nations, both for investment and for relief from 
a $39-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity has made it clear that it will join forces with the government in 
this appeal, even to the point of sending Walesa abroad -- to Rome this month, 
followed by trips later in the year to West Germany and the United States -- 
not quite as an official emissary, but at least as a demonstration of a new 
spirit in Poland. 
</P>
<P>

SANDINISTAS DEPORT AMERICAN WHO CRASH-LANDED IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The government Monday deported an American who crash-landed his private plane 
in Nicaragua last month during what Sandinista officials called a flight to 
pick up cocaine in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan authorities brought no charges against the pilot, Arthur Henry 
Burton Jr., even though his twin-engine Aerocommander entered the country's 
airspace illegally March 25 en route from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
But they said his deportation showed their eagerness to cooperate with the U.S. 
government in regional drug enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have been cool to that offer, coming as it does from a 
Marxist-oriented government that Washington is trying to isolate in Central 
America. They had little public comment on the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry police officers brought Burton, 39, from a Managua prison to 
the airport and handed him over to U.S. Consul Atim Ogunba. She gave him his 
U.S. passport, which had been seized by the police at the time of his arrest, 
and escorted him aboard a direct flight to Miami on Lacsa, the Costa Rican 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said the U.S. State Department had asked for 
Burton's deportation so he could be questioned by the U.S. Customs Service in a 
drug-related investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time there has been cooperation between the United States 
and Nicaragua in a drug case," the official said. "The deportation was an act 
of our government, but it was their idea." 
</P>
<P>
American officials declined to comment on talks with the Nicaraguans about the 
case or even to confirm that Burton is under U.S. investigation. The U.S. 
Embassy spokesman, Lou Falino, said he could not discuss the case because 
Burton had not waived his rights under the Privacy Act. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, U.S. officials expressed annoyance over the incident, 
without denying that Burton is a suspected drug runner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas have been pushing for several months to portray themselves as 
the white knights of Central America in the war against drugs," one official 
said. "They very badly want any kind of understanding with the United States, 
and they would say anything to show that they are cooperating with our 
government in this area." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of five Central American presidents in February, Nicaragua offered 
a plan to unify regional anti-drug efforts. It called for centralized 
enforcement authority in each of the five countries and monthly regional 
meetings to which officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration would 
be invited. 
</P>
<P>
The five countries' foreign ministers agreed to send delegates to Managua early 
this month to discuss the Nicaraguan plan. But the meeting was postponed when 
Honduras, a close U.S. ally, advised that its representative could not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the region say that Washington wants to keep the Sandinistas 
isolated until they live up to promises for open and fair elections next 
February. U.S.-Nicaraguan relations have been minimal since the two countries 
expelled one another's ambassadors last July. 
</P>
<P>
Burton and Abimael Castillo Canur, 38, both residents of Belize, landed near 
Puerto Cabezas, on Nicaragua's east coast, with a damaged fuel tank. Nicaraguan 
officials later gave reporters a confession signed by Burton saying the two 
were en route to Capurgana, Colombia, to pick up 200 kilograms of cocaine.

HELICOPTER CRASH FOILS DRUG SMUGGLER'S PRISON ESCAPE

<P>
A helicopter swooped inside a prison yard near here on Monday and a marijuana 
smuggler with a life sentence leaped aboard, but the breakout was foiled when 
the chopper hit a fence and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a flight to freedom, Ben Kramer -- once a world champion powerboat 
racer -- received a fractured ankle. His novice pilot, identified as Charles 
Clayton Stevens, broke both of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave it a try, but they sure made a mess of it," said John Clark, warden 
at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happened during the dreary, overcast morning, prison officials 
said. Kramer, 34, was out for a walk in the recreation yard. Only about half a 
dozen other inmates were nearby, playing cards or shooting baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter appeared from the south, hugging the tree line. It lowered 
inside the perimeter. It was a tight squeeze. The yard is but 50 feet across. 
</P>
<P>
The small two-seater hovered inches from the ground. Kramer made his run, then 
grasped one of the skids. But when the aircraft tried to lift away, it suddenly 
listed to the right. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rotors tangled in the concertina wire that curls above the 14-foot 
fence. The rotor split, and chunks of blade flew hundreds of feet. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, the helicopter teetered in the mesh, like a fly caught in a spider 
web. Then it finally fell, face down. 
</P>
<P>
Two inmates got to the crash first. Some witnesses, according to Clark, say 
these other prisoners were actually trying to join the escape. 
</P>
<P>
"But the main version -- and I believe this one -- is that they were trying to 
help," Clark said. "Obviously, too many people weren't going to get away in a 
two-seater." 
</P>
<P>
In minutes, armed guards circled the area. Fuel leaked from the aircraft. A few 
prison officials ran toward the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bullard was among them. "Ooh, that pilot was moaning," he said. "He was 
yelling about the pain: 'Oh, my side' and 'Oh, my legs.' " 
</P>
<P>
The prison has nearly 1,000 inmates. About 100 are classified as low-security 
and are used as a work force. Most of the rest are awaiting trial or placement 
in another facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was being kept in a special high-security area. He was soon to stand 
trial on a marijuana-smuggling charge in Ft. Lauderdale. He was already locked 
up for life with no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, he and auto racer Randy Lanier were convicted of masterminding a 
drug ring that distributed more than half a million pounds of marijuana 
nationwide from 1980 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During those same years, the brash, hot-tempered Kramer also was becoming a 
champion powerboat driver, steering in ocean races at speeds of 120 m.p.h. "He 
was an aggressive, very competitive guy," said another racer, Bob Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer won the U.S. Open Class Offshore Powerboat Championship in 1986 and the 
world title in 1984. He also owned a Miami marina and boat works. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to say he has really put bad light on the sport, just like when 
those pro football players get caught dealing drugs," racer John D'Elia said. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was brought to the correctional center from a federal prison at Ray 
Brook, N.Y., in December to face another marijuana-smuggling indictment in Ft. 
Lauderdale and a Miami gun charge on which he already has been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marshal John Horgan said Kramer will also be charged with attempted 
escape, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and the pilot 
will face charges of aiding an escape. 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, U.S. Marshals were still trying to find out how Kramer made a 
connection with Stevens, the pilot -- and if anyone else was involved. Stevens 
took his lessons at a small private airport outside Miami. He told his 
instructors he wanted to be a crop-duster. 
</P>
<P>
He "had taken flying lessons just over the past five-six months, and he really 
wasn't an experienced enough pilot yet to attempt this kind of thing," said 
Darrell Williams, of the marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens is believed to be from Oregon, Williams said. In fact, the Bell 47D-1 
helicopter, built in 1952, was reported sold in January to C. Stevens of 
Oregon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Using a helicopter as an escape vehicle has now been tried with varying success 
more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
One effort, involving a love story, was made into a recent TV movie, "Outside 
Woman." Another incident, in Mexico, inspired the 1975 movie "Breakout." 
</P>
<P>
Most prisons have contingency plans to deal with helicopter escapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell you everything, but if we have a clear shot at an inmate 
boarding, we'll take the shot," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are all sorts of other problems where discretion is advised. What 
can you do if the helicopter pilot is a civilian hostage who has been hijacked? 
It gets tricky. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, in this case, it all sort of worked itself out on its own." 
</P>

EXXON CLEANUP OKD BUT WIDER EFFORT SOUGHT

<P>
The Coast Guard commandant Monday approved Exxon's plan to scrub at least 305 
miles of shoreline fouled by America's worst oil spill, but he demanded that 
the company also target oil-tainted beaches outside Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Paul Yost also expressed reservations that Exxon's draft plan was too 
optimistic. The plan, released Monday, calls for Exxon to hire 4,000 people to 
clean most of the soiled shoreline by the third week in August. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup can be be completed by August if a hot-water cleaning method that 
can damage beach life is used aggressively, or by mid-September if 
environmentally safer methods play a larger role, the plan says. 
</P>
<P>
Those projections were disputed by a state environmentalist, who said after 
reviewing the plan that only about 150 miles could be cleaned before winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to Exxon Official 
</P>
<P>
Yost, under orders from President Bush to hasten the cleanup, approved the 
draft plan in a letter to Exxon's general manager in Valdez, Otto Harrison. But 
he immediately demanded that Exxon broaden the plan by May 1 to include 
oil-tainted beaches outside the sound, which state officials say may number in 
the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
The top state environmental official also called for the plan to be broadened 
to include areas outside the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said Exxon's first fully equipped landing barge would be deployed 
Saturday, a prediction Yost said he found encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The plan estimates that by June 1 the company will have 2,500 Alaskans working 
on the shoreline, with 1,500 other people in support roles. It says 11 barges, 
28 landing vessels, 150 utility ships, and six wash-vacuum ships will be used. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Haavig of the Environmental Conservation Department estimated after 
reviewing the plan that crews would be able to scrape and spray greasy black 
sludge from only about one mile of beach per day. 
</P>
<P>
At most, there are 150 days from the time workers and gear are mobilized, two 
or three weeks from now, until winter descends in September.

NRC GRANTS A 2ND CHANCE TO PLANT SHUT FOR NAPPING 
</P>

<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday gave a Pennsylvania nuclear plant 
permission to resume operations two years after it was shut down because 33 
control room operators slept on the job or neglected their duties. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC voted 3 to 0 to lift the order that had kept the Peach Bottom plant 
closed since March 31, 1987, when the commission said its continued operation 
would threaten public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
In granting permission to restart the facility, the commission nevertheless 
warned the plant operator against complacency. "We will be watching you very 
closely," NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items before bringing 
the plant to full power, a task that will take several months and be carried 
out under the scrutiny of NRC inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utility Reports Changes 
</P>
<P>
The commission acted after a representative of Philadelphia Electric Co., the 
plant operator, said it had undergone radical changes since the NRC 
investigated a tip about sleeping on the job and ordered the facility shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The changes got to the "root causes" of the problem, the NRC's staff said in 
recommending that the commission permit the restarting. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a lax "culture" at Peach Bottom, in which plant problems either 
were ignored or went unnoticed, the staff said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would at least appear to me that management (before the shutdown) either 
was not aware of conditions or, if they were aware of it, they condoned it," 
Zech said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The operators must never again betray the special trust and countenance of the 
public," Zech said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner James Curtis was out of the country and missed the vote. 
Commissioner Kenneth Rogers abstained because he once served on the 
Philadelphia Electric board, the NRC said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costly Down Time 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown cost the company about $250 million for plant modifications, 
purchasing replacement power and its share of a $1.25 million fine, the largest 
in NRC history. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems at Peach Bottom occurred on the overnight shift. On at 
least two occasions, according to NRC testimony in 1987, three of the four 
control room employees responsible for running the plant were asleep at the 
same time. Another time, several of the operators were found huddled around a 
personal computer, playing video games. 
</P>
<P>
Of 39 control room operators now at the plant, 24 were there at the time of the 
shutdown, and all have been retrained. To discourage napping, high-backed 
chairs in the control room have been replaced with less comfortable seating. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, meanwhile, Zech indicated the committee would vote 
Thursday on awarding a full-power license to the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long 
Island, after hearing the NRC staff report that the $5.5 billion reactor is not 
hazardous and is ready to go into service. 
</P>
<P>
All indications are that the Shoreham full-power license will be awarded, but 
whether it will ever be used is doubtful. The Long Island Lighting Co. is one 
step away from selling the plant to New York state for $1 in exchange for 10 
annual rate increases of up to 5%. The state would then decommission and 
dismantle the plant.

EXXON PLANS TO HIRE 4,000 TO CLEAN SHORES

<P>
Exxon will hire 4,000 people to scrub 305 miles of shoreline fouled by 
America's worst oil spill and says the job can be finished by the third week in 
August, according to a plan obtained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup can be be completed by August if a "steam-cleaning" method is used 
aggressively, or by mid-September if environmentally safer methods play a 
larger role, says the plan obtained by Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Those projections were disputed by a state environmentalist, who said after 
reviewing the plan that only about 150 miles could be cleaned before winter. 
</P>
<P>
The plan estimates that by June 1 the company will have 2,500 Alaskans working 
on the shoreline, with 1,500 other people in support roles. It says 11 barges, 
28 landing vessels, 150 utility ships and six wash-vacuum ships will be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Estimates of Spill's Severity 
</P>
<P>
The total affected shoreline from the March 24 Exxon Valdez wreck in Prince 
William Sound is 366 miles, says the plan, which proposes to clean 305 miles. 
It estimates that 54 of the miles to be cleaned are heavily oiled, 86 
moderately oiled and 165 lightly oiled. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes that needed permits will be promptly issued and that no 
additional oil will wash ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Haavig of the state Department of Environmental Conservation said the 
plan estimates that crews would be able to scrape and spray greasy black sludge 
from only about one mile of beach per day. 
</P>
<P>
"A mile a day is optimistic," Haavig said. 
</P>
<P>
At most, there are 150 days from the time workers and gear are mobilized, two 
or three weeks from now, until winter descends in September. 
</P>
<P>
Haavig said crews might make good time on lightly oiled beaches, but the more 
heavily polluted stretches will slow them. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment, Exxon spokesman Dennis Stanczuk said the company wanted to 
confer first with the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Paul Yost, who was sent by 
President Bush to hasten the cleanup.

A Thai man whose flight was delayed by a labor dispute was found to have 
swallowed 100 condoms filled with 700 grams of heroin, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The man had been forced to make an unscheduled stop in Brisbane when his 
Singapore-to-Sydney flight was blocked April 11 by an overtime ban by air 
traffic controllers. Customs officers noticed that the man, 37, looked nervous, 
and they alerted colleagues in Sydney, where the heroin was found during a 
hospital examination. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was not named by police, has since passed all the condoms and will 
appear in court later this week charged with smuggling a prohibited import, the 
spokesman said. The airport labor dispute has been resolved, Australian 
aviation officials said Monday.

GOLD-MINING CYANIDE BLAMED IN WILDLIFE DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that thousands of birds and animals are being poisoned, Rep. Mel 
Levine (D-Santa Monica) and the Wilderness Society called Monday for a federal 
investigation into gold mining operations in California and Nevada that use 
cyanide to extract the precious metal. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,400 migratory birds and other animals, including deer, coyotes, kit 
foxes, rabbits and chipmunks, have been killed at the Nevada mines since 1984, 
according to figures compiled by Nevada officials and released at a press 
conference Monday at the Federal Building in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mines are in arid areas, and birds and animals searching for water 
are attracted to the cyanide-laced holding ponds that are an integral part of 
the mining operations. There are 93 such operations in the two states. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an environmental scandal taking place in the remotest areas of California 
and Nevada," Patricia Schifferle, the California-Nevada director of the 
Wilderness Society, said Monday. She said the death rate in 1988 was twice 
1987's in Nevada. There are no figures available for wildlife deaths at 
California mines. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Levine's office released a letter urging the House 
subcommittee on mining and natural resources to request an investigation by the 
General Accounting Office, the investigatory arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But the mining industry issued a statement later in the day charging the 
Wilderness Society with issuing misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
"Any characterization that the California mining industry is responsible for 
significant numbers of bird deaths or that it disregards its environmental 
responsibilities is absolutely untrue," said Bill Tilden, chairman of the 
mining industry's Desert Conservation Institute. 
</P>
<P>
An "informal survey" of 10 of 93 mining operations turned up fewer than 200 
dead birds last year, Tilden said. He said the information was collected by the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management. By the time Tilden issued his statement, Bureau 
of Land Management offices had closed and his figures could not be verified. 
</P>
<P>
The call by Levine for a General Accounting Office investigation came on the 
eve of a public hearing scheduled for tonight by the Bureau of Land Management 
on a controversial plan to open a mine 100 miles south of Las Vegas in the 
Castle Mountains of the eastern Mojave Desert where a new 1.5-million-acre 
Mojave National Park is proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "heap leach" mining, the method has become popular in the last decade 
because it enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from 
low-grade ore. 
</P>
<P>
Heap leach mining involves saturating heaps of ore dug from nearby strip mines 
with a cyanide solution. The solution, which is about 0.1% cyanide, bonds to 
the bits of gold and is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is 
separated from the solution. Companies can produce an ounce of gold for about 
$200 or less and sell it for about $400. It costs about $300 an ounce from deep 
mining and standard milling methods. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle charged Monday that the Bureau of Land Management was "ready to 
approve" the mining operation proposed by Viceroy Resource Corp., a Canadian 
firm based in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
"The BLM continues to approve these mining operations. . . . I believe we have 
a case of Valdez-type indifference," Schifferle said, referring to 
circumstances leading up to the 11-million-gallon crude oil spill March 24 from 
the Exxon Valdez in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield denied Monday that a decision has been made on 
the Castle Mountain proposal. But she said the General Mining Law of 1872 
requires the bureau to approve the Castle Mountain mine unless it would result 
in "undue or unnecessary" degradation of the habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Fitzpatrick, president of Viceroy Resources Corp., could not be reached 
for comment Monday. But he told The Times a year ago that steps would be taken 
to protect birds and wildlife from entering the ponds, including floating 
covers on the surface and the use of air cannons and multicolored flags to 
scare birds away. 
</P>
<P>
The Castle Mountain mine proposed by Viceroy would extract about $40-million 
worth of gold from 2.8 million tons of crushed ore each year, according to 
company President Ross Fitzpatrick. The strip mine will be 600 feet deep and 
2,200 feet across. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle warned that, based on the known deaths of birds and wildlife and 
other cyanide heap leach gold mines, the mine proposed in the eastern Mojave 
should be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle said mine owners are exempt from state and federal hazardous waste 
cleanup and prevention laws. She said the mining industry is not required to 
pay royalties to the federal government or the cost of cleaning up public lands 
and restoring them to their original condition. She pointed out that such 
royalties and cleanup charges are routinely paid by the oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 p.m. BLM hearing tonight at the San Bernardino County Government Center, 
as well as hearings Wednesday in Barstow and Thursday in Las Vegas, are on a 
final environmental impact statement. The public comment period closes May 15 
and a decision on the proposal is expected in mid-July, Maxfield said.

The nude body of 13-year-old Jennifer Moore, who has been missing since 
Thursday, was discovered Monday evening at the side of a local highway, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears . . . that she was probably killed elsewhere . . ," police 
spokesman Scott Sibbald said. "She was in some garbage bags, partially in and 
partially out. Part of her face and head were still concealed in the bags." 
</P>
<P>
Some of her clothes were found nearby, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald declined to elaborate on the condition of the body. An autopsy was 
scheduled by the Marin County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald said a motorist driving along Novato Boulevard, about half a mile west 
of the city limit, spotted debris alongside the road, stopped to check, found 
the body and contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald indicated investigators have a lead on "a suspect or suspects," but 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The popular eighth-grade student was last seen near a local shopping center, 
where she had gone to get an ice cream cone, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 posters appealing for help in locating Jennifer were 
distributed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Family friend Jan Shippey called Jennifer "the sweetest; just a good girl." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's disappearance was the latest in a series of cases involving missing 
Bay Area girls. Ilene Misheloff, 13, disappeared Jan. 30 on her way to an ice 
rink in Dublin; Michaela Garecht, 9, was abducted outside a Hayward market last 
November, and Amber Swartz-Garcia disappeared while playing in the front yard 
of her Pinole home last June. 
</P>
<P>
However, investigators have said there is no evidence that the cases are 
connected.

Grocery clerks in nine Bay Area counties voted overwhelmingly Monday to 
authorize a strike against major food stores unless a contract agreement is 
reached, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 
24,000 clerks, voted by 97% margin to authorize a strike against Safeway, 
Lucky, Cala, Alpha Beta, Albertson's, Raley's, Frys, Pak 'n Save, Park 'n Shop, 
PW Markets and several other major stores, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote set the stage for the first major grocery strike in the Bay Area since 
a six-week walkout in 1960, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The membership gave us an overwhelming mandate to achieve their goals at the 
bargaining table," union spokesman Carl Bunch said. "We plan to carry this 
message back with us (today) when we meet in negotiations with the Food 
Employers Council." 
</P>
<P>
Talks began in mid-February. Management has sought cutbacks in health and 
welfare benefits and pensions. The two sides have yet to get into serious talks 
about wages, the union said.

SDG&amp;E, SCE ADMIT MERGER MAY MEAN SHIFT OF 1,700 JOBS 
</P>

Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
would save the utilities $1.7 billion during the next decade, according to 
documents the two utilities have filed with the state Public Utilities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison repeated their previous assertion that only 1,000 jobs 
would be lost after the proposed merger that would create the nation's largest 
gas and electric utility. However, the filing suggested for the first time that 
1,700 more employees probably will be transferred if the merger occurs. Edison 
Vice President Michael R. Peevey on Monday said it is too early to say which 
employees would face transfer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filings made Friday, 693 management personnel would lose jobs 
because of the merger. An additional 305 employees in customer service would 
lose jobs and 118 "power supply" employees would lose their jobs. Also, the 
filing acknowledges that "it is still possible, however, that additional 
reductions may be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counter to Testimony 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E and Edison have maintained that the 1,000 jobs to be eliminated would 
be spread between the two companies. However, that explanation runs counter to 
recent testimony by a pair of former SDG&amp;E board members who suggested that 
SDG&amp;E alone stands to lose 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at both utilities maintained that the merger would lead to lower 
electric rates for the new company's 4.8 million customers, improved service, a 
more reliable electric supply and reduced air pollution. "The merged companies 
will be a stronger, more efficient utility, with a diversified power supply and 
fuel mix," according to the documents, which were filed late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The joint filing -- an 8-inch-thick collection of documents -- provided the 
first comprehensive analysis of how the combined company would operate. The PUC 
will use the complex and wide-ranging document during its upcoming review of 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The filing drew immediate criticism from environmentalists, consumer groups and 
politicians in San Diego, who have opposed the proposed merger since it was 
announced Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The filing "seemed to ignore a lot of the concerns raised by us and other San 
Diegans," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action 
Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "They tried to put a nice window 
dressing (on the proposed merger), but there's still nothing that makes me 
think that this is a good deal for San Diego residents." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor remained unimpressed by the utilities' 
repeated promise of immediate rate reductions after a merger. "I say big deal. 
. . . We're talking about the utility rates of this city for a lifetime," 
O'Connor said. The promise of an immediate rate decrease "does not matter . . . 
that's just another example of them putting out a little tiny carrot so they 
can get the whole ball of wax," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigations Urged 
</P>
<P>
Peevey on Monday defended the proposed rate reductions as "clear and immediate 
recognition that there are benefits" for San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, SDG&amp;E Chairman Tom Page -- who at first opposed 
the proposed merger -- now believes it is "questionable" whether SDG&amp;E 
could continue to meet San Diego County's increased demand for electricity 
without a merger partner. Standing alone, SDG&amp;E "could return to the 
dilemma of the 1970s -- over-reliance on oil and gas generation," according to 
Page. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a state senator called for three separate investigations of 
allegations that SDG&amp;E board members were improperly influenced by Edison 
before they voted to sell the utility. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) asked Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, San 
Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, and the San Diego County Grand Jury to 
examine the charges, leveled earlier this month by two former SDG&amp;E board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The former directors, Charles (Red) Scott and O. Morris Sievert, said in sworn 
depositions that SCEcorp, Edison's parent company, approached several SDG&amp;E 
directors about seats on the SCEcorp board of directors during merger 
negotiations between the two companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott described the offers as "bribes" and said he believes they must have 
influenced the judgment of his fellow SDG&amp;E directors. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E officials have said the offers were legal and normal for 
two companies negotiating a merger. The investigative agencies queried by 
Stirling could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities' detailed filing also acknowledged that Edison gave consideration 
to seeking PUC approval to share the anticipated cost savings between 
shareholders and customers. However, Edison abandoned that controversial 
proposal because it "would divert attention from the substantial benefits 
ratepayers will receive," according to testimony by Edison Executive Vice 
President John E. Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
"We are (now) confident that, over the long run, our shareholders will benefit 
from the strengthening of our core utility business through the merger," 
according to Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities also relied heavily upon what critics in the past have labeled 
"celebrity witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
James S. Schlesinger, former secretary of the U. S. Department of Energy, 
endorsed the proposed merger as a "sensible and worthwhile step" that will 
"yield real benefits, especially over time." 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E also solicited favorable testimony from Ernest S. Liu, a 
general partner with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a New York-based investment 
firm. Lee C. White, formerly chairman of the Federal Power Commission and a 
past president of the Consumer Energy Council of America, was hired to testify 
about the merger's effect on consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Celebrity Witness 
</P>
<P>
The merger also won praise from Lee M. Thomas, who served as administrator of 
the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency during the last half of the Reagan 
Administration. Thomas said the proposed merger's environmental impact seems to 
be "consistent with the objectives of achieving long-term, stable improvements 
in air quality for Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The merger would improve air quality in San Diego because the combined company 
would cut back on the use of older oil- and gas-fired electrical power plants 
in San Diego County, according to Thomas. The former EPA administrator also 
suggested that air quality in the Los Angeles area would be improved with or 
without a merger, largely because of tough new restrictions recently proposed 
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Shames also scored the utilities' promise to seek a 10% rate decrease for 
SDG&amp;E's residential customers and a 5% rate cut for the San Diego-based 
utility's commercial and agricultural customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were in Los Angeles, I'd be protesting the proposed 5% to 10% rate 
decreases promised for San Diegans," Shames said. "It means that (Edison 
customers) will be subsidizing SDG&amp;E rate cuts for a promise that they'll 
get something back in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Shames also contended that the PUC probably would ignore the proposed rate 
decreases for San Diegans because "the law states that you can't . . . 
discriminate and charge different rates in different service territories." 
</P>
<P>
The joint filing contradicted a pessimistic report by San Diego's Air Pollution 
Control District, which predicted a massive increase in pollution following the 
conclusion for a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Berg, a South Coast Air Quality Management District board member, said: 
"Our major concern is that (a merger) is really dealing with emissions 
throughout Southern California. What (Edison) does in San Diego has an impact 
on us up here and vice versa." Berg is chairman of the University of Southern 
California's Institute of Politics and Government. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of SDG&amp;E and SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, 
are expected to approve the proposed merger at meetings this week. 
</P>
<P>
The merger also must be approved by a handful of regulatory agencies, including 
the state PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Opposition to the 
proposed merger has been intense in San Diego since SDG&amp;E's board of 
directors voted Nov. 30 to accept SCEcorp's $2.4-billion stock swap merger.

EX-POLICEMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN PERJURY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A former San Diego police officer pleaded not guilty Monday to a felony charge 
of perjury after he allegedly lied in court about his arrest of a drug suspect. 
</P>
<P>
John Doulette, a police officer for two years until his termination, is charged 
with lying on the witness stand about his procedures leading to the arrest of a 
man on suspicion of possessing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Doulette's allegedly false testimony last year, the charges against 
Paul D. Bogus were dismissed. The state attorney general's office entered the 
case in March and filed the perjury charge against Doulette. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Situation 'Very Rare' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare for an officer to be charged with a case of perjury," said 
Janelle B. Davis, supervising deputy attorney general. "It's not a common crime 
and it's not something you expect of a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
Doulette did not speak during his brief arraignment Monday, but his attorney, 
Barton C. Sheela, said afterward that the episode is merely an innocent 
mistake. He said the officer simply did not remember that he had forgotten to 
follow proper police policies when making the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a logical thing," Sheela said. "I've talked to a number of police 
officers, and they say that's standard conduct if they're real busy." 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Dick Tonek, a Police Department spokesman, sharply disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to beg to differ with him," Tonek said. "It's not a small thing. When 
you make an arrest or you do anything that has legal consequences to it as a 
police officer, you do it with the utmost honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just tell little white lies and omit little important things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions About Search 
</P>
<P>
According to Davis, the incident occurred Feb. 12, 1988, when Doulette and his 
partner, Officer David A. Hoffman, saw Bogus drop something on the ground in 
the 200 block of N. 50th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Doulette got out of the car, began to question Bogus, then prepared to cite him 
for littering. Davis said the officer also searched Bogus and found a couple of 
rocks of cocaine in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Bogus was taken to County Jail, where sheriff's deputies found more cocaine in 
his possession, Davis said. He then was charged with two counts of possession 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
At a March 3, 1988, preliminary hearing, Doulette testified that he radioed his 
dispatcher and learned there was an outstanding warrant for Bogus' arrest, 
which gave him the proper authority to search Bogus in the first place and find 
the drugs, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, Officer Hoffman testified that no such call was made. A 
judge subsequently ruled that the arrest was improper, and the charges against 
Bogus were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheela, in his version of the case, said Doulette actually found out about the 
arrest warrant only after taking Bogus to police headquarters. But, on the 
witness stand, Doulette forgot and assumed that he had received authorization 
for the search through a routine radio call, Sheela said. 
</P>
<P>
Doulette was later terminated from the police force, and he is now appealing 
the dismissal to the city's Civil Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's court hearing, he was released on his own recognizance. Municipal 
Judge Frederic Link set a May 23 preliminary hearing.

POLICE PROBE FRACAS INVOLVING OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Police Department's internal affairs office is investigating a 
confrontation in Paradise Hills involving eight off-duty officers who were 
attending a bachelor party that was disrupted by a dispute between two officers 
and several men from a house across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two men who allegedly threatened several of the officers were arrested and 
charged with assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
But at issue is who provoked Friday night's confrontation and whether the 
officers identified themselves as such before becoming engaged in the brouhaha. 
</P>
<P>
According to statements from officers quoted in the police report of the 
incident, one of the men slashed at an officer with a knife, a second was 
holding a pool cue "over his left shoulder like a baseball bat" and "rotating 
it as if to swing," and a third drove into an officer with a slow-moving truck. 
</P>
<P>
However, the two men and several witnesses from the same house maintain that 
the officers initiated the brawl and identified themselves as police officers 
only after the fight had ended. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Officer Timothy Long, who was off duty, drove into the 
cul-de-sac of the 3000 block of Plato Drive about 8:45 p.m. Friday and began 
looking for a parking spot. He was waved down by fellow Officer John Manke, who 
had been yelling for him to park in the driveway of the house where the party 
was being held. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Nicholas Ross, 25, began walking toward the two officers from 
the house across the street and made threatening comments to Manke, according 
to the police report. Moments later, Ross' brother, Michael, walked from the 
house across the street and joined his brother while holding a pool cue, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Everette, 18, who was later arrested in connection with the fight, 
gave the following account to police: "Those guys (the officers at the party) 
across the street were drinking and making lots of noise. We asked them to be 
quiet. Then they yelled, 'Right here, park right here.' Nick and Michael went 
outside and said, 'Do you got a problem? We've been living here longer than 
you. You can't be making noise in a neighborhood like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Everette continued: "Then those guys (Long and Manke) said, 'Who . . . do you 
think you are?' That's when they started showing us a gun and started beating 
us up. One guy said, 'You're going to sleep!' They never identified themselves 
as police officers." 
</P>
<P>
The officers involved, however, offered a different version of the incident: As 
Michael Ross approached him while carrying the pool cue, Long stepped back and 
displayed his gun and identified himself as a police officer. After more words 
were exchanged, Nicholas Ross returned from the house across the street with a 
knife. Manke then went back to the party to summon assistance. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Long was then confronted by the Ross brothers, one 
holding a pool cue and the other brandishing a knife. Also, a man later 
identified as 18-year-old Terrance Everette "drove a pickup truck at a slow 
speed" until it struck Long, forcing him into Nicholas Ross, "who slashed at 
him three times," with a knife, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Manke returned to the scene with six other officers who were attending the 
party. After Long and off-duty Officer Brett Righthouse took the knife from 
Ross, several other officers wrestled with Everette to obtain the sawed-off 
.22-caliber rifle he had brought back to the scene, the report said. Michael 
Ross had reportedly fled and was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived and arrested Nicholas Ross of the 3000 block of Plato Drive and 
Terrance Everette, of the 6400 block of Garber Avenue on suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon. Ross and Everette were taken to County Jail and released 
Saturday after posting bail: $10,000 for Ross and $15,000 for Everette. Their 
arraignment has been scheduled for early this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Manuel Rodriguez, Steve Kingkade, Kent Hoflen, Kevin Rooney and Paul 
Libassi were also involved in the incident.

MUSICIANS STRIKE AGAINST THE STARLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking greater job security, union musicians struck the Starlight theater 
company Monday, and planned to picket auditions by non-union musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Civic Light Opera's five-play summer season opens May 24 with a 
performance of "Peter Pan" at the Civic Theatre. In past years it has employed 
a minimum of 20 musicians per show. 
</P>
<P>
Local 325 of the American Federation of Musicians sanctioned the strike after 
the Starlight mailed contracts with a 5 p.m. Monday signing deadline to 21 
union musicians, despite the absence of a contract agreement. The strike makes 
it impossible for union musicians to work for Starlight, even if they sign the 
contracts, said Joseph Pallazola, president of Local 325. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to prevent any hassles our people may have gotten into by having 
signed these things (contracts)," Pallazola said. "The main issue is a work 
guarantee for the group of people who have played most of the jobs over the 
past several years." 
</P>
<P>
Besides changing the "contractor" who selects orchestra musicians this season, 
management did not offer contracts to the same people it had in past years. 
</P>
<P>
"The symphony and the opera musicians have tenure," Pallazola said. "This 
orchestra does not have any tenure of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
Starlight Executive Producer Harris Goldman said the union demand for tenure 
infringes on managerial discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenure is not only contrary to our past relations with the musicians' union, 
it is a practice that is not in existence in musical theaters around the 
country," Goldman said. "We asked a number of our colleagues around the country 
if they have any tenure and they said no, no, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
Although past Starlight contracts guaranteed employment to a minimum 20 
musicians for each show, management balked at that clause this year, calling it 
"featherbedding." 
</P>
<P>
"Some shows are scored for less than 20," Goldman said. " 'Dream Girls' is 
scored for only 14. "What we believe is that there are certain elements in the 
musicians' union who are trying to preserve all the jobs to themselves to the 
exclusion of other members."

CHURCH VANDALISM TIED TO 3 TEENS HELD IN SCHOOL FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges of burglary and vandalism of a Roman Catholic church have been added to 
the arson charges against a group of Escondido teen-agers accused of setting 
four fires at three Escondido schools that caused more than $1 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
As hearings began Monday to determine whether the teen-agers will be tried as 
juveniles or adults, Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Walter added a break-in and fire 
at the Church of the Resurrection to charges against the teen-agers. They 
already face charges in four fires last month at Escondido High School, Orange 
Glen High School and Del Dios Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
Walter said the mid-February break-in at the church involved three of the four 
teen-agers. A church window was broken, crosses outside the church were 
inverted, property inside the building was rifled and outside lights were 
unscrewed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter argued Monday that the youths -- three boys and a girl -- should be 
tried as adults because of the costly effects of their acts and the gravity of 
the crimes with which they are charged. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, two 16-year-olds and two 17-year-olds, are also charged in 
connection with two fires at Escondido High, one on March 10 that caused about 
$55,000 damage to a portable classroom and one March 18 that destroyed the 
5,000-square-foot cafeteria and dramatic arts structure, and caused an 
estimated $900,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Later the night of March 18, it is charged, the teen-agers set a $223,000 fire 
in a classroom at Orange Glen, then stopping off at a 7-Eleven store to buy 
lighter fluid that they used to set another fire in a portable classroom at Del 
Dios that caused about $40,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The four youths, handcuffed in pairs, were led into the chambers of Judge 
Sheridan Reed, presiding judge of the juvenile courts. They remained silent and 
unmoving during the morning hearing, looking neither at their parents nor at 
videotapes showing the ravages of the fires they are charged with starting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire Damage Detailed 
</P>
<P>
Reed scheduled an all-day session Wednesday to conclude the fitness hearings 
for the four -- all of whom were represented by attorneys at the Monday 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Sworn testimony from school officials detailed the damage and inconveniences of 
the fires, which forced high school students to eat sack lunches instead of 
normal hot meals, caused the delay of a spring dramatic production at Escondido 
High because scenery, costumes, lighting and theater equipment were destroyed, 
and burned the research work and collections of several teachers. 
</P>
<P>
If the youths are tried as juveniles, their maximum penalty would be sentencing 
to the California Youth Authority until the age of 25. If tried as adults, they 
could be sentenced to up to six years on each count of arson and to lesser 
terms on counts of burglary, theft and vandalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
A74-year-old woman died Monday after she was struck by a car while walking 
across a Panorama City street, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Irma Martinez of Gardena died at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills 
several hours after the 3 p.m. accident, Officer Timothy Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, 34-year-old Edwin John Preimesberger of Lancaster, was arrested on 
suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and was being held at the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Van Nuys Jail, Sands said. Police said a breath test showed 
that the man was legally drunk when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was walking in a crosswalk on Van Nuys Boulevard at Chase Street when 
she was struck by the car, which had run a red light, police said. The car was 
traveling about 35 m.p.h., Sands said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER CHARGED WITH STUDENT SEXUAL LIAISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando High School teacher has been charged with three counts of 
unlawful sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old female student, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shrake, 52, of Valencia was arrested April 4 after the student, who 
authorities said had willfully engaged in sex with Shrake, told a family member 
about their relationship, said Detective Gary Lyon of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's child abuse unit. 
</P>
<P>
"She confided in an older brother, and he convinced her to tell police," Lyon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents are alleged to have taken place between March, 1988, and March of 
this year at Shrake's former Reseda residence, his home in Valencia and in his 
car, Lyon said. The girl, now 17, attended San Fernando High but was not a 
student of Shrake's. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on an emotional downside when they first met, and he took advantage of 
that," Lyon said. The youth decided to tell her brother about her involvement 
with Shrake after "she realized she was being used." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Munatones, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
said since his arrest, Shrake has been placed on compulsory leave of absence 
without pay pending the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Munatones said Shrake, who is not married, has been a special education teacher 
at San Fernando High since 1982 and has worked on and off for the school 
district for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Shrake is free on $10,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned in San Fernando 
Municipal Court on April 25. If convicted, he faces a maximum of six years in 
prison.

FORMER OPPONENT BACKS BERNARDI IN COUNCIL RUNOFF RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, facing a June 6 runoff against 
firefighter Lyle Hall, announced Monday that he has picked up the key 
endorsement of Al Dib, the third-place finisher in last week's primary in the 
northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Bernardi, a 28-year council veteran, also said at a City Hall 
news conference that, if reelected, his next term would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I just happen to think this next term ought to be enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi finished first in the April 11 primary with 42% of the vote but fell 
short of the 50%-plus-one vote required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who 
finished second with 26%. Dib, past president of the Arleta Chamber of 
Commerce, received 12% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he is not running again after this term, which tells me he will not 
owe developers and special interest groups anything," Dib said of Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business, GOP Support 
</P>
<P>
Dib, who was the only Republican in the nonpartisan race, is expected to bring 
business and GOP support to the veteran councilman. Bernardi and Hall are 
Democrats, as are most of the district's voters. But Republican support could 
be critical in a close race. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi and Hall have been aggressively courting another also-ran -- Irene 
Tovar, a Latino activist who has strong roots in the district's increasingly 
Latino community. Tovar, a former head of the Hispanic Caucus of the state 
Democratic Party, finished fourth in the field of eight candidates with 10% of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Those who hope to elect a Latino to the seat someday are urging Tovar to back 
Bernardi because the councilman probably would vacate the office sooner than 
would the 49-year-old Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Dib, who met privately with Bernardi and Hall last week, said he chose the 
councilman because Bernardi has "love, feeling and care for our community." He 
said Bernardi has been working to reduce crime and to control growth in the 
district since he inherited much of the area in the 1986 council redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years working in this community, I have never seen Lyle Hall in our 
community," Dib said. "Just looking into his eyes. . . . They just look cold 
and icy. 
</P>
<P>
"I must endorse the one who I believe will do the most for our community," Dib 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disappointed' By Endorsement 
</P>
<P>
When told about Dib's reading of his eyes, Hall laughed. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm disappointed," the challenger said of Dib's endorsement of Bernardi. "But 
while it is disappointing on a personal level, the bottom line is that 60% of 
the people voted against the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he has not committed to support any of the also-rans should they 
run for the seat in 1993. Dib said he will not be a candidate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, meanwhile, criticized Hall for failing to identify the employers and 
occupations of many of his contributors in his last campaign fund-raising 
report. 
</P>
<P>
City elections officials have asked the Hall campaign to provide the additional 
information. Hall said contributors have been slow in providing the 
information, but he is making every effort to obtain it.

MAN BEATEN IN FORMER HELLS ANGELS HANGOUT; 
</P>
<P>
JURY AWARDS $592,000 IN DAMAGES TO VICTIM IN RESEDA BAR FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who's a jury to believe? A convicted felon and snitch who was drunk when he was 
beaten up in a bar? Or a biker called Indian Dave and the owner of the bar, a 
hangout for the Hells Angels? 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury believed the intoxicated felon, a Canoga Park 
man. In a verdict filed Monday, jurors unanimously found that Chuck Smith, 61, 
deserved $592,000 for injuries he received in a fight last June at the Canby 
Sweet bar, in the 7200 block of Canby Avenue in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Smith suffered a ruptured spleen, punctured lung and broken ribs in the fight. 
He was hospitalized for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorney, Bruce M. Bunch, argued that the bar's owner should have 
protected his client. He said the only security in the bar, then a Hells Angels 
hangout, was a female bartender. 
</P>
<P>
Bunch said jurors felt that "We don't need bars like this that cater to the 
Hells Angels and they ought to be put out of business." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the bar, John Schroeder, said Bunch had "tried the case on 
the basis of the Hells Angels" and not on the facts. He said members of the 
Hells Angels used to stop at the bar but that owner Beverly Rios "kicked them 
out about eight months ago." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called the award outrageous, especially because the plaintiff is "an 
admitted felon and alcoholic." Smith was convicted of arson for hire last year, 
but escaped a prison term by helping prosecutors convict the person who hired 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Bunch said his client is a convict and has admitted that Smith was drunk when 
he went into the bar. Smith's blood alcohol was more than 0.2% when he was 
admitted to the hospital two hours later, Bunch said. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides differ on what happened inside the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder claimed that Smith threw the first punch at Sterling Knuznitsky, a 
biker known as Indian Dave. Four witnesses, including the owner, agreed. 
Schroeder said Knuznitsky, in turn, hit Smith once. 
</P>
<P>
Smith testified that he doesn't remember who threw the first punch but that he 
was kicked and struck several times in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Smith at first thought he might have been beaten up because of 
his role as a snitch in the arson case. But Smith discovered later that one of 
the two women with whom he entered the bar was the girlfriend of one of the 
bikers, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boiled down to which side the jury believed," he said. "And they 
believed us."

KINGS RETURN TO EARTH IN CALGARY; 
</P>
<P>
VICTORY OVER EDMONTON GIVES TONELLI SHOT AGAINST FORMER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before John Tonelli was a King, he was a Calgary Flame. But that doesn't 
necessarily mean he's going to go through the same kind of gut-wrenching 
emotions during the Smythe Division playoffs that plagued Wayne Gretzky during 
the semifinal series against Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
It's a different story for Tonelli in the series that begins tonight at 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't called the Great One in Calgary. In fact, he wasn't called much at 
all during the playoffs the last couple of years he was with the Flames. 
Mostly, he sat. 
</P>
<P>
And when last season ended, they called him a cab. Made him a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
That was a shock, but not as big a shock as having been traded to Calgary by 
the New York Islanders, the team he helped to four Stanley Cup titles. 
</P>
<P>
Holding desperately to the belief that he had some more good days of hockey 
left in him, Tonelli signed with the Kings last June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wants nothing more than to show the Kings that they were right, that he 
can still do the job. He did it all season, showing the way on the ice with a 
dogged determination and off the ice with mature, low-keyed leadership. But he 
wants to do it in the playoffs. This is his favorite time of year. This is when 
it really counts. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens this time around? He comes down with the flu, then 
complications. He ends up in the hospital with respiratory problems, losing 
weight and patience while the Kings struggle through the early games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very frustrated when I was in the hospital watching the games," Tonelli 
said. "It was very difficult. You can't help but think a little negative at a 
time like that, thinking, 'It's happening to me again. I'm being denied this 
opportunity again. I'm missing the time I like to play most.' I'm so thankful 
for my teammates for keeping it going." 
</P>
<P>
So he can get back into it. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli made a token appearance in Game 5 against Edmonton, played a little 
more in Game 6 and actually played some real hockey in the big victory Saturday 
night in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting better every day," Tonelli said. "I feel I'm getting stronger. The 
coaches have been very wise in giving me part-time duty, letting me fill in." 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he harbors no animosity toward the Flames, but his days in 
Calgary do not account for his happiest hockey memories. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was in New York," he admitted. "It was a big shock to be traded. It 
took me awhile to get over it. But I love playoff time, and my first season 
with the Flames, I got to play and contribute in the playoffs, and that was 
great. The last two seasons were very different. I wasn't given the opportunity 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli played in all 22 playoff games as the Flames advanced to the Stanley 
Cup final series against the Montreal Canadiens right after he was traded to 
Calgary. But the next year he played in only three of six playoff games. And in 
his second full season with the club he played in only six of nine playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he said that he didn't play much, he hastened to add in his 
diplomatic way: "But that has to go on my shoulders as well as theirs. I don't 
think I got the best out of me, so, obviously, they didn't get the best out of 
me. It works both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Given another chance with the Kings -- and when that almost slipped away, 
another chance when the Kings came from two games behind to gain him at least 
one more round -- he says things will be different. "I damn well better get the 
best out of me this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are taking nothing for granted as they prepare for the team with the 
best record in the National Hockey League during the regular season, the team 
that dominated their season series, winning six of eight games. The Kings did 
not win at the Saddledome this season. 
</P>
<P>
The only sign, so far, that the Flames might be vulnerable is the semifinal 
series between the Flames and the Vancouver Canucks. The Flames finished 43 
points ahead of the Canucks in the regular season, and the series was expected 
to last four games, maybe five. But it went seven, and even went into overtime 
in the seventh game at the Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take a close look at what made Vancouver so successful against 
them," Tonelli said. "Vancouver took them to the brink, to the final seconds of 
overtime. (The Canucks) never gave up. They took the body and forced them all 
over the ice." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings also have been pointing out that the Flames did not see them with 
their current roster completely assembled. The Kings are playing much better 
now than they were earlier in the season. And the Flames? 
</P>
<P>
"They play so well all season long, right from the start they have great 
consistency," Tonelli said. "They play so well throughout the regular season. 
Other teams, during the playoffs, pick it up a notch, eh? The Flames are 
already there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's not easy for a team to go into a building where it was 0-4 and try 
to upset the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"You either look that challenge right in the eye or you don't," Tonelli said. 
"We've seen a big challenge already, and we met that one. We have to be 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be televised by Prime Ticket and broadcast by KGIL (1260) 
and KORG (1190) at 6:30, Pacific time. . . . Calgary will be without defenseman 
Gary Suter, who suffered a broken jaw in Game 2 against Vancouver, and Mark 
Hunter, who suffered a broken hand in Game 6. When Calgary beat the Kings in a 
Smythe Division semifinal series last season, Suter led the Flames with nine 
points, including eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Vernon, the Calgary goaltender who has been maligned as a guy who can't 
win the big games, made 42 saves, including two overtime stops, in the Flames' 
4-3 victory in Game 7 against Vancouver. Vernon, who led the NHL during the 
regular season with 37 victories, said after the game that he never understood 
the reputation. "I don't understand the bad rap. It ticked me off a bit, yeah. 
In the last 10 years, only three goalies have won a Cup. I have a great team in 
front of me. So did (Grant) Fuhr, (Patrick) Roy and Billy Smith. I think the 
criticism has made me a better player, though. I've had to face it day in and 
day out." 
</P>
<P>
King Marty McSorley, on whether this series will be more physical than the 
fight-free Edmonton series: "Our goal-scorers are going to have to suck up a 
punch, a stick to the ribs. They're going to have to be tough -- and it's tough 
to take that stuff and not retaliate -- and then hurt them by shaking it off 
and scoring goals. That's the best way to stop that garbage. I expect Wayne 
(Gretzky) to get a few more cheap shots this series. But he can take a shot, 
turn around and score a goal. When I was first getting to know Wayne, there 
were times when he would come back to the bench and say, 'Relax, I can handle 
it.' He's said many times, it's easier to look in the mirror and see yourself 
with a bloody nose after a win." But McSorley is not saying that the Kings are 
going to do nothing but take shots. He's not shy about dispensing what he sees 
as justice if he needs to. McSorley said: "Our guys have to have some room to 
play."

ETHIOPIAN WALTZES THROUGH BOSTON;

MEKONNEN WINS IN 2:09:06; KRISTIANSEN FIRST IN 2:24:33

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of the horn of Africa has emerged the most devastating and dominant group 
of marathon runners the world has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation 
and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on 
the marathon. It appears to be happening again, a generation after Abebe Bikila 
ran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of 
his two Olympic golds. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic 
Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero. 
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen, a police lieutenant from Addis Ababa, made a furious rush with a mile 
to go, passing Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania and winning Monday's Boston Marathon in 
2 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds. Ikangaa was second in 2:09:56. It was only the 
second time an African has won here. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway easily won the women's race in 2:24:33 after 
abandoning her attempt to break 2:20. Kristiansen, the women's marathon world 
record-holder, started fast but slowed markedly on a hot day. With temperatures 
in the high 60s during the Patriot's Day race, it was about 20 degrees warmer 
than it was Sunday and all of last week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kristiansen finished 26th overall, believed to be the highest finish for 
a woman in this race. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset 
with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished 
ninth among the women in 2:37:52. It was the worst marathon performance of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon. In 
an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's 
Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have 
run her last marathon for some time. 
</P>
<P>
But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 
million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon 
running. 
</P>
<P>
In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons. In Rotterdam on 
Sunday, Belayneh Dinsamo won in 2:08:39. Dinsamo holds the world record of 
2:06:50, set last year on the same course. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2. 
Keleke Metaferia won in 2:10:28, and Dereje Nedi was second in 2:10:36. 
Ethiopia beat Italy for the World Cup team title with a second-string team. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen Ethiopian runners have been deployed around the world in this 
hectic two-week period of spring marathons. Two other Ethiopians were in 
Monday's Boston race, placing ninth and 18th. And still another, Wodajo Bulti, 
who has run 2:08:44, is one of the favorites in the London Marathon next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's legacy to the world in the last decade has been one of drought, 
famine and ethnic civil war. More than 1 million people died in 1984-85 during 
a drought-caused famine. The plight of Ethiopians caught the imagination of the 
world and inspired rock musicians and others to organize benefit concerts. 
Because of internal disturbances, however, little of that aid ever reached the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
Politically pro-Soviet, Ethiopia's Marxist government ordered boycotts of the 
Olympic Games in 1976, 1984 and 1988. Had they not boycotted, at least three 
Ethiopian runners would have been among the favorites in the men's marathon at 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its erratic participation, however, Ethiopia has a proud Olympic 
heritage, dating to 1956. 
</P>
<P>
One of the marathon's most enduring figures was Bikila, who won the marathon 
gold medal in 1960 and 1964. Ethiopia also took the marathon gold in 1968, when 
Mamo Wolde, 36, won at altitude in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
It is the altitude at which the Ethiopians train that enhances their aerobic 
capacity. Much of the central part of the country is mountainous, ranging in 
altitude from 6,000 to 15,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and 
Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it. He was among the pack of four African 
runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles. At about mile 16, 
Mekonnen and Ikangaa took off, running at first side by side, then with Ikangaa 
holding a slight lead. 
</P>
<P>
And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning 
last year's Tokyo Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I know him very well as a runner," Mekonnen said through an interpreter. "I 
knew that I should stay with him until the last (two miles). He's a good 
runner, but he does not have a good finish." 
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen and Kristiansen each earned $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
John Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third 
again in 2:10:24. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that they had gone out very hard," Treacy said of the blistering early 
pace. Until the halfway point, the men were on a 2:04 pace, dangerous in 
Monday's heat. 
</P>
<P>
The pace got the best of Saimon Robert Haali of Tanzania, who led the race for 
five miles. He finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The women's race had only one leader, Kristiansen. She, too, set an incredible 
early pace. For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running 
at a 2:17 pace. By the 17th mile, she had added more than 20 seconds to her 
mile splits. 
</P>
<P>
By her own reckoning, it was at almost 16 miles that Kristiansen felt the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to just win the race," she said. "It was too hot to set the world 
record." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson held on to second place and even ran comfortably until about 11 
miles, when she came undone. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't 
my problem today," Samuelson said. "I felt real easy the first 11 miles, I felt 
I was right in the groove. I was right where I wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came to Boston, I had a lot of problems with my hip and my back. At 
about 11 miles, it went very quickly. I lost my stride from that point. Lisa 
Weidenbach went flying by me at that point. Marguerite (Buist) went shortly 
thereafter. I kept thinking I'd pull it off. I didn't have the day I really 
wanted. I was duly humbled." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson, who had knee surgery in February, continued to fade as her stride 
faltered and was beaten by three U.S. runners. It had been at least eight years 
since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American. 
</P>
<P>
Buist, of New Zealand, was second in 2:29:04. Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., was 
third in 2:29:34. Weidenbach was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult to be beaten by Americans when you are the American 
champion," Kristiansen said. "The easiest way to be beaten is to drop out of a 
race. And she didn't. I think it's great that she finished." 
</P>
<P>
Such compliments did little to placate Samuelson. In the postrace news 
conference, the private Samuelson was as emotional as she has ever been in 
public. Her voice broke several times. 
</P>
<P>
"I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in 
me," she said. "A lot of people are expecting me to say this is it. It's not 
it. (But) I have been spending as much time in physical therapy as I have in 
training and I can't continue that. I think I need to take an indefinite rest. 
It could be a year, it could be five years. I just can't go on with my 
responsibilities as a wife and mother and spend this amount of time in physical 
therapy and training. I'll just take a break." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly 
decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races. She said she will 
run an eight-kilometer event next month in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone to know that it's still there," Samuelson said, tears welling 
in her eyes. "I will run again. I need to get beyond this problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

ANOTHER 9 ZEROS BY ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
MCCASKILL, HARVEY PUT WHITE SOX IN DEEP FREEZE, 3-0 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, it's true: The Angels have pitched back-to-back shutouts. No, hell hasn't 
frozen over, although Comiskey Park nearly did before reliever Bryan Harvey 
iced Kirk McCaskill's 3-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Amid extraordinary conditions -- temperatures dipped below 40 degrees and winds 
provided a mighty chill factor -- the Angels accomplished an extraordinary 
feat, matching Bert Blyleven's Sunday shutout with another on Monday to extend 
the pitching staff's scoreless streak to 24 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill himself is 3-0 with a scoreless streak of 17 1/3 innings. His 7 1/3 
innings against Chicago lowered his earned-run average to 0.44 -- best in the 
American League -- and dropped the Angels' team ERA to 2.66. 
</P>
<P>
This from the man who entered spring training with questions about his arm and 
finished it with an ERA of 6.49. 
</P>
<P>
This from a starting rotation that was assailed all off-season as being in dire 
need of rotating. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you figure?" Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "No way you could've 
handicapped this one. But, I'm certainly grateful." 
</P>
<P>
Three hours earlier, Rader shivered on the steps of the Angel dugout, hands 
jammed into the jacket that was covering another jacket, watching his breath 
form cold clouds as he wondered how the elements would affect McCaskill and his 
stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not good," Rader said, staring into the outfield. "You can quote me. 
This is not good." 
</P>
<P>
Seven innings later, McCaskill was still in the game, working on a four-hitter 
and protecting a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And the only thing stiffening up was the White Sox offense. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill got another out in the eighth inning before yielding successive 
singles to Eddie Williams and pinch-hitter Matt Merullo. Not willing to press 
his luck any further, Rader called on Harvey, the Angel bullpen closer who 
hadn't been given a game to close for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey faced five batters. He retired all five, striking out three, including 
the .321-hitting Dave Gallagher and the .354-hitting Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he was well-rested. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to get in games more often than that," Harvey said. "Five or six days 
is usually too long. But I ain't complaining. It's early. You've got to rest 
all you can." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was just glad for the chance to get out of the frigid Comiskey Park 
bullpen and warm his blood a little. 
</P>
<P>
"It was c-o-l-d," Harvey said. "My toes were numb from just sitting in the 
bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
It was cold enough to bring back postgame references to McCaskill's hockey 
days, the years he spent in the Winnipeg Jets' organization before scrapping 
the skates for a berth in the Angels' starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill provided his usual answers to the hockey questions -- "I made the 
right choice" -- and shrugged off the weather questions as any warm-blooded 
former skater from Ontario, Canada, might. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was all that cold," he said. "Of course, I'm the luckiest 
guy on the field. I get to move around, so I didn't feel it so much." 
</P>
<P>
And the back, which forced him out of his last start after six innings? 
</P>
<P>
It didn't stiffen until the eighth inning, said McCaskill, who didn't argue 
when Rader removed him again in mid-shutout. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made the right move," McCaskill said. "I was getting a little 
stiff. I wasn't throwing as well. I don't mind giving the ball to Bryan Harvey 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Until the eighth, McCaskill yielded only a single to Gallagher in the first 
inning, a single to Darryl Boston in the second, an infield single to Steve 
Lyons in the fifth and another single to Gallagher in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Given a 1-0 first-inning lead when Brian Downing reached base on an infield 
single and scored on a double by Devon White, McCaskill made it stand until the 
Angels added two insurance runs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill was asked to explain the difference between his pitching in March, in 
the desert heat, and now, in a Chicago ice box. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my problem in spring training was that I was pressing," McCaskill 
said. "I was pitching for a new manager, and every time I went out there, I 
wanted to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to re-arrange my thought process. I'm not trying to overpower people 
now, I just want to make them hit the ball at people." 
</P>
<P>
And the cold, if anything, lended an assist Monday night, according to 
McCaskill. 
</P>
<P>
"On a day like today, the pitcher has the advantage," he said. "If a pitcher 
throws strikes on a day like today, he doesn't have to be as fine. The ball 
doesn't carry as far." 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 17 1/3-inning scoreless streak for McCaskill -- not quite 
Hershiser territory, but nothing to, well, sneeze at. 
</P>
<P>
"That will end," McCaskill said of the streak. "I just hope I can ride the 
momentum as far as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, for the Angels' sake, they simply can't freeze the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly night, it wasn't Chili Davis' night. Errorless in left field for 
the first two weeks of the season, Davis saw that streak end in the third 
inning when he dropped a fly ball off the bat of Ozzie Guillen. Guillen reached 
second base on the play and advanced to third on an infield out, but he was 
stranded when Harold Baines lined to third. Davis also went 0 for 3, dropping 
his average to .205, but drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the ninth. . . 
. The back-to-back shutouts were the first for the Angels since June 13-14, 
1987, when Willie Fraser (complete game) and Don Sutton (with relief help) 
blanked the Kansas City Royals in consecutive games. . . . Catcher Lance 
Parrish tripled to score Wally Joyner in the ninth inning for the Angels' third 
run. It was the fifth triple for Parrish since 1984. "I don't like triples," he 
said with a grin, having recovered from the 270-foot sprint. "I'd just as soon 
hit the ball a little further and trot around the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray tested his left wrist with 20 minutes in the batting cage, swinging 
both right-handed and left-handed. Angel trainer Rick Smith called it "a real 
positive outing" but real progress will be made if Ray is able to taking 
batting practice again today. "We'll see how he continues to feel," Smith said. 
"With continued therapy, he could hit again (Tuesday)." . . . Shortstop update: 
Dick Schofield (strained chest muscle) is scheduled to be re-examined today in 
Inglewood by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. Schofield's backup, Glenn Hoffman, 
missed his third consecutive game with a bruised left forearm. Smith said 
Hoffman has had "a little problem getting the arm extended" while swinging the 
bat but could have played if necessary Monday.

PADRES FOLLOW BAD FORM IN 9-0 LOSS TO GIANTS 
</P>

Fly ball to deep center field. The Padres' best player chases it, chases it . . 
. and crashes into the wall while the ball bounces off the same wall a few feet 
away. The ball is now rolling across the outfield and the Padres' best player 
chases it, grabs it . . . and crashes onto his rear end. 
</P>
<P>
True story. And if this happened to Tony Gwynn Monday, you can guess what 
happened to the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
On this night of the strange and unusual, the only thing that followed recent 
form was that the Padres once again were walloped into embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
This time the victor was the West Division-leading San Francisco Giants, who 
defeated the Padres, 9-0, in front of a paid crowd of 12,161 at Candlestick 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
And Gwynn's third-inning gaffe that gave Kevin Mitchell a triple was only one 
of three of his ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
Before going into details, let's first put this into warped perspective: 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have now gone 20 innings without a run. They have gone 25 innings 
without an extra-base hit. Their last 18 hits have all been singles. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, they've also lost three in a row, which makes tonight's game here sort 
of a measuring stick. Only once last year under Manager Jack McKeon did the 
Padres lose more than three in a row. And that time, they lost just four in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew the formula for that," McKeon said when asked about resurrecting 
his motivation techniques. "When I took over last year, we had already played 
60 games. This year, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps McKeon means that in this young season the Padres have yet to 
understand how bad it feels to play badly, which is the best motivation of all. 
But trust them, they are learning. Fast. 
</P>
<P>
Take Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Stupid, stupid night," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The shenanigans didn't all belong to him, and in fact, even included several 
Giants. But let's start with the guy who started it all, Dennis Rasmussen, 
Padre starting pitcher. Rasmussen, who will celebrate his birthday today, 
pitched like that birthday will be his 50th. 
</P>
<P>
His first four pitches of the game all avoided the strike zone. No sooner did 
Brett Butler reach first base with a walk than Robby Thompson singled to left. 
And no sooner did that happen than Will Clark singled to left to score the 
other two guys. 
</P>
<P>
Three batters, two runs, game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asking for trouble when I walked Butler, and after that, everything went 
wrong," said Rasmussen, 30 today, who lasted just four innings but had a game's 
worth of problems, allowing seven runs on 10 hits. He allowed the Giants to 
score at least one run in each of his innings, and then they scored in each of 
reliever Mark Grant's two innings. 
</P>
<P>
In his last nine innings covering two starts, Rasmussen has allowed 10 runs and 
18 hits in just nine innings, giving him a 6.35 ERA to go with his 1-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
And the first inning wasn't even his worst. Not counting slo-pitch softball, 
when is the last time you've seen five straight balls hit to center field? It 
happened to Rasmussen in the third, and then, for good measure, two of the 
first three batters in the fourth also hit shots to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Giants were locked in on him or anything . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They have been feeling comfortable at the plate, and I should have done 
something about it, but I didn't," Rasmussen said. "I should have pitched 
inside more, gotten them off the plate. You have to let them know that the 
inside part is yours. I didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen's counterpart, Scott Garrelts, was in equally unusual territory. He 
threw his first complete game since 1986, and only the second shutout in his 
five-year career. Part of the reason for those low numbers is that in the past 
he's also worked as a reliever. But another good reason, these are the 
stumbling Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for us to play our game offensively when we get behind so fast," 
McKeon said. "Some of our guys were finally making good contact tonight (John 
Kruk had his second hit of the year, while Benito Santiago and Jack Clark each 
had a hit) but we couldn't string anything together, and that's hard when you 
are always trying to come back." 
</P>
<P>
And it's hard when your defense prevents any comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Gwynn, the two-time Gold Glove outfielder allowed a Mitchell drive to the 
wall to become a triple in the third inning when he misplayed it off the wall 
and then slipped and fell. An inning later he misplayed another fly by Clark, 
losing the ball and crashing to the wall and watching Clark triple, this time 
driving in a run. 
</P>
<P>
And then two batters after the Clark drive, Gwynn let a Candy Maldonado 
grounder get under his glove for an error while another run scored on the hit. 
"Just a typical night at Candlestick," Gwynn said, who finally was removed in 
the seventh inning. "It was tough soil, I could never get my footing, it was a 
night of slipping and sliding and crashing everywhere. I misplayed this, I lost 
that, I could never get my feet." 
</P>
<P>
The game wound down with both a light and a sentimental moment, both 
appropriate. Giants' catcher Kirt Manwaring set some sort of record in the 
sixth inning when he was hit twice in three pitches. First, Grant plopped him 
on the shoulder and sent him to first base. One pitch later, Santiago threw to 
first for a pickoff and hit a diving Manwaring in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't even feel those until tomorrow," Manwaring said bravely. "They can't 
get me down." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the game ended with Chris Speier making a running catch of a pop foul 
down the first-base line. Speier was playing first base for the second time in 
his 19-year career. Like everybody said this spring, this is the year teams 
will finally be taking the Padres seriously. Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, besides needing a right-handed stopper in the bullpen, could use a 
right-handed hitter off the bench. Thus, the bosses watched the waiver wire 
with interest Monday when the name Gary Ward showed up. Outfielder Ward was 
dropped by the New York Yankees this weekend after hitting .294 with no homers 
and one RBI in eight games. After spending a week on waivers, if nobody picks 
him up, he becomes a free agent and can be signed and paid just the major 
league minimum $68,000 with the Yankees forced to pick up the rest of his 
$675,000 contract. Ward, 35, entered this season with a career .279 batting 
mark and an average of 11 homers and 52 RBIs a season over 10 years with 
Minnesota, Texas and most recently the Yankees. Padre Manager Jack McKeon liked 
Ward when he played for Minnesota from 1979-83. In 1982, Ward hit 28 homers 
with 91 RBIs, then 19 homers with 88 RBIs the following year. . . . The Padres 
also could fill their need for a right-handed hitter by bringing up outfielder 
Gerald Clark from triple-A Las Vegas if pitcher Greg Harris is disabled with 
his sore left rib cage. The rookie pitcher was told Sunday that he would 
probably be put on the disabled list, but then Monday he told one Padre coach 
that he felt fine, and another coach that he was 85%. The Padres now believe 
that he might be confusing injury for pain, the kind of pain which most 
pitchers must live with daily. They don't want to put him on the disabled list 
until they are certain he cannot pitch with the soreness. McKeon will likely 
talk with Harris today, and if McKeon is convinced Harris can pitch, he will 
work him into a game beginning Friday, when the Padres visit Atlanta. He won't 
throw him into San Francisco's cold weather, lest he have a repeat of Harris' 
one-batter outing Saturday against Cincinnati, when he walked Eric Davis and 
then walked off the field in pain. "Right now we'll just wait," McKeon said. 
Said Harris: "I don't know what's going on. I feel about the same as I've 
always felt."

SCOTT OSTLER: UPDATE ON MARY BEA PORTER SINCE HEROICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be nice to report that Mary Bea Porter, since saving a boy's life 13 
months ago, has become a terror on the LPGA tour, that her tee shots are 
carried by angels and her putts fall like rain. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. Porter is still struggling along, fighting to qualify for tournaments 
and scuffling to cash an occasional check. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the business of being a heroine has not been disappointing. 
The role becomes Mary Bea, and vice versa. Her story makes people feel good, 
and that makes Mary Bea feel good. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still unbelievable," she says of life since the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't remember the original good deed, it went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Porter is playing the 13th hole of the Moon Valley Country Club in Phoenix, 
trying to qualify for the weekend tour event. She butchers her approach shot, 
knocking it into a gully near a fence. Approaching the fence, Mary Bea sees a 
man in Amish garb, standing next to a swimming pool, holding a 3-year-old boy 
by the ankles and shaking him. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Jonathan Smucker, has just been found floating in the pool, 
unconscious. His mother and father, Amish farmers from Pennsylvania, have no 
idea what to do. They don't even know how to dial a phone. With the help of her 
caddie, Mary Bea scrambles over the high fence. Smucker silently hands his son 
to Mary Bea and walks away. The boy is gray, not breathing, limp. 
</P>
<P>
Using mouth-to-mouth, and pounding the boy on the chest, Porter finally brings 
Jonathan back to life, then battles to keep him alive, although she has no 
first aid or CPR training. Forty-five minutes later, the boy is on his way to 
the hospital, and Mary Bea is rushing back to the course to catch up with her 
threesome, which has gone ahead without her. She bogeys the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
I phoned Mary Bea a few days after the rescue and she told me the whole story, 
which was almost as long and dramatic as the rescue itself. For several weeks 
after that, I would check the LPGA tournament results, expecting, or hoping, to 
see her name among the leaders. But Porter, who turns 40 in December and has 
been on the tour off and on since 1973, never appeared among the leaders, and 
seldom was among the also-also-rans. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to her? How did the rescue and subsequent publicity effect her 
life? What happened to little Jonathan? I phoned Mary Bea for an update. 
</P>
<P>
She said she finally got an opportunity to visit Jonathan and his family in 
Pennsylvania. Several months after the rescue, Porter learned that Mrs. Smucker 
was trying to contact her, so she eventually reached Mrs. Smucker by phone. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked," Mary Bea says. "She asked me if I knew how Jonathan got the bruise 
on his chest. I said, 'I slugged him.' I can remember holding back a little 
when I hit him, but I guess I still hit him pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
The Smuckers invited Porter to their farm, to meet Jonathan under more 
favorable circumstances. Porter brought her own 6-year-old son, Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
"When we drove up, little Jonathan was standing in a corner window sill, hiding 
behind a curtain," Mary Bea says. "He had just turned 4, and he's very shy. 
He's really a cute little boy. His sister had to half-carry him out to meet me, 
he's so shy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was wearing a new shirt that his mother had made him. It was tan, with long 
sleeves, and it had no buttons. They use straight pins instead of buttons. He 
was very proud of that shirt, they told me he had saved it to wear when I 
came." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan didn't talk much, but the visit was a very special family occasion. 
Mrs. Smucker prepared a picnic. Jonathan's grandmother was there, and his 
great-grandmother sent a gift. All seven of their children were there, 
including the four oldest, who have left the Amish church. The children gave 
Mary Bea presents -- a bracelet, earrings, a stuffed bunny rabbit . . . "It was 
one of the most relaxing days I've ever had," Porter says. "There are no phones 
there, no TV, no radio. It's so quiet it's eerie." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bea has mentioned how undemonstrative the family was at the time of the 
rescue. She assumed that was because of their Amish life style. I asked Porter 
if, during her visit, anyone in the family told her thanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in those words," she says. "But you could see it in their eyes. Their 
feelings came through clearly. They'd do anything for me. The four older 
children, the ones who are no longer in the church, were very emotional, they 
hugged me." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bea and Mrs. Smucker have had long talks. 
</P>
<P>
"They spent the night (of the rescue) in Children's Hospital in Phoenix," 
Porter says. "The boy in the next bed was brain dead, from drowning, and I 
think that caused her to realize how lucky they were. She told me they -- she 
and Mr. Smucker -- had given Jonathan back to the Lord when they saw him 
floating in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready to give him back. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me that the only side effect of the accident is that they live near a 
rural firehouse, and every time they hear a siren, Jonathan covers his ears and 
shuts his eyes. Also, he's a little quieter." 
</P>
<P>
The outside world has honored Porter. She was given the Golf Writers Assn. of 
America's Charlie Bartlett Award, "For unselfish contributions to the 
betterment of society." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Golf Writers of New York gave her a similar award and a 
singular honor. The next person deemed worthy by the Metro Writers will receive 
the Mary Bea Porter Humanitarian Award. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Porter's golf game didn't turn around when her life did. But she 
recently worked with a noted golf psychologist-coach, and she says the joy has 
returned to her game. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not be the best player in the world but I love what I do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend she worked as a TV commentator on the AI Star/Centinela tournament 
at Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
Porter is divorced, and last year she did the tour with Joseph, putting 45,000 
miles on their old car and struggling at each stop to make ends meet and to 
find child care while she played golf. 
</P>
<P>
But while playing in a charity pro-am tournament conducted by King Coach Robbie 
Ftorek, Porter met a businessman who offered to sponsor her on the tour. Now 
she flies from city to city, and travels with a baby sitter for her son. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bea says she will always keep in touch with Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm part of the family," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She also says she is thankful every day for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel like me," Porter says. "But obviously this has made a big impact 
on my life. I feel if I died tomorrow, I made a difference. I have different 
priorities on everything now. It has made me enjoy life a lot more. I'm more 
appreciative of my heath and my son's health. It's not that I'm special or 
anything, but when it's all over, when all the record books are closed, I still 
won." 
</P>
<P>
Last month Porter was back on the Moon Valley course for a qualifying round. 
When she got to the 13th tee, Mary Bea looked over at the gully and at the 
fence she had scrambled over so ungracefully a year before, and she smiled.

FRANCONA GETS TO RYAN AGAIN AS RANGERS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Francona isn't likely to make baseball's Hall of Fame, but lately he's 
been making life tough for someone who eventually will. 
</P>
<P>
Francona, who broke up Nolan Ryan's no-hit bid in the eighth inning last week, 
got three hits Monday night, two off Ryan, as the Milwaukee Brewers snapped the 
Texas Rangers' club-record eight-game winning streak with an 8-1 victory at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Bill Spiers contributed with a grand slam for his first major league 
home run as the Brewers won their fourth straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take hits off anybody," Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan on Francona: "He hasn't mastered me yet. He did hit a good pitch for a 
double tonight, but the second hit he got was a nubber." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan threw 104 pitches and lasted just five-plus innings, yielding three runs 
and seven hits, walking six and striking out three. In his previous start, Ryan 
retired the first 20 Milwaukee batters and went eight innings, allowing only 
the hit by Francona and striking out 15. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Bill Wegman scattered five hits in 7 2/3 innings before Dan 
Plesac came on for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, Toronto 2 -- Andy Hawkins pitched a five-hitter for his first AL 
victory and Roberto Kelly drove in four runs, three with a ninth-inning triple, 
as the Yankees beat the Blue Jays at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who signed a three-year, $3.6-million contract with the Yankees last 
December after six years with the San Diego Padres, walked three and struck out 
three. He started the game with a 15.00 earned-run average after yielding 20 
hits and 15 runs in nine innings in his two previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Yankees' first complete game of the season and their third victory 
in four games after a 1-7 start. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Brower homered for the Yankees, Fred McGriff for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Oakland 2 -- Henry Cotto hit his first two home runs of the season 
and rookie Erik Hanson held the Athletics to four hits through eight innings at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Cotto's two-run homer put Seattle ahead, 2-1, in the Mariners' four-run fourth 
inning, and he added a solo shot in the seventh. It was the first multiple-home 
run game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson walked two and struck out five through eight innings. Jerry Reed pitched 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Baltimore 4 -- Mike Greenwell hit a two-run homer as the Red Sox 
rallied for five runs in the eighth inning at Boston to beat the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles scored two runs in the ninth, but fell short in their bid to win 
consecutive games on the road for the first time since August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Burks led off the Boston eighth with a triple off Brian Holton, who 
replaced starter Jose Bautista at the start of the seventh. Greenwell then hit 
his fourth homer of the season, a 420-foot shot into the bleachers in 
right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rice followed with a single that extended his hitting streak to 11 games.

METS TURN ON POWER TO DOWN PHILLIES, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time this season the New York Mets looked like the Mets of 1988 
-- a club capable of winning with power. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets got consecutive third-inning home runs from Darryl Strawberry, Kevin 
McReynolds and Keith Hernandez Monday night, ending an offensive slump to beat 
the Philadelphia Phillies, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez left the game after five innings with a slight sprain of the right 
groin and is on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a last-place ballclub and there's no reason for us to play like 
one," Strawberry said. "It was just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets began the game with the worst record in the National League at 3-7 and 
had scored only 35 runs, fewest in the league. They had a team batting average 
of .223, and had only four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson criticized the team for its lackluster effort and banned 
the players from playing cards or golf on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry hit a pitch by Don Carman over the left-center field fence with one 
out in the third. It was his fourth home run of the season. McReynolds hit 
Carman's next pitch for his first home run and two pitches later Hernandez hit 
his first homer. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Fernandez won his first start of the season, allowing two runs on five hits 
in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Aase relieved with the bases loaded and two out in the sixth. He struck out 
pinch-hitter Curt Ford with three fastballs and Randy Myers took over in the 
ninth for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' Kevin Elster played his 71st consecutive game without an error at 
shortstop, one short of the major league record set by Eddie Brinkman of the 
Detroit Tigers in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, Chicago 1 -- Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer in the sixth 
inning at Montreal as the Expos ended the Cubs' seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gross pitched 6 2/3 innings and allowed nine hits for the victory. Tim 
Burke got the last three outs for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 9, San Diego 0 -- Converted reliever Scott Garrelts pitched a 
six-hitter, and Will Clark and Candy Maldonado each drove in three runs as the 
Giants beat the Padres in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have lost five of their last six games, were shut out, 5-0, 
Sunday by Rick Mahler and the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Ozzie Smith's run-scoring double sparked a 
three-run eighth inning at St. Louis, leading the Cardinals past the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals managed four doubles off reliever Brian Fisher to break a 1-1 tie 
in the eighth.

CATCHING FIRE, SUNS WIN BY 55 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the only thing that could worry the Phoenix Suns at this point is that 
they might be peaking too soon. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to catch the Lakers for the National Basketball Assn.'s 
Pacific Division lead and home-court advantage in the playoffs, the Suns on 
Monday won their eighth straight game, routing the Sacramento Kings at Phoenix, 
140-85. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns trail the defending champion Lakers by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson scored 21 of his 24 points in a lopsided second period as the 
Suns scored the biggest victory margin in the NBA this season and improved to 
28-0 at home against Western Conference competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns were coming off a 137-91 home victory Saturday night against the San 
Antonio Spurs -- their most one-sided victory ever before Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-point loss was the second-worst in the Kings' 41-year NBA history, 
behind a 140-82 defeat at Milwaukee on Dec. 15, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers finished with 20 points, Armon Gilliam had 19, and Kevin Johnson 
scored 17 points and added 15 assists for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 104, New York 100 -- Michael Jordan scored 20 points in the fourth 
quarter as the Bulls ended a six-game losing streak by defeating the Knicks at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who finished with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists, took charge 
from his point guard position after the Knicks scored 17 consecutive points, 
wiping out a 10-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls entered the final quarter trailing, 75-70, but Jordan scored 13 of 
Chicago's final 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
A steal and layup by Jordan put Chicago ahead, 92-89, with four minutes left, 
and his dunk with 2:27 remaining gave the Bulls a five-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 113, Charlotte 108 -- Robert Parish scored 21 points and got 22 rebounds 
at Charlotte as the Celtics defeated the Hornets in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Shaw hit three free throws in the final 22 seconds of the extra period to 
seal the victory, Boston's fifth straight over the Hornets. Shaw, who had 12 
rebounds, scored all five of his points from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 99, San Antonio 91 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 20 of his 26 points in the 
second half and paced a fourth-quarter rally as the Rockets beat the Spurs at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs extended their club-record road losing streak to 19 games, dropping 
their record away from home to 3-37. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, who also had 16 rebounds, helped extend San Antonio's overall losing 
streak to six as his basket with 5:37 left put the Rockets ahead to stay, 
84-82. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 116, Golden State 109 -- Reserve guard Sedale Threatt made two baskets 
and two free throws in the overtime period as the SuperSonics beat the Warriors 
at Oakland to move closer to clinching a home-court advantage in the first 
round of the playoffs.

MARATHON COVERAGE RUNS INTO TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SportsChannel America, covering its first marathon Monday, hit the wall early 
and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The coverage, carried in Los Angeles by Z Channel, illustrated: (a) Trying to 
televise a marathon is even tougher than running one, (b) SportsChannel didn't 
prepare properly, (c) Channel 13's work on the Los Angeles Marathon was 
tremendous by comparison, and (d) Bud Collins should stick to tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, host of the coverage, compared Ingrid Kristiansen to Bjorn Borg during 
the show. Of course. Two peas in a pod. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said Kristiansen was as unemotional as Borg, who was known for his 
poise on a tennis court. But you had to wonder, how would Collins know? Tennis 
is his sport, not running. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong with having a non-running person around to curb all the running 
lingo, or poke fun at it. Collins pointed out that PR means personal record, 
which probably all viewers didn't know. And he made up his own lingo -- PB for 
personal barrier, which was OK. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, Collins struggled with this assignment. 
</P>
<P>
At least he was better than the woman who sat next to him, Barbara Bickford, 
the wife of 10,000-meter runner Bruce Bickford. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Collins asked her if Kristiansen still had a shot at a world 
record. Bickford said no. 
</P>
<P>
Collins: "So what about the Boston Marathon women's record? What is that 
record?" 
</P>
<P>
From Bickford came silence. Not, "Just a second and I'll check." Simply 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
Collins didn't let her off the hook, though. He asked again, and someone 
finally gave her the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Collins asked about the record again as Kristiansen approached the finish line. 
Viewers could see the clock read 2:24 and change. The record is 2:24:30, set 
last year by Rosa Mota. 
</P>
<P>
It was going to be close. So what did Bickford say? Something about the splits 
indicating she wouldn't get the record. Forget the splits. Just look at the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen's time: 2:24:33. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Collins noted that barriers along the course gave Kristiansen two 
lanes to run in. "The crowd is not suffocating her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bickford's observation: "The only thing that is suffocating her is the crowd 
noise." Say what? 
</P>
<P>
Craig Virgin was the other prominent commentator, while Bill Rodgers, Mr. 
Boston Marathon, was on hand but didn't get much air time. And Larry Rawson, a 
competent running announcer, was reduced to holding a microphone that sometimes 
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
For the first post-race interview, Collins said: "Now we go to Larry Rawson 
with the men's winner." 
</P>
<P>
Rawson was then shown with Ibrahim Hussein, the fourth-place finisher who won 
last year. Oh well, close. Rawson conducted the interview, but the words came 
over so muddled they were barely discernable. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Rawson did get to the winner, Abebe Mekonnen. This time, nothing. The 
audio problems had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to televise a marathon," Collins explained. 
</P>
<P>
No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel also had all kinds of technical problems with the pictures, which 
kept breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
And the camera work was shabby. When winner Mekonnen finally started to pull 
away from Juma Ikangaa, the runner-up, at the 24-mile mark, the one dramatic 
moment in the race, the cameras left the two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that Sports- Channel is not experienced in televising 
marathons, which, obviously, is a difficult task. So, as Channel 13 has done 
each year with the L.A. Marathon, perhaps SportsChannel will learn from some of 
its mistakes and come back stronger next year. At least, let's hope so.

CSUN TO SIGN CERRITOS' HUMPHREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eugene Humphrey, a 6-0 guard who helped Cerritos College to the state junior 
college basketball championship, said Monday that he will sign a letter of 
intent with Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey averaged 12.5 points and four assists for Cerritos, which finished the 
season with a 31-4 record. He converted 51% of his field-goal attempts and made 
46% from three-point range. He shot 80% from the free-throw line and played 
both point-guard and off-guard positions. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN baseball team has signed Tustin pitcher Monte Jones, a 6-1, 175-pound 
right-hander who leads Orange County in strikeouts with 77 in 45 innings 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge softball team has signed Simi Valley's Denise Swank, a third 
baseman who has been an all-Marmonte League selection three times and was last 
season's team MVP for the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Signing with the women's basketball program is Haily Griffith, a 6-1 forward 
who led Eureka High to a 24-4 record last season. MIKE HISERMAN

Lakewood High School Coach Walter (Spud) O'Neil has a problem when it comes to 
finding a weakness on his Lancer baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers are 15-2 overall and tied for first with a 6-1 record with Long 
Beach Millikan in the tough Moore League. Having opened the season by winning 
the 32-team Loara tournament, the Lancers made their claim as one of the top 
teams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The first area O'Neil does not have to worry about is offense. Despite a recent 
slump, the Lancers are hitting better than .375. Among the top hitters is 
senior shortstop Chris Gomez, at .400. 
</P>
<P>
"He is definitely our best player in the eyes of the scouts," said O'Neil, who 
inherited his nickname from his father. "He is the best defensive shortstop in 
the area, with a strong arm and great glove." 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Guiterrez, who plays third base, is also an outstanding hitter. He is 
averaging about .400 and has batted in more than 20 runs, even though he bats 
leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
At second base is Shawn Hardy, who is batting better than .500 and leads the 
team in stolen bases with 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Our infield has just been great," said O'Neil, who is in his sixth season at 
Lakewood after coaching at Colton. "Every player is hitting over .400 for the 
year and they have all had their share of big hitting games." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil also does not have to worry about his infield's defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we have averaged one error or less a game," O'Neil said. 
"(Guiterrez) has not made an error all season." 
</P>
<P>
To complement their strong offense and defense, the Lancers also have quality 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Proffitt, a right-handed senior, leads the way with a 7-0 record. 
Sophomore Dave Reeser, a lefty with a 6-1 mark, is the Lancers' other key 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Chris Miller, a junior right-hander, and Richard Lovan, a senior 
lefty, have three saves each. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching has been a pleasant surprise," O'Neil said. "We have four 
outstanding pitchers who lead a staff that has an earned-run average below 
1.5." 
</P>
<P>
With the Southern Section playoffs approaching, O'Neil is looking for the 
Lancers to get hot at the right moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal at the start of the season was to make the playoffs," he said. "After 
we won the Loara tournament, we started thinking about how good we really are. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have to keep up our intensity and be hot at the end of the 
season in order to win it all." 
</P>
<P>
At Culver City High School, center fielder Todd Steverson has received most of 
the attention on the Centaur baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Steverson signed a letter of intent with Arizona State last week, and is 
expected to be drafted in the first round of baseball's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
However, Culver City has been more than Steverson this season, as the Centaurs 
are in first place in the Ocean League with a 6-0 record, 12-4 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very good team, all-around," Coach Dave Ruebsamen said. "Our only 
weakness is our lack of depth in our pitching." 
</P>
<P>
A major surprise for the Centaurs has been the emergence of pitcher John Wade, 
who leads the team with a 6-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Wade has really come into his own this season," Ruebsamen said. "Nothing 
indicated that he would have a season like this. He has worked hard and gained 
the confidence needed to become an outstanding pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Wade, 3-0 in league play, throws strikes with both his fastball and his 
breaking ball. He pitched a six-hit shutout over Redondo last week, striking 
out 10 and walking only one. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season started, I knew we would have a good hitting and a 
questionable pitching team," Ruebsamen said. "But with the development of Wade, 
I am pleased with our pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Wade's performance this season may have been unexpected but Steverson's wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd just has that God-given ability that makes him special," Ruebsamen said 
about the 6-foot-2, 190-pound Steverson. "He has outstanding speed, a great 
arm, hits for power and average." 
</P>
<P>
Steverson has put up some outstanding statistics. In six league games, he has 
batted .412 with two home runs and 12 runs batted in, and leads the team with 
five stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Ruebsamen has also been fortunate to have three other star players. 
</P>
<P>
Senior second baseman Lamarr Rogers, is batting .409 in league, is a fast 
leadoff hitter who has attracted scouts with his fielding ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Lamarr has tremendous speed with great hands," Ruebsamen said. "He is the 
ideal leadoff hitter because he is such a good contact hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mitchell is Culver City's power hitter. In league play, the left-handed 
first baseman is batting .444 with three home runs and 11 runs batted in. He 
has hit 21 home runs in his prep career. 
</P>
<P>
Junior outfielder Mauricio Estavil is batting .583, with 10 runs batted in, and 
has a .958 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"Those four players have really pounded the ball this season," Ruebsamen said. 
"The key for us is to be consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Playa del Rey St. Bernard's baseball team set a Southern Section record for the 
most consecutive league wins with a 6-4 victory over Serra for its 35th 
straight Camino Real League win. St. Bernard, which last lost to Cantwell in 
1986, broke the record of 34 set by Lakewood of the Moore League from 1973-76. 
The Vikings' streak ended Saturday when they lost to El Segundo, 9-6.

BABY BOOMER LOYALTY HELPS KEEP UBIQUITOUS MUSTANG GOING STRONG

<TEXT>
<P>
Monday was yet another watershed day in baby boomer history, a day sure to make 
every member of the Davy Crockett set feel ever so old. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang turned 25. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most influential and successful American car of the post-War era -- 
with more than six million sold worldwide -- the Mustang is still going strong. 
It remains today the best-selling car in its class. 
</P>
<P>
So on Monday, Ford officials gathered in the ancient assembly plant here that 
turned out the first Mustangs in April, 1964 -- and which continues to stamp 
them out today -- to celebrate a car that has become a cultural icon for a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
To the strains of the '60s classic, "Mustang Sally," Ford executives, led by 
chief designer Jack Telnack, rode through the Dearborn assembly plant in 
mint-condition early Mustangs. Later Telnack and other Mustang watchers talked 
about the impact the original "pony car" has had on Ford, and on America's car 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great statement of American design and of American ingenuity," 
Telnack says. "From day one the Mustang has created a wave of excitement few 
other cars can match." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Mustang -- introduced at the New York World's Fair on April 17, 
1964 -- has become one of the most beloved cars in American history, argues 
Michael Marsden, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State 
University in Ohio, who has worked with Ford on researching the car's history. 
</P>
<P>
Marsden says only three other cars -- the Volkswagen Bug, the Chevrolet 
Corvette and the Model T Ford -- have evoked the same kinds of deep emotional 
attachments from American car buyers as that first evoked by the Mustang in the 
spring of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang became such a cultural phenomenon partly because of its timing; it 
was the first car designed specifically for the baby boomer generation. With a 
base price of just $2,368 at the time of its introduction, the Mustang 
virtually created a market for sporty cars that teen-agers and college kids 
could afford. It was the first pony car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a car that came along at the right time and for the right people," 
Marsden says. "The first baby boomers were just turning 17 and 18 and were 
entering the car market. Ford recognized the demographic trends and came 
forward with a car that combined all the qualities they wanted. It was sporty, 
yet it had the luxuries their parents' cars had, and it was affordable. It 
created a whole new class of cars." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that it was really just a derivative of the old Ford Falcon -- 
with better-looking sheet metal -- the Mustang was an overnight success; right 
after its introduction, buyers lined up in showrooms all across America to see 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the Mustang became more than just another successful new product; like 
the VW Bug, it became a symbol of youthful freedom for a generation. So much so 
that its prime champion inside Ford -- one Lido Anthony Iacocca -- quickly 
found himself on the cover of Time Magazine and on the path to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying Power 
</P>
<P>
Yet perhaps the Mustang's most remarkable achievement has been its staying 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ford hasn't redesigned the car in a decade, it is still the 
best-selling sports car on the market, outpacing 30 other imported and domestic 
models in what analysts call the small specialty segment of the car market. In 
fact, with sales of 170,080 in 1988, the Mustang outsells the Pontiac Firebird 
and the Chevrolet Camaro -- two other 60s holdovers -- combined. 
</P>
<P>
The Dearborn gathering Monday was one of several events held across the nation 
commemorating the Mustang. In Southern California, Mustang enthusiasts 
participated Sunday in a "Fabulous Fords Forever" car reunion at Knott's Berry 
Farm in Buena Park. Among those present was Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen, 
who was a member of the original product planning team that brought the vehicle 
to market. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been more surprised by the Mustang's continued success than Ford 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ford has repeatedly planned to kill it off. 
</P>
<P>
Ford executives, sure that the Mustang's dated, rear-wheel-drive design 
couldn't compete with the newer and fancier imports, have officially scheduled 
the Mustang's demise several times. The car has frequently been dropped from 
the company's internal product "cycle plan," Ford's master schedule of its new 
car development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was certain, for example, that its new Probe, a front-wheel-drive 
performance car built for Ford by Mazda in its U.S. plant, would kill off the 
market for the Mustang. As a result, Ford planned to cancel the current Mustang 
and put its name on the Probe instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intense Loyalty 
</P>
<P>
But Ford hadn't reckoned on the intense loyalty of Mustang owners and buyers. 
Aging baby boomers seeking to recapture their youthful glory have kept Mustang 
sales so strong in recent years that Ford officials have been forced not only 
to keep the car in the lineup, but to invest $200 million to modernize Ford's 
Mustang production line here in Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ford officials say, the Mustang is likely to stay in the Ford lineup at 
least through the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Marsden of Bowling Green is sure the Mustang won't vanish anytime soon, at 
least not as long as there are baby boomers with enough money to buy a piece of 
their youth. After all, the Mustang's passing would be a sign of their own 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a car they grew up with," Marsden says. "Now they are in middle age, 
and they are buying it again. They aren't going to let it die."

CONTROL DATA IS GETTING OUT OF SUPERCOMPUTERS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE TO HURT U.S. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH JAPANESE; 3,100 JOBS WILL BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move viewed as an embarrassing blow to U.S. technological strength, 
financially ailing Control Data Corp. on Monday announced that it is closing 
its supercomputer business and cutting 3,100 jobs overall from its work force. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the loss of ETA Systems, the Control Data subsidiary that is the 
nation's No. 2 supercomputer maker, would, over time, hurt U.S. efforts to stay 
ahead of Japanese competitors and remain the world's dominant supplier of 
supercomputers. With the departure of ETA from the business, only one U.S. 
company, Cray Research, is producing supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
"This won't immediately result in the sale of another Japanese supercomputer, 
but it will provide another argument for customers who are already angling to 
'buy Japanese,' " said Chris Willard, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose 
technology market research firm. "It shows the world that another U.S. company 
didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
ETA Systems will account for 800 of Control Data's 3,100 layoffs. The rest of 
the cutbacks will come at its other computer equipment divisions. About half of 
the 3,100 people being laid off work in the Minneapolis area, where Control 
Data is based, and the others are scattered across the country. The company 
makes everything from mainframe computers to computer storage devices to 
electronic lottery equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Uses 
</P>
<P>
About 410 supercomputers have been installed worldwide, not counting the 
supercomputers used by manufacturers of the machines themselves. They are used 
for such complex technical tasks as developing weapons systems, designing 
advanced aircraft and breaking secret codes. They also are used to simulate and 
calculate such things as the flow of air over an aircraft wing or the 
interaction of volatile chemicals, along with other processes that require more 
computer processing speed than other types of computers can provide. 
</P>
<P>
The market for these machines, which first appeared less than a decade ago, 
once was thought to be vast, but analysts say growth has been slower than 
anticipated. For example, Cray Research, which controls about two-thirds of the 
worldwide market, has seen its sales growth slow from a red-hot 66% in 1985 to 
just 10% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If the market had been more robust, perhaps Control Data could have made it," 
said Patricia Laupheimer, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Laupheimer said the "easy sales" of supercomputers to the government, 
universities and aerospace companies have already been made. "Now the 
supercomputer makers need to get into new markets, and it will be harder and 
the initial purchases won't be as large," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dataquest, which had at one time forecast a 25% annual growth rate for 
supercomputer sales, has revised the projection downward to less than 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Control Data, which had been making supercomputers -- and losing money on them 
-- since 1983, cited its ongoing financial problems for closing the business. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Control Data was under severe pressure from its lenders to stem 
its continuing losses, which have amounted to more than $800 million since 
1985. One analyst said ETA Systems, whose total losses since 1983 exceed $350 
million, was viewed as the most logical target for the cost cutters. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its streamlining moves would result in a one-time charge of 
$490 million, including $350 million from liquidation of ETA Systems. The 
company said most of the restructuring costs will be charged against earnings 
in the second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
A Control Data spokesman said after months of studying its choices for ETA 
Systems, the company decided it could no longer "afford to continue product 
development across such a wide section of products." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neglected Software 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Control Data attempted to sell ETA Systems, spokesman Frank Ryan said: 
"We looked at all options. The shutdown was the most practical." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said ETA Systems had never developed a reputation as a strong player 
in the supercomputer business, largely because it focused too much on building 
the machines and neglected the all-important software that customers needed to 
operate the powerful systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The market wants a solution but ETA was delivering fast boxes," said Gary 
Smaby, an analyst analyst with the Needham &amp; Co. brokerage firm in 
Minneapolis. "That's a whole lot like building a racing yacht with only one 
sail." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a likely beneficiary of Control Data's pullout is International 
Business Machines, which is actively developing its first supercomputer 
technology. The computer giant is backing the efforts of supercomputer designer 
Steve Chen's new venture, Scientific Systems Inc., to build an advanced 
supercomputer and has other projects in the works as well. 
</P>
<P>
Smaby said without Control Data, the U.S. government, which has been a major 
customer for supercomputers, for the time being no longer has a domestic second 
source for its purchases, a position that IBM could fill as soon as its 
products are ready for market. 
</P>
<P>
Control Data stock closed at $21.50, off 87.5 cents a share, in active trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The company's chairman, Robert Price, said the restructuring would allow the 
company to operate profitably for the remainder of the year and should set the 
stage for sustained future growth. 
</P>
<P>

JUSTICE DEPT. STARTS A CRIMINAL PROBE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL and MARIA L. LA GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an escalating battle between regulators and American Continental Corp., the 
nation's top savings and loan regulator said Monday that his office has 
referred criminal allegations involving the management of American's Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. lashed 
out at regulators who seized Lincoln on Friday, charging that "malicious 
bureaucrats" were out to destroy his company and threatening to fight the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in court. 
</P>
<P>
Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall, in a telephone interview from Washington, 
said several complaints involving the management of Lincoln have been referred 
to the Justice Department for investigation. He said the inquiry also could 
involve American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Wall declined to be specific about the types of potentially criminal activities 
the bank board had referred to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
He did say, however, that the bank board's most recent audit of both Lincoln 
and American Continental turned up evidence of assets being shifted from the 
S&amp;L to the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Wall also said bank board personnel believe possibly critical documents 
pertaining to the S&amp;L's activities were ordered destroyed by the thrift's 
management just before American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen those comments," said Mark M. Connally, spokesman for 
American Continental. "Until there's actually something factual presented by 
Mr. Wall to back up the allegations, there is no way we can adequately and 
properly respond." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$70 Million Withdrawn 
</P>
<P>
American Continental and 11 subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 
Thursday. Regulators seized control of Lincoln the following day. The seizure, 
coupled with the bankruptcy, prompted depositors to withdraw nearly $70 million 
from the thrift's 29 Southern California branches on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, however, federal regulators who are operating Lincoln under a 
conservatorship said that the pattern of heavy withdrawals by panicked or 
confused customers had died down. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Phoenix, Keating accused regulators of engaging in a 
politically motivated campaign to destroy Lincoln Savings and American 
Continental. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Feuds 
</P>
<P>
Keating said Lincoln "may well become the first thrift to defend itself to the 
full extent . . . if need be to challenge in court those who would destroy us, 
and (to) call for a full federal investigation of the abusive power by one or 
more regulatory offices." 
</P>
<P>
Keating bought Lincoln in 1984 and has since been involved in a number of feuds 
with S&amp;L regulators. The battles generally have centered on his practice of 
involving the S&amp;L in commercial real estate and development rather than 
sticking to more traditional single-family home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Keating declined to answer questions at the news conference, choosing instead 
to appeal to the citizens of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Visibly upset and hands shaking as he stared into the television cameras, 
Keating warned that federal savings and loan regulators would destroy the 
Arizona economy if they succeeded in pulling down Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental claims to directly employ 2,300 people with a payroll of 
over $70 million in Arizona and to generate countless other projects around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In its bankruptcy filing, American Continental and the 11 subsidiaries listed 
$3 billion in debt and $3.85 billion in assets in its Chapter 11 petition.

Crude Oil Prices Surge: After hovering near Friday's close for most of the day, 
oil prices rallied in late afternoon trading, following strong gains in 
gasoline prices ahead of the summer driving season. West Texas Intermediate, 
the benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 53 cents at $21.22 a barrel for May 
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. May gasoline contracts firmed 
2.06 cents to 72.08 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile. May heating oil 
was up 0.85 of a cent to 53.76 cents a gallon. "There are worries of 
longer-term supply problems going into the summer driving season," said one 
trader.

HOME DEALS IN LIMBO AFTER STATE SEIZES ENCINO ESCROW OFFICES

When David Fein completed the sale of his Woodland Hills house March 17, he had 
no reason to think that anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Fein went to the Escrow Shoppe, an Encino firm that handled his 
sale's escrow. He signed the deed of his house over to the buyers, picked up a 
five-figure check written by the Escrow Shoppe -- his proceeds from the sale -- 
and three days later deposited the check in his bank. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Fein went to his bank's automated teller machine to withdraw 
cash. But the ATM, instead of showing that he had thousands of dollars in his 
account, showed a negative balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Naively, I didn't feel that badly," recalled Fein, who thought that it was a 
computer glitch. "I knew it would probably be cleared up in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. On the day he deposited his check, March 20, the state Department 
of Corporations froze all of the Escrow Shoppe's funds because the agency was 
seizing the firm for allegedly making $3 million in unauthorized payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No House, No Money 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks later, Fein still does not have his money, and now he is very upset. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am in the most incredible situation of having sold a house, turned over 
the deed . . . and I sit without any proceeds from the sale," said Fein, a 
52-year-old television producer. "It's a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
And not just for Fein. The Escrow Shoppe had 300 to 400 accounts when it was 
seized, and $5 million in customers' money was frozen, said Judy L. Hartley, a 
senior lawyer at the Department of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms. 
</P>
<P>
The department has tried to sort out the Escrow Shoppe mess as quickly as 
possible but, until its investigation is completed, "we will not release any 
funds," Hartley said. When will that be? Hartley said she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Warden, a lawyer for the Escrow Shoppe and its owner, Sandra Bianco, 
denied the state's allegations and said no money is missing from the firm. 
Bianco could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Escrow Shoppe customers are not only out thousands of dollars they 
had counted on, their housing plans have been thrown into chaos. The Escrow 
Shoppe stopped doing business and abandoned its office just as the state seized 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers are angry that neither state officials nor anyone else will tell 
them when they can expect to get their money and that they have not even been 
kept abreast of the investigation. Calls to the Department of Corporations, 
their real estate brokers and others usually yield no information, they 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting a Runaround 
</P>
<P>
"It's peoples' life savings, and they're toying around with it like it means 
nothing," said Alan Bloom, 26, whose sale of a Canoga Park condominium 
collapsed with the Escrow Shoppe. "They're giving people the total runaround." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers of real estate use escrow companies to ensure that certain 
conditions are met -- that a property title search has been conducted, for 
example -- before a sale is made final. The escrow firms also hold and transfer 
any payments between the parties until then. Frequently, each party is required 
to make a "good-faith" deposit of a few thousand dollars simply to open escrow. 
</P>
<P>
People often do not have a particular escrow firm that they want to use, so 
they look to their broker to pick one. But the Escrow Shoppe case illustrates 
how people should not hesitate to investigate which escrow firm they are using, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Question the Broker' 
</P>
<P>
Customers "should question the broker where they're going to take the escrow," 
said Ed Moore, president of Townsgate Escrow in Thousand Oaks. "How long have 
they been in business? Are they in good stead with the Department of 
Corporations?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet even that advice might not have helped Escrow Shoppe customers. Both Fein 
and Bloom said they were referred to the Escrow Shoppe by their brokers, both 
of whom work for Mike Glickman Realty, a major broker in the San Fernando 
Valley. Michael Pennell, Glickman's chief operating officer, said Glickman had 
no warning before the Escrow Shoppe was seized that it was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, some customers' frustration has boiled over. After the Escrow 
Shoppe was seized, Townsgate Escrow -- at the request of the state -- took over 
many of the Escrow Shoppe's pending escrows. Within days, Moore said he and 
some of his employees received death threats from people demanding that their 
money be unfrozen immediately. Townsgate's office also got a bomb threat, 
forcing the building to be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Required 
</P>
<P>
State investigators believe that the Escrow Shoppe made unauthorized payments 
totaling $3 million and that more than $200,000 might simply be missing, 
Hartley said. Among other things, the Escrow Shoppe was transferring money from 
some escrows that were pending in order to pay customers closing other escrows, 
Hartley alleged. That alleged shuffling between accounts was not authorized by 
the Escrow Shoppe's customers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Licensed escrow firms are required to have insurance by joining Escrow Agents 
Fidelity Corp., a self-insurance group for the industry. EAFC usually will 
cover any shortfall in customers' accounts caused by embezzlement or other 
wrongdoing by the escrow firm involved, Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, EAFC, which is "working right alongside" state officials in 
their investigation, is also withholding any payments until the probe is 
completed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odd Circumstances 
</P>
<P>
And the investigation has been slowed by some odd circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
A recent fire at the Department of Corporations' downtown Los Angeles offices 
has forced department lawyers to work at home. Further, the state needs records 
from another entity that was also owned by Bianco. 
</P>
<P>
Could their real estate agents have helped? Bloom said he was first alerted to 
the problem by his Glickman agent. But after Fein found out on his own that his 
check was frozen, he said his Glickman agent told him that she had learned 
about the problem a couple of days earlier but "didn't call me because she had 
hoped my check would clear." 
</P>
<P>
"That was outrageous that nobody from the Glickman company would call us," Fein 
said. "It has gotten so preposterous that I now get calls from low-level people 
at Glickman to find out what's happening" with the Escrow Shoppe mess, Fein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman's Pennell said his firm wasted no time in trying to help Fein and its 
35 or so other customers who were using the Escrow Shoppe when it collapsed.

EASTERN TAKEN OFF BLOCK; NEW BIDDER HINTED; 
</P>
<P>
LAWYERS AGREE TO GIVE SUITORS CONFIDENTIAL DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unexpected development, Texas Air Corp. declared Monday that it is no 
longer interested in selling strikebound Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came amid rumors of a new bidder for Eastern and hours after a 
court hearing during which Eastern's lawyers agreed to provide confidential 
information about the company's financial health to prospective purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, federal bankruptcy judge Burton R. Lifland put off for a week a 
motion by a disgruntled Eastern customer calling for Eastern to be put on the 
auction block. But he urged all the parties to quickly find a way to get the 
carrier's planes back in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This airline is hemorrhaging," said Judge Lifland. "Most bankruptcy cases go 
through an early triage stage. In this case the patient has been in the 
emergency room too long," he said, continuing his medical analogy. "Our purpose 
is to get the debtor stabilized enough to get the debtor from the emergency 
room to intensive care." 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore Eastern's difficulties, U.S. Customs agents Monday seized 
one of the relatively few Eastern Airlines jets still flying after inspectors 
found 75 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag in the cargo hold in Miami. It was the 
14th such seizure of an Eastern jet. 
</P>
<P>
Customs imposed a $1.2-million fine on Eastern and demanded a letter of credit 
from the strike-hobbled airline before releasing the plane. Because of 
Eastern's financial problems, Customs has decided to cash in three previous 
credit letters worth about $3 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Customs will have to go to bankruptcy 
court to get its money. "We don't think that fining airlines and seizing their 
aircraft is the way to stop drug trafficking," said Ceremsak. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing was the first public event in several days in the tortuous 
process to rescue Eastern, which was struck by its machinists on March 4 and 
filed for protection from its creditors five days later. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, rumors spread that a new, fourth bidder is emerging for the 
ailing company, joining former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, TWA 
chairman Carl C. Icahn and Chicago hotel magnate Jay A. Pritzker, all of whom 
have recently expressed interest in buying Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
One well-placed union source said the fourth bidder was someone who "emerged 
from left field." The source said the individual, whom he declined to identify, 
was a wealthy East Coast businessman who had no previous experience in the 
airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like someone who got a civic urge" to save a sick company, the 
source said, but added: "When such a person discovers what kind of dollars are 
really involved, they often lose that urge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delay Urged 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing was prompted by the filing of a motion earlier this month by 
Moreton Rolleston Jr., a 71-year-old Atlanta attorney who is the father of a 
striking Eastern pilot married to a striking Eastern flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
The motion asked Judge Lifland to consider putting Eastern on the auction block 
because its continued idleness is harming the public, especially the people of 
Atlanta, one of the carrier's major hubs. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joel Zweibel, chief attorney for Eastern's 15-member creditors' 
committee, which includes representatives from aircraft manufacturers, food 
suppliers and unions among others, urged the judge to delay hearing the motion 
for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Zweibel said the creditors committee in conjunction with Eastern officials and 
a special court-appointed bankruptcy examiner has been working on finding a 
buyer for the carrier or another solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not selling a used car at a foreclosure sale," Zweibel said. "We are 
selling a complicated business." 
</P>
<P>
Lifland acceded to Zweibel's request. However, he warned that "as time goes by 
there are fewer alternatives to explore." He said it is losing $1 million a day 
and that its value is dropping rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Eastern attorney Harvey Miller said it would be difficult for 
Eastern to present a new business plan to the creditors' committee by Thursday, 
as the judge strenuously urged the company to do. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air's announcement that it doesn't intend to sell the airline was 
described by some analysts as another bargaining ploy that sends a signal the 
company will hold out for a good price rather than be stampeded. 
</P>
<P>
However, Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, said in a formal statement that 
the company's board "believes a sale is not in Texas Air or Eastern's best 
interests, or in the best interests of Eastern's creditors." 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after Lorenzo released his statement from Houston, Bruce Simon, 
the chief lawyer for Eastern's pilots, blasted the executive and noted that the 
airline's position appeared to put it at odds with the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acker Makes Appearance 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear for the moment at least that Lorenzo is in a tug of war with 
the bankruptcy court over whether or not the company is for sale," said Simon. 
"The judge has said clearly and unmistakably . . . that Eastern is to be 
returned to its full status and the likeliest way to achieve that is through 
sale as an ongoing entity to a third party." 
</P>
<P>
As has occurred continuously in the Eastern saga, the day was filled with 
intrigue and surprises. When C. Edward Acker, who was deposed as chairman of 
Pan American Corp. in 1988 after four unions demanded his ouster in return for 
concessions, walked into the courtroom early Monday morning, some reporters 
asked if he was in any way involved. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, no," he said mysteriously, and left before the hearing began. 
He told reporters he was headed back to his home in Bermuda, even though he 
flew here from the resort island only hours earlier.

L.A. FIRM OBJECTS TO BID FOR CONTROLLING BLOCK IN THEATER CHAIN; 
</P>
<P>
MCA, CINEPLEX CHAIRMAN BEGIN PUBLIC FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MCA Inc., once enamored with its investment in Cineplex Odeon Corp., has begun 
a public battle in Canada to block Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky from 
acquiring a controlling block of stock and possibly taking the movie theater 
company private. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec Securities Commission Chairman Paul Guy said Monday that MCA has 
objected to Drabinsky's plan to buy the holdings of the Charles R. Bronfman 
family and his associates in a private transaction for $17.50 a share 
(Canadian). 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the MCA action and questions raised by its own staff, the Quebec 
Securities Commission has scheduled a public hearing Friday in Montreal to 
determine whether Drabinsky's proposal can be allowed under Canadian laws 
governing takeovers, Guy said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Drabinsky-led group notified the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in Washington that the group's intent is to make a profit from the 
investment. The group said it has no immediate plan but might eventually urge 
Cineplex to sell assets, repurchase shares or take steps to become a closely 
held company, delisting its shares from the New York Stock Exchange and/or the 
Toronto Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that things are beginning to unravel," said one securities analyst, 
who asked not to be identified. Because MCA executives have a standstill 
agreement not to purchase more Cineplex shares, the analyst said, "they seem to 
have gotten themselves boxed into an illiquid investment where they're not 
calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Top MCA officials who serve on the Cineplex board were unavailable for comment 
Monday, and Drabinsky did not return a reporter's call. But there have been 
indications recently that the companies' relationship has frayed. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Cineplex pulled out of its 50-50 partnership with Universal 
City-based MCA to construct a theme park attraction called Universal 
Studios/Florida. The sale of the Cineplex stake to Rank Organisation for $150 
million was characterized as an effort by Toronto-based Cineplex to reduce its 
considerable debt, which stood at nearly $664 million at year-end. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg insisted that occasional 
differences between the two companies on the Florida project had "zero 
relevance" to Cineplex's decision to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, after the Drabinsky group announced its plans to increase 
its holdings to between 34% and 40% of Cineplex's common stock, an executive 
close to the two companies indicated that MCA would be uneasy if Cineplex went 
private, no longer filing detailed financial statements required by publicly 
traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
The source speculated that the entrepreneurial Drabinsky, for his part, chafes 
with a large American company as his largest single shareholder. MCA has 
controlled 33% of Cineplex's voting shares -- or up to five seats on the 
16-person board -- since 1986, when it paid $159 million for the shares. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky's move to gain the upper hand over MCA stunned one analyst who has 
followed the company closely. "Why would (Drabinsky) burn one of the last 
bridges he's got?" he asked, alluding to Cineplex's past feuds with three other 
powerful studios: Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Cineplex shares have been under pressure from short-sellers 
who have wagered that the price of the stock will fall. Some analysts have 
questioned whether the company's cash flow will prove sufficient to cover its 
operating costs and interest payments on its borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cineplex reported $44 million in pretax income for the year ended Dec. 
31, 1988, one analyst estimated that the company would have reported a pretax 
loss of nearly $26 million in its continuing operations if adjustments are made 
for the asset sales, writedowns and certain operating expenses that have been 
capitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not making any money," said another analyst, who spoke on the 
condition that he not be identified, because, in his view, the mood has become 
"ugly." The company has ceased returning his phone calls, he said, but "it is 
painfully obvious the Bronfmans wanted to sell." 
</P>
<P>
The Bronfmans' support had been deemed critical by some investors because they 
are members of one of Canada's wealthiest families and are considered shrewd 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex shares closed at $14.875, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with a volume of 891,000 shares. At the Toronto Stock Exchange, 
Cineplex closed at $17.50 (Canadian) -- the very price that Drabinsky agreed to 
pay the Bronfmans for their shares.

Apple to Produce Cheaper Macintosh: Apple Computer will work toward cultivating 
a low-end, less-pricey Macintosh personal computer for the office environment, 
the company's chief executive told a user conference. John Sculley said 
managers and office workers can use the versatile Macintosh for functions as 
diverse as designing graphics or linking all company employees on an electronic 
mail network. Sculley said creating inexpensive and smaller Macintosh models 
will be a top priority for the $4-billion company in the 1990s. He speculated 
that the inexpensive machines of the 1990s, as powerful as today's high-end 
models, will be priced between $1,500 and $2,000. Versions of the powerful 
Macintosh IIx now cost more than $7,500 each.

FIGURES DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO WHISTLE-BLOWER AT LITTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Carton did not immediately suspect his employer of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
He figured that there was a reasonable explanation for the inconsistencies that 
he had discovered in the accounting records of a Litton Systems data center in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While working on an in-house project in early 1986, he alleges in a lawsuit he 
later filed against the company, Carton noticed that the company's software 
system looked as though it was designed to under-record the computer usage of 
Litton's commercial clients, which caused the government to be overcharged for 
the same type of service. 
</P>
<P>
He thought that he must be reading things wrong. "There were some discrepancies 
that I just attributed to myself for lack of understanding of the system," said 
Carton, 46, a former technical director for Litton. 
</P>
<P>
But upon further inquiry, the suit alleges, Carton came to the conclusion that 
Litton had rigged its computer billing service to overcharge the federal 
government more than $25 million during a six-year period for computer work on 
hundreds of defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 18 months after his initial findings, Carton and the Center for Law in 
the Public Interest filed the suit, which charges Litton with improperly 
billing the military between 1983 and 1988. The case was submitted under the 
federal False Claims Act, which says a whistle-blower can receive 15% to 30% of 
any damages awarded to the government in a successful case. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department announced late last month that it has taken over 
Carton's suit. Damages could reach $175 million, said John Phillips of the 
Center for Law in the Public Interest. The False Claims Act permits damages of 
three times the overcharge plus additional fines for every instance of false 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Merit' to Suit 
</P>
<P>
The electronics giant has denied all of Carton's allegations and said it was 
actually reducing the government's costs by letting commercial customers use 
the same computers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are incredulous that we are being charged with false claims for an action 
that saved the government substantial sums of money," said Robert Knapp, 
Litton's director of public relations. "The plaintiff's suit has no merit." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome, experts say Carton's story is a valuable glimpse at 
the issues the average whistle-blower must confront before deciding to expose 
suspected fraud, including the fear of getting blacklisted and being 
permanently unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"It took him a long time after finding out to actually make a move to make a 
public disclosure," said Hampshire College Prof. Penina Glazer, co-author of 
the recently released book "The Whistleblowers." "He went to his supervisors 
and waited to see if anything would be done. That is very typical. 
Whistle-blowers don't jump on their high horse right away." 
</P>
<P>
Because Carton was its technical director, Litton asked him in early 1986 to 
write a report on how profitable its business was with commercial clients, such 
as credit unions and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Litton provides both computer storage and computer services. Commercial clients 
use the data center to do work such as their taxes or accounts receivable; the 
government relies on the data center to process defense contracts being worked 
on by other Litton divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Just a day into his study, Carton said, he noticed that most of the commercial 
customers -- which accounts for 40% of the data center's revenue -- were 
actually costing the company money. This puzzled him because the data center 
overall consistently reported a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"The accounts that I'm looking at singularly, the majority of them were in the 
negatives," Carton recalled in an interview. "The data center itself was 
reporting profits for all computer usage." 
</P>
<P>
Something wasn't adding up. So Carton decided to compare the invoices that were 
being sent to commercial customers with records of the services they were 
using. "I'm finding more discrepancies," Carton said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went to Supervisors 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Carton claims that one company was charged for using two disk 
drives when it actually was using three. The government on the other hand was 
allegedly being overcharged for services. 
</P>
<P>
He went to his supervisors. "Their first explanation to me was they can't be 
doing that," Carton said. "They said: 'That's not supposed to be happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carton said he waited a year for something to change but that Litton continued 
to overcharge the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting very uncomfortable," Carton said. "Nothing is happening. I started 
thinking, 'If I don't do something, how responsible am I?' " Carton called the 
General Accounting Office's government fraud hot line but hung up before 
officials could get his name or where he worked. He went to the library and 
read articles about whistle-blowers.

"People often worry they can be personally implicated and get into trouble," 
Glazer said. "Whistle-blowing is not always an altruistic, selfless action." 
</P>
<P>
Carton says he felt caught between doing the right thing and protecting 
himself, his wife and his four children. "I start thinking, geez, half of the 
people I could work for are in the aerospace industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But during his research, he came across information on the False Claims Act and 
the possibility of collecting millions of dollars if his allegations were 
proven in court. He was confident that his allegations were valid. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt this was a calculated risk," Carton said. "It's like buying a $1 
lottery ticket with better odds. I had confidence in my ability to get 
employment even if it meant bagging groceries." 
</P>
<P>
Several years will pass before Carton will reap any reward -- if ever. He now 
works for Northrop, which Carton says hired him without knowledge of his 
lawsuit against Litton. Northrop itself is the target of several False Claims 
Act lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Carton was worried how Northrop would react last month after the Justice 
Department joined his suit and had it unsealed in U.S. District Court. "I 
really felt palpitations," he said. "I'm walking from my car into the building, 
and a manager I work with . . . walks up to me and says congratulations. I've 
had nothing but positive comments."

Ducommun: The troubled Carson aerospace company lost $19.4 milion for all of 
1988, compared to a $19.1-million loss for 1987. The company said that sales 
from its continuing operations declined 6% to $59.8 million in 1988. The 
company blamed its loss on inventory writedowns and cost overruns in two of its 
aerospace units and a $3.1-million loss related to the disposal of its cable 
assembly business. The company also said it lost $9.8 million on sales of $13.7 
million in the fourth quarter of 1988, compared to a loss of $21.5 million on 
sales of $14.9 million in the fourth of 1987.

SECURITY PACIFIC CORP. HAS RECORD FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. reported Monday that profit rose to a record level in 
the first quarter, buoyed by gains in all three of its major lines of banking. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based parent of Security Pacific National Bank said profit for 
the quarter totaled $179.3 million, the highest ever for a single three-month 
period at the bank and up 22% from the first quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Two major New York banks, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover, reported 
lower first-quarter earnings on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The increase at Security Pacific, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, 
came as a result of strong performance in all three of its major business areas 
-- its California bank, its banks in five other states and its 
financial-services subsidiaries, such as international banking, according to 
Richard J. Flamson III, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing efforts to cut overhead also paid off. Non-interest expenses, which 
cover staff and other overhead, were $755.4 million for the quarter, up just 3% 
over the year-earlier period. For the last year, the bank has been striving to 
keep the overhead increases under 5%. And one-third of the increase for the 
quarter was the result of its acquisition of Nevada National Bancorporation in 
January, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff expenses, however, may show a sharper increase over the remainder of 1989 
because Security Pacific has joined the other big California banks in extending 
branch hours. The biggest cost is expected to come from the bank's decision to 
open Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., which started last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Spread in California 
</P>
<P>
But, as Security Pacific's balance sheet showed, California's major banks can 
afford such extra costs because widening spreads between loan yields and retail 
deposit costs are boosting their interest income. 
</P>
<P>
This spread is higher in California than in most parts of the country because 
banks here tend to pay lower interest rates to customers for deposits while 
interest rates charged on loans to customers are similar to those elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, Security Pacific's interest income was $733.8 million, 
up $102.4 million -- 16% -- from a year ago. The bank attributed the increase 
to a higher interest-rate spread and a 7% increase in average assets. The bank 
also benefited from its expanded lending in two areas where spreads are 
traditionally high, real estate and consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's return on assets and return on equity, two key measures of a bank's 
performance, were both up for the quarter and above industry averages in 
California. The ROA was 0.90%, up from 0.81% a year ago, and ROE was 19.4%, up 
from 18.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific reported some problems with its domestic loans, stemming 
chiefly from troubled real estate loans at its Arizona banking subsidiary. 
Non-performing loans -- those on which payments are at least 90 days past due 
-- increased slightly in the quarter compared to the end of 1988 primarily as a 
result of Arizona real estate problems. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kooken, the chief financial officer, said the fact that the bank posted 
a record profit despite its loan problems in Arizona demonstrated the value of 
its earnings diversity. 
</P>
<P>
At Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's second-largest banking company, profit 
fell 52% to $131.9 million from a year earlier. The bank said increases in 
interest income and fees were offset by lower income from foreign exchange 
trading and other trading activities. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., the nation's seventh-largest banking company, said 
its profit for the quarter dropped nearly 27% to $103 million from $141 million 
in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
A gain of $40 million in tax benefits and from the sale of a subsidiary, 
however, contributed to last year's first-quarter earnings. Without the 
one-time gain, the bank's earnings would have been slightly higher than a year 
ago.

BANKAMERICA TO BUY PARENT OF NEVADA FIRST BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its second acquisition in as many weeks, BankAmerica said Monday that it has 
signed an agreement to buy the parent of Nevada First Bank. 
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Reno, Nevada First operates 14 branches in Nevada and has 
assets of $200 million. It is the state's fifth-largest bank. Its parent is 
Nevada First Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for BankAmerica said the purchase price would not be disclosed 
because the 5-year-old Nevada banking company is privately held by its 
founders, Sidney B. Stern and his wife, Vera L. Stern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Important Addition' 
</P>
<P>
Last week, BankAmerica said it had agreed to buy a small savings bank in 
Tacoma, Wash., which will be combined with Seattle-First National Bank, a 
BankAmerica subsidiary. The Washington deal was the San Francisco banking 
giant's first acquisition since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
With its Nevada acquisition, BankAmerica will become the third major California 
bank with a subsidiary in that neighboring state. First Interstate and Security 
Pacific Corp. already own banks there. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada First Bank is a highly profitable institution and an important addition 
to the BankAmerica network of financial services operations in the Western 
United States," said A. W. Clausen, chairman and chief executive of the 
California bank. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to buy two consumer-oriented banks illustrates a key change in 
strategy that has occurred over the last two years at BankAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
Once the world's biggest bank and a major international player, the San 
Francisco-based company is now concentrating on consumer banking in the West 
and is cutting back worldwide. Its principal subsidiary, Bank of America, is 
California's largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Magnani, a B of A spokesman, said BankAmerica expects the Nevada bank to 
continue growing and that the company will introduce many of its 
California-developed consumer products to Nevada customers.

NWA MULLS THE OPTIONS FOR NORTHWEST AIR'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Takeover target NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, said Monday that 
its board is willing to consider a range of alternatives for the airline's 
future, including possibly selling the company to Los Angeles billionaire 
Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
NWA had earlier rejected Davis' bid of $2.62 billion as inadequate. But Monday, 
the firm said it would talk to Davis or any other interested bidder as part of 
an effort to "enhance shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
Other alternatives include the repurchase of some of the firm's outstanding 
shares, a special stock dividend, sale of the entire company and a partial or 
complete liquidation, NWA said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyback Expected 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Davis, who plans a proxy fight for control of the airline, had 
no immediate comment on NWA's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"This announcement tells shareholders that they will get something, and it will 
be better than the $90 a share that Davis offered," said Samuel Buttrick, an 
airline industry analyst with Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis, an investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Buttrick said he expects NWA to buy back a substantial amount of its shares for 
between $110 and $105 a share. He said NWA could finance the repurchase through 
a sale and lease back of its aircraft fleet and the sale of its Japanese real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Davis might try to negotiate a takeover, rather 
than wage a battle for control of NWA's board. "It's much less expensive to do 
a friendly deal if it can be worked out," said Kurt Rivard, an airline industry 
analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc., a Minneapolis investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
NWA said it would provide Davis and other possible buyers with confidential 
information about its business to help negotiate a price for the airline 
company. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said it was possible that NWA might require Davis and other 
possible buyers to sign so-called "standstill agreements," or promises not to 
accumulate NWA stock, to get the confidential information. Such a requirement 
might prevent a friendly deal, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
NWA said it was possible that, after exploring all the options, the company 
might chose to do nothing. However, most analysts said it was clear that NWA 
planned to take some action. 
</P>
<P>
NWA said it expects to start studying its options on Monday and has hired First 
Boston, a New York investment firm, to advise it. Analysts doubted that NWA 
would complete its study by May 15, the date of its annual meeting.

FREEZING OF ESCROW SHOPPE'S ASSETS LEAVES ITS CUSTOMERS LIVID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When David Fein completed the sale of his Woodland Hills house March 17, he had 
no reason to think anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Fein went to the Escrow Shoppe, an Encino firm that handled his 
sale's escrow. He signed the house's deed over to the buyers, picked up a 
five-figure check written by the Escrow Shoppe -- his proceeds from the sale -- 
and three days later, deposited the check in his bank. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Fein went to his bank's automated teller machine to withdraw 
cash. But the ATM, instead of showing that he had thousands of dollars in his 
account, showed a negative balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Naively, I didn't feel that badly," recalled Fein, who thought it was a 
computer glitch. "I knew it would probably be cleared up in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. On the day he deposited his check, March 20, the state Department 
of Corporations froze all of the Escrow Shoppe's funds because the agency was 
seizing the firm for allegedly making $3 million in unauthorized payments. 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks later, Fein still does not have his money, and now he is livid. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am in the most incredible situation of having sold a house, turned over 
the deed . . . and I sit without any proceeds from the sale," said Fein, a 
52-year-old TV producer. "It's a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Accounts 
</P>
<P>
And not just for Fein. The Escrow Shoppe had 300 to 400 accounts when it was 
seized, and $5 million of their money was frozen overall, said Judy L. Hartley, 
a senior lawyer at the Department of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms. 
</P>
<P>
The department has tried as quickly as possible to sort out the Escrow Shoppe 
mess, but until its investigation is completed, "we will not release any 
funds," she said. When will that be? Hartley said she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Warden, a lawyer for the Escrow Shoppe and its owner, Sandra Bianco, 
denied the state's allegations and said no money from the firm is missing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Escrow Shoppe customers not only are out of thousands of dollars 
they had counted on, their housing plans have been thrown into chaos. The 
Escrow Shoppe stopped doing business and abandoned its office just as the state 
seized the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers are angry that neither state officials nor anyone else will tell 
them when they can expect their money, or at least keep them abreast of the 
investigation. Calls to the Department of Corporations, their real estate 
brokers and others usually yield no information, they assert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's peoples' life savings, and they're toying around with it like it means 
nothing," said Alan Bloom, 26, whose sale of a Canoga Park condominium 
collapsed with the Escrow Shoppe. "They're giving people the total runaround." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers of real estate use escrow companies to ensure that certain 
conditions are met, such as a property's title search, before a sale is 
finalized. The firms also hold and transfer any payments between the parties 
until then. Frequently, each party is required to make a "good faith" deposit 
of a few thousand dollars to open escrow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broker Referrals 
</P>
<P>
People often do not have a particular escrow firm they want to use, so they 
look to their broker to pick one. But the Escrow Shoppe case illustrates how 
people should not hesitate to investigate which escrow firm they are using, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers "should question the broker where they're going to take the escrow," 
said Ed Moore, president of Townsgate Escrow in Thousand Oaks. "How long have 
they been in business? Are they in good stead with the Department of 
Corporations?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet even that advice might not have helped Escrow Shoppe customers. Both Fein 
and Bloom said they were referred to the Escrow Shoppe by their brokers, both 
of whom work for Mike Glickman Realty, a major brokerage company in the San 
Fernando Valley. Michael Pennell, Glickman's chief operating officer, said 
Glickman had no warning before the Escrow Shoppe was seized that it was in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Threats 
</P>
<P>
In any case, some customers' frustration has boiled over. After the Escrow 
Shoppe was seized, Townsgate Escrow -- at the request of the state -- took over 
many of the Escrow Shoppe's pending escrows. Within days, Moore said he and 
some of his employees received death threats from people demanding that their 
money be unfrozen immediately. Townsgate's office also got a bomb threat, 
forcing the building to be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people have been caught right in the middle," Moore said of 
Escrow Shoppe's customers. He said some have canceled their escrows "and gone 
elsewhere, and I don't blame them. They are in hopes of getting their deposits 
back when this all gets cleared away." 
</P>
<P>
State investigators think the Escrow Shoppe made unauthorized payments totaling 
$3 million, and that more than $200,000 might be missing, Hartley said. Among 
other things, the Escrow Shoppe was transferring money from some escrows that 
were pending to pay customers closing other escrows, Hartley alleged. That 
alleged shuffling between accounts was not authorized by the Escrow Shoppe's 
customers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Required 
</P>
<P>
Licensed escrow firms are required to have insurance by joining Escrow Agents 
Fidelity Corp., or EAFC, a self-insurance group for the industry. The EAFC 
usually will cover any shortfall in customers' accounts caused by embezzlement 
or other wrongdoing by the escrow firm involved, Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, the EAFC, which is "working right alongside" state officials 
in their investigation, also is withholding any payments until the probe is 
completed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has been slowed by some odd circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
A recent fire at the Department of Corporation's downtown Los Angeles offices 
has forced department lawyers to work at home. Also, the state needs records 
from another entity, called Encino Equities, Hartley said. That firm also was 
owned by Bianco and shared the same office as the Escrow Shoppe, said Warden, 
Bianco's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
(There is another firm named Encino Equities on Wilshire Boulevard in Los 
Angeles. But that firm's owner, David Telerant, said his firm has no ties to 
the Escrow Shoppe.) 
</P>
<P>
But the Encino Equities that is connected with the Escrow Shoppe had "not given 
us access" to the records the state needs, Hartley said. So last week, the 
Department of Corporations sent a subpoena for the records to Warden's office, 
but he said he was out of the country last week. 
</P>
<P>
Warden said Monday that "we intend to comply with the subpoena" and provide the 
records, perhaps within a week or so. But the delays have left Fein, Bloom and 
other Escrow Shoppe customers fit to be tied. "It's absolutely Alice in 
Wonderland," Fein said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agents' Role 
</P>
<P>
Could their real estate agents have helped? Bloom said he was first alerted to 
the problem by his Glickman agent. But after Fein found out on his own that his 
check was frozen, he said his Glickman agent told him that she had learned 
about the problem a couple of days earlier but "didn't call me because she had 
hoped my check would clear." 
</P>
<P>
"That was outrageous that nobody from the Glickman company would call us," Fein 
said. "It has gotten so preposterous that I now get calls from low-level people 
at Glickman to find out what's happening" with the Escrow Shoppe mess, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman's Pennell said his firm wasted no time in trying to help Fein and its 
35 or so other customers who were using the Escrow Shoppe when it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was concerned and everyone was trying to do something," Pennell said. 
"We would have liked to have been able to do something to help our clients, 
vis-a-vis getting their funds unfrozen more rapidly. We were, of course, unable 
to do that."

CHRONIC FATIGUE: A MYSTERY UNRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN LIBMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Jay Goldstein of Anaheim Hills has spent the last five years researching 
and treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating disease 
characterized by incapacitating exhaustion and a range of other perplexing 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his theory of an unknown retrovirus invading the immune system, 
inducing cells to produce a chemical transmitter affecting the entire body, 
Goldstein pauses. "You know," the family practitioner says, "some very 
respected physicians will tell you I am crazy." 
</P>
<P>
That's because in posing a medical explanation for the existence of chronic 
fatigue syndrome -- a disease with no known cause or cure -- Goldstein is 
bucking conventional wisdom. For years now, many in the medical community have 
regarded the ailment as primarily psychological, and they are wary of 
practitioners who pose unproven medical theories. 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, a growing number of the nation's most respected scientists are 
taking the illness very seriously, researching various hunches and theories of 
their own, as they reported at the First Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Conference 
held last weekend in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dubbed 'Yuppie Flu' 
</P>
<P>
Once dubbed the "yuppie flu" and dismissed as a vogue ailment affecting 
neurotic women, chronic fatigue syndrome is now believed to be a complex 
illness of immune dysfunction that affects people of both sexes and varying 
ages and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Though there is little funding for its study, scientists are hoping to 
understand more about chronic fatigue by scrutinizing viruses, including the 
involvement of the newly discovered Human Herpes Virus 6, or HHV-6, which has 
been linked to cancer and AIDS; questioning whether chronic fatigue is linked 
to multiple sclerosis; puzzling over how it is transmitted, and experimenting 
with treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Even AIDS was simpler than this, because it was caused by one virus, and that 
virus is very new in the last 20 years. It is more likely (with chronic 
fatigue) that a whole bunch of other old viruses and other infectious agents 
are all able to cause some people's bodies to act in a particular way to cause 
this disease," said Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, associate professor of medicine at 
Harvard University and chief of general medicine at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. "It is only since new technology has enabled us to take 
pictures of what goes on in the brain that many physicians became convinced 
this was an illness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Komaroff, a presenter at Saturday's conference attended by about 500 
health-care professionals, said he and other researchers speculate toxins, 
heredity, allergy and stress may work in concert with other factors to trigger 
the malady. 
</P>
<P>
Although statistics documenting its prevalence aren't available, chronic 
fatigue syndrome has been classified as a disease by the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta, which is launching a four-year study. In evaluating 
a grant proposal, the CDC recently noted the illness "appears to be reaching 
epidemic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are more than 200 support groups for patients. The CFIDS 
Chronicle, the journal of the nonprofit Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction 
Syndrome Assn., based in Charlotte, N.C., publishes a bimonthly, 70-page 
journal of advocacy information and research. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, chronic fatigue sufferers talk of callous treatment by the medical 
community. Through the course of her two-year illness, conference speaker 
Melinda Paras, 35, of San Francisco, said she dealt with seven practitioners at 
her health maintenance organization. On one occasion, she said, she was told: " 
'This is a seven-minute appointment. I don't have time to hear your 
complaints.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a battery of laboratory work, Paras was advised to take an AIDS test. As 
terrible as it was to wait two agonizing weeks for the appointment and another 
two weeks for results, it paled by what was to come, she said. "Absolutely the 
worst part of this disease came when I had a particularly acute attack and was 
so weak I couldn't breathe and could hardly move. I was scared. I called the 
HMO, and the nurse-practitioner said: 'There is nothing more we can do for you. 
We recommend you seek psychiatric treatment,' " Paras recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly a program coordinator for a nonprofit institution, Paras was stricken 
while on a business trip in Washington. She thought it was severe flu, but in 
the next two months became so debilitated, "it took me 30 minutes to crawl to 
the bathroom and I had to take a nap on the floor for 30 minutes on the way 
back to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Tom Hennessey, a 35-year-old former BMW salesman who described 
himself as "a very aggressive, competitive person," said he is now unable to 
work because of chronic fatigue and has spent his last $20,000 on medical 
expenses. "My life savings and individual retirement account are gone," 
Hennessey said, "and I have sold two cars. I don't have the money to pay the 
May rent." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, his claim for Social Security disability was denied, he said. He 
urged health-care workers assembled to support patients with letters and 
documents necessary for disability payments, rent subsidies and food stamps. 
"We also need buddy systems to help us with chores, such as cooking, cleaning 
and taking care of ourselves," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many are struck in theirs 30s and 40s, experts say, more often women than men. 
Typically, incapacitating exhaustion is accompanied by flu-like symptoms, 
including sore throat, swollen lymph glands, drenching night sweats, chronic 
cough, painful and weak muscles and joints, and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
Some also exhibit multiple sclerosis-like symptoms, such as disorientation, 
memory loss, inability to concentrate, balance disturbances and brain 
inflammation. The disease can last for six months or two years. Others never 
seem to recover. 
</P>
<P>
There is disagreement on how long chronic fatigue syndrome has been around, 
perhaps in different guises. Estimates range from the last 30 years to more 
than 120. In the 20th Century, it has been identified as anemia, a bacterial 
infection, low-blood sugar, environmental allergy, bodywide yeast infection, 
and more recently, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, which causes infectious 
mononucleosis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Paul Cheney of the Nalle Clinic in Charlotte, N.C., speculates 
chronic fatigue may be an old disease that has evolved. "If this had been 
around for 200 years, with people this sick, I can't believe we could have 
missed it for so long," he said. "I think it's something that has existed as 
long as viruses, but some new co-factor has been added, as well." 
</P>
<P>
In searching for clues, scientists are trying to understand how viruses work 
singly and together as well as how they affect the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Although HHV-6 and the Epstein-Barr virus don't cause chronic fatigue syndrome, 
they may hold powerful clues, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Virus 
</P>
<P>
"We now have evidence that HHV-6 is present and active at the time (chronic 
fatigue patients) are sick," Komaroff reported, citing a collaborative effort 
with Dr. Dharam Ablashi of the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Berch Henry of 
the University of Nevada. The finding may be significant, Komaroff said, 
because an active virus can infect cells of the nervous system, which might 
contribute to some or all symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. At the National 
Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., a high prevalence of antibodies to HHV-6 
also has been found in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
and childhood acute leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hypothesize that, like the AIDS virus, HHV-6 has the ability to 
kill the immune system's helper cells. "In the culture system, we have found 
that when you can co-infect these CD4 helper-positive cells with two viruses, 
the cellular killing effect is much faster than either will do alone," said 
Ablashi, coordinator for DNA virus studies at the National Cancer Institute. In 
a similar vein, investigators speculate that the combination of Epstein-Barr 
and HHV-6 might co-infect the immune system of chronic fatigue patients in a 
devastating manner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still a Puzzle 
</P>
<P>
Just what goes on their immune systems is a puzzle. "It is very difficult to 
sort out the mix of what different agents may be causing this illness. The only 
common denominator for all potential causes or co-factors seems to be the 
element of immunological dysfunction in all these patients," Cheney of the 
Nalle clinic said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney became interested in the disease while practicing medicine in the early 
1980s. At the time, he was inundated with patients from Lake Tahoe suffering 
from what he thought might be a chronic mononucleosis-type illness. 
</P>
<P>
After years of research, he believes "the immunologic problem isn't necessarily 
a severe one like AIDS. It looks as much like an allergy. Rather than being 
suppressed, the immune system looks like it is hyper-responsive, really 
fighting something." Theoretically, he added, the immune system's raging battle 
may be one reason chronic fatigue patients feel ill constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Virologist Dr. Jay Levy and his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Group at UC 
San Francisco have been unsuccessful in attempts to isolate an agent that might 
cause chronic fatigue. Perplexed by patients whose symptoms resemble multiple 
sclerosis, he poses these unanswered questions: "Are these really MS patients, 
or is this an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some people? Could chronic 
fatigue syndrome be an acute symptom of another virus that gives rise to 
multiple sclerosis in certain people?" 
</P>
<P>
Another researcher, Dr. David Bell of Lyndonville, N.Y., started seeing 
children with what he now believes is chronic fatigue syndrome in 1983. "These 
children had large lymph nodes, big spleens and were quite sick. They still are 
sick today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic or Infectious? 
</P>
<P>
After identifying 21 cases at a local school, the pediatrician compared the 
youngsters with a group of 42 healthy children, examining about 50 factors. 
Among his findings: "The people who got sick had a high rate of allergy, 
implying a genetic marker. There was a high rate of people within the same 
family becoming ill, implying an infectious agent. And people with the illness 
were much more likely to have been drinking raw milk." After three years of 
research, however, the pediatrician has been unable to explain what role raw 
milk might play. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who is affiliated with the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, a cancer 
research center in Buffalo, N.Y., reflects a common complaint about lack of 
research grants. "When you see a disease that is so devastating to the lives of 
children and families, it is remarkable that so little has been done about 
this. I see children who haven't been out of bed in a year, and yet there is 
very little government response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to doctors is the impact the illness appears to have on the 
brain. Cheney said brain tests in some patients reveal unexplained white 
lesions of the cortex -- the brain's outer layer of gray matter -- and 
abnormalities in the temporal lobes where vision, hearing, memory and emotion 
are processed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scans, mapping electrical activity, show there are characteristics of 
brain lesions in almost all of the people who have chronic fatigue syndrome," 
added Goldstein of Anaheim Hills. "In some patients, we see areas of decreased 
blood flow in certain areas of the brain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cognitive Problems 
</P>
<P>
These changes correspond with cognitive impairment. "I have seen IQ tests drop 
30 points. I have a doctor in my practice who can't drive a car because he 
can't read street signs and mothers who don't remember the names of their 
daughters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He theorizes that an unknown virus enters cells of the immune system of a 
genetically susceptible person, inducing production of a chemical transmitter 
or cytokine. Other cells, in turn, make their own transmitter chemicals. "You 
can almost view the immune system and the brain as one organ. The body is a 
network of these communicating systems," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
He speculates that by treating the brain, the immune system can be altered. 
Experimenting with a drug that increases slow-wave sleep, he plans to study "in 
what ways this treatment might make people feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Other clinicians are also searching for treatments. In some of her patients, 
Bay Area physician Dr. Carol Jessop has found an imbalance of gastrointestinal 
bacteria and yeast caused, she believes, by chronic use of antibiotics, a 
high-sugar diet, birth control pills, steroids, or, in some people, an 
immunosuppression caused by an unknown viral agent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, patient advocacy groups are becoming increasingly vocal. Jan 
Montgomery of San Francisco's Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
Foundation was instrumental in urging city officials to form a task force 
resulting in the conference, co-sponsored by the San Francisco Medical Society, 
the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the UC San Francisco 
Department of Medicine and School of Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
And researchers, too, are coming to the defense of chronic fatigue patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe, personally, these are people who are primarily depressed or 
psychologically ill," said Dr. Leonard S. Zegans, professor of psychiatry and 
director of professional education at the Langley Porter Institute, a UC 
psychiatric research, teaching and treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
The disease represents powerful stress, the psychiatrist said. Moreover, 
symptoms such as impaired attention and anxiety alter performance at work or 
school, "calling self-worth and self-esteem into question." Not being able to 
work is especially devastating because "many of these people are ambitious," 
Zegans added. Patients become isolated, in part, because "not everyone believes 
they are sick." 
</P>
<P>
He, too, suspects a virus, latent in the blood stream, maybe re-activated by a 
variety of causes, including stress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just now beginning to learn about the interaction between the nervous 
system and the immune system," he told his colleagues at the conference. "We 
have a very complex system of checks and balances in the body and there perhaps

the next 20 years, we are going to be learning a tremendous amount about this."

FERRARE TO SKIP 'HOME' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cristina Ferrare has decided not to return to ABC's "Home Show" in order to 
spend more time with her newborn daughter, an ABC spokeswoman announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the 'Home Show' and all the people involved, but because I have to be 
up at 4:30 a.m. every day, I couldn't see the new baby until the afternoon," 
Ferrare said through the ABC spokeswoman. "I really want to be with her, as 
well as my 2-year-old daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Gregory, Ferrare's manager, said that his client decided very recently 
that the demands of co-hosting the "Home Show," as well as "A.M. Los Angeles," 
were too time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
He said Ferrare will continue as co-host with Steve Edwards of "A.M. Los 
Angeles," where she returned to work Monday after a five-week maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrare first appeared on the "Home Show" with Robb Weller on Jan. 16 and left 
March 9, the day her daughter, Arianna, was born. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC spokeswoman said the "Home Show" would continue to have rotating guest 
hosts. DIANNE KLEIN

ART BUCHWALD: TAXPAYER PURSE IS CORPORATE GOLD MINE

Government officials predict that the American taxpayer will have to pay for 
the vast oil clean-up in Alaska . 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as I opened the door I recognized the man from the federal government. 
He had come to the house last fall to ask me to bail out the S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
I told him, "I already gave at the office." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'm not asking you to bail out the S&amp;Ls this time, I want you to 
contribute to the clean-up in Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
"Why me?" 
</P>
<P>
"You're a taxpayer and we would like every taxpayer to behave responsibly and 
help Exxon with this problem." 
</P>
<P>
"But I had nothing to do with the tanker going aground," I protested. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of us is guilty. It's not our role to point the finger at others when 
it comes to an oil spill. We have to leave that to wiser and more experienced 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"Such as the captain who was snoozing in his bunk while the third mate steered 
the ship." 
</P>
<P>
"Some day we'll get to the bottom of all this. For the moment, the only way to 
make restitution is for John Q. Public to dig deep into his pockets and say, 
'There but for the grace of God go I.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been to Alaska in my life. I'm tired of bailing out everything 
from nuclear power plants to railroads. Someone has to say, 'Enough is enough.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the right attitude. The position you should take is, 'OK we 
blew it. What can I do to save Exxon management and the stockholders whose 
savings are at stake?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to say that. Every time you come to the house looking for 
bailout money you make an appeal to my patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong with a little flag-waving for an American company that 
makes a teensy, weensy mistake. Just hand over $10,000 as your share for 
cleaning up Alaska. I promise not to bother you again until I figure out how 
much you owe me to prevent Third World countries from going bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about Third World countries going bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not them we are worried about. It's the American banks, which loaned them 
the money. If you don't come through on this they could all be broke. Are you 
willing to take responsibility for the Irving Trust Co. running aground?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not," I replied. "But if I keep rescuing all these companies, I'm 
not going to have anything left for myself." 
</P>
<P>
"Surely, you jest. You have at least four more bailouts in you. Look, nobody 
likes oil spills, but they are inevitable when the situation on board a tanker 
is not as sobering as it should be. Your money will be used to clean up the 
environment in Alaska once and for all. It will also enable us to study tanker 
captains, who are under the weather, and how they behave when they are at sea. 
Once we have the answer to this question, the only one left for you to bail out 
is the defense company that makes the B-1 bomber."

BRITISH MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST TAKES SCIENCE OFF THE HOOK

Is Science Necessary? Essays on Science and Scientists by Max F. Perutz (E.P. 
Dutton: $19.95; 285 pages) 
</P>
<P>
For the last hundred years or so, society has looked to science as the way to 
solve the world's problems. The public-health triumphs of the turn of the 
century made people think that knowledge could make all ills disappear. 
</P>
<P>
This was a new role for science. Historically, scientific knowledge had been 
pursued largely for its own sake. It was interesting to know about astronomy, 
but not much more. The Industrial Revolution used technology for economic and 
commercial gain. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until later that people began to think that scientific insights 
could be used broadly to improve health and welfare, an idea that remains a 
cornerstone of public support for research to this day. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that it was easier to wipe out diphtheria and yellow fever than to 
wipe out poverty and hunger. Never mind that the application of scientific 
knowledge frequently has unfortunate side effects like pollution. The notion is 
still very much with us -- at least in most quarters -- that science is the way 
to improve the world's standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
This is the view taken by Max F. Perutz, a Nobel Prize-winning British 
molecular biologist, in "Is Science Necessary?" a collection of his essays 
written over the years. The title of the book is the title of the first and 
longest essay in it, and the answer Perutz gives is an emphatic yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Best Hope 
</P>
<P>
Science is not only necessary, it is crucial. In fact, he argues, it offers the 
only solution to the problems of food, health and energy that confront the 
world. There are simply too many people on the planet to get by without it. 
</P>
<P>
Perutz is aware -- as who isn't? -- that knowledge has a downside. "Science 
often exacts a price," he writes. "Benefits and risks are complementary aspects 
of each technical advance." But he comes down foursquare on the side of the 
benefits and has little patience for nostalgia for the simpler good old days, 
which, he says, weren't so good. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the Irish potato famine of the last century and the great Bengal famine 
of the 1930s were caused by fungi attacking crops," he writes. "If we reverted 
to organic farming without fungicides, we would not be able to prevent a 
repetition of these disasters." 
</P>
<P>
That is the overall argument of the essay, and it is undoubtedly true, though 
it is unlikely to persuade those who focus on the risks of science rather than 
on its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Perutz's essay is a powerful restatement of what many people believe and what 
those who don't are not likely to. It's an important essay, but it doesn't tell 
us much that's new. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the remaining essays in the book are more engaging. They deal with 
smaller themes and include many personal observations from a life in science, 
but they say a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am suspicious of scientists who tell me that others have pinched their 
ideas," Perutz writes in one of them. "Far from preventing people from stealing 
it, I have always had to ram any new idea of mine down their throats. Even 
scientists are unbelievably conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Like most people, scientists prefer order to progress. 
</P>
<P>
The one autobiographical essay in the collection is an entertaining account of 
Perutz's experiences during World War II. A native of Austria, he was judged an 
enemy alien by the British in 1940, though he had just gotten a Ph.D. from 
Cambridge and was briefly interned and sent to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, he was put to work on a project to make ice harder so giant 
icebergs could be used as landing strips for Allied planes in the middle of the 
ocean. No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scientists Profiled 
</P>
<P>
There are also short profiles of various scientists, including Alexander 
Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, who turns out to have been plodding and 
unimaginative, leading Perutz to observe: 
</P>
<P>
"Success in research is a haphazard business, and great discoveries are not 
always made by great thinkers. Some are made by skilled craftsmen, some by 
observant watchmen, and some even by prosaic people doing a regular job because 
they are paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
In the course of writing about topics and people, Perutz reveals a fair amount 
about himself and what he has learned from years at the laboratory bench. 
"Science offers a safe niche where you can spend a quiet life classifying 
spiders, away from what E. M. Forster called the world of telegrams and anger," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Not all scientists would agree with this monastic view of the scientific life, 
but it is an ideal to be cherished, and it leads to a civilized view of the 
world that is very much on display in this book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaching the Top 
</P>
<P>
"A discovery is like falling in love and reaching the top of a mountain after a 
hard climb all in one, an ecstasy induced not by drugs but by the revelation of 
a face of nature that no one has seen before," Perutz says. 
</P>
<P>
From start to finish, Perutz makes a strong case for the orthodox view of 
science, its methods and its accomplishments.

NEW LONG BEACH SYMPHONY DIRECTOR CHOSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JoAnn Falletta has been named the new music director of the Long Beach 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old conductor, a native New Yorker who will soon hold three degrees 
from the Juilliard School, was chosen over four other candidates for the post, 
vacated last year when Murry Sidlin's contract was not renewed by the 
orchestra's board of directors. Each of the five contenders -- including Paul 
Polivnick, Kenneth Kiesler, David Alan Miller and Jon Robertson -- led a Long 
Beach Symphony concert during the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta signed a two-year contract with the symphony association on Sunday 
night. The contract stipulates that the new music director will spend 100 days, 
or half her professional time, with the orchestra each season. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor already leads the Queens Philharmonic in New York -- an orchestra 
she founded nine years ago -- the Denver Chamber Orchestra and the Bay Area 
Women's Philharmonic. Thus, in the season 1989-90, she will hold four 
concurrent music directorships. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the post, Falletta becomes one in an elite group of women who hold 
primary conducting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Monday at the Denver Chamber Orchestra office, Falletta acknowledged 
that "this is a big, big step for all women on the career path to being a 
conductor," adding that, though no woman holds a primary conducting post with a 
major American orchestra, Falletta becomes the second woman to head a regional 
orchestra; the other is Catherine Comet, the French-born music director of the 
Grand Rapids Symphony. (The Michigan orchestra has a budget of $2.6 million; 
the Long Beach ensemble one of around $1.5 million) 
</P>
<P>
"The symphonic world is so rigid and conservative," Falletta observed, "These 
kinds of changes can come only from inside. Women conductors, like all 
conductors, have to serve a long apprenticeship, and move up slowly. But, 
things are changing." 
</P>
<P>
A former classical guitarist who also plays cello and piano, Falletta said she 
maintains a home in New York -- with her husband, a computer scientist -- and 
an apartment in Denver, and commutes to San Francisco three times a year for 
her work with the Bay Area Women's Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989-90, Falletta will conduct five of the Long Beach Symphony's six 
subscription concerts in the Terrace Theatre at the Long Beach Convention 
Center (and will choose the guest conductor on the other one), will lead one of 
three scheduled pops concerts and preside over all of the youth and education 
programs given by the 54-year old orchestra.

CNBC, NBC's 24-hour consumer and business-news cable service, dawned Monday 
with only minor opening-day problems -- a slight audio glitch in a live report 
from London shortly after the cable service began operations at 6 a.m. EDT, a 
10-minute stoppage in a stock-market ticker and a Wall Street report in which 
correspondent Arthur Alpert forgot but then remembered to put on his lapel 
microphone. NBC President Robert C. Wright called the venture, which cost an 
estimated $65 million to launch, "the most significant programming effort NBC 
has ever undertaken outside of the network. . . ." Ironically, NBC's new 
financial news service can't be seen on Wall Street because CNBC has no 
Manhattan cable outlet yet. ALEENE MacMINN

Fox's new release, "Say Anything," had a respectable opening, but ticket sales 
didn't measure up to the positive critical response the film has received. The 
teen romance starring John Cusack and Ione Skye grossed $4 million at 1,113 
theaters, a per-screen average of $3,646. The latest release from the troubled 
Weintraub Entertainment Group, "She's Out of Control," grossed $3.7 million at 
987 theaters, an average of $3,701 per screen. Meanwhile, Paramount's baseball 
movie, "Major League," held strong, dropping just 20% from its opening last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
*"Winter People," the Kelly McGillis-Kurt Russell film chosen to kick off the 
AFI/LA FilmFest last week, had a weak opening at 298 theaters, grossing 
$760,000, or $2,550 per screen.

While celebrations around the world Sunday were noting the 100th anniversary of 
the birth of film pioneer Charlie Chaplin, folks in Missouri were marking a 
similar anniversary involving a native son. Thomas Hart Benton, the prolific 
and provocative painter whose work brought him fame but not wide acceptance by 
the art world's elite, received a spirited celebration in his home state. He 
remained a Missouri resident until his death in 1975. ALEENE MacMINN

After almost 11 years and 7,000 performances, the musical extravaganza "Hello 
Hollywood, Hello" will clear off the stage at Bally's hotel and casino in Reno 
tonight to make way for star headliners. The long-running show (it opened June 
2, 1978) has become a Reno landmark, featuring a passenger jet landing on the 
one-acre stage, attacks by spaceships that descend from the showroom ceiling, a 
re-creation of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and a three-story waterfall 
that dumps 4,000 gallons of water onto the stage. Richard Sturm, Bally's vice 
president of entertainment, said that "the last couple of years the audience 
has been down. Our surveys showed that people wanted to see name stars." And 
that they'll get when Dean Martin opens April 27 as the first headliner. ALEENE

The Los Angeles Theatre Center's Latino Theatre Lab will commission seven new 
plays from six Latino playwrights with $220,000 in new grant money, the LATC 
said Monday. Some of the funding -- $200,000 from the Ford Foundation and 
$20,000 from NBC -- will be used to expand the actors' ensemble at the Lab. 
Director Jose Luis Valenzuela said the new plays will chronicle the Latino 
experience and reflect Latino concerns. The Lab, a multicultural nonprofit 
professional theater company and theatrical training laboratory organized in 
1979, has produced five plays at LATC under Valenzuela's direction. ALEENE

Calling it "the season without reason" and "the dreariest program development 
yet," FCB/Telcom released its annual outlook Monday on what the TV networks 
will be serving up come fall. The consensus: "This year's class of network 
programmers simply recycled the output of their predecessors . . . and came up 
with essentially the same mind-numbing sitcom premises with different titles 
and players. And the drama development is basically forgettable, except that 
several series conjured up vivid images of past failures. Are we exaggerating? 
Fervently we do wish we were," the report said. While there were "a few 
individual pieces of work that one could feel warm about," the impression is 
that "all of the broadcast networks are in various degrees of trouble because 
of too little emphasis on the product side by management." Some comments: ABC's 
development crop is "pure vanilla"; CBS' "long on 'rah-rah' and short on 
substance"; NBC has "some weaknesses that will have to be shored up," and Fox 
has a " 'guts ball' approach to networking." In all, 135 programs are covered 
in the report. FCB/Telcom is the TV programming division of Foote, Cone &amp; 
Belding advertising agency.

Singer Liza Minnelli, already in the doghouse with Swedish authorities for 
taking her dog into the country last week without proper authority, ran into 
more problems over the weekend. On Sunday, she was grounded by a severe ear 
infection and had to pull out of a concert with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis 
Jr. in Helsinki, Finland. Doctors told her she could not fly for 10 days. 
Sinatra and Davis went ahead with the show. ALEENE MacMINN

3 POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR SUPERVISOR; 
</P>
<P>
POSSIBLE RILEY RETIREMENT CLOUDS GOP FOCUS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election is still 15 months away, and Thomas F. Riley, the powerful 
chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, has not decided whether he 
will seek a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
Yet three local Republicans have begun lining up support and contributors to 
run for Riley's coveted seat in the 5th Supervisorial District, should the 
former Marine Corps brigadier general choose retirement over running for 
another 4-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 76, who has been noticeably slowed in recent years by asthma, 
acknowledged that his political future hinges on his health. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the job I'm involved in, and I have a desire to serve longer," he said. 
"But . . . I want to go out feeling like a full-time supervisor. I would hate 
like heck to have my health diminish that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't feel up to it, I'll step aside." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting in the wings are at least three would-be supervisors, including Newport 
Beach lawyer Dana W. Reed, who Monday announced that he has formed an 
exploratory committee to raise money for a probable run for Riley's seat in 
June, 1990. But Reed and the two other potential candidates -- Peter F. Buffa, 
mayor of Costa Mesa, and Peer A. Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water 
District board of directors -- said they would withdraw from the race if Riley 
seeks reelection. 
</P>
<P>
All three praised Riley's leadership on the board and within the county GOP. 
Mounting a challenge against the supervisor, who has been easily reelected four 
times since his appointment to the board in 1974 by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, 
would be foolish, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, a political conservative, said he has received assurances from each of 
the potential candidates that if he runs again, they will not challenge him for 
the $66,000-a-year supervisorial post. 
</P>
<P>
But his age and health problems have triggered widespread speculation that 
Riley will call it quits later this year, creating a wide-open race similar to 
the scramble among 18 candidates a year ago for former Newport Beach Republican 
Robert E. Badham's seat in the 40th Congressional District. C. Christopher Cox 
finally won the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Because Republicans greatly outnumber Democrats among registered voters 
countywide, GOP officials are rarely threatened, even for such nonpartisan 
offices as supervisor, and more often than not remain in office until they tire 
of the job. 
</P>
<P>
The district -- which stretches from Newport Beach to San Clemente and includes 
Irvine, Laguna Niguel and San Juan Capistrano -- is typical. Among the 
district's 292,605 registered voters, Republicans outnumber Democrats more than 
2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"A seat on the board of supervisors is a prized commodity in this county, and 
Riley's departure would be a rare opportunity for someone," said Harvey 
Englander, a Newport Beach political consultant. "The race could attract as 
many as a dozen candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Such a race, observers said, could become one of the most expensive in county 
history, topping the record $1.6 million spent in 1986 by eventual winner 
Supervisor Don R. Roth and two challengers in the 4th Supervisorial District. 
</P>
<P>
And money is the reason cited by Reed, Swan and Buffa for starting campaigns so 
far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 73, adopted by voters statewide last year, state and local 
candidates cannot accept more than $1,000 a year from a single person or more 
than $5,000 a year from a committee. The contribution law is based on the 
fiscal year, so candidates who form fund-raising committees by July 1 of this 
year can collect twice from each contributor before the primary on June 5, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, Reed, a lawyer specializing in campaign-finance law, appears to 
have an advantage. Two members of his campaign committee, former Democratic 
congressman James Roosevelt and campaign consultant Robert Nelson, are longtime 
political advisers of Riley's. Roosevelt was co-chairman of Riley's last two 
campaigns, while Nelson managed those races. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, a member of the Orange County Transportation Commission, denied that the 
presence of Roosevelt and Nelson on his team is an indication that Riley has 
decided not to run again. 
</P>
<P>
Riley also discounted the significance of the advisers working for Reed, 
adding: "If I decide to go after this seat, I trust both those individuals will 
be with me. . . . I've known Dana for a long time, but I haven't endorsed 
anyone and don't plan to at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 45, a former undersecretary of the California Business, Transportation 
and Housing Agency and a former deputy state controller, moved to the county in 
1985. He can claim ties to top GOP officials and officeholders locally and 
around the state because of his work as a legal adviser and campaign treasurer 
for various candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa and Swan said they also plan to organize campaign committees in the near 
future. Both men were candidates in the GOP primary for the 40th Congressional 
District before withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, 40, an independent TV producer, was elected to the Costa Mesa City 
Council in 1986 after being on the city's Planning Commission. He has also been 
on several countywide commissions, including ones concerned with the San 
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor and managing hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Swan, 44, a corporate financial executive who has been active in varied civic 
and GOP organizations, said he is perhaps the most moderate of the three 
potential candidates, particularly on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
Those positions, he said, may help him appeal to a broader number of voters, 
especially Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Although the race is nonpartisan, county Democrats have a goal of winning a 
seat on the board of supervisors. In the middle 1970s, Democrats controlled 
three seats on the five-member board. But since the early 1980s, Republicans 
have held a solid majority. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran is most often mentioned as a possible Democratic 
candidate for Riley's seat. But Agran said Monday it is doubtful that he would 
run because it would be "a long, long time until we (Democrats) could gain a 
progressive majority" on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I have given it some small measure of consideration," Agran said. "But it is 
difficult being a lone progressive voice."

CONVICTED SLAYER ADMITS IN COURT HE STRANGLED BOY

A man convicted of kidnaping and killing a 10-year-old West Covina boy in 1980 
admitted his guilt for the first time in court Monday as he testified for the 
city in a wrongful death suit brought by the victim's father. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jerome Young, 29, said he was testifying on behalf of the city in the 
$10-million suit to set the record straight and remove any blame from the 
police who handled the murder case. 
</P>
<P>
"The only person who could have saved Ronnie Tolleson was God," Young testified 
in Pomona Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Young is serving a life term without possibility of parole for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days after Ronald Tolleson Jr. was abducted and $3,000 was demanded in 
ransom, the boy's strangled body was found in the garage of a home two doors 
away from the Tolleson residence. Young lived in the home with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suing West Covina 
</P>
<P>
Ronald A. Tolleson Sr. is suing the West Covina Police Department, Police Chief 
Craig Meacham and two officers, alleging that police botched the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A Pomona Superior Court judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to 
warrant a trial. 
</P>
<P>
But a state Court of Appeal ruled that the case could be heard, a decision that 
the state Supreme Court affirmed early last year. 
</P>
<P>
State Appellate Justice Campbell M. Lucas had concluded that police searched 
the Young house the night of the kidnaping but did not enter the garage. Lucas 
also found that a suspect was not apprehended, even though several police 
officers were stationed near the site where the ransom was to be placed and one 
officer saw a man pick up the money. The ransom bag contained $100, all the 
senior Tolleson could raise, and crumpled newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The city's defense attorney, Thomas J. Feeley, has maintained that the boy was 
dead before police were contacted and that the suit should be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who was convicted in 1982 of second-degree murder and kidnaping, 
testified Monday that he strangled the boy with an electrical cord within hours 
after abducting him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Young pleaded not guilty, the prosecution introduced a taped 
confession obtained by police. 
</P>
<P>
Young maintained during his trial that the confession was coerced. On Monday, 
he admitted that he had lied. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that careers should be in jeopardy for something I did," said 
Young, as he unemotionally told how he killed Tolleson. "Even if this causes my 
life to be terminated in the penitentiary, I got to do it. I can't lay back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Gain 
</P>
<P>
Feeley said Young has nothing to gain by his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"He's serving life without the possibility of parole . . . I'm not aware of 
anything you can offer a person in those circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolleson's attorneys, Charles C. Simon and Peter M. Wucetich, said they 
believe Young was offered some inducement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not out of the goodness of his heart for the city of West 
Covina and the police officers who put him away," Wucetich said. 
</P>
<P>
Young testified Monday that the boy came to his house looking for Young's 
nephews. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he lured Tolleson into his room and bound and gagged him. He said he 
demanded the boy's phone number, "because I knew at the time that I was going 
to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
He then took Tolleson to a downstairs bathroom, where he strangled him. After 
wrapping the body in blankets, Young said he stuffed it behind a sofa in the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phoned House 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, he phoned the Tolleson house and demanded $3,000, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Was Ronnie already dead at that point?" Feeley asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he persuaded an acquaintance to pick up the ransom at a local park, 
by telling him that he was obtaining a bag of marijuana. While watching the 
drop site at Rimgrove Park, Young said he saw police officers "all over" after 
the man picked up the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Young was captured in Nevada a month after the slaying.

ST. JOSEPH TO SHUT DOWN ITS TRAUMA CENTER IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank have decided to close the 
hospital's trauma center, dealing another blow to Los Angeles County's wobbly 
emergency services network, it was disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's board of governors recently decided to close the trauma center, 
which has lost $1.5 million annually for the last five years, said Mark Dundon, 
vice president of operations for the Sisters of Providence in Seattle, owners 
of the 647-bed hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Dundon said the decision to "discontinue" the hospital's participation in the 
county's trauma network came after many months of discussion among top hospital 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to employees in February, hospital official Daniel F. Fahey said 
that the hospital's financial losses have been caused by "grossly inadequate 
reimbursement by the county for these services. Such a large financial drain is 
clearly unacceptable and cannot continue, since it jeopardizes the viability of 
our other medical services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision This Week 
</P>
<P>
Fahey was not available for comment Monday, but hospital spokeswoman Gail Foy 
said that a decision about the trauma center would be announced by the end of 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price Hastings, chief of paramedics and trauma hospitals for Los 
Angeles County, said she has not yet been officially notified of the St. 
Joseph's decision, but said she believes from her conversations with hospital 
executives that they are intent on closure. By law, the hospital must give the 
county 60 days notice before closing the trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of if they're going to close, it's a matter of when," 
Hastings said. "It's clear we're going to have another large uncovered area" of 
the county not served by a trauma center, which is required to have such 
specialists as neurosurgeons and orthopedists on the premises or available 
within 30 minutes at all times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Emergency Rooms 
</P>
<P>
Trauma victims in the zone previously served by St. Joseph will instead have to 
rely on trauma centers farther away or on local emergency rooms, which may have 
less sophisticated equipment and fewer specialists on call. 
</P>
<P>
"If you need a surgeon, the doctors in the emergency room will call one, and 
the surgeon may or may not get there before you bleed to death. It's that 
simple," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when the trauma system was set up in Los Angeles County, eight of 
23 participating hospitals have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear we don't have a whole (trauma) system in the county any longer," 
Hastings said. "Some parts are functioning well, but there are large parts of 
the county that have no trauma service at all." 
</P>
<P>
She cited as examples parts of the San Gabriel Valley as well as a large area 
around Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centers in Pasadena, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
The trauma center at St. Joseph -- which treated 657 trauma patients in 1988 -- 
serves the city of Burbank and a large section of the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. The next closest trauma centers are located at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena, Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that if St. Joseph closes its trauma center, the county will contact 
these other hospitals to see if their trauma centers can accept additional 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
But paramedics warned that this is no long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hurtado, president of the United Paramedics of Los Angeles, a labor union, 
said that re-routing ambulances to more distant hospitals results in "longer 
transport times and longer response times" for ambulances "at increased 
jeopardy to patients and paramedics."

CHARGES FILED 2 MONTHS AFTER BRIDAL SHOWER BECAME BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"After a lengthy investigation," criminal charges have been filed against seven 
members of a Cerritos family who allegedly threw rocks and bottles at sheriff's 
deputies during a melee in February, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The street violence engulfed a usually quiet neighborhood while a bridal shower 
was going on inside a home on Noran Avenue inhabited by Arthur Dole and his 
seven children, aged 20 to 30 years old. About 50 friends and relatives 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said neighbors of the Doles had complained that the shower was becoming 
a raucous affair and developing into a street brawl. 
</P>
<P>
In quelling the disturbance, Reiner said, 15 deputies were injured, nine 
seriously enough to require medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Large People' 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, accompanied by Sheriff Sherman Block, noted that the seven defendants 
-- of whom four were charged with felonies, three with misdemeanors -- "were 
very large people," including Emily Dole, 31, a 350-pound wrestler known 
professionally as Mount Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the incident to the tragedy last weekend in Sheffield, England, where 
94 spectators were killed at a soccer match, Reiner said: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . When a group of people become a mob and they take over, it doesn't 
matter that it's a bridal shower; it doesn't matter that it's just a soccer 
game. A mob has a mentality of its own, and they're very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said his investigation showed that the incident was sparked when David 
Dole, 28, who Reiner said weighs 245 pounds, "attacked one of the sheriff's 
deputies, struck him and took him down to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Reiner said, Sale Paopao, 19, responded by "picking up a 
foot-and-a-half-long cinder block and heaving it at an officer. . . . Paopao is 
a very large man; he weighs 290 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deadly Acts of a Mob' 
</P>
<P>
Paopao's action, Reiner alleged, triggered "a shower of very large rocks and 
bottles filled with beer. . . . These were deadly acts of a mob that had been 
incited by one of their own. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
David Dole and Paopao were charged with felonies in a 10-count complaint filed 
in Los Cerritos Municipal Court. Also charged with felonies were John 
Talamaival, 28, and Mark Rodarte, 28. 
</P>
<P>
The four men were charged with assault with a deadly weapon against a peace 
officer, a felony, and misdemeanor rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Dole, Opa Tagaloa, 28, and Sheron Dole, 20, were charged with battery, 
obstructing a peace officer and rioting, all misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are to be arraigned May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said 23 others who attended the shower remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The clash with deputies generated an immediate protest among members of the 
county's Samoan community, which numbers about 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 Samoans sang hymns and prayed in their native language during a rally 
outside the sheriff's station in Carson, a community where thousands of Samoans 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The Samoans said they wanted an apology from deputies for what they claimed was 
unnecessary force used to break up the bridal shower. Neighbors interviewed by 
The Times vigorously denied that any rocks or bottles were thrown at the 
approximately four dozen officers who responded to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' Response 
</P>
<P>
"I told the police and the FBI that I didn't see anything being thrown," said 
one neighbor, who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, who claimed to view the entire incident from the arrival of 
the first deputies, also said "there was no rock throwing" and "I would go into 
court and say that." 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Fred Regan said the agency was conducting an investigation to 
determine if any civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, neighbors also expressed alarm after seeing what 
they described as deputies beating some of the defendants with clubs while they 
were handcuffed on the ground in front of the Dole home. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape taken by a neighbor shows deputies repeatedly hitting individuals 
lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But Block told reporters Monday that the actions of his officers were taken 
only when the handcuffed defendants "made efforts to get up off the ground" and 
that the blows were only "to the feet and lower extremities and did not create 
injuries. . . . (It) was not a wanton act of brutality." 
</P>
<P>
Block said his deputies followed "established policy for dealing with large 
parties" that get out of hand. His officers, he said, "absolutely, without 
question" conducted themselves properly. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the Doles, Garo Mardirossian, said he was "appalled that Reiner 
decided to file charges at such a late date. They waited 66 days to rewrite the 
police report to suit their purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why (the deputies) did what they did. The police precipitated the 
entire incident."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One firefighter was injured Monday in a blaze, which could be seen for miles, 
that started in a Baldwin Park garage and quickly spread to a nearby chicken 
coop and a storage shed due to high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Officials could not immediately determine the cause of the fire, which broke 
out at 4:44 p.m. in a garage at 3722 Maine Ave. and spread as embers were blown 
to the roofs of the other structures, Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Chris 
Button said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty spectacular, but no homes were burned. It was confined to three 
outbuildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 firefighters extinguished the fire by 5:40 p.m. One firefighter 
was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in good condition after being injured 
by an electrical shock, Button said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate damage estimate.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EVICTION ORDINANCE TARGETS DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who deal drugs in rented apartments or houses can be evicted by their 
landlords under an emergency ordinance passed by the Gardena City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which passed 
a similar ordinance last month, the council voted 4 to 0 in favor of the 
measure that permits landlords to evict tenants for selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A landlord would be required to seek eviction of such tenants after a request 
by the Police Department, the district attorney or the city attorney. Landlords 
failing to seek eviction of drug-dealing tenants within 60 days face fines of 
up to $5,000.

MOTHERS BEARING CAMERAS TAKE ON SPEED DEMONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 800 block of San Clemente's Calle Vallarta used to be a quiet, dead-end 
street where parents could let their children play with little fear of passing 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But 2 years ago, the hillside street was opened to connect with a new housing 
tract, and Calle Vallarta became a blazing raceway, with frenetic commuters 
speeding up to 50 m.p.h. through the 25-m.p.h. residential zone, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood's baby population exploded at the same time, increasing from 
about eight to two dozen. Suddenly, residents said, there was a much greater 
danger to toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the "vigilante mothers." 
</P>
<P>
First, the group of seven called police and begged for more enforcement of the 
neighborhood's speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
When the understaffed Police Department failed to assign more patrols, the 
mothers took it upon themselves to try to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning about a year ago, they stood on both sides of the street and shouted 
at speeding motorists to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
When this tactic was greeted with an occasional obscenity, one mother began 
videotaping offending drivers, threatening to turn the tape over to the police 
for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, 2 months ago, the mothers resorted to even more desperate measures. 
They scrawled their own speed limit signs -- with such not-so-subtle messages 
as "Slow Down" or "You Are Being Videotaped" -- and staked them out in their 
front yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Began Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
That got the city's attention. Several weeks ago, workers painted double yellow 
stripes down the middle of the street to deter motorists from using both lanes 
while rounding corners on the hill. They also posted an official speed limit 
sign. Police began conducting radar checks on the street, with Police Chief 
Albert C. Ehlow himself sitting in on one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
With the county's explosive growth, other communities have had similar 
problems, with the frequency of accidents involving pedestrians increasing. 
</P>
<P>
According to California Highway Patrol statistics, fatal county accidents in 
which pedestrians were killed by automobiles increased to 64 in 1988, from 51 
in 1987. Automobile-related pedestrian injuries increased from 996 to 1055 in 
the same period, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine, Dr. Phyllis Agran has been researching traffic-related injuries 
to children since 1980. Because some drivers zip through residential areas 
regardless of posted speed limits, Agran said it is important for parents to 
take special precautions with their children, especially toddlers, who are at a 
greater risk of being injured as traffic increases in once-quiet areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you mix children with vehicles and increase the number of vehicles, 
you're going to increase the risk of injury to children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way of preventing injuries is separating the children from the 
vehicles. Parents have to retrain their children that they cannot go in the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
Agran also suggested riding bicycles only on sidewalks and wearing helmets; 
taking children to play in parks, and dressing school-age children in 
reflective clothing if they have to be out in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
On Calle Vallarta, thanks to the activism of residents, motorists are slowing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
On April 5, Linda Smith, 44, mother of a 3-year-old boy and 
</P>
<P>
leader of the Calle Vallarta mothers' group, appeared before the City Council 
seeking continued city support for her neighborhood's speeding problem. 
</P>
<P>
The council was receptive, with Mayor Brian J. Rice asking Smith to report back 
about whether the city's speed control measures have helped to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to commend them," Rice said of the mothers. "They definitely got our 
attention -- and I'm glad." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Markley, one of the mothers, said the vigilante tactics probably 
prevented a serious accident. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't gotten as far as we had, there's no doubt in my mind that there 
would have been a tragic accident," said Markley, 38, mother of 8-month-old and 
3-year-old sons. "The main thing is not to make people aware after the fact, 
when a child is fighting for life in a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Keep Out of Street 
</P>
<P>
But Markley said that while she and the other mothers impress upon their 
children the importance of not going into the street, that does not always keep 
them from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with a child under 3 years old," Markley said. "If they just 
happen to forget, that could be it. I mean, you're talking paralyzed for life 
or killed, because of the way they (vehicles) fly through here -- so fast I 
sometimes can't even get the license plates." 
</P>
<P>
Calle Vallarta's speeding predicament is typical of many neighborhoods in the 
rapidly growing south county, where dead-end streets are opened to provide 
access to new tracts. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, where residential growth has been exploding in the rugged 
hills in the east of town, Chief Ehlow said he has received speeding complaints 
from many neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
None, he added, have become involved to the extent of the residents on Calle 
Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Days of Tickets 
</P>
<P>
The customary police response to speeding complaints, he said, is to dispatch 
officers to a neighborhood for a few days to write tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But Ehlow said the department, already understaffed by seven positions, does 
not have the manpower to spend much time on a street such as Calle Vallarta, 
with the city's 40 police officers kept busy tending to the problems in areas 
more heavily trafficked by the city's 37,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We go out and we work it as we can," Ehlow said, adding that officers will 
return periodically to Calle Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
Calle Vallarta used to be so quiet, residents said, that children safely flew 
kites in the middle of the street. When the street was opened up, Smith said, 
motorists on their way to the new Seaside Estates tract atop the hill would 
"gun it" to build momentum for the final steep grade. Since the 800 block of 
Calle Vallarta lies on flat terrain between two steep grades, Smith said it 
became a favorite spot to accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accident Dramatized Danger 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been no serious traffic injuries reported on the street 
since the upper Calle Vallarta housing tract was built nearly 10 years ago, 
Smith said a non-injury accident 2 months ago dramatized the potential danger. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly man, test-driving a new luxury-model automobile, reportedly had a 
blowout and lost control, crashing into a park area where children play. The 
vehicle sustained only minor damage, but Smith and other residents -- who 
believe the man was speeding -- said the accident could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, residents and police agree, traffic has slowed dramatically. 
Ehlow said officers he has posted have cited violators only sporadically in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat there myself for almost an hour," Ehlow said. "I counted 16 cars going 
down the hill and five up the hill, and none were speeding." 
</P>
<P>
Several residents of the Seaside Estates tract above Calle Vallarta said the 
activism of their neighbors downhill had deterred them from speeding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slamming on the Brakes 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself slamming on my brakes if I do 30," said Lori Twilegar, 26, a 
Seaside Estates resident. 
</P>
<P>
The Calle Vallarta mothers are still not entirely satisfied. Although traffic 
has slowed, Smith said she is worried that it will speed back up as soon as the 
city diverts its attention from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
And with summer coming and teen-agers out of school, Smith said the city needs 
to keep on top of the problem, perhaps by installing speed bumps, 
children-at-play signs and maybe another speed limit sign or two. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is," she said, "that we will see this speeding continue."

NO MOTIVE, SUSPECTS IN MISSION VIEJO SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
VICTIM OF FATAL STABBING IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Authorities Monday identified a Mission Viejo man found dead in his home this 
weekend as David Werner, 72, a retired stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
He died of suffocation and several stab wounds to the upper body, according to 
a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Werner's body was found in his bed about 1 a.m. Sunday by his daughter, 
Deborah, 40, who lived at the single-family home with him. 
</P>
<P>
He retired from Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment banking firm, in March, 
1981. Werner moved to his ranch-style home on the corner of the 27000 block of 
El Moro from Lake Forest last year, authorities and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had no suspects, nor had they determined a motive. The cause of 
death was determined by a preliminary autopsy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors remembered Werner as an amiable man. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing him working on his garden last week. He was a really nice 
person," neighbor Lori Jones said. "He was quiet but always made a point to 
stop and say hello." 
</P>
<P>
"He used to let us play in his yard while he watched TV," said Jonathan 
Freeman, 9, "or sometimes he would just come out and watch us play." 
</P>
<P>
Others on the small cul-de-sac said they did not know much about Werner and his 
daughter. Several said he was a quiet and peaceful person. His death, they 
said, came as a shock to the neighborhood and left many residents fearful for 
their family's safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a newborn baby and small children," one neighbor said. "This really 
makes me uneasy." 
</P>
<P>
The man, who asked not to be identified, added that the lack of information 
about the killing makes him more nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies are trying to determine a motive, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said Werner's home had been ransacked, but no items have been reported 
missing, which would suggest that robbery was not the motive. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said investigators have also not detected a forced entry into the house. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies parked a surveillance trailer at the home, locked doors and windows to 
the home and guarded the area Monday as the investigation continued. 
</P>
<P>
Werner's daughter is not staying at the home and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Werner is survived by her and by two brothers, of Fountain 
Valley and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Olson declined to comment on whether investigators believe that the victim knew 
his killer.

BUS FARE TO RISE A NICKEL; TRANSFER FEE IMPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's soon going to cost a nickel more for most Orange County commuters to ride 
the bus. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost revenue for a bus operation that recovers less than a 
fourth of its costs from passengers, Orange County Transit District board 
members voted 5 to 0 Monday to raise the current 80-cent fare to 85 cents on 
July 1, except in certain cases involving seniors and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was approved after a public hearing at OCTD headquarters in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The fare increase is needed to make sure that the district meets its minimum 
fare box recovery, which has been a problem at OCTD in the past," said County 
Supervisor and OCTD Board Chairman Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Fare box return -- the percentage of OCTD expenses offset by passenger fares -- 
is projected to rise slightly above the current 22.8% to about 24% as a result 
of the increase approved Monday. The rest of OCTD's revenue comes from local, 
state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The last OCTD fare hike -- also a nickel -- took effect July 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Monday's action, the OCTD board imposed it's first-ever transfer 
fee, also a nickel. A transfer fee is charged whenever a rider changes buses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stated Their Cases 
</P>
<P>
Two elderly and 2 disabled people testified during the public hearing, 
contending that seniors and the handicapped already face economic hardships and 
should not have to pay more for public transportation. Their comments helped 
persuade OCTD board members to exempt the two groups from some increases, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors will not have to pay the nickel fare increase for fixed-route OCTD 
service, such as a scheduled run from South Coast Plaza to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers on Dial-A-Ride, the district's door-to-door van service arranged by 
appointment, will have to pay $1.70 compared to the current fare of $1.60. But 
the elderly and handicapped are also exempt from that increase. Although the 
van service was initiated to serve seniors and the disabled, the OCTD board 
opened it to all riders in hopes that it would get more commuters in the habit 
of using public transportation. However, the board now is considering again 
limiting it to seniors and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The fare hikes are expected to increase district revenues by about $1.4 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
The regular bus fare in Los Angeles is $1.10, according to a spokesman for the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District, which recovers only about 13% of 
its costs through fares. Seniors pay 55 cents. RTD does not provide Dial-A-Ride 
service. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to OCTD, Orange County has two other public transit systems: 
</P>
<P>
Vans operated by the Consolidated Transportation Service Agency charge $1 for 
first 10 miles and $1 for each additional 10 miles, for handicapped and the 
"frail elderly" anywhere in county. (Dial-A-Ride is restricted to trips within 
small zones). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Municipal Transit operates three, fixed-route buses with fares at 
50 cents. Seniors currently ride free, but they will soon be required to pay 25 
cents, according to Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors and the disabled account for about 10% of OCTD's ridership, which 
surpassed 35 million trips annually in 1987-88. The district's bus and 
Dial-A-Ride van fleets total 582 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Board members on Monday also agreed to ask the Orange County Transportation 
Commission -- which coordinates all county transportation -- to re-evaluate 
some of the rail service proposed in the commission's 20-year 
transportation-improvement program. The board decided that the 20-year plan 
will not provide sufficient funding to expand rail service along the Los 
Angeles-San Diego corridor enough to significantly reduce automobile traffic.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
The Times incorrectly reported Tuesday that the Orange County Transit District 
intends to impose a 5-cent transfer fee for changing buses. There will be no 
such fee. In the same story, the amount of Southern California Rapid Transit 
District costs that are recovered through fare-box revenue was misstated. It is 
40%, the RTD said.

The editorial "A Major March" (April 11) missed the mark badly when it said, " 
. . . The (Supreme) court must look beyond legal principle to tenable social 
policy and good sense. . . ." Wrong, wrong, wrong! That is precisely what it 
must not do. Deciding what laws make sense and are good social policy are not 
the constitutional function of the Supreme Court. That power resides in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The proper function of the Supreme Court is to decide, when cases are brought 
before it, whether the laws written by Congress are constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is entrusted with making the laws, and for this reason the founders 
made the term of a congressman only two years. The idea was to make Congress 
responsive to the people. In contrast, the founders provided for Supreme Court 
justices to be appointed for life. This was intended to make them nonresponsive 
to the people, so they could avoid the influence of public hysteria and make 
wise decisions based solely on legal principles and the Constitution. To allow 
(or encourage) the Supreme Court to make laws is extremely dangerous. If they 
can make laws, there is no limit to their power and no way to get them out.

AN OLD-FASHIONED JOURNALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Kenny McClatchy, known simply as C.K., inherited enough newspapers and 
enough money to work at anything he wanted to or at nothing at all. He chose 
journalism, and over the years his quiet, stubborn brand of integrity kept 
raising standards not only for his own newspapers but for all of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Slim, patrician and slightly old-fashioned, McClatchy often seemed out of place 
in an era of leveraged buyouts and manipulative politics, but he was never out 
of touch. After taking over the family chain of Bee newspapers, the first of 
which was founded in Sacramento by his great-grandfather in 1857, he set an 
uncompromising tone for editorials and news coverage that chopped away at 
pretense, sham and lapses in honesty at whatever risk of retaliation in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, having expanded the chain of California newspapers by purchasing 
papers in Washington and Alaska, McClatchy used the forum of the 
Press-Enterprise lectures at UC Riverside last year to attack chain 
newspapering. 
</P>
<P>
Mergers and buyouts, he said, too often put people with no newspaper tradition 
in charge of newspapers and made companies of all kinds less responsive to 
public interest. "The public and the government increasingly accept what used 
to be unacceptable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for his own newspapers and the many others that admired and 
identified with his high standards, C.K., who died at age 62 while jogging in 
Sacramento Sunday, never had any trouble identifying the unacceptable or any 
qualms about attacking it.

I was a member of the delegation from Los Angeles that had a scheduled and

WRIGHT SHOULD RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve years ago, as the U.S. House of Representatives debated a sweeping 
code-of-conduct resolution for itself, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. argued 
forcefully against an amendment that would have deleted a strict limit on 
members' outside income. To leave out such an important provision, he argued, 
even if all such income were disclosed publicly, "creates in the public mind a 
suspicion of conflict, a suspicion of impropriety . . . The issue is 
credibility, restoring public confidence in this Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Credibility . . . Public confidence . . . To rise above any suspicion of 
conflict or impropriety. That was the issue in 1977 in the wake of a flurry of 
congressional ethics cases. And that is the issue today, as House Speaker Jim 
Wright (D-Texas) stands accused by the House Ethics Committee of 69 violations 
of the rules, including an alleged "scheme to evade" the limits on outside 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Wright has only been accused. He has not been convicted of 
anything. But that is not the point. The point is that as a leader of the 
House, Wright has failed the test set by Tip O'Neill and the rest of that body 
when it set certain standards of ethical conduct for its members. 
</P>
<P>
By failing that test, Wright has broken the bond of trust and confidence he 
needs to continue as an effective officer of the House. For the good of the 
House of Representatives, for the good of the Democratic Party and for the good 
of the nation, Wright should resign his speakership now. 
</P>
<P>
In defending himself against the allegations the other day, Wright declared 
that, in his mind, he did not violate any rules or any commonly accepted 
standards of ethical conduct. He further claimed that he was the victim of 
changing rules and standards. Financial dealings undertaken in good faith in 
past years now are being judged differently, as through a rear-view mirror, the 
Speaker said. But there is nothing new about the rules Wright is accused of 
violating: They go back at least a dozen years. And these are not old charges 
dredged up from the past, but involve alleged violations as recent as last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
These are not idle charges. If they were, 12 members of the Ethics Committee -- 
six Democrats and six Republicans -- would not have voted unanimously to issue 
its report finding reason to believe Wright violated the rules. That is an 
unprecedented action that would trigger an extraordinary cycle of events 
similar to the impeachment of a President. 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough for Wright, or any Speaker, to merely adhere to the law by the 
narrowest of technicalities. The Speaker and others entrusted with special 
leadership positions must scrupulously avoid any appearance of conflict of 
interest or questionable financial dealings. Wright violated this standard and 
because of that, his Speakership is crippled. 
</P>
<P>
Most important to him, Wright said, is to defend his personal reputation and 
personal honor. He will have ample opportunity to do that in the days to come. 
But only by resigning the speakership can he conduct that battle without 
paralyzing the work of Congress for weeks and months to come.

THE AMNESTY VOTE IN URUGUAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome of Sunday's special plebiscite in Uruguay was more pragmatic than 
inspiring. A bare majority of the nation's 2.3 million voters, 52%, chose to 
uphold an amnesty law that prevents the persecution of military officers 
accused of abusing human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to a military takeover in 1973, Uruguayans had proudly regarded their 
nation as the "Switzerland of South America" because of its tradition of 
democratic government. But when the military seized power after several years 
of political turmoil and terrorism, Uruguay's noble traditions were forgotten. 
The generals detained thousands of people merely suspected of subversion, 
torturing many. The effect of such massive repression on a nation of only 3 
million people was dramatic. At one point, Uruguay had more political prisoners 
per capita than any other nation in the world. 
</P>
<P>
A series of economic failures and other political setbacks persuaded the 
generals to give up power in 1985. But they pressured the new civilian 
government to grant an amnesty to 180 officers, accused in lawsuits -- filed 
after the military stepped aside -- of having violated human rights. President 
Julio Maria Sanguinetti signed the amnesty law, saying it was a distasteful but 
necessary step to ensure continued civilian government. But many Uruguyans 
disagreed. More than half a million signed petitions that forced Sanguinetti to 
call for a plebiscite on the amnesty issue, and more than 770,000 persons voted 
to repeal the law. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority agreed with Sanguinetti -- that it is time for Uruguay to forget 
the past and move on. While that decision is morally troubling, one can still 
take some hope from the plebsecite. The voting was peaceful and conducted in a 
spirit of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a leader of the anti-amnesty campaign said, "The people have 
expressed themselves freely, and we are going to respect this democratic 
outcome." At least the democratic tradition that existed before 1973 has not 
been forgotten.

It is often instructive to hear the views of an outside party in order to gain 
some perspective on a problem which, because of its familiarity, has become 
virtually invisible to those whom it should concern most. Dr. Suresh Vidya's 
comments regarding the homeless (letter, April 7) should, therefore, be taken 
very seriously. After an absence of 10 years, the doctor was shocked to see the 
apparent decline in our standard of living in such a short time. What, the 
doctor asks, has happened here in the last 10 years?

What indeed? Could the systematic gutting of social programs to fund an 
increasingly voracious and monstrously inefficient military be at fault? Could 
a steady diet of propaganda about welfare queens in Cadillacs and the virtues 
of self-reliance have something to do with it? Perhaps the explosion of cocaine 
abuse and the coddling of drug lords to facilitate misguided foreign-policy 
objectives had some kind of impact? Has the utter failure of the private 
sector, in the absence of any federal help, to provide decent, affordable 
housing been a factor?

In short, Dr. Vidya, Ronald Reagan happened to this country.

MINING, POLLUTION BATTER ONCE-BOUNTIFUL VENTURA; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISTS TRY TO STEM RIVER'S TIDE OF DECAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Long gone are the days when hotels reserved entire floors for out-of-town 
fishermen tempted by the thousands of steelhead that could be seen splashing in 
the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has passed the time when a tourist guide could gush, as one did in 
1911, that "a fine stream flows into the ocean at the west end of the city, and 
from May to October the breakfast tables of Ventura need never go troutless." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, dams, diversions, mining and pollution have battered the 
once-bountiful river, from its convergence with Matilija Creek 16 miles north 
to the brackish lagoon at its mouth near the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Left in between are countless stretches of parched stone, bulldozer-scarred 
banks and no more than 100 of the legendary seagoing steelhead trout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Interest 
</P>
<P>
Yet a growing interest in the river is beginning to stem that tide of decay. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of an ambitious four-year study of the lower river and tidal 
estuary being conducted by UC Santa Barbara is expected to be completed this 
summer. Researchers hope that the report, which is the first attempt to analyze 
plants, soil and water quality in the area, will eventually persuade state 
officials to preserve the river's mouth as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, environmental groups are rallying to challenge a sand and gravel 
company's application to continue mining from 50,000 to 250,000 tons annually 
from the river bed about 1 1/2 miles upstream. Recently those groups expressed 
their concerns in a meeting with Ventura County planning officials, who will 
require Southern Pacific Milling Co. to undergo an environmental review later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the river were also buoyed last summer when the California Supreme 
Court rejected a proposed agreement between Ventura and the Casitas Municipal 
Water District to divert part of the stream as reserve for use in a drought. 
The court ruled that, even though officials had vowed to limit any ecological 
damage, the loss of water would probably decimate the few remaining trout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Stagnant Pool' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing is to pass on to the public that this isn't 
just a stagnant puddle of water with no value," said Wayne R. Ferren Jr., 
curator of the UCSB Herbarium and coordinator of the university's study. "A lot 
of people don't realize that they have a gem in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for people accustomed to seeing rushing water in their rivers, the 
Ventura might seem more like a lump of coal. Low stream flow, exacerbated by 
three years of drought, makes walking long stretches of the river bed in tennis 
shoes a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The natural beauty is not enhanced by the industrial plants and oil fields that 
line its banks where the river parallels Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
High above, in the Ojai Valley, the Matilija Dam, a 152-foot-high concrete 
monolith built in 1948, holds back the flow that once made the stream the 
world's second-most-prolific trout habitat, behind the Santa Ynez River in 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remarkable Resiliency 
</P>
<P>
But for all that, the Ventura River has shown remarkable resiliency. Fed by 
four mountain creeks, it has still managed to sustain abundant plant and animal 
life. Idyllic nooks dot the stream's length. And its lower stretches are among 
only 25% of the state's coastal wetlands that have managed so far to survive 
20th-Century development. 
</P>
<P>
In the 200-acre area being studied by UCSB, more than 30 different types of 
vegetation have been identified, including salt marshes, black cottonwood 
forests, intertidal cobble zones and riparian scrub. At least 230 plant species 
have been noted, including the California walnut, pickle weed, salt grass and 
bulrush. About 200 bird species have been spotted, including snowy egrets, 
Virginia rails, merlins and ruddy turnstones. 
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers bathe the dunes near the ocean in splashes of lavender and yellow. 
Flocks of red-winged blackbirds stir up a ruckus in the tall reeds. Flowering 
green duckweed floats on the surface of small tidal pools near the river's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"If your measure of health is a river loaded with 10-pound fish, then obviously 
this river is not very healthy," said Mark Capelli, executive director of the 
1,700-member Friends of the Ventura River. "But there are a lot of other 
resources -- maybe a bit more subtle -- that show the river is still enormously 
vigorous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1990 Survey 
</P>
<P>
UCSB researchers intend to make those resources more overt. In June, they will 
deliver a report that state officials paid $4,000 for, cataloguing plant life 
in the surrounding Emma Wood State Beach wetlands. With other grants, they will 
publish a final survey in 1990 recommending various methods of restoring and 
maintaining the ecologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
The project, they hope, will lead to greater appreciation of the lower river 
and its estuary, as well as to the creation of nature trails, guide books and 
informational maps. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just nothing indicating to the public the value of the site," Ferren 
said. "And the more enlightened the public is about our resources, the more 
protection we'll have for them." 
</P>
<P>
The river, which for thousands of years had sustained the Chumash Indians, 
suffered a blow when oil was discovered at the west end of the city in 1916. 
For years, during the first heavy rain of the season, the oil companies used 
the waters to rinse their holding ponds of drilling-mud and brine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, through World War II, the Ventura River supported a substantial 
steelhead population, estimated to have been as high as 4,000 or 5,000 fish. A 
1911 newspaper story reported a hefty trout caught by one George Pacheco that 
measured 3 feet and weighed 14 pounds. Fishermen, who competed in annual 
contests sponsored by sporting goods stores, lined up by the hundreds for the 
season's opening day. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the Matilija Dam was built 40 years ago to reduce flood hazards 
and provide additional water for neighboring communities that the trout stock 
began to dwindle. The Casitas Dam, built in 1959 about 6 1/2 miles from the 
river's mouth, sounded the death knell. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more environmental hazards have been faced, including the Oak View 
Sanitation District's sewage facility, which discharges treated effluent about 
4 1/2 miles above the river's mouth; a now-defunct Shell Oil Co. chemical 
plant, which was found guilty of dumping ammonia in the river in 1972; and 
Southern Pacific Milling Co., which began its mining operation in the river bed 
and surrounding flood plain in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura River represents, one way or another, just about everything man 
can do to degrade a natural environment," said Charlie Price, president of 
Friends of the Ventura River and a former county fish and game commissioner. 
"It's been a steady, long-term deterioration."

GROUP SEEKS INCREASE IN MINORITY TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Decrying what they called an appalling lack of minority teachers in the public 
schools, educators from across the state gathered in Newport Beach on Monday to 
seek ways to increase the number of minority instructors from kindergarten 
through 12th grade and on into college. 
</P>
<P>
"We predict that we will need more than 80,000 new teachers in this state over 
the next 9 years," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to State Supt. 
of Public Instruction Bill Honig. "The majority of the students in many 
districts are minorities and it only makes sense that we get an equitable 
number of minority teachers into the teaching pool." 
</P>
<P>
But many of the nearly 200 educators who gathered at Hotel Meridien agreed that 
the obstacles to minority recruiting are substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our number (of minority teachers) is abysmal," said Paul B. 
Gussman, a spokesman for the state Intersegmental Coordinating Council. "It's 
largely because we have no pipeline. We have no system that says teaching is 
honorable and is something that is terribly important to our society. We have 
lost any sense of idealism (about teaching) that we once had." 
</P>
<P>
Gussman said that one of the council's main goals in the recruitment of 
minority teachers is to try to instill the notion that teaching is of prime 
importance, has a powerful effect on society, and improves it as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"Once someone has got his or her degree, coming up with reasons for them to 
(accept) a huge salary sacrifice -- a choice that they are often confronted 
with -- is very tough," Gussman said. "(We) have to appeal to their higher 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-day conference, entitled "Increasing Faculty Diversity," is sponsored by 
the coordinating council, an agency of the California Education Round Table 
which is affiliated with the State Department of Instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The council is made up of representatives from the state's 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade school districts, community colleges, the 
University of California, the California State University system and various 
private universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really about educational quality and social fairness. Hispanics, blacks 
and Asians are often radically under-represented in the teaching ranks," said 
council Executive Director Mark G. Edelstein. "This needs to change. These kids 
need positive role models for their success." 
</P>
<P>
The educators formed about 30 teams from the council to carry the message 
throughout the state. The mission of the teams will be to meet and develop 
methods on the local level to improve the numbers of minority teachers. The 
group also called for a corporate-sponsored center to coordinate statewide 
recruiting of minority instructors.

RED SOX RALLY FOR 6-4 VICTORY

<P>
Like the Boston Marathon leaders passing near Fenway Park, the Boston Red Sox 
had a finishing kick. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Mike Greenwell and Marty Barrett, the Red Sox rallied for five runs in 
the eighth inning Monday to beat the Baltimore Orioles, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell triggered the rally with a two-run homer and Barrett capped it with a 
two-run single. In between, Rick Cerone got an RBI with a bases-loaded walk. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ellis (Burks) led off the eighth with a triple, we knew we were going to 
pull it out," Barrett said. "Then two pitches later Greenwell hit the home run 
and we were ahead 3-2." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell said his fourth homer of the season came off a changeup by reliever 
Brian Holton (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to stay on it because it was up," Greenwell said. "If it were down, 
it would've been a different story." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles scored two runs in the ninth, but fell short in their bid to win 
consecutive games on the road for the first time since August 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Holton is going to have to establish his fastball in this league," Baltimore 
Manager Frank Robinson said. "If ballclubs are patient enough, they can give 
him a tough time late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't get much help from the Baltimore bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
With two on in the eighth, Mark Williamson came in and walked two batters to 
force in a run. Kevin Hickey replaced Williamson and struck out Wade Boggs 
before Barrett lined a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally got a hit with the bases loaded and it won us a game," Boston 
Manager Joe Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles opened the ninth with three singles off Lee Smith (1-1) who 
replaced starter Wes Gardner in the eighth. The third single, by Randy 
Milligan, drove in Cal Ripken and made it 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stanley relieved Smith and got Francisco Melendez on a fielder's choice 
before pinch-hitter Jim Traber made it 6-4 with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley then earned his second save by retiring Rene Gonzales on a game-ending 
fielder's choice. Gardner went seven innings, allowing four hits and matching 
his career high with eight strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first on a double by Barrett, a pair of walks and 
a sacrifice fly by Jim Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner retired the first nine batters before Brady Anderson opened the fourth 
with a ground double just inside the first base bag. Anderson took third on 
Phil Bradley's bloop single and scored the tying run as Mike Devereaux grounded 
into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore took a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning when Gonzales walked, stole 
second and third and scored on an infield grounder. Gonzales, who stole only 
two bases in 92 games last year, has four steals this season.

When Carl Hinds was deciding whether he wanted to continue playing competitive 
tennis after high school, he knew it would not be in his native Australia. 
</P>
<P>
There are no teams on the college level, and only a select few make it to the 
country's sports academy. Hinds, who played on club teams and won the Victorian 
18-and-under Schoolboys' Championship in 1986, knew he would have to look to 
the United States to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds and his father came to the West Coast last summer to get a firsthand look 
and to talk with coaches. He settled on San Diego State, but there were 
problems with transferring units from another school. So, San Diego State Coach 
Hugh Bream told Hinds to contact Saddleback College Coach Bill Otta because 
Hinds would have a much easier time getting into a community college. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds, 20, contacted Otta in September, and after being accepted, started 
classes in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really tough decision to leave all my friends to come here," Hinds 
said. "But I had to decide how much a part of my life I wanted tennis to be and 
the time was right to do it now." 
</P>
<P>
Hinds, along with Ed Peregrino, have helped Saddleback remain the top-ranked 
men's tennis team in the state. Hinds is the second-ranked singles player in 
the state and Peregrino is third. Hinds went from unknown to the top five when 
he won a singles tournament in Santa Barbara in January, before the dual-match 
season started. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds has built a 17-1 record in dual matches. He is 10-0 in Orange Empire 
Conference play for first-place Saddleback. His only loss came against Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a few calls like that each year," Otta said of the call from San Diego 
State. "Very seldom does something ever come out of it. But this time, we got a 
pretty good player out of it. At first, I figured that he would be about our 
No. 3 or 4 player, but he's really come on." 
</P>
<P>
Hinds says California is very much like his hometown of Victoria, and he has 
had very little trouble adjusting. He says the climate and the life style are 
pretty much the same. But everything isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds, who rents a room in San Juan Capistrano, doesn't have a car. Instead, he 
has to depend on rides from teammates to and from school as well as other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad is the one with the funds and he doesn't think I need a car," Hinds said. 
"Meanwhile, he's bloody bouncing around on a kangaroo and I'm here stuck 
without transportation," Hinds joked. 
</P>
<P>
Men's tennis showdown: Saddleback plays host to Orange Coast (9-1 in 
conference) at 2 today for the conference title. Saddleback won the first 
meeting, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
OCC, ranked third in the state, is led by singles players Eric Rebitzer, ranked 
No. 7 in the state, and John Gabriel, who is ranked No. 15. Saddleback's 
doubles team of Peregrino and Jamil Atcha and Orange Coast's team of Rebitzer 
and Gabriel are tied for second in the state doubles ranking. 
</P>
<P>
In women's tennis, Orange Coast (10-0 in conference) can clinch the conference 
title Thursday when it travels to Golden West (9-1). Golden West's only loss 
came earlier this season to Orange Coast, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast crew: The Orange Coast Freshman Eight defeated California to win 
its division in the Stanford Rowing tournament on San Francisco Bay Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates won the final race in 5 minutes 57 seconds over California (6:11). 
Orange Coast beat UCLA, 6:06 to 6:20, in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
In the JV Eight, Orange Coast defeated UCLA, 6:07 to 6:10, for third place. 
Orange Coast lost to Brown, 5:52 to 5:59, in the semifinals. Brown went on to 
win the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast baseball player Eddie Pierce has signed with Tennessee, Orange 
Coast said Monday. Pierce, a left-handed outfielder and relief pitcher, is 
hitting .346 this season. He also is 3-0 with three saves as a pitcher. He 
played his freshman season at UC Santa Barbara before transferring to OCC this 
season. . . . This has been a painful season for Cypress batters, who have been 
hit by a pitch a conference-leading 39 times in 36 games. Doug Yates and Bobby 
Thome have been hit nine times each and Brett Gregory has been plunked seven 
times. . . . Jack Bailey set a Rancho Santiago record for career innings 
pitched Saturday when he went the first seven as the Dons defeated Riverside, 
19-2. Bailey has pitched 187 2/3 innings, passing David Tellers, who pitched 
186 1/3 in 1987 and '88. Tellers is 11-2 this season for San Jose State. . . . 
Rancho Santiago softball pitcher Natalie Sanchez has not allowed an earned run 
in her last 47 innings. . . . Mike Varos, who made a Cypress record 78 
three-pointers last season, was voted the basketball team's most valuable 
player.

LINCOLN'S WILHITE TO PLAY BASKETBALL WITH THE TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Wilhite, a 6-foot-8, 230-pound forward from San Diego Lincoln High 
School, has signed a national letter of intent to play basketball at Cal State 
Fullerton and will deliver it to the school today, Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is not valid under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules until it 
is delivered to the school and filed in the conference office. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds a game this season for Lincoln, 
which finished 27-2, losing to Morningside in the first round of the state 
playoffs. He also set a San Diego Section record for rebounds in a game with 39 
against Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
Loneski said Wilhite had visited San Diego State and Oregon State and decided 
on Fullerton in part because of the school's engineering department.

General Automation, a financially ailing computer maker, said Monday that it 
expects to report its first profitable quarter in nearly 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim company also said it has promoted Douglas J. Tullio to president. 
The position had been vacant since the resignation in January of W. Norris 
Agee. 
</P>
<P>
Tullio has previously headed General Automation's operations in North America. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation said it expects net income for the fiscal third quarter 
ended March 31 to be $103,000 on revenue of about $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company's last profitable quarter was the one ended in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In January, General Automation gave Sanderson Electronics PLC the option to 
acquire a majority of General Automation in exchange for a $1.75-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
For the 6 months ended Dec. 31, General Automation lost $1.9 million on revenue 
of $19.8 million.

STATE SAYS NEWPORT INSURER IS INSOLVENT, SEIZES CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Insurance said Monday that it has seized control of 
California Benefit Life Insurance Co. in Newport Beach, contending that the 
small health insurer is insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it sought court approval to take over the company after an 
examination of California Benefit's books showed a deficit of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge earlier this month granted the 
department's request to transfer control of the company to Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who was appointed conservator of California 
Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
California Benefit strenuously disputed the department's assessment of its 
financial health. The company pleaded in court that appointing a conservator 
could "destroy" the firm within a few weeks by driving away customers. 
</P>
<P>
Another hearing on the conservatorship is scheduled next month. 
</P>
<P>
California Benefit writes health insurance through groups of small employers. 
It also sells individual policies to supplement Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The company has about 3,000 individual policyholders. The number of group 
health insurance customers was not available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company will service its policies as usual while trying to replenish its 
cash reserves, the Insurance Department said. 
</P>
<P>
If the company does not eventually shore up its financial condition to the 
satisfaction of the Insurance Department, the final step would be a bankruptcy 
filing, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
President and Chief Executive Officer Joseph F. Bartholomew has denied in court 
papers that the company has too little money to run the business or pay claims 
on its policies. California Benefit is taking in $3 million a month in 
premiums, he said, or about $400,000 more than its expenses, including claims. 
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the Insurance Department's estimate that the company needs 
$2.8 million in cash to meet its capital reserve requirements under state law. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bartholomew has said an investor has already put $2.8 million 
into an account for the company. 
</P>
<P>
But the Insurance Department disputed Bartholomew's statements in its court 
filing, saying California Benefit failed in four previous bids to gain the 
needed financing. And, the department said, the $2.8-million deal would require 
giving 51% of the company's stock to the unnamed investor. 
</P>
<P>
The change in ownership would require Insurance Department approval, which the 
department said California Benefit had yet to request. 
</P>
<P>
The department also challenged Bartholomew's statement that the company had had 
no trouble paying claims on policies. The department said in court papers that 
it had received many complaints from policyholders about the company's "failure 
to pay its claims." 
</P>
<P>
The department said its Consumer Services Division had recently received nine 
complaints, seven of which turned out to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparently those complaints and the company's financial statements that 
prompted the Insurance Department to examine the company's books in September. 
</P>
<P>
By late last year, the department said, the company had $4.7 million in assets 
and $7 million in liabilities, and had made "serious misstatements of income, 
surplus and reserve charges." 
</P>
<P>
California Benefit was founded in 1984. From the beginning, Bartholomew and his 
partners concentrated on niche markets too specialized for many of the industry 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
One of those niches was selling health insurance through small employers. By 
banding together in what the industry calls multiple-employer trusts, small 
companies can get better rates for group health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
California Benefit also moved into the business of selling policies to 
supplement Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The company is now a subsidiary of CBL Group Inc., of which Los Angeles 
businessman James Sobieski owns the largest share, 22.6%. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong at California Benefit is not clear from the court filings, but 
the company has been shutting down some of its group health plans recently. 
Bartholomew did not return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the company still believes that it would close in a matter of 
weeks if a conservator is appointed, Jeffrey P. Thomas, the company's attorney, 
responded: "We'll have to wait another few weeks to see."

REFRESHING REGGAE, PRAISE BE, FOLLOWS IRVINE SHOW'S TEACHING, PREACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Drum rolls and synthesized music of the spheres swirled with portent, then a 
figure robed in priestly vestments appeared, stretched out his arms and said, 
"Behold." 
</P>
<P>
A glitzy holiday extravaganza at the Crystal Cathedral? No, just a Sunday-night 
reggae show at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The self-consciously beatific entrance was cause for fretting, even though the 
man in the holy Rastafarian trappings was Bunny Wailer, last living founder of 
the Wailers, a band that had few rivals in creating music with lasting 
spiritual and social impact. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer (given name: Neville Livingston) had come to teach and preach, and 
that's about all he did during the first half of a show that lasted more than 2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even a good sermon can become wearisome unless there is some climactic occasion 
to lend the words special weight or some special brilliance to the discourse 
that raises it from mere instruction to memorable storytelling. While any tour 
by the reclusive Wailer is a special occasion for reggae fans, the Jamaican 
singer's first hour on stage turned into sermonizing, not storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
There was no questioning the virtue or importance of Wailer's message, which 
proclaimed the need for justice, freedom and a sense of individual self-worth. 
Wailer also brought some special strengths to the delivery of songs with social 
themes and spiritual resonances: a gentleness that allowed him to be trenchant 
without sounding strident and a sense of proportion that enabled him to be 
urgent, yet not hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer's socio-spiritual rambles included some solid material -- first from his 
early days as a Wailer and as a solo artist, then from his new album, 
"Liberation." But the songs and lofty spoken interludes added up to something 
more didactic than enthralling. It didn't help that Wailer had to compete with 
a rumbling, overamplified bass. 
</P>
<P>
Just when one began to wonder whether he might be more interested in occupying 
a pulpit than a concert stage, Wailer changed everything. Reggae, he declared, 
is intended to refresh the body and soul as well as stir the mind and spirit. 
Off came the robes embroidered with Rasta iconography; out came Wailer in 
dancing trim, and away went the whole 20-member ensemble -- including two 
wonderfully limber and athletic male dancers -- for an excursion that was 
refreshment with a capital R. 
</P>
<P>
The songs, including a sharp Wailers medley in honor of the group's other 
co-founders, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, were catchy, lively reggae dance music 
that seemed a special treat after the heavy early going. The Bunny Wailer who 
had seemed so imposingly patriarchal showed that he can also be a strutting, 
whirling party hound of the first order. 
</P>
<P>
The second half's easy fun made the first half's lofty seriousness seem more 
palatable in retrospect. But Wailer's final number pointed to how the best rock 
songs can unite fun with seriousness. The song was "Keep On Moving," a 
deceptively catchy Wailers gem that, if you concentrate on the words, is about 
an innocent poor man hounded by false criminal accusations. For the most part, 
Wailer's musical sermons early in the show could only tell about injustice. 
"Keep On Moving," besides its uncommon melodic strengths, conjured up a story 
that showed injustice happening. "Show, don't tell" is one homily that 
songwriters can take as gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer's set capped a 6-hour evening steeped in reggae tradition. Second-billed 
Judy Mowatt, a longtime member of Marley's I-Threes backup vocal group, 
displayed a superb, flexible voice that can handle rootsy reggae as well as 
pop-soul stylings. There was a substantial gap, however, between Mowatt's own 
material and the Wailers songs -- especially a moving "No Woman No Cry" -- that 
highlighted her hourlong set. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Tosh, Peter's son, also had his best moment with a playful rendition of 
a Wailers song, "I'm the Toughest." Tosh also sang a plaintive yet strangely 
impersonal song addressed to his father's murderers. 
</P>
<P>
The Skatalites, a horn-driven band that was crucial to reggae's birth in the 
early 1960s, got the audience hopping gleefully as it offered quick-stepping 
ska rhythms and sax and trumpet solos in a jazzy, lightly tootling style. But 
the 10-man band, which included seven original members, performed with too much 
reserve for its lighthearted style of music, and an upright bass boomed 
annoyingly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Ras Michael began the day with a spare, percussive set built around prayerful 
traditional reggae songs in what amounted to an opening benediction.

 The only thing more hellish than war is its uncivilized aftermath in this grim 
first film from director Paul Greengrass (co-author of the controversial book 
"Spycatcher"), which begins seven weeks after the end of the brief Falklands 
War. A missing and presumably dead British soldier miraculously straggles in 
from the hills, and although this shy young man is at first given a hero's 
welcome back home, he is eventually presumed to be a cowardly deserter and is 
ostracized by everyone he knows. Well-told, but unremittingly bleak.CHRIS

 Well-meaning but ponderous and improbable wartime romance, adapted by New 
Zealand director Larry Parr and Grant Hindin from M.K. Joseph's novel. In 1944 
Normandy, a British soldier (well-played by Gabriel Byrne) and a young French 
woman (Marianne Basler) accused of treason by the French Resistance share a 
brief interlude. Sincere, beautifully shot in Normandy by Alun Bollinger, but 
sorely lacking in style and conviction. KEVIN THOMAS

 San Juan's most prestigious casino and social club is the site of a last grand 
ball before it is converted into a U.S. military facility for the duration of 
World War II. Francoites and liberals dance and mingle and, under the 
glittering surface, intrigues, double-crosses, and heartbreaks percolate and 
pop. This first film by Marcos Zurinaga ("Tango Bar") is a lesser effort. 
Zurinaga skimps on his specialties -- musical numbers and eye and body english 
-- and, though we need a Fitzgeraldian bittersweet opulence, gives us something 
drier, thinner, more like Edna Ferber. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

U.S. URGED TO LIFT FETAL TISSUE BAN

Expert advisers to the National Institutes of Health formally recommended today 
that the government lift its year-old ban on transplant research using tissue 
from aborted human fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers and federal officials said the ban is likely to remain in place 
for some time, despite the experts' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The ban stems from a proposed study on transplanting fetal nerve tissue into 
people suffering from Parkinson's disease. Due to the emotional nature of the 
debate over fetal tissue research and strong opposition from the anti-abortion 
movement, the panel's report is likely to undergo lengthy and intense scrutiny 
by Congress and the Administration.

BUSH SCORES POINTS, DUCKS HOT ISSUES IN LABOR SPEECH

<P>
President Bush scored points with organized labor today in his first 
post-election speech to a union audience but avoided any mention of his 
positions on the Eastern Airlines strike and minimum wage, which have soured 
labor's relations with the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I want this door at the White House to stay open," Bush told about 3,000 
delegates representing building trades unions from across the country. "I want 
to work with you." 
</P>
<P>
The closest Bush came to discussing his recent differences with labor was when 
he told the delegates: "There's a lot more to the relationship between the 
White House and the labor organizations than one issue or another. . . . We 
have had honest differences but we agree on goals and what matters is that we 
make progress on issues of shared concern." 
</P>
<P>
Labor had several visible confrontations with former President Ronald Reagan on 
such issues as the firing of striking air traffic controllers and White House 
opposition to legislation requiring employers to give workers advance notice of 
plant closings. But labor's lasting resentment toward Bush's predecessor stems 
more from what they considered staunchly anti-union appointments to the 
National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks to Avoid Animosity 
</P>
<P>
Bush took pains to avoid exciting the labor animosity that flourished during 
the Reagan years. He praised the already cordial crowd and improved his 
standing with labor leaders by promising to make NLRB appointments "whose 
neutrality and integrity are above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
"My appointments will not be anti-labor or, as I say, anti-business. They will 
be based on fair trade," Bush said, as a shout of "Amen" was heard from one 
Texas delegate in the applauding audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That is indeed a welcome step," said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also praised the group's patriotism, role in the nation's economic growth 
and efforts on behalf of Poland's Solidarity movement, saying that "wherever 
the free trade movement is threatened, so too is democracy." 
</P>
<P>
But noticeably missing from the speech were any direct references to Bush's 
promise to veto minimum wage bills that have cleared the House and Senate or 
his refusal to intervene to block a strike that has grounded Eastern for nearly 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders expressed no disappointment over the omissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Expect Comment 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't expect him to discuss those fronts," said Hardesty. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have turned the audience (against him) real fast," said another union 
official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he will veto the minimum wage measures because they would raise 
the base wage to $4.55 an hour, 30 cents an hour more than the President

a sub-minimum wage for six months. Bush has said such a "training wage" must be

KHASHOGGI JAILED, ACCUSED OF HIDING MARCOS' RICHES; 
</P>
<P>
SWISS HOLD HIM FOR U.S. EXTRADITION

Adnan Khashoggi, the flamboyant Saudi financier once reputed to be the world's 
wealthiest man, was arrested today on charges he helped Ferdinand and Imelda 
Marcos hide riches stolen from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The jet-setting arms merchant, allegedly the man who brokered the Iran-Contra 
arms deal, was seized by police at an elegant Bern hotel and jailed, said 
Pierre Schmid, assistant director of the Swiss Federal Police Office. 
</P>
<P>
Schmid said the arrest came shortly after the U.S. Embassy tipped off Swiss 
authorities that Khashoggi was in the capital and issued a warrant, demanding 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The United States plans to submit a detailed extradition request within 60 days 
as required by treaty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indicted in New York 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank were indicted 
in October by a U.S. District Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses the ousted Philippines dictator and his wife of stealing 
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real estate and 
expensive art objects in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Philippines says the couple took $3.5 billion in cash and 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government alleges that Khashoggi, 54, posed as owner of some of the 
assets to help hide that they actually belonged to Marcos, prosecutors have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obfuscation Maneuvers' 
</P>
<P>
Swiss authorities said a U.S. diplomatic note demanding Khashoggi's arrest 
cited four buildings in Manhattan and a collection of paintings that 
disappeared from a Manila museum. Khashoggi allegedly bought them for Marcos as 
part of "obfuscation maneuvers" during the ex-president's reign, Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled into exile in Hawaii after the February, 1986, civilian-military 
uprising that put Corazon Aquino in power. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, Swiss authorities must decide whether 
Khashoggi's alleged offenses are considered criminal acts under both U.S. and 
Swiss law. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Khashoggi in a "gentlemanly" way without using handcuffs at the 
downtown, five-star Hotel Schweizerhof where he was staying, Manager 
Jean-Jacques Gauer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Bail Likely 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to the nearby district jail, the Swiss Justice Ministry said. 
Schmid indicated that bail is likely to be set exceptionally high. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi arrived in Switzerland on Monday for unspecified medical treatment, 
said a well-placed Swiss official speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Khashoggi, who has lived in Paris, has visited a Bern hospital in the past for 
rejuvenating fresh cell therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses went into exile, their agents 
and Khashoggi carted away 25 paintings from New York properties owned by the 
Marcoses. The action allegedly came after a California federal judge ordered 
that none of the Marcoses' property could be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Published reports once estimated his personal wealth at up to $4 billion, and 
he was reported to be the richest man in the world. But falling oil prices, 
stricter control of arms dealing and recent loss-making deals have reportedly 
left him in financial straits.

A 91-year-old man suffered a broken nose and several bruises to his head when 
he and his daughter were robbed at gunpoint Monday night outside the Christ 
Lutheran Church in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Joseph, 59, of Fullerton and her father, Carl Johnson, were entering the 
church at 820 W. Imperial Blvd. at 9:08 p.m. when he was struck in the head 
with the butt of a pistol, said Larry Labrecht principal of Christ Lutheran Day 
School. Joseph, a kindergarten teacher at the school, which adjoins the church, 
was going there to catch up on some work. 
</P>
<P>
Labrecht said Joseph was about to open the door "when she heard a commotion 
behind her and turned to see her father falling after being hit with the gun." 
The two thieves demanded the keys to Joseph's blue 1987 Nissan Maxima and fled 
in the car. Police have not found the car or the robbers.

Democrat Glen Browder was sworn in today as the House's newest member, 
replacing veteran Rep. Bill Nichols (D-Ala.), who died in December. 
</P>
<P>
Browder, who won a special election April 4 to take the Third District seat, 
took the oath of office from Speaker Jim Wright in the well of the House. The 
margin of Browder's victory over Republican state Sen. John Rice -- 65% to 35% 
-- was a surprise and a blow to Republican hopes to end its minority status in 
the House. The current breakdown in the House is 260 Democrats, 174 Republicans 
and one vacancy.

Health Secretary Louis W. Sullivan today outlined a program for states to help 
poor families get off welfare and become self-sufficient through education and 
job training. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, one parent in two-parent welfare families will be required 
to work at least 16 hours a week in the public or private sector as a condition 
for receiving benefits, and single welfare parents with children 3 years or 
older will have to participate in employment and training programs. Also, 
teen-age parents who have not completed high school will be required to return 
to school or work toward an equivalent degree. 
</P>
<P>
The program also includes a provision requiring states to guarantee child care 
for parents who participate in the education and training activities.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Communist Party chief Wojciech Jaruzelski met

"I feel satisfaction. We have come a very difficult and long way," Jaruzelski 
told reporters after the meeting. "Reconciliation is a process, not an act," he 
said, and he cited the broad agreement on political and economic reform reached 
between communist authorities and the opposition.

"Today we only put another seal, in a way, on that accord," he said.

CHINESE YOUTHS, TROOPS CLASH AT PARTY HQ;

Thousands of Chinese students tried to force their way into the national 
Communist Party headquarters in the heart of Beijing today but were repulsed by 
lines of troops. 
</P>
<P>
A massive crowd of students calling for democratic freedoms and demanding to 
speak with Chinese Premier Li Peng surged against the gates of the heavily 
guarded Zhongnanhai Compound, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 onlookers cheered them on as they clashed with soldiers in scenes 
never seen in 40 years of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented protest came on the fourth day of mounting unrest after the 
death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, popular among students 
because he championed the rights of intellectuals. Today's action followed 
student demands for democratic freedoms and rehabilitation of the former party 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said scuffles broke out as the demonstrators confronted police 
guarding the gates but that the protest settled into a tense standoff between 
students and authorities shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrest on Campuses 
</P>
<P>
Hu's death Saturday has triggered widespread unrest on Beijing campuses where 
students have spoken out against the forced resignation in 1987 of the 
reformist leader. 
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of students also demonstrated early today at Fudan University in 
Shanghai, China's biggest city, college sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the demonstrations are the biggest spontaneous gatherings in Beijing 
in 13 years, diplomats doubted that the students would succeed in shaking the 
authorities as they did with nationwide rallies for democracy and freedom in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This time is different. I do not feel the tension," one veteran European 
diplomat said, remarking on the almost festive mood in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Student protests in late 1986 contributed to Hu's downfall at the hands of 
party hard-liners who launched a campaign against "bourgeois liberalization," 
code words for Western political ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tribute Slated Saturday 
</P>
<P>
So far the authorities have chosen to ignore the students and emphasize their 
own praise for Hu as a great revolutionary while glossing over the 
circumstances of his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Two official newspapers with a reputation for being more liberal have even 
encouraged the students, though indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, once Hu's close ally, has not made public comment 
on the death of his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Hu's successor as party leader, Zhao Ziyang, is expected to make a speech in 
tribute at a special memorial service in the Great Hall of the People on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Informed Chinese sources said up to 10,000 students could be invited to join 
the ceremony to take the sting out of their protests.

Surgeons failed in their attempt today to reattach the left hand of a 
5-year-old girl maimed by a pipe bomb at a K mart department store, while 
investigators sought a group of young men for questioning in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Erin Bower, who suffered eye damage and lost four fingers and part of her palm 
when she touched the pressure-sensitive bomb about 7:50 p.m. Monday, was in 
serious but stable condition at Methodist Hospital today after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The hand was recovered by paramedics at the store about an hour after the 
blast, packed in ice and rushed to the hospital. However, doctors said the limb 
had been separated too long for a successful attempt at reattachment, 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred as Erin was walking through the store with her parents 
and 1-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which needed only a slight touch to be set off, was hidden in a box 
of trash bags and placed on a shelf in the hardware and housewares section of 
the store. Sheriff's detective Sgt. Mike Kouns said four or five young men were 
being sought for questioning. Witnesses said the men left the store right after 
the explosion and appeared unconcerned about the incident.

Apple Computer Inc. today said its second-quarter net income decreased 29% 
compared to the same quarter last year, partly because of previously announced

Net income fell to $56.4 million from $79.7 million while earnings per share

Net sales were $1.25 billion, a 44% increase over the net sales of $867 million

John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the problem of an 
oversupply of chips bought at peak prices "is now substantially behind us."

International sales accounted for 40% of total revenues during the second

<P>
Consumer prices jumped 0.5% in March, propelled by higher costs for food, 
energy and apparel, and helped produce the largest quarterly increase in two 
years, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's climb in the Labor Department's consumer price index followed 
advances of 0.6% in January and 0.4% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, consumer prices in the last three months rose at a compound annual 
rate of 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest quarterly increase since the first three months of 1987, 
when prices rose 6.3% on an annual basis, and was significantly higher than the 
annual consumer price rises of 4.4% registered for each of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Price increases have been even steeper at the wholesale level, where inflation 
ran at a compounded annual rate of 10.2% in the January-March period, the 
largest quarterly increase in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco, said 
in advance of today's report that while price rises have moderated some since 
the start of the year, "we still have a problem" with the pace of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Around 5% to 5.5%" 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a period where the inflation rate seems to be hanging around 5% to 
5.5%," Van Dyke said. "That is too high for any long-run kind of equilibrium 
and I don't think that's what the Federal Reserve has in mind either." 
</P>
<P>
Food costs last month rose twice as much as they did during the previous month, 
up 0.8% in March after advancing 0.4% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increase last month since 
August, 1987, advancing 1.1% after rising 0.6% in February. 
</P>
<P>
The boost in petroleum-based energy prices, up at a 22.4% annual rate so far 
this year, accounted for more than two-fifths of the price acceleration during 
the first quarter, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Rising food prices were responsible for nearly one-quarter of the price 
increases during the quarter, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding those two volatile categories, other consumer prices rose 0.4% in 
March, the same pace as in February.

1ST TRANSPACIFIC FIBER-OPTIC CABLE LINKS U.S., JAPAN

<P>
The first fiber-optic cable across the Pacific Ocean went into service today, 
tying the United States and Japan together more tightly than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The cable, no bigger than a garden hose, stretches 8,271 miles from California, 
through Hawaii, splitting in the western Pacific into legs that travel to Guam 
and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Link vastly increases the capacity for communication across the 
Pacific, which is sometimes called the ocean of America's future. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of driving a golden spike, the builders of the $700-million cable 
marked its completion with a video teleconference between Japan and the board 
room of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The distance between the two countries has become shorter," Shiro Uramatsu, 
executive vice president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said from the Japanese 
end of the hookup. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a new base, a new plateau" for communications services, John 
Berndt, president of International Communications Services for American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The completion of Pacific Link comes just four months after completion of the 
first fiber-optic cable across the Atlantic, TAT-8, which was inaugurated with 
a video speech by author and futurist Isaac Asimov. 
</P>
<P>
Fiber links will now stretch most of the way around the world, competing with 
satellites for the business of carrying phone calls, computer traffic and video 
conferences. Satellites are still used for television. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional copper cables, fiber-optic cables carry information in 
pulses of laser light. The single new cable will be able to carry 40,000 phone 
calls at a time across the Pacific, compared with less than 1,000 for the two 
copper cables already in service combined.

Downhill racer Bill Johnson has undergone surgery for removal of a ruptured 
disk in his lower back and faces an extensive rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery Monday at Denver's St. Anthony Central Hospital went "pretty well," 
according to Dr. Courtney Brown, who declined to speculate on Johnson's chances 
of returning to ski racing. "That's an impossible thing to say," Brown said. 
"So much of this is motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, the 1984 Olympic downhill champion, had two disks removed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his future, the typically flip Johnson said, "Who cares? Can I play 
the piano again? I've never been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Troutdale, Ore., resident said he won't know if he can resume racing until 
he begins training. "We'll just have to see how it goes this summer," said 
Johnson. "If I'm able to train a lot and get back in shape, I'm sure it will be 
no problem. But if there are complications along the way and I'm doubting 
myself, I might just hang the boards up."

INVESTIGATION CLEARS GEORGIA COACH

A University of Georgia investigation has concluded that basketball Coach Hugh 
Durham did not know about secret payments by a sports agent to Dominique 
Wilkins while Wilkins was playing at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no clear and credible evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, to 
indicate that Durham was aware" of Wilkins' dealings with agent Jack Manton, 
said a 50-page report on the investigation released by the school. The report 
was authored by Athens attorney Edward D. Tolley and was based on interviews 
with Wilkins, Durham and Manton, as well as a deposition given by Wilkins in a 
court case in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, now a star with the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, acknowledged earlier this 
month that he had signed an agent contract with Manton while at Georgia and 
had, along with his mother, received nearly $30,000 in payments from the agent. 
Such an arrangement would apparently violate NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins also testified in 1985 in a civil case that Durham was aware of the 
relationship, according to a report in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But 
Durham denied knowing about the transaction, and Wilkins later insisted that 
Durham had no knowledge of it. Tolley's report cited a 1986 deposition given by 
Wilkins in the same case in which he said Durham did not know about the money 
he got from Manton.

CANADA ROUTS U.S. HOCKEY TEAM; 3RD STRAIGHT LOSS

Steve Yzerman, playing his first game of the tournament, scored three goals 
today as Canada downed the United States 8-2 to hand the Americans their third 
straight loss in the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans earlier dropped a pair of 4-2 decisions to the Soviet Union and 
defending world champion Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"Canada was the toughest team on us to date," said U.S. Coach Tim Taylor of 
Yale. "They put much more pressure in our end than the Soviets and the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected that and had prepared for it through our game plan that we would 
be facing an awful lot of strength, speed and power deep in our end. But quite 
frankly, we were out-manned all day." 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman, the high-scoring captain of the Detroit Red Wings, was one of the late 
additions to Team Canada, which is 3-0 in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Impressive' 
</P>
<P>
He had arrived in Sweden on Monday, and it took him just 3:34 to score his 
first goal. Yzerman added a second tally at 10:16 in the third, firing a slap 
shot from the right circle past goalie John Vanbiesbrouck. He completed his hat 
trick with 2:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very impressive for a guy who just stepped off the plane," said 
Canadian Assistant Coach Dan Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL's Norris 
Division semifinals last week. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Brian Bellows and John McLean who spoiled any U.S. hopes of staying 
in the game. They scored within 29 seconds early in the second period, putting 
Canada ahead 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Bellows broke a 2-2 tie with his first of two goals, whipping the puck past 
Vanbiesbrouck just 38 seconds into the period after a perfect feed from Kirk 
Muller from behind the cage. McLean then tapped in a rebound at 1:07 after a 
blue-line shot by defenseman Randy Carlyle. 
</P>
<P>
Other Canada scorers were Kirk Muller, who tied the game 2-2 midway through the 
first period, and James Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Millen and Brian Mullen scored for Team USA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25-6 in Series 
</P>
<P>
Only four penalties were called in a game watched by a near capacity crowd of 
12,800 at Stockholm's new Globe Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Canada now has outscored its three first opponents 25-6, beating Finland 6-4 
and Group A newcomer Poland 11-0 in the earlier games. 
</P>
<P>
In another game today, Viacheslav Bykov and Vladimir Konstantinov each scored 
two goals, leading the Soviet Union to a 4-1 win over Finland. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, which avenged a 2-1 loss to Finland in the Olympics last year, 
gave the Soviets a perfect 3-0 record along with Canada in the tournament's 
single round-robin portion. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia moved to five points, one point behind the leaders, by trouncing 
winless Group A newcomer Poland 15-0 in Stockholm's Globe Arena.
