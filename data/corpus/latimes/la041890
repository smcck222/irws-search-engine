DRUG OFFENDERS MAY BE JAILED IN TENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County plans to step up enforcement of minor drug offenses and may put 
some of those convicted in an encampment on public land so that County Jail 
facilities would not be further overcrowded, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is part of a new, drug-enforcement policy being developed by Sheriff 
John V. Gillespie and Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to turn up the heat on recreational users and start hitting the 
demand side of the equation," Bradbury said. "We want to go after those people 
and put them in jail." 
</P>
<P>
However, if an idea proposed by Gillespie is approved by the Board of 
Supervisors, the offenders would not be housed in existing jail facilities -- 
which already are desperately overcrowded -- but in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sheriff also mentioned in his "State of the Jails" report this 
week that the county might be able to renovate existing buildings to house the 
new inmates, Assistant Sheriff Richard Bryce said that one Navy base already is 
enthusiastic about hosting the encampment because of the free labor it could 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce refused to name the base, but the county has two, the Port Hueneme and 
Point Mugu naval facilities near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Bryce said, two to four tents, each of which would house about 
80 prisoners, would be installed at one of the bases. The department would seek 
federal funds to help pay for the tents, which cost about $60,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, an encampment would be set up just for men, but if the tents prove 
practical, another encampment would be erected for women, Bryce said. Two 
deputies would guard the tents, to be enclosed by a fence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates would be assigned work duties such as picking up trash, mowing 
lawns and painting buildings and might be taken to public areas, such as 
beaches, marinas and parks, to do maintenance, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
During free time, they would be required to attend substance-abuse classes or 
take part in counseling sessions, according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The program could be in full swing in 30 days, once the department receives 
approval from the Board of Supervisors and completes negotiations with the Navy 
base, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the encampment is based on the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department's use of four 15-foot-high domed tents to house minimum-security 
prisoners at the James A. Musick facility in Irvine, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've worked out very well, although they tear apart pretty easily," Orange 
County Assistant Sheriff Jerry Krans said of the tents. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring 90 feet by 40 feet, the tents -- which are air-conditioned and heated 
-- house about 80 prisoners each. A fifth tent, 50 feet by 80 feet, is used for 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The encampment, which is popular with inmates, was launched in 1985 to handle 
an overflow of prisoners from Orange County's jail facilities. Although the 
tent village was meant to be temporary, there is no indication that it will be 
discontinued, Krans said. 
</P>
<P>
The tents in Ventura also would be intended as a temporary solution to lack of 
space for prisoners, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
As a permanent solution to the overcrowding, the county is considering building 
a new jail. And Supt. John K. Flynn has proposed that the county embark on a 
$19-million, 450-bed expansion of the jail at the county government center in 
Ventura. In addition, Flynn has proposed that the county build a separate 
facility for inmates convicted of drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are expected to decide whether to build the new facility within 
the next five months. Five rural sites are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, County Jail facilities housed an average of 794 more inmates than they 
were built to accommodate, according to Gillespie's report. If nothing is done 
to alleviate the space problems, the county predicts that there will be 2,800 
more prisoners than beds by the year 2010.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: INMATE 60924-098 COULD PROVE TO BE THE LEAST-TAXING 
CANDIDATE AROUND

<P>
I am sometimes asked to disclose my politics. 
</P>
<P>
By temperament and background (I worked for the Copley Press), I am a 
monarchist. I was content when Pete Wilson was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
If we must have elected government, I prefer farce. I like the present San 
Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
I also like politicians who serve their prison sentences before their terms of 
office, rather than during or after. It's tidier. 
</P>
<P>
As such, I was saddened to learn that Barbara Hutchinson, or, as she would have 
it, Federal Inmate 60924-098 ("Just 098 to my friends"), has decided not to run 
for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
She took out papers to seek the Libertarian nomination in Bill Lowery's 
district, but decided against pursuing it when her mother's health worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson, 63, just might be San Diego's most notorious tax protester. She's 
been back home in Rolando since April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, she served "36 months, 2 hours, 22 minutes and 11 seconds" of a 
five-year fall for mail fraud. It started as a massive tax-evasion indictment 
involving "family trust" plans. 
</P>
<P>
A loser for City Council in 1965 and county assessor in 1978, Hutchinson 
figures that public outrage at the tax man has finally reached a fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have been an excellent year for me," she said. "The public is 
finally ready. They've realized that the Gestapo is alive and well and known as 
the IRS." 
</P>
<P>
She's keeping a low profile except for a little picketing and calling of talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote to Lech Walesa, dissident-to-dissident. She rejoiced when Roseanne 
Barr sassed an IRS bureaucrat into submission on "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Soon she'll join those who say easements for horse trails amount to 
confiscation of private property. She doesn't rule out a run for office later. 
</P>
<P>
Her only elective office was president of the inmate council at Pleasanton 
federal prison. When Hutchinson started agitating for change, the warden 
disbanded the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Gotch Grudge 
</P>
<P>
Since we're talking politics. 
</P>
<P>
* Are voters in San Diego's 6th City Council District still mad at former 
two-term Councilman Mike Gotch for his support of the Belmont Park shopping 
center? 
</P>
<P>
Can a duck get wet in Mission Bay? 
</P>
<P>
In last week's special primary in the 78th Assembly District, Republican Jeff 
Marston outpolled Democrat Gotch 35% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
But, in that hunk of the 78th that is also in the 6th Council District, the 
Marston margin was much wider: 46% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
* Ben Ginsberg, chief counsel to the Republican National Committee, arrives in 
San Diego today for four days of politicking with state party chairmen from 
across the country. Also, one day of golf with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
* Chris Crotty is out as of Friday as chief of staff for San Diego City 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
Replaced by Aurie Kryzuda, Bernhardt's landlord and campaign director. Kryzuda, 
Bernhardt and staffer Eloise Emery just returned from a week in Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Can you spell p-o-w-e-r s-t-r-u-g-g-l-e? 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) is set today to tell a House subcommittee in 
Washington that border violence in San Diego is getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he will scold San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen for 
supposedly not taking seriously reports of war-game-playing teen-agers. A 
spokesman for the chief says Bates is full of wind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Hand Holding Allowed 
</P>
<P>
The medium is well done. 
</P>
<P>
* The Washington Post caused a flurry with a story about Navy boot camp going 
soft, pointing to the camp at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Times followed with a harrumphing column. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the San Diego boot camp says that, regardless of what's going on 
at Orlando, San Diego still: requires daily calisthenics, requires steel-toed 
boots and greets recruits with a company commander, not a hand-holding 
chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
Recruits in San Diego run 600 miles in eight weeks.

DISPUTE OVER NEPOTISM FUELS FEUD; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL SERVICE: A UNION ACCUSES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF VIOLATING COUNTY RULES 
BY LETTING A DIVISION HEAD KEEP HIS NEW WIFE ON STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Charges of nepotism within the district attorney's office have stoked a 
long-running feud between Ventura County's top prosecutor and the county Civil 
Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on charges by an employees' union that Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury has violated county work rules by allowing the head of his Child 
Support Division to keep his new wife on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Service Commission, which will receive a report on the issue this 
morning, has scheduled an 11 a.m. hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the report is issued, however, Commission Chairman Robert Embry has 
accused Bradbury of sanctioning "blatant nepotism." 
</P>
<P>
And Bradbury, in turn, has blasted the Civil Service Commission as a longtime 
"tool of the union." 
</P>
<P>
"They act irresponsibly and they're incompetent," Bradbury said of the 
five-person commission Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh words reflect years of animosity between the veteran district 
attorney and the commission. Commissioners infuriated Bradbury by overturning 
his 1984 suspension of a deputy prosecutor and his 1985 firing of another. 
</P>
<P>
The firing of William Maxwell, accused of sexually harassing a court 
interpreter and other offenses, was finally upheld last year by a state 
appellate court, but the appeal cost the county $100,000 in legal fees, 
Bradbury said. Embry said the decision represents the first time the commission 
has ever been overturned by a court. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1944, in all the hundreds of cases the commission has heard, there has 
been just that one case that failed to stand up to challenge," Embry said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue at today's hearing is whether the district attorney can legally allow 
C. Stanley Trom, a former district attorney himself and chief of the office's 
largest division, to keep ombudsman Margaret Escobar Trom on his 150-worker 
child-support staff. 
</P>
<P>
The couple married in October, sparking protests from the Public Employees 
Assn. of Ventura County, which represents most of the county's 6,000 workers 
and dozens of child-support employees. 
</P>
<P>
The union cited a county policy that says "no person shall be employed in a 
position directly supervised by a member of his immediate family" without 
approval of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors refused to approve a rule waiver for the district attorney last 
fall. And they delayed action again Tuesday on his request to find that Escobar 
Trom's assignment does not constitute a county rule violation or to waive the 
rule it violates. The supervisors will consider the waiver again after they 
receive the Civil Service Commission's recommendation and report. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradbury did not transfer Escobar Trom to another division, union 
Executive Director Harry L. Hammitt in February requested an investigation by 
the Civil Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members are concerned about this because they believe she has received 
favored treatment," Hammitt said. "She gets prime overtime assignments. She 
gets time off to travel with her husband to conferences." 
</P>
<P>
Hammitt said some co-workers have felt for years that Escobar Trom held her 
personal relationship with their boss "over them directly" in disputes. "They 
felt they couldn't take it to Stan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trom and Bradbury said Tuesday that Escobar Trom, a 19-year county employee, 
has received no favored treatment but in some ways has been treated worse than 
her colleagues because of her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Trom said his wife works about 10 hours overtime a week, which is less than 
many of her co-workers. She does take unpaid personal leave to join him at 
quarterly conferences, Trom said. But, he said, he has never turned down 
requests for unpaid leaves from any of his employees. 
</P>
<P>
His wife took unpaid leave to attend a training conference with him in 
February, even though colleagues in her same work classification attended the 
conference and received full pay, Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
"Margaret went to that conference on her own time and paid her own way just to 
avoid these kinds of crazy allegations," he said. "So, in fact, if Margaret has 
been treated differently, it has been to her detriment." 
</P>
<P>
Escobar Trom, a mid-level supervisor, has not been promoted since 1984, well 
before she and Trom began living together, Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury has responded to what he acknowledges might have been a legal problem 
by having Escobar Trom report directly to Assistant Dist. Atty. C. Toy White, 
who evaluates her performance. But Escobar Trom still performs the same duties 
and works in the same office just down the hall from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at transferring her to another part of the office," said Bradbury, 
whose office has 375 employees. "But there is no comparable position for which 
she has training. She's worked her way up in the child-support division and 
that's where her expertise lies." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he also could not find a comparable position outside child 
support with similar pay. Escobar Trom makes $2,908 a month, at least $300 more 
a month than is paid for comparable jobs in other district attorney divisions, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said his only other option is to fire Escobar Trom, "which is 
absolutely ridiculous . . . and I would not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Hammitt, the union representative, said he is not trying to cost anyone her 
job, especially Escobar Trom, who is a union member. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a perception of favoritism" that needs to be addressed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Embry, a professor at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem has existed for more than a year. He was in the same office with 
her during their period of courtship. And the same kinds of problems existed 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, I would ask Mr. Bradbury, why would he knowingly allow a violation of 
the nepotism rule?" Embry said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury accused Embry of prejudging the case without reading his staff's 
report and said the chairman should abstain from voting today. Embry said he 
would think about that.

ENDANGERED BIRDS AT LAGOON WILL GET HELP; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A BARRIER WILL BE REMOVED TO END FLOODING THAT PREVENTED NESTING 
OF SPECIES SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA LEAST TERN AND BELDING'S SAVANNAH SPARROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A coastal barrier that has kept rare birds from reproducing at Batiquitos 
Lagoon in Carlsbad soon will be removed, the state Department of Fish and Game 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The El Nino storms of the early 1980s created a large cobble blockage at the 
mouth of the lagoon that trapped water over areas where the California least 
tern and the Belding's savannah sparrow traditionally nest. 
</P>
<P>
The least tern is on federal and state endangered species lists, and the 
Belding sparrow is on the state list. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game wildlife biologist Theresa Stewart said Tuesday that crews will 
close South Carlsbad State Beach part of next week while removing the cobble 
barrier that is 15 feet high, 30 feet long and 18 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a dam out there, basically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad's assistant planning director, Gary Wayne, added, "The lagoon just 
keeps filling." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the flooding of sensitive habitat has discouraged the rare 
species from nesting. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said 47 pairs of Belding's savannah sparrows were reported at the 
lagoon in 1986, but that number has since dropped to fewer than 20 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is declining, I don't think we'll get back up to 47," Stewart 
said. "If we get 30, I'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
As for the least terns, last year only three pairs tried to nest, and Stewart 
figures, "if the water level is lower, we could expect 20 to 30 pairs." 
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers seem insignificant, Stewart pointed out there are only an 
estimated 1,200 pairs of least terns in California. 
</P>
<P>
El Nino storms produced the barrier as the rough surf washed away the beach 
sand and left cobbles protruding 12 feet above sea level, enough to keep water 
from flowing out of the lagoon and opening the nesting areas. 
</P>
<P>
It is critical to remove the cobbles now because the nesting season for the 
least tern begins in May, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
She also believes that lowering the lagoon's water level would benefit other 
species, including the snowy plover, the American avocet, black-necked stilt 
and Forster's tern. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wayne said the flooding problem won't be solved permanently until the 
lagoon's entire tidal system is opened. 
</P>
<P>
He said that will happen under a $20-million lagoon restoration project to be 
finished next year. The project is now in the environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Audubon Society has endorsed the cobble removal plan.

BAIL $2.5 MILLION FOR ACCUSED KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

Bradford Warren Powers Jr. told police that he decided to "take the law into 
his own hands and make the doctors pay" for his father's death when he shot 
four people in a rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, a deputy district 
attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Robert Eichler made that assertion in a brief San Diego Municipal 
Court hearing in which Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and 
three counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Powers, his eyes moist and bloodshot, spoke only once to the judge, when he 
interrupted the hearing and said: "I don't wish for bail." 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Woodward set bail at $2.5 million, despite Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Eichler's request that the 46-year-old La Jolla man be held under no 
bail. The prosecutor said he wanted no bail because Powers poses a threat to 
the community and because he had planned to flee to Oregon before he turned 
himself in to Oceanside police, an hour after he allegedly opened fire in an 
emergency room Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The spray of bullets killed a nurse and a student trainee -- on his first day 
at the job -- and wounded the on-duty physician and the father of a patient. 
</P>
<P>
The victim involved in the third count of attempted murder was identified as 
nurse Terri Fagen, but Eichler declined to elaborate on what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
Asked after the hearing whether he would seek the death penalty, Eichler said 
he was still reviewing the case. "It's a double homicide -- that makes it a 
possibility just by definition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred about eight hours after Brad Powers Sr. died in the same 
emergency room, suffering a heart attack while doctors were attempting to 
repair a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that the younger Powers, who has had psychiatric problems 
dating back at least 25 years, was distraught over the death of his father, a 
well-known architectural illustrator, and returned to the scene to seek 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the shootings, a dark side to the father-son relationship has 
emerged. The younger Powers, who lived at home and seldom held a job for more 
than several months, was occasionally physically and verbally abusive to his 
father, a doctor and a family attorney said in telephone interviews. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of a family member, the coroner's office investigated whether 
physical abuse had contributed to the elder Powers' death, said Dr. H. E. 
Hammerstead, the doctor who tried to save the aging man when he was brought 
into the emergency room. The coroner's investigation, however, found no signs 
of physical abuse, he said. Officials with the coroner's office declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Powers, 75 when he died, had postponed his retirement for fear that 
he lacked funds to support his wife, their son Powers Jr. and his two children, 
now 20 and 23, said Marvin Mizeur, an attorney who has known the family for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many episodes where (Powers Jr.) was emotionally out of control. I 
have seen him calm one moment and then blow up the next," said Mizeur, who 
represented the younger Powers during part of his divorce case and continued to 
assist the elder Powers in legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
"His family indicated that he made threats to (Powers Sr.) and struck him once 
or twice," said Mizeur, who added that these reports of violence occurred 
during the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Though the younger Powers felt close to his mother, Mary, he was often hostile 
to his father, Mizeur said. And the elder Powers felt threatened by his son. 
"It was not a pleasant situation for Brad Sr. for the last 10 years. And it has 
gotten progressively worse," Mizeur said. "I do know certainly there was verbal 
abuse -- that was practically a constant thing." 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Powers Sr. filed a petition in San Diego Superior Court to begin 
having his son tested for mental illness with the possibility of having him 
committed to authorities, court records show. Powers Jr., then 21, single and 
unemployed, was examined by Dr. Carl E. Graner. 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Powers changed his mind and suddenly withdrew his petition. 
Family members were unavailable Tuesday to talk to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the handgun allegedly used in the shootings had belonged to the 
Powers family and was kept at the home for protection. The 6-inch, 8-shot 
.22-caliber revolver was found in Powers Jr.'s white Corvette Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for the dead -- nurse Deborah Kay Burke and Edward Thomas 
Rooney, a student trainee -- is scheduled for Thursday at the hospital.

<P>
To avoid raising a stink with nearby Port Hueneme residents, the Oxnard City 
Council has moved to spend $91,100 on an odor control system for a sewage pump 
station on Port Hueneme Road near Surfside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously last week to spend the funds on a odor filtration 
system for the station, which is along the city's boundary next to a 
condominium development in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The station, one of 20 in the city, has a pump capacity of 12 million gallons a 
day and is used to pump sewage to the Oxnard Waterwaste Treatment Plant on 
Perkins Road. 
</P>
<P>
Odor from the pump station has prompted about eight complaints in the last year 
from residents in the nearby condominiums, said Mark Norris, the city's waste 
water division superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Regular off-shore breezes usually dissipate the odor from the station, but 
Norris said the odor is more noticeable during summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Norris said he expects the odor control system to be installed by August. He 
said no other sewage pump station in the city has an odor control system. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they are going to spend some money to do it," said Alan Fox, manager 
of the Surfside Motel, which is across the street from the pump station. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said some of his guests have complained to him about odor from the station. 
"I know that during the summer some people keep their windows closed and turn 
on their fans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One Port Hueneme resident who lives less than 100 feet from the pump station 
said she has never complained to the city about the pump station but has 
noticed the odor. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's not pleasant," said the woman, who declined to give her name. "Even 
my son will say 'Oh mom, that stuff is gross,' " she said. HUGO MARTIN

COUNTY SUPERVISORS RULE MEASLES EPIDEMIC IS PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors, responding to San Diego County's worst measles epidemic in 
10 years, declared Tuesday that a public health hazard exists, making the 
county eligible for state funds to bolster inoculation programs. 
</P>
<P>
By April 4, more than 487 reported and probable cases had been reported in the 
county, up from 191 cases during all of 1989 and more than in 1982, the last 
epidemic year, when 451 cases were reported. The county has not in recent times 
issued a "Declaration of Public Health Hazard" for measles or other common 
diseases such as mumps or German measles, Dr. G. William Cox, director of the 
county's Department of Health Services, said. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration makes San Diego eligible for as much as $147,181 in state money 
that would be used to hire personnel and purchase vaccine. However, preliminary 
indications from the state suggest that the county will only receive about 
$65,000. "We'll take what we can get," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The state, which supplies much of the medicine used to vaccinate needy 
children, has made $1.2 million available to counties that have been 
overwhelmed by measles in recent months. More than 1,800 measles cases have 
been reported this year in California, and the epidemic has taken 24 lives. 
Measles is suspected in the death this year of a San Diego boy. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important about this epidemic is the severity of the cases we're 
seeing," Cox said. "Statewide, one in four people who contract measles are 
being hospitalized." 
</P>
<P>
Though inoculations prevent most people from contracting measles, health 
officials' efforts to contain the outbreak have been stymied because the 
disease is hitting many unvaccinated preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
"Previously, this was spread at schools, and we knew how to go right in and 
(control it)," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
But preschoolers often infect their parents and other children, and 
subsequently transmit the disease to other people during visits to doctors' 
offices and clinics, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency declaration makes it possible for the county to seek state funds 
without the normal requirement that it match the state funds dollar for dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors also agreed to spend an additional $73,591 on wages related to a 
larger inoculation program.

SCHOOLS' NEW DRUG POLICY SATISFIES FEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new drug-abuse policy covering teachers and other school employees who work 
with children was adopted Tuesday by San Diego city schools' trustees, but it 
satisfied neither the school board nor the district's two major labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
The policy would offer employees suspected of substance abuse the chance to 
take a voluntary drug test and enter a rehabilitation program. If the employee 
refuses, the district asserts the right to require a health and/or 
psychological examination and to use the results to determine whether the 
employee can continue to work. 
</P>
<P>
The board already has a policy requiring pre-employment testing for workers in 
sensitive positions, such as bus drivers and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Teachers Assn., which represents the district's 6,000 teachers, 
gave official notice to the board that it will file an "unfair labor practice" 
with the state Public Employment Relations Board over the policy, which will 
delay implementation until the panel makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The SDTA says the district does not have the right to require such an 
examination without reaching agreement first with the union during 
negotiations. The union and the district have been talking for more than five 
months without reaching a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the district has become impatient and decided to act unilaterally," SDTA 
President Hugh Boyle told the board Tuesday. "So we deliver to you a demand to 
bargain over the drug policy . . . once again placing us into the adversarial 
positions which we have been trying so hard to avoid." Boyle said the policy 
smacks of violations of personal rights and will fail, if implemented, to stem 
drug problems because it is too broad-brushed. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees, however, said they would have preferred to bring in mandatory testing 
of any employee suspected of substance abuse as their effort to comply with the 
federal government's policy for a drug-free workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"This policy is way smaller in scope than the board (originally) intended," 
board president Kay Davis said. She said the board was willing to go along with 
a more limited policy, conceding that the unions still "have a different 
perspective on how to set an example." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said "the drug problem is so immense that we need to be impeccable . . . 
to set standards so high and so pure to set an example for students." 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Jim Roache, a deputy sheriff, said the policy is so weak that he was 
tempted to vote against it. But he went along with the rest of the board 
because it can serve as a first step, he said.

GUATEMALAN ADMITS KILLING IMMIGRANT

<TEXT>
<P>
A Guatemalan immigrant admitted Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court that 
he fatally stabbed a countryman in a drunken brawl in Simi Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Garnica-Vargas, 27, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter using a 
deadly weapon in the death of Ezequiel Romero, 37. 
</P>
<P>
Romero died July 19 after being stabbed in the abdomen with a kitchen knife. At 
one time, Romero claimed to be a member of a rightist death squad in their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Garnica-Vargas faces a maximum 12-year prison sentence. His sentencing is 
scheduled for May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a jury acquitted Garnica-Vargas and a fellow immigrant, Julio 
Arriaza, 27, of first-degree murder in the case. After four days of 
deliberation, the jury failed to reach verdicts on lesser charges of 
second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Garnica-Vargas was being held 
pending the prosecutor's decision on retrying the case when he agreed to plead 
guilty to the lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
Arriaza is in jail, pending a plea hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. today. MACK

SCHOOL DISTRICT PLANS CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a potential $1.2-million budget shortfall, Ventura Unified School 
District administrators announced proposed cutbacks Tuesday for the 25-school 
district, including layoffs, a hiring freeze and reductions in district 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Unveiled at Tuesday night's school board meeting, the proposed layoffs would 
affect 15 district employees, including five administrators and two assistant 
principals at the district's two high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cutbacks, which also include trimming such programs as the visual 
program, would pare the entire $1.2-million shortfall from the district budget. 
</P>
<P>
The district is facing the potential deficit because of a proposal by Gov. 
George Deukmejian to trim the state budget allocation for education. Deukmejian 
has proposed cutting the annual 4.95% cost-of-living increase for California's 
elementary and secondary schools to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The district's estimated $1.2-million deficit is based on a 4.2% cost-of-living 
increase, a figure educators hope will be the compromise reached when the state 
budget is finalized. If the 3% increase should be instituted, district 
officials estimate, an additional $500,000 in cuts will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Averett, an assistant superintendent, said the proposed cutbacks, while 
harsh, are not unusual. School districts statewide are scrambling to bring 
their budgets in line with decreased revenues, Averett said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Unified Board of Education will decide whether to implement the 
cutbacks at its May 8 meeting. KEN McALPINE

LAW SETS GUIDELINES FOR FILMING IN CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council has adopted an ordinance governing film companies 
that use the city as a location. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, production companies are required to apply to film in the 
city two business days in advance and to notify neighborhoods that would be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the companies will work with city staff members rather than having to 
apply to the council for permission to film. 
</P>
<P>
The council had decided that a film company doing business in Santa Paula must 
show proof of at least $1 million in insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The council also set fees for filming in the city at $500 for the first day and 
$350 for each additional day. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the council chose Councilwoman Kay G. Wilson to serve as 
mayor for a year. Wilson replaces Les H. Maland, who has served as mayor four 
times during his 22 years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
John A. F. Melton was chosen as mayor pro tem. Melton has served 16 years on 
the council. JANET BERGAMO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEARCH FOR SUCCESSOR TO KORNBLUM BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday authorized a nationwide search to find a 
successor for beleaguered Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Ronald N. Kornblum, 
who announced he will step down from the job on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a real tough one," said Supervisor Kenneth Hahn of the 
recruitment effort. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the coroner's staff of 15 doctors performed 5,804 autopsies and 
its 160-member staff handled 18,019 investigations last year. 
</P>
<P>
A recent management audit called for 155 changes in the coroner's office after 
finding that staff shortages, coupled with a growing homicide rate, were 
leading to a breakdown in controls and sanitary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, 56, took over the coroner's office in 1982 when Thomas Noguchi, the 
so-called "coroner to the stars," was accused of mismanagement and lost his 
job.

OFFICIALS NAMED TO TAYLOR RANCH PANEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura City Councilman Todd Collart and Community Development Director Everett 
Millais will represent the city on a Cal State University committee that will 
oversee the development of an environmental impact document for Taylor Ranch, 
the council decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two were appointed after Cal State invited representatives from all 10 
cities in the county, area legislators and community groups that support or 
oppose the development of a four-year university at Taylor Ranch, a 450-acre 
hillside bluff west of the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Collart has remained neutral on the issue, which has brought a storm of 
protests from those opposing the additional burden on traffic and water. 
</P>
<P>
The university has so far received confirmation to participate on the committee 
from state Sens. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Ed Davis (R-Northridge), 
and Assembly members Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley), said John Smart, university vice chancellor.

IF IT'S RAINING, THIS MUST BE CRASH DAY, SAYS AN OVERBURDENED HIGHWAY PATROL 
</P>

<P>
Dozens of weather-related traffic accidents, most of the "fender-bender 
variety," occurred throughout San Diego County Tuesday, causing massive 
headaches for the California Highway Patrol, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens every time it rains," Lt. Joe Garrison said. "We get a little 
shower, and all of this weather-related traffic piles up. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand that when the pavement gets wet, they need to slow 
their speed, expand their space cushion and pay particular attention to what 
they're doing. A little bit of water and an oily surface make for an extremely 
slippery area. 
</P>
<P>
"It got so bad this morning that, at 6 a.m., we suspended all non-injury 
traffic accidents, meaning there were so many of them, we didn't bother to 
attend to them. There were dozens, all brought on by the rain." 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside office of the CHP reported eight weather-related accidents, one 
resulting in minor neck and back injuries that sent a man to Tri-City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going too fast for the conditions and ran into the center divider on 
northbound Interstate 5," spokesman Tom Kerns said. "His car overturned near 
the under-crossing just north of Camp Pendleton." 
</P>
<P>
The steady drizzle was brought by a storm that "trickled" down the coast from 
the Pacific Northwest, said Richard Stitt, a National Weather Service 
forecaster. The storm is expected to leave this morning, Stitt said, although a 
20% chance of rain remains. 
</P>
<P>
It started raining at Lindbergh Field about 2 a.m. Tuesday, and by 4:30 in the 
afternoon, 0.37 of an inch had fallen, Stitt said, adding that Del Mar 
registered 0.75 of an inch, followed by Escondido with 0.66 and Rancho 
Penasquitos with 0.39. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's high and low temperature readings for the county were: Lindbergh 
Field, 66 and 57 degrees; El Cajon, 67 and 57; Mt. Laguna, 52 and 34, and 
Borrego Springs, 67 and 57. 
</P>
<P>
Stitt said showers are not rare for the county at this time of year, and the 
county is below its average rainfall for the season. 
</P>
<P>
He said a threat of isolated thundershowers is expected in the mountains and 
deserts throughout today, with warmer and less-windy conditions forecast 
Thursday.

2 FARM WORKERS KILLED, 4 HURT AS VAN HITS EARTHMOVER BLADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Mexican farm workers died and four were injured Tuesday when the van in 
which they were riding collided with the sharp blade of an earthmover tractor, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Reyes, 20, was driving the van east on Otay Lakes Road at 5:47 a.m. when 
it struck the protruding blade of the tractor, which was aboard a westbound big 
rig truck, according to California Highway Patrol officer J. E. Orlette. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Flores-Caldero, 35, and Margarito Murillo-Salas, 67, were killed by the 
impact, which sheared off the van's left side. The van then spun around and was 
thrown into the air, landing in a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was still investigating Tuesday. Orlette said that, although it was 
raining at the time, she did not think poor weather caused the collision. 
Orlette was also investigating whether the big rig's wide load was legal. It 
was traveling with two pilot trucks, as required. 
</P>
<P>
The men were on their way to work from their homes in Bonita, Orlette said. The 
two dead men were from Tijuana, according to the county coroners' office. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes underwent surgery at Mercy Hospital. His condition was unknown. Jesus 
Sanchez, 42, was in stable condition; Rafael Gonzalez, 30, was in fair 
condition; and Moises Zamora-Arroyo, 36, was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the big rig, John Theakston, 30, of El Cajon, was not injured.

<P>
More than two-thirds of the census forms mailed three weeks ago to Ventura 
County residents have been returned, putting the county in second place 
statewide in terms of the percentage of forms returned, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bryant, a Census Bureau spokesman, said that as of last week -- the 
latest period for which statewide figures are available -- 66% of the 228,219 
questionnaires mailed in Ventura County had been returned. 
</P>
<P>
Concord County in Northern California was leading the state with a return rate 
of 67% of the 279,061 forms mailed there, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Geary-Ellen Williams, manager of the Ventura County Census Bureau office, said 
residents continue to flood the office with the forms. By Monday, 68.7% had 
been returned. 
</P>
<P>
Since the census forms were mailed out in California on March 23, only 57% of 
the 10,788,677 forms had been returned by last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County had a return rate of 57%. CAROLYN KUSKY

NAVY COUNTERS BATES CRITICISM WITH OWN SURVEY OF STORE PRICES 
</P>

In what has become an escalating battle of price-comparison surveys, the Navy 
has conducted its own review of a local exchange store and found that prices 
there amount to a nearly 30% savings for military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has blasted the local Navy 
exchange stores for what he said are bloated prices. But, based on a comparison 
of 87 randomly selected, common items, Navy officials said Tuesday that 
shoppers at the 32nd Street Naval Exchange save 28% by shopping there instead 
of at Target or K mart stores in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"You do save substantially by shopping at the exchange and buying there on a 
regular basis," said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman. "Frankly, the only 
thing that surprised me is that there was such a large disparity in prices -- 
that the exchange is doing so well. Somewhere in San Diego, you could find a 
store with prices close to the exchange, but I don't know where." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bates said he stands by his two staff-conducted surveys of 30 randomly 
selected items. One survey showed prices at the exchange to be 15% to 25% 
higher than those in Army and Air Force stores. The other showed prices at the 
Miramar Naval Air Station exchange were, on average, 4% higher than at local 
civilian retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think we need to look at the Navy's prices. You can manipulate those 
figures," Bates said. "Even if their selected sampling is true, there should be 
a wider margin because the Navy doesn't have to pay rent, liability insurance, 
sales tax, and there's virtually no overhead." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy hires an independent market research firm annually to conduct its own 
official survey of 300 items. That survey has found that sailors save 23% by 
shopping at San Diego-area exchanges instead of private stores. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional hearings have been scheduled for May in San Diego to discuss 
operating procedures at the exchanges. Bates says experts are considering 
whether to combine the Navy exchange with the Army and Air Force stores, which 
are jointly operated. 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy survey, which did not include sales items, Energizer AAA batteries 
that cost $1.25 at the exchange went for $1.99 at Target and K mart. Anacin 
coated aspirin tablets that cost $5.60 at the exchange were $5.99 at Target and 
$6.84 at K mart. And Mennen After Shave that cost $1.69 at the exchange was 
$2.12 at Target and $2.32 at K mart.

A man known only as "Marcus" to people on the street was stabbed to death 
Tuesday afternoon in front of a grocery store near 12th Avenue and Market 
Street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man walked into the Valu-Mart about 1:30 p.m. and collapsed by the front 
door, said Sgt. Jim Clear, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Tuesday, authorities had not determined the real identity of the 
man, who was stabbed in the upper abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The man, thought to be 25 to 30 years old, was 6 feet tall and weighed about 
200 pounds, said Ken Bell, spokesman for the county coroner's office. He wore a 
red warm-up suit with a white stripe down the side of the pants, and white, 
low-top athletic shoes, Bell said. He died at 2:20 p.m. in the emergency room 
of UC San Diego Medical Center, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police they saw a suspect drive off in a maroon vehicle, which 
officers followed to a store at 13th Avenue and F Street, where Delbert 
Russworm, 35, was arrested. He was booked into County Jail on suspicion of 
murder, Clear said.

EDISON DENIES CLAIM OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: AN EMPLOYEE OF THE LOS ANGELES-AREA COMPANY CHARGED THAT POWERFUL 
CUSTOMERS GET FASTER SERVICE DURING OUTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Southern California Edison officials Tuesday denied an employee's claim that 
the Rosemead-based utility has lists of powerful customers who get faster 
service during power outages. 
</P>
<P>
Reginald Henry, a 17-year Edison employee, made the allegations at a Monday 
press conference in San Diego arranged by Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group that is challenging Edison's efforts to take 
over San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. The list supplied by Henry included the 
names of Edison executives, a former U.S. attorney general, several Los Angeles 
Times executives, corporate officers and a handful of California lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps acknowledged that the utility's district offices 
maintain "sensitive customer lists," but said they "do not exist to provide 
preferential service treatment to any customers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Phelps said, the lists are compiled to "provide rapid telephone 
notification to individuals who have a need to know the nature and extent of 
power outages . . . Edison seeks to restore all circuits affected as quickly as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Henry has "completely misrepresented and distorted the purpose" of the lists, 
Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry alleged that Edison has made a practice of developing lists titled 
"Officers, Directors and Other Sensitive Customers." "The purpose of the lists 
is to provide priority service to the residences of those on the lists in the 
event of circuit interruptions and extended outages," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged "practice of redlining customer services is a graphic example of 
the arrogant and insensitive spirit that permeates Edison's upper management," 
Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a telephone interview, Henry was unable to recall any specific 
examples of discriminatory or preferential service given anyone on the list. He 
described generally a 1988 situation when supervisors in Edison's Monrovia 
district argued about whether to send a crew to restore service to a VIP or to 
a so-called low-tolerance customer. Henry said the "important" customer was 
served before the other customer. 
</P>
<P>
UCAN Executive Director Michael Shames on Tuesday maintained that preferential 
treatment "is unlawful and elitism at its most insidious." UCAN has asked the 
state Public Utilities Commission to prohibit Edison from using the lists to 
arrange preferential customer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about it," said PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk. "What 
we're going to have to do, obviously, is look at the allegations and see if 
there is any substance to them, or whether they are just (the charges of) a 
disgruntled employee. . . . That's the challenge for us. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wilk acknowledged that most utilities maintain contact lists of government 
officials who are to be contacted if "they have a major problem . . . (but) 
that's very different from a preferential service list. . . . I think we have 
to be real careful about taking the word of one employee before we get all the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
A utility "must provide service to all customers on an absolutely 
non-discriminatory manner," said Edmund Texeira, interim director of the PUC's 
Division of Ratepayer Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he is on stress disability leave from his job and has a claim 
pending against Edison. He was most recently a customer service manager in the 
company's Monrovia district. Phelps described Henry as "a disgruntled Edison 
employee who has a history of making misleading statements about the company." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which 
represents about 6,000 Edison employees, also maintained that the lists exist. 
"We've known about these lists for a long time," said Dean Cofer, business 
representative for IBEW Local 47. "When there is an outage, those are the areas 
they check first." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cofer was unable to supply specific examples of the lists being used 
to restore service of the supposedly preferred customers first. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nearly 40 names on the list supplied by Henry were former U.S. Atty. 
Gen. William French Smith, Vons Grocery President William Davila, three Los 
Angeles Times executives -- President and Chief Operating Officer Richard T. 
Schlosberg III, Chairman Tom Johnson and Donald Wright, a senior vice president 
-- and Edison Vice President Mike Peevey. The list also included executives of 
several Los Angeles-area corporations, a California assemblyman and a state 
senator's aide.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city schools trustees admitted Tuesday that they have let maintenance 
and repair deteriorate below acceptable levels but offered no assurances that 
they will put more money into improving the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In receiving a comprehensive report on the sorry state of district maintenance, 
board members said they would explore ideas of how to deal with the need for 
new paint, asphalt, boilers and windows at more than two-thirds of the 
district's 179 school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Shirley Weber said the report by six prominent San Diego businessmen 
knowledgeable in maintenance impressed upon her that, "We are at the limit, and 
can't keep putting things off." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the district should increase its $7.3-million annual budget to 
at least $12.5 million to begin catching up on almost a decade of neglect. But 
the district may have to cut instructional and academic programs for next year 
if expected low state revenue forecasts prove correct. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. Tom Payzant said Tuesday that one reason San Diego spends much 
less on maintenance than other California urban districts is because it spends 
more on support of teachers and extra textbooks.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW CHARGES FILED IN THREATS TO BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man was indicted Monday for a second time on charges of threatening 
President Bush, four days after a federal judge dismissed an original 
indictment as too vague. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Schmidt, 44, was accused of telephoning the White House and the Secret 
Service in Los Angeles on Nov. 9 and threatening Bush and former President 
Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. on Monday agreed to release 
Schmidt on $20,000 bond if he enrolled in a residential alcohol treatment 
program. But Hatter ordered Schmidt to remain in federal custody for violating 
probation in Colorado, where he was convicted in 1986 of negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney was trying to obtain Schmidt's release from a no-bond, Colorado 
arrest warrant so Schmidt can enter the treatment program, federal prosecutors 
said Tuesday.

WIDOW SOLD VALUABLES OF SLAIN PORNOGRAPHER FOR $43,000, WITNESSES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a month after pornographer Theodore J. Snyder died in a burst of 
submachine-gun fire, his widow sold her husband's rare coins and jewelry for 
$43,000, according to testimony Tuesday at a preliminary hearing for the widow 
and an alleged hired killer. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged gunman went to a Simi Valley bank shortly after the killing to 
change a rare $10,000 bill that authorities said belonged to Snyder, the bank's 
manager testified. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held in San Fernando Municipal Court for Victor Diaz, 47, and 
Sharon Snyder, 40, of Woodland Hills, who are charged with first-degree murder, 
conspiracy and a special allegation that they killed for financial gain. If 
convicted, they could be sentenced to death, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Snyder offered Diaz $20,000 to kill her husband so that she 
could inherit their property. Her husband was killed on a Northridge street on 
Aug. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Clarke, a Richardson, Tex., jewelry broker, testified Tuesday that on 
Aug. 31, Snyder appeared at his office and sold him her husband's gold ring, 
diamond-studded watch and two gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Rainartsan, manager of the Bank of America branch in Simi Valley, 
testified that Diaz came to the bank in early August and tried to exchange a 
$10,000 bill that Los Angeles Police say had been owned by Snyder. Rainartsan 
said Diaz left with the bill after she told him the bank did not have enough 
smaller bills on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially speculated that Snyder, a flamboyant producer of sex-oriented 
videotapes who friends said liked to show off his Rolls-Royce and expensive 
jewelry, may have been gunned down in an organized-crime "hit." At the time of 
his death, Snyder's Northridge company, VCR Inc., owed $105,000 to a videotape 
distributor linked by federal investigators to an East Coast crime family. 
</P>
<P>
But police later uncovered evidence they said implicated Sharon Snyder and 
Diaz, described by authorities as social acquaintances.

<P>
The tone of Kennedy's statements and your editorial echo most recent 
discussions in implying that universities have overemphasized research in a 
self-interested pursuit of scholarly prestige and research funds. 
</P>
<P>
This may be partly true. However, it must be remembered that at present 
universities are the only institutions at which research in many fields 
(including some areas of science) can be pursued. There are few or no 
opportunities for employment in industry or in the government in these areas of 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Excellent teachers can find employment in liberal art colleges, state campuses 
with a teaching emphasis, and in secondary education -- where their talents are 
sorely needed.

ACCENT THE POSITIVE, NOT NEGATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court has let stand a lower-court ruling that an employer does not 
violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act by refusing to hire someone whose accent 
"interferes materially" with job performance. That decision, though narrowly 
drawn, disturbs many who fear that an employer bent on discrimination will now 
seize on a person's accent as an excuse to get around the employment 
protections provided by civil-rights laws. That is a legitimate and 
understandable apprehension. No less legitimate, though, is the asserted claim 
of employer rights that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld in a 
ruling the high court saw no reason to change. The next step -- the next 
challenge, really -- is to try to prevent this ruling from becoming a tool to 
pry open the door to unfair hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
The case at issue involved a Filipino American who seemed qualified in every 
way for a job with the Department of Motor Vehicles in Honolulu except, in the 
opinion of two interviewers, for an accent that would have made him "difficult 
to understand over the phone." In the view of the appeals court, a refusal to 
hire was justified only because an essential part of the job involved 
communicating with the public. Discrimination? In one sense, yes. But illegal 
discrimination, under the terms of the Civil Rights Act? No, said the court, 
not if an employer made "an honest assessment" that an applicant's oral 
communication skills were inadequate to the needs of the job. 
</P>
<P>
That seems a reasonable enough standard to apply. But it's also, inescapably, 
an ambiguous one, depending as it does on a personal judgment that can vary 
widely from one employer to another, even in the absence of discriminatory 
intent. A rule that rests on subjective interpretations does not make for 
settled law. It seems clear enough what the appeals court intended. It's also a 
good bet that the courts have not seen the last case involving alleged 
discrimination based on accent.

WELFARE OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When, as a journalist, I was researching homelessness in downtown Los Angeles 
it became clear to me that the Department of Public Services located it offices 
in large part as a form of social engineering; that is, it attempts to move the 
homeless from one place in the city to another by moving services from place to 
place. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, too, that welfare workers are quick to cut off services to 
people who miss or are even a few minutes late for scheduled appointments. 
</P>
<P>
They are then required to wait several weeks before receiving welfare again and 
must apply all over again. Putting an office farther away, and requiring long 
bus rides and transfers to reach it, guarantees that large numbers of people 
will mess up in one way or another and miss their appointments. That means that 
either the homeless must move closer to the office or that the welfare rolls 
will dwindle.

<TEXT>
<P>
Your March 27 article on the Supreme Court's decision upholding the insurance 
industry's exemption from local taxes was damaged by a misleading headline 
implying that the court had given the industry a "tax break." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the court's decision simply means that insurers will not be forced to 
pay additional taxes to local government entities. 
</P>
<P>
Such taxes would only increase the cost of insurance to policyholders. We need 
to work toward ways of lowering insurance costs, not increasing them. 
</P>
<P>
The story failed to point out that the more than $1 billion insurance premium 
tax is the fifth largest source of state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry is paying its fair share of taxes and is working hard to 
change the insurance system so that insurance is more affordable to consumers.

PRESERVING OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "History Is People, Not Bricks" (California Commentary, April 2) by 
Rodolfo Acuna was cruel and biased with false information. He does not know the 
facts regarding the curator, Jean Bruce Poole. 
</P>
<P>
She goes the extra mile to promote and preserve the Spanish-Mexican history and 
traditions of El Pueblo de Los Angeles. She does all she can toward maintaining 
the history of Los Angeles and to protect El Pueblo from commercialism and 
further destruction. It seems that Acuna has Poole's efforts confused with the 
projects of other factions working to destroy the historical significance of 
the area. He expects El Pueblo to preserve Mexican history and culture as would 
a Hispanic museum. This is shamefully lacking in Los Angeles but that is 
another issue. 
</P>
<P>

PRESERVING OLVERA STREET

<TEXT>
<P>
I am greatly alarmed at what appears to be yet another effort to "write the 
Mexican-American/Chicano" out of his rightful place in the history of this 
city, state and county. 
</P>
<P>
Again, our people are "expendable." 
</P>
<P>
I have been involved in the Chicano movement for many years and was hanging up 
the gloves (due to age). But, I am ready to put them back on and take up the 
fight once again. 
</P>
<P>
We will not be "erased" from history. We cannot let you remove us from the 
culture and heritage of this city, state and country -- we helped to make it, 
to give it form, to give it value. 
</P>
<P>
I send this challenge to our elected officials and to all men and women of 
conscience -- no more "erasing" of the history of a people. They all belong in 
this mosaic of history -- and each one in his/her place.

GUNS: BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who among us has not shuddered over one of the stories? At least once a week -- 
usually near the bottom of some newspaper column or for a few flickering 
television seconds -- there it is: Two children innocently playing come upon 
the handgun one of their parents purchased for home security. Curiosity 
overwhelms and, in the briefest of moments, childish high-spirits and parental 
carelessness are transformed into irremediable disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the state Senate can take a big step toward saving lives by passing a 
simple, common-sense proposal that first-time handgun purchasers be required to 
take a brief course in the safe handling and storage of firearms. Introduced by 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) -- himself a hunter and gun owner -- the 
bill already has passed the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The narrowness of the vote there earlier this week belies the proposal's 
obvious merits. Before buying a handgun, the purchaser would be required to 
take a safety course not exceeding four hours in length or pass a basic safety 
examination. The cost would be $17. Current and retired law- enforcement 
officials, active and former members of the military, licensed hunters and 
holders of concealed-weapon permits all would be exempt from the process. If 
the measure is signed into law, the state's Department of Justice will begin 
setting up convenient safety courses around the state next year, and the course 
requirement would become effective on Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Areias bill stands squarely in the tradition of the other rational firearms 
regulations passed by the Legislature over the past year. Their singular 
characteristic -- and the thing that has made them a national model -- is the 
balance they strike between the demands of public safety and the rights of 
serious-minded sportsmen and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
Like those other measures, this bill is strongly supported by the state's 
leading law-enforcement officials and opposed only by the National Rifle Assn. 
The Senate should pass it quickly and send it on to Gov. George Deukmejian for 
his signature.

LET 500,000,000 BOTTLES BE BROKEN ALL OVER CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
CHINA: UNDERGROUND DISSIDENTS ARE HOPING THE SMALL GESTURE WILL BREATHE NEW 
LIFE INTO THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHENGSHENG LI, RUILAN LU and D. LI DAVIS, Chengsheng Li served as a member 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and as a senior science director with a 
national agency in China. With his wife, Ruilen Lu, he translated Rachel 
Carson's Silent Spring in 1973. D. Li Davis is an adviser to Chinese dissident 
groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, plainclothes police arrested and pummeled a young man in Tian An Men 
Square until he bled. His crime? Dropping a soda bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Xiaoping, as in Deng Xiaoping, means "little bottle" in Chinese. Since last 
June's massacre in the square, thousands of Chinese have left bits of broken 
bottle glass in public places to protest the government's crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Members of an underground network of Chinese dissidents, which spans five 
continents and 20 countries, faxed messages throughout China calling for 
similar gestures of resistance, including prearranged walks, whispers and 
claps. Thousands of unsigned letters urged a silent stroll through Tian An Men 
Square to honor those who died last spring. And an underground newspaper, Steel 
Currents, called for the formation of a political opposition than could unite 
and disperse on command. All this compelled the Chinese government to shut down 
the area briefly and send in young scouts. 
</P>
<P>
If breaking bottles and walking become subversive acts, the pro-democracy 
movement will triumph. If Tian An Men Square remains heavily guarded, the 
stroll will move to Shangdon Boulevard or to a host of other streets in Beijing 
until the government closes the city down. When the Asian Games open in August, 
foreign friends will chant "Tian An Men, Tian An Men, Tian An Men 
(clap-clap-clap)" in the hopes of starting a chorus. 
</P>
<P>
The Western media have already confirmed that such small gestures of resistance 
in China provoke government brutality, the first step of its self-destruction. 
Last Sunday in Beijing, police arrested a scientist from Southern China for the 
crime of pinning white flowers on his shirt in mourning for pro-democracy 
demonstrators. Such repression cannot quell the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, on the traditional day for remembering the dead -- the 
Qingming Festival -- the Chinese army brutally cracked down in Tian An Men. 
Thousands of Chinese, including one of the above authors, Chengsheng Li, put on 
black arm bands and placed gigantic wreathes and flowers at the Martyrs 
Monument in Tian An Men Square in honor of Chou En-Lai, who had died a few 
months earlier. The following evening, police moved in and clubbed people who 
didn't obey orders to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged by this assault, people fought back, burning two police vehicles and a 
police station bordering the square. The police returned the next night with 
armed gangs and forceably ejected the remaining few thousand 
"counterrevolutionaries." The square stayed closed until it was scrubbed clean 
of the blood. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year later, the government, ironically, revised its assessment of 
the crackdown, calling it the auspicious beginning of the downfall of the Gang 
of Four and the end of the dreaded Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Chinese government fears its own history when it fights the 
momentum of demonstrations that began last April during Qingming. The death of 
Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang ignited the largest show of resistance 
to China's political system in the party's 40-year rule. Other anniversaries of 
last spring's pro-democracy events are also slated for worldwide remembrances 
by exiled dissidents. May 4 marks the 71st anniversary of the 1919 Movement; it 
was also the day last year of the largest student march in China's history. 
</P>
<P>
It took the People's Liberation Army weeks to clear Tian An Men Square, and 
only after it imported and deployed young soldiers who could not speak the 
language of the demonstrators. Since then, the military budget has grown 50%. 
But an army of even 4 million cannot wipe out ideas shared by half-a-billion 
persons, no matter how many it captures, tortures, "educates, self-criticizes" 
and imprisons. 
</P>
<P>
Many of last year's student leaders have escaped China; others remain active 
despite being on most-wanted lists. Protected by thousands of Chinese citizens 
and some sympathetic party officials, Zhai Min recently resurfaced in Beijing 
to announce continuing plans for the democracy movement. His survival, after 
having moved around the country undetected for nine months, highlights the 
widespread support the movement retains. And after a dramatic appearance on 
Hong Kong television last week, Chai Lin, the second-most-wanted fugitive in 
all China, landed in Paris with her husband. This former "commander of Tian An 
Men" recited a poem by Bei Dao: 
</P>
<P>
 I am about to go! 
</P>
<P>
 I have left no ripples 
</P>
<P>
 But my pen to my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a hero ... 
</P>
<P>
 This is an era without heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 But I would not fall 
</P>
<P>
 So that those butchers 
</P>
<P>
 Could show their loftiness 
</P>
<P>
 To block that wind of freedom 
</P>
<P>
 Through those deep, deep bullet wounds 
</P>
<P>
 Bleeds the dawn of red blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at a whisper, scary stuff.

ISLAM, THE WEST'S IMAGINARY MENACE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSLIMS: THEY ARE A PRESENCE IN MANY MATTERS TROUBLING TO THE WEST, BUT THE 
CAUSES ARE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC, NOT RELIGIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is deputy director of the Middle East 
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, and 
the editor of The Politics of Islamic Revivalism. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Cold War is over and communism is collapsing, what more is there 
to fear? For many Western commentators, the answer is Islam. They see its rise 
as the new principal threat to Western security and values, a menacing force in 
an area extending from Yugoslavia to the deserts of Central Asia -- the 
so-called Crescent of Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
This view is as wrongheaded as it is popular. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that, for some time, Islam has been a potent political force. 
The disintegration of the Soviet empire is unleashing forces in Muslim Central 
Asia that could be destabilizing. And large-scale Muslim migration to Europe is 
proving to be disruptive. For some areas, then, the Islamic "menace" is close 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is both false and facile to attribute all new instability in Central and 
South Asia to Islam, or to explaining European problems with immigrant 
communities in terms of their Islamic character. 
</P>
<P>
It is simply incorrect to contend that recent troubles in Azerbaijan, Kashmir 
and in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo were all caused by Islam. In Kosovo, 
a part of the Serbian republic, the primary causes of strife are ethnic 
differences and resentment over Serbian dominance. Azerbaijan's dispute with 
Armenia is basically over territory and is only one element of a national 
crisis stemming from rancor over two centuries of Russian/Soviet imperial 
domination. Even Kashmir's troubles are due more to nationalism than to Islam, 
as most Kashmirians seek independence from India rather than merger with Muslim 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Europe's problem with Muslim immigrants derives primarily from the 
economic and social crisis of their native countries. Even if these people were 
not Muslims, many European countries would find the mass influx of poorly 
educated, untrained peoples stressful; witness the longstanding tensions over 
non-Muslim African and Caribbean immigration. 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, it is also not true that the Islamic movement is intolerant 
or exclusionary. Muslims in Lebanon, for example, are not guilty of intolerance 
because they refuse to continue accepting Christian dominance; nor are 
Palestinians because they demand part of their ancestral homeland; nor are 
Soviet Muslims because they reject Russification and state-ordained atheism. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 200 years the Islamic world has been largely a passive recipient 
of foreign cultural influences, often resulting from imperial expansion. This 
passivity led many Western Orientalists to disdain Muslim societies as 
fatalistic, gripped with inertia, lacking in dynamism. 
</P>
<P>
But during the past two decades there has been a steady rise in Muslim cultural 
consciousness, leading many intellectuals to question the wholesale adoption of 
foreign value systems and to reach into their Islamic culture for new models. 
An outward manifestation of this movement has been the insistence of many 
Muslims, including immigrant communities in Europe, on adherence to a strict 
dress code. This phenomenon recently led to the widely publicized head-scarf 
controversy in France, when the government prohibited Muslim schoolgirls from 
covering their hair. In this case, parochialism was on the Europeans' side, 
reflecting limits of Western tolerance regarding peoples who resist total 
assimilation and a European desire to maintain domestic culture free from 
foreign influence. 
</P>
<P>
In general, for the first time, Western societies have to face what the Islamic 
world has undergone in a much more extensive and systematic way for nearly 
three centuries: an assertive penetration of their societies by an alien 
religion and culture. The West finds this difficult to accept. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is an extremist dimension to the Islamic resurgence, but it 
affects only a small part of a large movement. Moreover, it derives primarily 
from political, social and economic factors other than Islam. Once stripped of 
their Islamic symbolism, the extremists' political views and agendas, both 
domestic and international, closely resemble other secular radical movements in 
the Third World. Even if Islam were to disappear, popular grievances and 
aspirations would incite radicalism. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the problem that both the West and the Soviet Union face in dealing 
with the Muslim world does not derive from Islam the religion. It is rooted in 
the social and economic crises of most Muslim countries, exacerbated by a 
population explosion, and in the Muslims' rising political and cultural 
assertiveness. If the West would see the Islamic phenomenon for what it is -- 
essentially social, economic, cultural and political -- the best approach 
becomes obvious: The West should use such tools as economic assistance to help 
Muslim countries create better living conditions for their citizens, which 
would serve European interests by helping to limit emigration; and it should be 
sensitive to Muslim desires for political and cultural autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Muslim extremism must be countered. But considering Islam to be the 
West's new enemy, lapsing into a medieval parlance of Crusade and Jihad, or 
imposing Western values on Muslims is no answer. It can only benefit Muslim 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is critical need for an ecumenical Christian-Muslim dialogue, 
to lay the foundation of a future relationship based on mutual respect for the 
beliefs, values and legitimate concerns of both communities.

'MY' EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A MISTAKE HERE; THIS HEAP IS A NEW EDEN; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AFTER A VISIT TO ZEKE THE SHEIK'S COMPOST PILE, IT'S HARD TO CALL 
IT A NUISANCE. THE BUREAUCRATS SHOULD LEARN FROM HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN YANDELL, Ben Yandell is the co-author with Janet Nippell of Mostly on 
Foot: A Year in L.A. (Floating Island Press, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other day I drove by Zeke the Sheik's 30-foot-high compost pile in 
Altadena, which briefly caught fire and as a result has been under fire from 
various of my employees. I say they are my employees because they are County of 
Los Angeles bureaucrats, and I am a citizen and taxpayer in this county. I 
wanted to see the nuisance they are attempting to abate in my name and for my 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Zeke was there, talking to neighbors and a stream of visitors. The neighbors 
focused on neighborly concerns like saying hello, getting Zeke to haul some of 
their rubbish away with his truck, or receiving some of the vegetables Zeke 
grows. Some of the visitors were friends, I might even say co-conspirators. I 
should note that there has always been a good supply of free-thinkers living up 
against the San Gabriels, starting with John Brown's sons, who spent a quiet 
old age in a canyon after the raid on Harpers Ferry, continuing through 
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, author of among other things a feminist utopia called 
Herland, and coming into the present with the late Richard Feynman and Jirayr 
Zorthian, who also lives up a canyon. Zorthian likes to make sculptures out of 
telephone poles. I went to junior high with his son, Toby. So the local 
independent characters are numerous, though not all famous. Zeke can count on a 
body of support. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, I visited Zeke partly because I'm curious but also because, like 
Zeke, I have a compost pile. I wanted to see how far I could take mine. You 
see, I've been reading the papers. I've been receiving instructions on how to 
recycle (which I was already doing) from other employees of mine, this time in 
the Pasadena Waste Reduction office. Recently I've been told a lot of things I 
already believe. That we are running out of landfill space. That we need more 
forests but instead are cutting down the rain forests to make toilet paper and 
for ranch land to graze beef for the junk-food chains. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's recycling plan consists of me putting jars, cans, newspapers, motor 
oil, etc., undifferentiated, into a blue bin, which I then put on the curb. The 
glass will probably end up in the landfill anyway. There is not as yet much 
demand for it, in that a large part of the Earth's mantle is made of silicon, 
which can be easily turned into glass that is free of the Paul Newman spaghetti 
sauce I failed to get completely washed out of mine. I used a large quantity of 
water, which in the next couple of months will probably be rationed. 
</P>
<P>
The city's new recycling program costs me $1.50 a month. On the long-awaited 
first day I looked out the front window and saw a middle-aged Latino taking 
most of the contents of my recycling bin. He zig-zagged down the street from 
blue bin to blue bin in a 15-year-old station wagon. I said to my wife, "Janet, 
come look at Pasadena's recycling program," realizing with disappointment just 
as I said it that this was simply a man for whom it made economic sense to go 
house-to-house, picking up other people's recycling. He wouldn't have cost me 
$1.50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
But to return to Zeke's spread and my search for a nuisance, there wasn't one. 
The property, including the "mountain of dung," as the (Pasadena) Star-News 
called it in the headline of a good-natured story, was beautiful. From the top 
of the heap, looking down, I could see that Zeke's square two-story wood house 
sat in a local analog of the rain forest -- lush growth everywhere, succulents 
and cacti, banana trees, palms, fruit trees, taller trees, bushes and shrubs 
too numerous to name. A ladder was propped against bushes. Someone unseen was 
pruning a tree. There were pathways and chickens, ducks and geese roaming free. 
A huge turkey, more than 40 pounds, whose name I have forgotten, but who 
replaced an even larger one named Butch, according to Zeke, functions partly as 
watchdog and will chase intruders through the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Zeke has solved his problem with the fires that got the county out there in the 
first place, but the firefighters are going to come by and pick up some plants 
that he's offered them, he says. He has planted the heap with powerful 
vegetables -- collard and mustard greens, onions, leeks and beets. At the top 
there are roses and azaleas. There are also a couple of crosses, but I think a 
man should be allowed a few eccentricities. It is clear Zeke is trying to 
create on his property, and also on a strip of land apparently owned by a 
nearby cemetery, a new Eden, something whole and alive and so energetic it is 
capable, if not watched, of bursting into flames or at least smoldering. As I 
was leaving he offered to give me some compost to energize my pile. Others have 
come in recent days to haul away a bushel or a truckload in the face of 
imminent threats that Zeke's heap will be forcibly leveled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, my employees, not too worried about the 55-gallon drums of toxic 
waste routinely dumped by the side of the roads of our county, have declared 
Zeke's heap an unlawful landfill. My other employees have neglected to include 
leaves and lawn clippings in their recycling plan, despite the fact that they 
can be composted in any back yard, or commercially, and make up something like 
one-third of what the trash collectors pick up. Soon we will be paying them to 
keep the man out of our blue recycling bin. I find more irony in this than I 
can easily stand.

To Pass Spending Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 362 to 59, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 4404) providing 
$2.4 billion in extra federal spending this fiscal year. About $1.8 billion 
would be taken from the defense budget and the rest is to be newly 
appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's major foreign outlays are $420 million to Panama, $400 million to 
Israel and $300 million to Nicaragua. At home it provides additional funds this 
year for veterans' benefits, food stamps, federal judges' pay, disaster aid, 
federal firefighting and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said: "Now comes the time to follow 
through" on helping Panama and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Toby Roth (R-Wis.) said: "The American people are not in favor of the 
legislation being debated here today." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the extra fiscal 1990 spending.

Foreign Aid 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 72 to 346, the House rejected an amendment to HR 4404 (above) 
shaving about $33 million from the bill's aid to Panama, Nicaragua and Israel. 
Sponsor James A. Traficant Jr.(D-Ohio) said: "I'm tired of foreign aid" at the 
expense of domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.) said the amendment would not lower spending 
but leave the money in the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Counting Hate Crimes 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 402 to 18, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 1048) 
requiring police agencies, including the FBI, to keep statistics on crimes 
motivated by prejudice against race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) said hate crimes "diminish the whole 
community in which they exist." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said it was wrong for the bill to 
"equate homosexuality . . . with the heterosexual lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

COLLEGE BASEBALL: UC SANTA BARBARA WINS GAME FEATURING 10 HOME RUNS AND 15 
EXTRA-BASE HITS.

<P>
David Waco and Denny Vigo are no strangers to each other. West Valley League 
opponents in high school, they renewed their rivalry Tuesday when Waco's UC 
Santa Barbara team visited Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Waco, a second baseman from Chatsworth High, hit a career-high three home runs 
and drove in six runs and Vigo, from El Camino Real, was four for five with 
five runs batted in and a pair of home runs. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Barbara made the most of its power, winning the nonconference game, 
14-13, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Waco and Vigo were not the only hitters to enjoy the favorable wind conditions 
at Matador Field: There were 10 home runs -- five by each team -- and 15 
extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB (28-14) scored three runs in the top of the 10th to take a 14-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge (25-15) battled back on RBI singles by J. D. Haendiges and Craig 
Clayton in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gaucho reliever Gary Adcock (7-4) closed the door on the Matadors, however, by 
getting Scott Richardson (four for seven) to pop to short with runners on first 
and third, and striking out Scott Sharts (hitless in seven at-bats). 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely not a home-run hitter," said Waco, who had one home run and 20 
RBIs entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never hit two in a game before today. . . . But the wind was blowing and 
this is definitely a hitter's park." 
</P>
<P>
Waco's two-run home run in the fourth narrowed Northridge's lead to 5-4, and 
his solo shot in the sixth cut the Gaucho deficit to 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, his one-out, three-run blast off Eric Spellman gave Santa Barbara 
an 11-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo answered with a two-out, solo home run in the bottom of the inning to send 
the game into extra innings.

ACCIDENT VICTIM WAS TRACK STAR AT GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old motorist who died Monday in an accident on the rain-slickened 
Glendale Freeway has been identified by coroner's officials as Pablo Herrera, a 
Glendale College distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, a 1989 graduate of Hoover High, was the Vaqueros' top runner in the 
10,000 meters, in which he had qualified for the Southern California regional 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera was killed after his car skidded off the southbound on-ramp to the 
Glendale Freeway at Mountain Street and plunged down a 50-foot embankment onto 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who was alone, was "traveling too fast for the weather conditions" and 
missed by inches a guardrail that would have blocked his vehicle, California 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tami Low said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers said that all four tires on the car, a 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix, 
were bald. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office will conduct a routine medical 
examination today. Results are expected by the end of the week.

DAMEWORTH, NAJAR, CHUTE PICK COLLEGES

<TEXT>
<P>
A high school distance runner, a power-hitting high school baseball player and 
a junior college first baseman have made commitments to four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High, one of the nation's most highly recruited 
distance runners, signed a national letter of intent with the University of 
Wisconsin on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando High's John Najar signed a letter of intent to play at Fresno 
State and Glendale College first baseman Art Chute made an oral commitment to 
attend Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the 1989 Kinney national cross-country champion, chose the Big Ten 
Conference school over Oregon and Arizona of the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit skeptical about going there because of the cold winters," 
said Dameworth, who won three consecutive state Division I cross-country 
titles. "But when I went to visit, everything just clicked. The coaches and 
athletes seemed to be really close. They all seem to be working toward the same 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin's cross-country tradition didn't hurt. The Badgers won three NCAA 
titles (1982, '85 and '88) during the 1980s and finished in the top four seven 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Najar has slugged seven home runs and driven in 25 runs to lead the area's City 
Section players, and, as a right-handed pitcher, he is 3-1 with a 2.52 
earned-run average. He said that he was recruited as both a position player and 
a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Najar, who also received a scholarship offer from Cal State Northridge, is the 
third area player to sign with Fresno State. Garret Anderson of Kennedy, an 
outfielder, and Bob Kazmirski, a pitcher-shortstop from Agoura, also have 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
Chute, a sophomore from Temple City High, is batting .409 with 41 runs batted 
in and a school-record 10 home runs at Glendale. He chose Fullerton over UC 
Riverside.

UNIFORM EFFORT PROPELS SAUGUS TO 8-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So what if Saugus High doesn't have Roger Salkeld anymore? 
</P>
<P>
They have his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions donned new duds for Tuesday's Golden League game against 
visiting Palmdale -- blue and gray uniforms similar to those of the Seattle 
Mariners, who made Salkeld the nation's third pick in last June's amateur 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed for success Saugus, on the strength of a pair of two-run home runs by 
catcher J. B. Johnson and satisfactory efforts from three inexperienced 
pitchers, fashioned an 8-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The win gives Saugus (11-5-1, 7-1 in league play) a two-game lead over 
second-place Palmdale (9-4, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Saugus Coach Doug Worley, a Seattle native and University of Washington 
graduate, insisted that the new attire was not a tribute to Salkeld. Not 
solely, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a Mariner fan long before he came along," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the uniforms served to boost morale -- which some players needed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, for example, who struck out swinging in the first inning, admittedly 
still feels the sting of last June's 1-0 nine-inning loss to La Palma Kennedy 
in the Southern Section 3-A Division championship game at Dodger Stadium. In 
his last high school game, Salkeld threw a bases-loaded, game-ending wild pitch 
that skidded to the right of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes through my mind every once in a while," Johnson said. "It took a while 
to say, 'Hey, that's only one pitch, I gotta forget that.' But this builds my 
confidence a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Said Worley: "He's been putting too much pressure on himself. I think he had to 
realize, 'Hey, I struck out, but I came back and hit two home runs, that's 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Saugus, powered by Jeff Albert's two-run home run, grabbed a 3-0 first-inning 
lead. In the third, Johnson crushed his first home run as Saugus extended its 
lead to 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale countered with two runs in the top of the fourth, but Johnson smashed 
another two-run shot in the bottom of the inning to give Saugus an 8-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left-hander Chris Hernandez (3-2) scattered four hits and six walks 
over five innings. From there, sophomore Jayme Riggio, who was tagged for two 
runs in the sixth, and junior right-hander Doug Maggiora, who entered in the 
sixth and recorded his second save, mopped up. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale right-hander Jim Carson (4-3), who allowed six runs in 2 2/3 innings, 
took the loss.

BUCS' ANDERSON OFFER TOO LITTLE FOR CHARGERS

The Chargers received and rejected a trade offer from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
for running back Gary Anderson Tuesday, Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They made an offer to show they were sincerely interested," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard would not say what it included but did say Tampa Bay did not offer its 
second-round pick in this year's NFL draft, the 30th overall. Beathard said the 
team is asking for a second-round choice this year as a minimum part of a deal 
for Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given Tampa an idea of what we need, and so far they have not come back 
and offered that," Beathard said. "It might just be a waiting game, or whether 
they're serious we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said Dallas and Seattle had also talked to him about Anderson. 
Beathard said the Cowboys' interest might be heightened because Anderson played 
at Arkansas, the same school at which Cowboy owner Jerry Jones and Coach Jimmy 
Johnson were teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys also have picks available to trade, five choices in the first three 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But John Wooten, Dallas director of pro personnel, said this week that he did 
not think the Cowboys would want to trade for Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going with younger players," Wooten said. "I don't think we'd be 
interested in a player of his age (Anderson turns 29 today)." 
</P>
<P>
And so far, Beathard said, Tampa Bay is the only team to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make it a reasonable offer," Beathard said. "We're not going 
to ask for something where a deal can't be made. We don't want to do that. The 
best interest of the Chargers is that Gary Anderson plays football, and we get 
what's fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any team that has talked to us so far has felt our request 
has been unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the team's most valuable player in 1988, sat out last season in a 
contract dispute. The Chargers would have to sign him before trading him. 
Beathard said that the contract would have to be negotiated with the other team 
in conjunction with Anderson's agent, Peter Johnson of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Chargers would like to trade Anderson before the first round 
of the draft Sunday but said a trade could still be sought after the draft. 
Beathard said the chances of Anderson playing for the Chargers in 1990 were 
"slim" but that it was not impossible.

VICTORY OVER USC IS 800TH OF COACHING CAREER FOR SDSU'S DIETZ 
</P>

Saturday, Jim Dietz survived what he called the worst experience in all his 19 
years of coaching at San Diego State. His team lost an 8-3 lead to Nevada-Reno 
and went on to lose, 9-8, in a game he said was marked by terrible umpiring. 
</P>
<P>
Then, before Tuesday's game against USC, Dietz strained his back trying to pull 
a rain-soaked tarp off Smith Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't make it out here tonight," Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Dietz, he made it. Although the Aztecs blew another late-inning 
lead, they came back to score three runs in the eighth and give him his 800th 
coaching victory with an 9-6 victory over eighth-ranked USC. 
</P>
<P>
In 19 seasons at San Diego State, Dietz has compiled an 800-438-15 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea where I'd be when I took over here," Dietz said. "I knew I had a 
real challenge ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz, 51, has mostly answered it. He has been to six NCAA tournaments and had 
14 consecutive winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Dietz said it's becoming more difficult each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much harder than it was eight years ago with all the budget cutbacks," 
Dietz said. "It's tough for us to recruit without a decent facility. I don't 
know how many more I've got left in me." 
</P>
<P>
If Dietz never gets to 900, he will surely remember this one and the two-run 
double by Brian Grebeck that gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs and Scott Dennison on third, USC pitcher Eric Hughes 
intentionally walked Jeff Barry to get to Grebeck. But Grebeck lined Hughes's 
fastball up the alley in left-center field to score Barry and Dennison. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect him to do it," Dietz said. "He's been with us two years." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grebeck: "He made a mistake, and I just hit it. I was glad that we finally 
got him his 800th." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Johnson followed with another double, his third hit of the game, to 
make it 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Filter (4-2) pitched the last 1 2/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (30-14) took a 5-3 lead in the fifth on Johnson's walk, a Darin McGhee 
sacrifice and back-to-back doubles by Steve Boucher and Bill Dunckel. The 
Aztecs added another run in the sixth on Grebeck's double, a sacrifice and a 
wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
USC (28-15, ranked sixth by Baseball America) tied it at six by scoring three 
times on only one hit. After throwing three hitless innings, the Aztecs' Brian 
Holliday walked two batters and allowed a hit to load the bases. Filter 
replaced Holliday and walked in a run. A fielder's choice scored another, and 
Scott Dennison's throwing error allowed the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU leaves today for Hawaii, where it will play a four-game series against the 
Rainbows beginning Friday. The Aztecs are 10-2 in the Western Athletic 
Conference, leading second-place Wyoming by two games and Hawaii by 2 1/2.

<P>
The Volvo World Cup equestrian competition will be coming to the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds in 1992, marking the first time the event will be held in the 
western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is an Olympic year, the event should provide a preview of the 
Olympics, with most competitors going on to the Games in Barcelona. Del Mar 
gained the competition over bids from Tampa and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria (Brooks) Parry, chairwoman of the event, estimates that over 50,000 
visitors will attend. A $5.4-million horse show arena is being constructed and 
will be completed by January 1991. 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Jack Avina, who was basketball coach at the University of Portland for 17 
years, was hired as a part-time assistant at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
USD Coach Hank Egan says Avina will be involved exclusively in teaching 
situations with players. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Coach Avina almost 20 years," Egan said. "I have a great deal of 
respect for his knowledge of the game and his ability to communicate with the 
young players." 
</P>
<P>
Avina was at Portland from 1970 to 1987, compiling a 222-243 record. In 1978, 
Portland finished 19-8, and Avina was honored as the conference coach of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Avina worked as coach of a professional team in 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego scored five runs in the eighth to defeat Cal Poly 
Pomona, 10-6, in a nonconference game at Pomona. USD (18-25) picked up its runs

HIRMEZ LOSES DAY'S PAY BUT NO GAME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midfielder Waad Hirmez was suspended by Socker President Ron Cady Tuesday for 
one day without pay for sitting out the second half of the Sockers' 2-1 loss to 
St. Louis Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez will not miss any games and will play against Wichita Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez decided not to return after arguing with Newman, who told him he needed 
to speed up. Newman said he wanted Hirmez on the bench in the second half, but 
Hirmez decided he didn't want to be there if he wasn't going to play and 
watched from the stands.

Telecommunications: Chicago-based Ameritech said first-quarter net income rose 
1% from a year earlier to $303.5 million, while revenue increased 5% to $2.6 
billion. The firm said results were affected by one-time expenses of about $54 
million related to work force reductions. 
</P>
<P>
GTE Corp. posted record first-quarter earnings of $355 million, a gain of 8%. 
Consolidated revenue and sales were up 9% to $4.5 billion. The Stamford, 
Conn.-based company said the results were driven by continued strong 
performance in its telephone operations and other telecommunications 
businesses. St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose 
4% to $247.8 million. Revenue totaled $2.1 billion, up 4% from the same period 
a year ago. The firm attributed the increased earnings to strong growth in its 
cellular telephone division and increased access lines in its telephone 
business. United Telecommunications Inc. said first-quarter net income climbed 
41% from a year ago to $108 million. Revenue totaled $2 billion, a gain of 15%. 
The Kansas City, Mo., firm, which is the parent of US Sprint, the nation's 
third-largest long-distance carrier, attributed the results to increased 
revenue and unit volume at US Sprint.

Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, said first-quarter profit fell to $231 
million, down 56% from a year earlier. The New York banking giant's problems 
stem from pressures on its corporate and investment banking business in Japan, 
Europe and North America, and a drop in Brazilian debt interest payments. It 
also has been hurt by the downturn in Northeast real estate values.

ACLU: A LAW FIRM UNTO US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN DEFENSE OF AMERICAN LIBERTIES: A HISTORY OF THE ACLU by Samuel Walker Oxford 
University Press $24.95, 479 pages 
</P>
<P>
Is the American Civil Liberties Union a "criminals' lobby," as former Atty. 
Gen. Ed Meese once called it? 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Walker's "In Defense of American Liberties," an authoritative and 
exhaustive history of the ACLU, demonstrates that Meese was dead wrong: If the 
ACLU is a lobbyist, its only real client is the Bill of Rights. Indeed, the 
ACLU is more nearly a jurisprudential SWAT squad that rolls out whenever our 
liberties are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
As Walker describes some of the ACLU's most controversial crusades -- on behalf 
of Nazis, PLO sympathizers, pornographers and the Ku Klux Klan -- we are 
reminded that its vigilance and its willingness to advocate unpopular causes 
have been repugnant even to some of its most ardent supporters. But the fact 
remains that the rest of us enjoy the luxury of taking our freedom for granted 
precisely because the ACLU is so tenacious in protecting the rights of the 
friendless and the despised. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1917, we learn, the civil libertarians who later created the ACLU 
were dismissed as a "little group of malcontents" when they championed the 
dangerous idea of freedom of speech during wartime. (The New York Times warned: 
"Jails are waiting for them.") Essentially the same slander was at work more 
than a half-century later when George Bush dismissed Michael Dukakis as "a 
card-carrying member of the ACLU" in the 1988 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker makes it clear that the ACLU is not a militant organization that 
takes to the streets or the barricades, although its current membership exceeds 
270,000. Rather, Walker depicts the ACLU as "the nation's largest law firm," a 
network of thousands of "cooperating attorneys" throughout the United States 
who are handling a thousand cases at any given moment. Some 80% of "the 
proverbial 'landmark cases' " in American constitutional law, according to 
Walker, are the result of the ACLU's quiet, sober and diligent work in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
"With some justification, the ACLU can claim to have shaped contemporary 
values," argues Walker. "When the ACLU was founded in 1920, the promises of the 
Bill of Rights had little practical meaning for ordinary people. Today, there 
is a substantial body of law in all the major areas of civil liberties. . . . 
The ACLU can legitimately claim much of the credit -- or be assigned the blame, 
if you prefer -- for the growth of modern constitutional law." 
</P>
<P>
"In Defense of American Liberties" is what I would call a semi-official 
history; Walker, as he is quick to point out, serves on the board of directors 
of both the ACLU and its Nebraska affiliate, and he was an active participant 
in some of the very cases and controversies that he describes. And, since 
Walker's book is a work of legal and institutional history, the prose is 
densely packed with names, dates, acronyms, factional politics and the 
metaphysical nuances of law and politics. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Walker appears to be too generous or too circumspect about his 
forebears and fellow activists in the ACLU. For example, he admits that "the 
ACLU's greatest failure during the cold war was turning a blind eye on the 
FBI." He even concedes that Morris Ernst, one of the ACLU's most influential 
and even beloved leaders, was "the FBI's advocate in the ACLU." But he does not 
fully confront recently discovered evidence suggesting that Ernst was perfectly 
willing to sell out Julius and Ethel Rosenberg by joining their defense team 
and acting as an FBI informer. (William L. Shirer, whose memoirs were recently 
reviewed in these pages, makes similar charges against Ernst.) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's impossible to argue with Walker's observation that "the 
revelations from the FBI files were a ghost from the past, a relic of an era 
and an ACLU that were long gone." Walker concludes: "If anything, the ACLU's 
attitude (toward cooperation with the FBI) had swung radically in the opposite 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
As I read "American Liberties," I was reminded of Pastor Martin Niemoeller's 
poignant warning against remaining silent when only the rights of others are at 
stake: "Then they came for me," Niemoeller recalls of the day when he, too, 
fell victim to the Third Reich, "and by that time, there was no one left to 
speak up for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Walker's book is especially instructive in a era when so many nations 
and peoples are struggling to build democracy on the ruins of a failed 
totalitarian empire. If America is a light unto the nations, it is only because 
of the courage of men and women of conscience, including the members of the 
ACLU, who are willing to speak up for even the least popular and least 
appealing among us.

NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS; 
</P>
<P>
CAN'T FIND THE CAN? . . . IT'S EASY AS DUCK SOUP

<P>
Tired of hunting in the cupboard for that can of soup you want but can't find? 
With Canup, a Californian's invention, consumers can double their kitchen 
cupboard space by hanging cans in holders that fasten to the underside of 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Canup, designed by James Cosgrove of Baldwin Industries Inc. in South Gate, is 
made of sturdy plastic and can be attached with pressure-sensitive tape or 
three wood screws. Its plastic panel grips cans' metal edges to hold them 
securely. It holds four, 10 3/4- or 12-ounce cans that can be slipped in from 
the end or snapped in and out. 
</P>
<P>
RV owners and boaters also may want to consider the holder "for space reasons 
and load stabilizing capabilities," Cosgrove says, adding he plans to market 
other Canups to hold larger cans. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail price for a three-pack of holders, which come in white, red or 
black, is $6.95. They're available through three catalogues: Colonial Garden 
Kitchens ((800) 752-5552), Ambassador's Easy Living ((602) 747-5000) and Taylor 
Gifts ((215) 789-7007). Or you can order them directly from Baldwin Industries 
Inc., 5211 Chakemco St., South Gate, Calif. 90280; phone, (213) 569-3266. Cost 
is $6.95 for a three-pack, plus $2 shipping and handling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mini-Water Bed Can Be Used Hot or Cold 
</P>
<P>
Suffering from muscle tension in your neck, shoulders or back? Consider 
Aqua-Cel, a portable water pad that can be microwaved. 
</P>
<P>
The 12- by 11 1/2-inch plastic cushion can be filled with hot tap water or 
placed in a microwave for use in heat therapy; for cold, use cold tap water or 
refrigerate before applying. When filled, its manufacturers say, water is 
channeled through the Aqua-Cel "creating a mini water bed." 
</P>
<P>
It's portable -- about an inch thick when not filled -- fitting easily into a 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Aqua-Cel contains no chemicals, gels or electric components and stays hot or 
cold for about an hour. It's available at Dana Boutique and Drug Store in 
Burbank, Northridge Pharmacy in Northridge, Friedman's Microwave Store in Long 
Beach and Orange and Moulton Plaza Pharmacy in Laguna Hills. If you can't find 
it, you can order it, for $29.95 plus $3.50 shipping and handling (Californians 
add 6.25% tax), from International Diversified Technologies, 2211 E. Winston 
Road, Suite G, Anaheim, Calif. 92806; phone, (714) 635-1815.

A Handy Hook for Heavyweight Hanging 
</P>
<P>
The PowerHook lets you hang a heavy mirror, clock or painting on dry wall 
without searching all day for that wall stud. 
</P>
<P>

SCREEN STYLE: TURTLE DOVES

THE SHOW: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" 
</P>
<P>
THE SET-UP: Based on the veeeery popular comic book/cartoon characters created 
by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, this film charts the adventures of a quartet 
of rambunctious mutant teen-age turtles who live in the sewers of New York, 
where they fight crime. With the help of human reporter April O'Neil (Judith 
Hoag) and martial artist vigilante Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), the teen-age 
turtles chase after The Foot, a gang of street kids and ninja warriors. Therein 
lies the tale. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: The turtle's togs in foam rubber are manufactured by the wizardly Jim 
Henson, creator of The Muppets. But there is a Raymond Chandler style trench 
coat and hat disguise one turtle wears, which costume designer John Hay put 
together. Clothes for the sinister ninja Foot gang are the typical, Kung Fu 
black belt variety. But the Shredder's samurai-like costume is awesome, based 
on early designs by the comics creators Eastman and Laird. About the totally 
radical cape, Hay said, "We had a whole superstructure under it to keep the 
fabric out and flowing. The fabric is a synthetic that is over dyed and 
over-sprayed." The grungy street wear for actor Elias Koteas is off the rack. 
The same is true for Judith Hoag as reporter April O'Neil. "We decided against 
the yellow jumpsuit April wears in the comics," said Hay. She needed to look 
more like a modern, TV anchor woman. 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: Hey, get real! Turtles don't NEED labels! However, sidewalk vendors 
in Soho and the East Village in New York provided most of the 500 outfits Hay 
needed for the Foot gang. And since the film was made last summer, in a very 
hot North Carolina, most clothing decisions were made for comfort and a quick 
change. 
</P>
<P>
THE WRAP UP: Ninja wear could be the hot fashion look for night prowlers this 
summer -- a turtleneck, tight pants and subtle shoes, all black, along with a 
bold colored headband. And turtle togs could win the race for daytime's 
trendiest pre-teens. Already the look has flooded the pajama and T-shirt 
markets. And we saw a kid wearing a turtle mask the other day. SUE MARTIN

Question: Different restaurants serve different types of breads with their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
I've even been to some restaurants that put down a tray of Danish pastry when 
you first sit down. I know that Danish is a kind of cake, so I avoid it. But 
what about an English muffin? Is that considered acceptable if you're trying to 
watch your weight? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: An English muffin is acceptable. Danish, sweet rolls and coffee cake 
are not.

Quick, Before the Phantom Disappears: Can the sizzling black-market ticket 
prices for "Phantom of the Opera" get any hotter? Yes, if the tickets are for 
Michael Crawford's final performances. 
</P>
<P>
In one Times Classified ad Tuesday, tickets for Crawford's last date as the 
phantom on April 29 were offered at $1,500 each. Four were available, and they 
were listed as good orchestra seats. Compared to that, another ad offered 
Crawford last-day tickets at a bargain basement price, two balcony seats at 
$500 a piece. BETH KLEID

Music to Critics' Ears: "The Piano Lesson," August Wilson's Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play, opened Monday at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theater to rave 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Wilson's most accomplished work to date, resonating with a poetry that 
enhances a strong story and illuminates a half dozen or so expertly drawn 
characters," wrote AP drama critic Michael Kuchwara. Frank Rich of The New York 
Times wrote: " 'The Piano Lesson' is joyously an African-American play: It has 
its own spacious poetry, its own sharp angle on a nation's history and its own 
palpable ghosts." And from the New York Post's Clive Barnes: "This is a 
wonderful play that lights up man. See it, wonder at it, and recognize it."

NEW WORKS AT THE JAPAN AMERICA THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of his duties as the Los Angeles Philharmonic's composer-in-residence, 
Steven Stucky told a reporter last week, is "to be seen a lot," to be publicly 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
Stucky was exactly that -- he was ubiquitous, even -- Monday night. At the 
Japan America Theatre he conducted all five works at the latest performance by 
the Philharmonic's New Music Group, and did so with energy and authority. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, he assembled a varied, striking and potent program: To frame 
first performances of works by himself, William Kraft and Donald Crockett, 
Stucky chose Schoenberg's "Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte" and Stravinsky's 
"Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett's engrossing "Still Life With Bell" received its world premiere in 
what seemed a fair and transparent reading by 14 members of the group. A 
quarter-hour piece in a fragmented but apprehendable atonal style, "Still Life" 
could easily become the background for an abstract film, or the basis of a 
dramatic ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Mournful, grating and passionate by turns, Stucky's 5-year-old Double Concerto 
for violin, oboe and chamber orchestra arrived at its first West Coast hearing 
clearly polished and handsomely delivered. 
</P>
<P>
One is tempted to call the work neo-Bartokian, but its actual stylistic 
identity is much more complex; it broods in a unique manner. Tamara Chernyak 
and Barbara Winters were the protagonists, interacting responsively with 
colleagues and with conductor Stucky to produce emotional resonances of a dark 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
The first complete performance of Kraft's "Three Settings from 'Pierrot 
Lunaire' " accomplished similar success. 
</P>
<P>
Performed by soprano Jennifer Trost and a sextet of instrumentalists, and 
conducted pertinently by Stucky, these musical realizations of poems by Albert 
Giraud, originally commissioned by the Arnold Schoenberg Institute (as part of 
the now-concluded "Pierrot Lunaire" project), made a stronger impact as a group 
than they might individually. Rangy but vocally grateful, they use the 
instrumental body in colorful and pointed ways, and demand further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Vasquez was the Reciter and Gloria Cheng the pianist, with a quartet of 
Philharmonic members, in Schoenberg's "Ode." The evening concluded with a 
sometimes scrappy, often game reading of the "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto.

BOB FLORENCE BAND OVERCOME BY CRAFTSMANSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 18-man behemoth known as Bob Florence's Limited Edition took to the stand 
Monday in the latest of promoter Diane Varga's weekly big band events at the 
Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An eclectic composer and arranger, Florence proudly informed his listeners that 
"We have no subs in the band tonight." That this was his basic personnel was 
reflected in the infallible accuracy with which his six saxes, five trumpets 
and four trombones interpreted the demandingly intricate music. 
</P>
<P>
For all the ingenuity of his writing, though, there were times when 
craftsmanship took precedence over creativity. Although Florence is a writer of 
sufficient skill to avoid derivative tricks, his tendency to borrow from 
familiar sources was often in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
A reworking of Johnny Mandel's "Emily" vacillated between piano solo and 
orchestral passages, with Florence showing respect for the original Bill Evans 
waltz treatment before the band jazzed it up, complete with pointless quotes 
from "Things Ain't What They Used to Be." This patchwork chart, despite 
ingenious use of everything from flutes to contrabass clarinet, never settled 
into a firm indentity. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberately secondhand was Florence's "Big Band Treasure Chest," packed with 
references, some obvious and others obscure, to Ellington, Goodman, Basie and 
Herman among others. But his version of the Harold Arlen standard "Out of This 
World" was truly original, showing that he does not need to rely on gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the band's warmth lies less in the writing than in several strong 
soloists, notably Steve Huffsteter on fluegelhorn, Lanny Morgan on alto sax and 
Charlie Loper on trombone. The ensemble was driven by drummer Peter Donald, 
whose power and precision kept the rhythmic pulse in flawless shape. 
</P>
<P>
The skill Florence has shown over the years leaves no doubt that he can tackle 
just about any orchestrational challenge. The proof was present again on 
Monday, but along with it came reminders that a first-rate talent can be 
qualified by reliance on secondhand ideas. LEONARD FEATHER

CULTURE WITH A CAPITAL K AT COUNTY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Envision this: Berlin as the Kapital of Kultur, home to the most vibrant 
population of artists, filmmakers, writers and thespians on the planet. Best 
museums, finest theaters, most creative fashions. Makes New York look like 
Cleveland and Paris like Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Some intellectuals believe that could have happened in Berlin during the Weimar 
Republic (1919-33) if Hitler and his thugs hadn't usurped power. One doubts it. 
Despite an artistic flowering that included everyone from Max Beckmann to 
Marlena Dietrich, from Ernst Lubitsch to Alfred Doblin and Thomas Mann, social 
conditions were ghastly. The period was bracketed by runaway inflation at one 
end and the Great Depression at the other. The notion of Berlin becoming top 
town under such conditions finally reads like a wistful pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
Today's different. This is a moment when pipe dreams come true. With West 
Germany a world economic powerhouse, national reunification gaining momentum 
and East Germany's healing, moving apology for the Holocaust, anything seems 
possible. Even good things. Perhaps the vision of an artistically great Berlin 
will turn out to have been but a deferred reality. 
</P>
<P>
All these matters and more lend unusual interest to "Envisioning America" 
opening today at the County Museum of Art. It's a relatively small but 
intensely pungent compendium of 70 prints, drawings and photographs emphasizing 
the scathing satire of George Grosz and contemporaries such as Otto Dix and 
Rudolph Schlichter. 
</P>
<P>
The show comes with a particularly smart catalogue but even without it the 
material provokes so many ideas it makes Conceptualism look vapid. And it's 
real art. The installation looks better here than it did at Harvard's Fogg Art 
Museum where it was organized by the university's Busch-Reisinger Museum, but 
the game's the same. It's name is Amerikanismus -- a passion for things Yankee 
that gripped the Berlin avant-garde who pictured their American imaginings and 
emulated the States' cocky Charleston style. Grosz dedicated a self-portrait to 
Charlie Chaplin, Dix pictured himself as a red Indian, Helmut Herzfelde changed 
his name to John Heartfield. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful images lace the show. An entry for the Chicago Tribune Tower 
competition shows the building as an Indian chief in the pose of the Statue of 
Liberty. Nobody seems to have noticed this art as a precursor of Pop. The 
Germans were fascinated with our popular culture. They glorified filmmaking and 
made Chaplin an honorary Dadaist. "Modern Times" proved them right. Black jazz 
musicians and wiggly white girls enchanted. Josephine Baker wowed them with her 
revue in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Beckmann suggested the psychological complexity of the attraction in his 
frenetic etching "Tauentzienpalast." It shows a white woman and a black man 
dancing. Looks like straight social satire but it gets more complicated. The 
man may be Beckmann himself in blackface, the others his wife and son, the 
staging a metaphor of his crumbling marriage. 
</P>
<P>
These artists hung highly personal feelings on racial, gender and even 
occupational types. A shrink would certainly see highly subjective longings for 
primitive childhood freedom in their troubled romance with blacks and Indians 
or macho power fantasies in their limning of capitalist (but important) 
plutocrats. But they are not going to get by in these touchy times without 
being suspected of prejudice and stereotyping. The whole genre of caricature is 
called into question in a epoch when absolutely nobody is properly the butt of 
a joke except politicians and tyrants. What satire has going for it is 
democracy. It razzes everybody equally. Real caricature is ambivalent in 
spirit. The objects of its mirth reflect the universal human capacity to love 
and fear something simultaneously. You can spot real downer caricature in an 
instant in the despicable catalogue illustration for the Nazi's 1938 
"Degenerate Music" exhibition. You see its black jazz saxophonist with the star 
of David on his lapel and your blood runs cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Amerikanismus" was all about the artist's waffling feelings toward the 
American myth. It stood for progress and modernity against the stuffy hypocrisy 
of the German burgher establishment. It was cool and free, rapacious and 
depersonalizing at once. Paul Klee adored the aesthetic perfection of "Negroid 
Beauty" while Gerd Arntz saw "Things American" as child-art bathing beauties 
lined up with a lynched man. Silliness and violence. Heartfield borrowed 
elements of film montage and snappy Yank graphic design, but he used it to 
praise Upton Sinclair and trash Henry Ford, the "KarKing." A determinedly 
left-wing lot with too much artistic detachment to be truly ideological. 
</P>
<P>
What is all this about then, really? It's about traveling someplace you've 
never been except in imagination. Wanderlust is a German word and they seem to 
have invented the impulse. Their cultural Sehnsucht for America doesn't begin 
with the Dadaists. It started a century earlier with the translation of James 
Fenimore Cooper's "Leatherstocking" tales, the same ones that turn up as a Pop 
icon in Karl Hubbuch's 1921 "Lederstrumpf." 
</P>
<P>
It resurfaces in the Brecht-Weill opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of 
Mahagonny" longing for an Alabama moon and is a regular theme of filmmakers 
from Wim Wenders to Werner Herzog. Everybody is on an alienated quest for 
utopia. When Grosz and other Germans fled to the promised land to escape the 
Nazis, most were bitterly disappointed. Nobody has found utopia yet but in 
these days when anything can happen it might turn out to me right there in the 
old Heimatstadt, hometown Berlin.

Five environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund and 
Citizens for a Better Environment, filed suit in U.S. District Court in San 
Francisco to force the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose cleanup 
rules for southern San Francisco Bay. The suit alleges that California missed a 
Feb. 4 deadline to submit "individual control strategies" required by the Clean 
Water Act for four major pollution sources -- sewage plants run by the cities 
of San Jose and Santa Clara, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale -- as well as local storm 
drains.

No criminal charges will be filed in the deaths of three boys and four would-be 
rescuers who drowned in ice-covered Convict Lake in February, Mono County Dist. 
Atty. Stan Eller said. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's investigation failed to find enough evidence to support charges 
against staff at Camp O'Neal, a group home for troubled boys, in the Feb. 19 
drownings, the prosecutor said. "After review of the reports compiled by your 
department, I will not be filing any criminal charges regarding this tragedy. I 
feel that there is insufficient evidence to establish criminal liability beyond 
a reasonable doubt as it relates to the action of individuals at Camp O'Neal," 
Eller said in a memo to Sheriff Martin Strelneck. State investigators blamed 
the drownings on a "lack of appropriate care and supervision" by the staff, and 
closed the camp. A hearing on the camp's appeal of the decision is set for Aug. 
27.

4 1/2-YEAR-OLD GIRL DYING OF CANCER 'JUST RADIATES LOVE' 
</P>

Those who work on floor 4W of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles have become 
accustomed to the sight of a little blind girl playing make-believe in the 
hallway, wandering about in way-too-big size 8 red shoes, pretending to be 
Dorothy from the "Wizard of Oz" and having the time of her life, even though 
she is fully aware that her life may soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
"She's amazing," said nurse Cammie Lancaster. "If people could only view the 
world the way Kati views it. With Kati, everything is magical. . . . She's 
always reaching out to other people. She just radiates love." 
</P>
<P>
"Kati" is 4 1/2-year-old Kati Sleeman, who has suffered more hardship during 
her short life than most people will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
At seven weeks, she was diagnosed with retinoblastoma -- a cancerous tumor of 
the eye. Her right eye was removed shortly thereafter. At 2 1/2, she lost the 
other eye. After a year of intensive chemotherapy and radiation, another 
cancerous tumor appeared, this one near her brain. 
</P>
<P>
Her cancer has now spread into her bone marrow, her spinal fluid and her lymph 
glands. Her doctors say she will not live much longer. 
</P>
<P>
But Kati, who has resided at Childrens Hospital for the past six months (and on 
and off for most of her life), is by all accounts a wondrous child -- ebullient 
and friendly with a crackerjack wit, mature beyond her years and more accepting 
of her fate than is even her own family. 
</P>
<P>
Full of love and full of life, she has charmed the hospital staff, from her 
doctors to the public relations people to the housekeeper, a close friend even 
though the two speak different languages. 
</P>
<P>
And so it came as no surprise at Childrens Hospital that when the Make-a-Wish 
Foundation offered to fulfill her fantasy, Kati did not do what most children 
do. She did not choose to visit Disneyland, or to meet a celebrity or take a 
trip to Hawaii -- even though her parents told her she could have any one of 
these things. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she simply asked for a party. She wanted it at the hospital, with the 
staff by her side. And with pizza -- even though she cannot eat solid food 
anymore. "I like parties," she explained when asked about her decision. "I love 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, at 2 p.m., Kati got her wish. It was a poignant affair; more than a 
few of the guests had tears in their eyes. But it was also a typical, if a 
little bit elaborate, kids party -- colored balloons, toys, a clown, a 
scrapbook for the guests to sign, a cake that depicted the Emerald City of Oz 
and dozens and dozens of friends and admirers who came to pay homage to the 
little girl who has stolen the heart of Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They almost need two scrapbooks, she's got so many friends" said Patty Kelly, 
a special-education teacher who works at the hospital, as she and about a dozen 
others waited in line to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an incredible little girl," said Barbara Edelman, who as the hospital's 
tumor registrar is required to report all cases of cancer to the state. "She 
recognizes people by voice. I can walk into the room and she knows who I am 
just by my saying, 'Hi Kati.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to her doctors, Kati's disease, retinoblastoma, is the most common 
form of eye tumor in children but is still relatively rare. It strikes 1 in 
20,000 youngsters and accounts for about 1% of all childhood cancers, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of all children who have retinoblastoma survive it, said Dr. A. Linn 
Murphree, an expert in the disease who has been treating Kati since she was an 
infant. Most victims are affected in only one eye, he said, and generally that 
eye is removed and sight in the other eye remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
But in Kati's case, the cancer is particularly vicious. Although doctors have 
tried "everything that is available to mankind" to put it in remission, 
Murphree said, it has returned with a tumor in the center of her forehead. Now, 
there is "virtually no cure," he said. The tumor got so big that doctors were 
forced to remove one of Kati's glass eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Through all this Kati is not at all depressed -- a fact her doctor finds 
remarkable. "I think Kati has a special spirit," Murphree said. "She has always 
been able to overcome the pain that she was experiencing. She has never been 
down. She has never felt depressed." 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, instead of prancing up and down the hospital corridor as she 
normally does, she was lying in a buggy, ordering her father to wheel her 
about. Her condition has deteriorated considerably in the past few days, and 
Glenn Sleeman explained that his daughter had been unable to walk since the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
When a neurologist appeared and told her he wanted to check her legs and feet, 
Kati's retort was quick: "You're not gonna do nothin' to me, are you?" When 
those around her laughed, she issued a firm instruction: "Don't laugh. It gives 
me a headache." 
</P>
<P>
When the doctor tried to have her stand, she was unusually uncooperative. But 
not more than a half-hour later, after her mother had dressed her in her pink 
satin party dress and pink sparkled slippers, she did something typically Kati. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to walk," she declared. And she did -- almost all the way to her party. 
</P>
<P>
Murphree and others credit Kati's pluck and her positive outlook to her 
parents. Although the family makes its home in San Bernardino, Kathy Sleeman 
since January has lived in her daughter's room in the hospital, amid electronic 
monitors and sealed-off chambers and intravenous equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"She's taught me so much, more than I have ever learned in my whole life, and 
I'm very thankful for it," she said. "I feel like I'm the luckiest mother in 
the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
The Sleemans decided long ago to be open with Kati about her illness and its 
prognosis. When she expressed a curiosity about cemeteries, they decided to 
bring her along when they selected a burial plot for the family. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as she nears the end of her life, Kati has been talking more and more 
frequently about heaven. At times, her mother said, the little girl uses these 
conversations to comfort not herself, but those around her. 
</P>
<P>
Because she cannot see, touch means a lot to Kati, and one of her favorite 
things to do is to snuggle close to Kathy Sleeman and rub her mother's ear. Not 
long ago, her mother said, Kati remarked upon that habit: 
</P>
<P>
"She said that when she's in heaven and I feel a tickle in my ear, it will be 
her."

SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES IN ANTELOPE VALLEY WORK A TOUGH, LONELY BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They patrol the deserts and mountains of Los Angeles County's last frontier in 
Chevy Blazers, carrying semiautomatic rifles along with the Sheriff 
Department's standard-issue shotguns and pistols. 
</P>
<P>
They take on wandering bears, paramilitary groups, escaped horses, desert 
nomads, poachers and drug-dealing urban gang members who have set up shop in 
the Antelope Valley desert. 
</P>
<P>
And they like it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like my own station," said Deputy Richard Ingalls, who is the deputy in 
the unincorporated desert areas of Lake Los Angeles, Littlerock, Sun Village 
and Pearblossom. "I'm my own detective. I do my own follow-up work." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike police officers who commute to their beats from distant suburban 
refuges, Ingalls works out of his home in the far rural reaches of the Antelope 
Valley station's 1,500-square-mile patrol area. Like frontier sheriffs of old, 
the community deputies are well-known and often the only law around. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, they're out there by themselves," said Sgt. Ron Shreves, 
spokesman for the Antelope Valley station. "There are situations where bravado 
alone is not going to prevail. Maturity is a big factor. You need someone 
experienced, someone able to talk to people." 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley community deputy program was created five years ago to 
respond to complaints in Acton and Agua Dulce about slow response times and 
minimal contact with the Sheriff's Department. Increasing population and crime 
subsequently led to creation of a community deputy in the eastern valley and 
one in the western mountain communities of Leona Valley. The only similar 
patrols in the county are resident deputies in Gorman and on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a necessity out here," said Greg Gerard, principal of Challenger Middle 
School in Lake Los Angeles, where 15,000 residents live amid desert buttes. 
"It's the only link we have. Prior to that, we would call the department and 
get a car in a half an hour or maybe four or five hours." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gary, former president of the Agua Dulce Civic Assn., said the patrol has 
improved police protection and community relations during the day, when a 
deputy is on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
But at night, Agua Dulce residents believe they do not get enough service when 
other, rotating deputies are less familiar with the winding roads and stark 
canyons south of Acton, Gary said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the people still want quicker response times," he said. 
"Under the best conditions, it takes 20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have said the Sheriff's Department should consider shifting Agua 
Dulce into the Santa Clarita station's jurisdiction. Sheriff's officials at the 
Lancaster station said they are working to improve coverage and expect a new 
Palmdale station to improve matters, because deputies will be based closer to 
Acton and Agua Dulce and will be able to spend more time there. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies also said the potential for slower response times comes with the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
A new problem for deputies is gangs, particularly in Lake Los Angeles and Sun 
Village. Local youths, some of whose parents moved from the city to escape 
urban threats, are claiming allegiance to Los Angeles-area gangs and causing 
problems in schools and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very big shock to the parents," Ingalls said. "They say, 'We moved here 
to get away from that.' And you tell them: 'You have to make a stand.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ingalls, 32, oversees a vast and diverse territory, about 400 square miles. Two 
other deputies help police the area bounded by the Kern County line on the 
north, the city limits of Lancaster and Palmdale on the west, the San 
Bernardino Mountains on the south and the San Bernardino County line on the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
On a crisp, sunny morning recently, Ingalls cruised from the peach fields of 
Pearblossom into Littlerock and Sun Village. Ranch-style houses with horse 
corrals alternated with tumbledown shacks and squalid trailer parks. Ingalls 
pointed out several of the local "rock houses" and surveyed a known drug 
location where two vacant-eyed women slumped on the front steps. He has put six 
houses out of the rock cocaine business in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cocaine trade -- run primarily by gang members who sell in 
the Sun Village area and in Palmdale and Lancaster -- Ingalls' turf has been 
home to heavily armed, well-disciplined members of outlaw motorcycle gangs who 
use remote spots for the production and sale of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
And even among non-criminal residents, including many deputies and officers 
from other departments who live in the Antelope Valley, guns and ferocious dogs 
are common household items.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BILL TO MERGE TRANSIT AGENCIES CLEARS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday approved a compromise bill 
designed to lead to the merger of the Los Angeles region's two feuding transit 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sent to the Appropriations Committee on an 11-0 vote, allows Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, his appointee and the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to serve on both the Southern California Rapid Transit District 
Board and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), also requires Bradley and 
the county supervisors to attend four joint meetings of the two panels each 
year instead of sending alternates. Further, the legislation directs the two 
agencies to approve a consolidation plan by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Previous efforts to reorganize the two agencies have sparked sharp controversy 
and have either been vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian or stalled in the 
Legislature.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUGE REBATES FOR WATER CONSERVATION 
APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District on Tuesday approved a plan to pay millions of 
dollars in rebates to water agencies that get customers to cut use by more than 
5% this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved without comment by the Board of Directors, would rebate $100 
for every acre-foot of water that local agencies conserve between June 1 and 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The program would bring an estimated $10 million to the 27 Southern California 
water agencies served by the Los Angeles-based agency. An acre-foot is enough 
water to cover an acre to a depth of one foot, or 326,000 gallons -- roughly 
the amount of water used by two families in a year. 
</P>
<P>
The money could be passed along to retail customers as rewards, pay for 
conservation programs, or could be used to offset lower sales by local water 
agencies, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL BUSING PROGRAM 
APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District board has voted 6 to 1 to reorganize 
its program for busing students to relieve overcrowding. About 25,000 students 
ride buses for up to an hour because there is no room at their local schools. 
</P>
<P>
District staff will try to find ways to improve the program, such as shortening 
travel time, channeling more money to receiving schools to help new students, 
and establishing long-term pairings of sending and receiving schools to allow 
bused students to attend elementary, junior and senior high in one area. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was sponsored by Westside board representative Mark Slavkin. Schools 
in his area received thousands of new bused-in students last fall. 
</P>
<P>
South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters voted 'no', saying the 
measure focuses too heavily on the needs of receiving schools while ignoring 
the problems of overcrowded areas.

L.A. PRISON FIGHT REVIVED BY ASSEMBLY BUDGET MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-dormant fight over building a prison near downtown Los Angeles 
suddenly flared back to life Tuesday after the Assembly moved to eliminate 
money for the prison from the next state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The move, if successful, would also endanger a prison proposed for construction 
near Lancaster, because the two were tied together by 1987 legislation 
authorizing their construction. Under the legislation, one prison cannot be 
built without the other. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round in the long-running fight over the Los Angeles County prisons 
got under way Monday night when an Assembly budget subcommittee, led by two Los 
Angeles legislators, voted 3 to 1 to delete $315 million in construction money 
for the two prisons from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Ground has not yet been broken on either site, but preliminary work, such as 
environmental impact reports and approval of preliminary plans, has all but 
been completed. The state has already invested $40 million in preparations for 
the two prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Administration officials reacted predictably when they learned of 
the action. Robert J. Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor is 
"going to insist that the budget include" money for the prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure for the downtown site grew from anger elsewhere in the state over the 
fact that Los Angeles County, which produces about 40% of the state's prison 
inmate population, does not have a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The fight to block the money was initiated by Assemblywoman Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who represents the predominantly Latino Assembly 
district near downtown where the more controversial of the two prisons would be 
located. 
</P>
<P>
During the subcommittee hearing, Roybal-Allard said that even though the 
legislation was approved in 1987, the proposed prison in her Eastside district 
is still bitterly opposed by residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastside legislator said the proposed prison site is within five miles of 
33 schools. She also said comparisons with other counties are unfair because 
they do not take into account the major county and federal jails in the 
downtown and East Los Angeles area, including Sybil Brand Institute for Women, 
the main county jail, a federal detention center and a youth facility. 
</P>
<P>
James Rowland, director of the Department of Corrections, said the two Los 
Angeles County prisons are badly needed because all the existing state prisons 
are being severely overcrowded. Rowland said, "We feel that we not only 
desperately need prisons in Los Angeles but that these two sites are good 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
Roybal-Allard was immediately joined in the fight by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), who pledged to seek the same budget action in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he had assurances from both Democratic candidates for governor -- 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein 
-- that they would support efforts to find another site for the prison. The 
Republican candidate, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, so far has not taken a position, 
according to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee and the author of the legislation authorizing the Los Angeles County 
prisons, said he believes the state is in too far to back out. "It would be 
very hard for the next governor to just walk away from it," Presley said.

HOT-ROD DRIVER AGREES TO STAY OUT OF NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: MAN ACCUSED OF TERRORIZING TORRANCE NEIGHBORS IS TOLD TO AVOID THE AREA 
OR FACE A 275-YEAR JAIL TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man accused of terrorizing his Torrance neighbors by hot-rodding in his 
souped-up Volkswagen Beetle pleaded no contest to 732 criminal charges Tuesday 
and agreed to stay out of the neighborhood or face a 275-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Shane Allabaugh, 21, said at a hearing in South Bay Municipal Court 
that he will move out of the Torrance hillside enclave known as the Hollywood 
Riviera, where Spanish street names translate to the Way of the Serene and the 
Road of Enchantment. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Municipal Court Judge Benjamin Aranda said he is prepared to sentence 
Allabaugh to the maximum jail term if he breaks the law or so much as sets foot 
in the Hollywood Riviera after June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if it's spitting on the sidewalk, smoking a marijuana cigarette 
or going back into that area again," Aranda said. "If you do any of those 
things, I will sentence you to 275 years, I promise you that." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling ratified an unusual plea agreement between Torrance 
prosecutor J.D. Lord and Allabaugh's attorney, Kevin Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a guarantee that he not be sent to jail, Allabaugh chose not to 
fight 730 charges -- one count of disturbing the peace and one count of driving 
on a suspended license for every day of the year that ended last Aug. 31. He 
also pleaded no contest to charges of assault with a deadly weapon -- for 
driving toward a man -- and brandishing a firearm (a shotgun). 
</P>
<P>
Allabaugh faced 275 years in jail -- five years for the weapons charges 
combined, six months for each charge of driving on a suspended license and 
three months for each charge of disturbing the peace. Aranda stayed the jail 
time and placed Allabaugh on probation for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The man described by Lord as an "urban terrorist" spoke softly Tuesday as he 
agreed not to venture into the neighborhood bounded by Pacific Coast Highway, 
Palos Verdes Drive, Hawthorne Boulevard and Palos Verdes Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The strapping young man has lived for several years with his grandmother and 
great-grandmother on Via Colusa near the center of the off-limits zone, which 
also includes parts of Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates. He 
agreed to move out by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is that I do not want to see this neighborhood disturbed again in 
any way, shape or form," Aranda said, glaring at the defendant. "Am I going to 
see you again?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir," Allabaugh answered quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Allabaugh declined to speak to a reporter, but Donahue called the charges 
overblown. He said Allabaugh and his baby-blue Volkswagen bug were out of town 
on many of the days he was accused of disturbing neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Lord said Allabaugh had been convicted in 1987 of disturbing the 
peace and that, soon after his one-year probation in that case was completed, 
he began roaring up and down his street again. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents on Via Colusa sent complaints and a petition to Lord. They 
said Allabaugh drove across their lawns, aimed his car at pedestrians and made 
obscene gestures at anyone who told him to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, who lives down the block, said she is relieved at the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry it came to that." she said. "I'm sorry he couldn't get his act 
together. But sometimes you have to be really harsh because he just doesn't 
understand."

MURDER-SUICIDE SNUFFS OUT A TEEN-AGE ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Ortega and Evangelica Guzman fell in love during their freshman year 
at Jordan High School, began sharing an apartment before they obtained their 
driver's licenses, and had a baby girl the same year. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along the way, the teen-age romance turned rocky. Then it turned 
violent. Finally, on Monday night, it turned deadly. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ortega, 18, distraught over his breakup with Guzman, 17, pointed a 
.357 magnum at her head and fired, fatally wounding her as she cradled their 
13-month-old daughter, Crystal. He then took his own life with a single shot. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was spared. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about a violent person, but you know the fair of heart," 
Los Angeles Police Detective Adalberto Luper said with a sigh. "Love has a way 
of eating you alive when you're young if you don't know how to handle it when 
it goes away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think that's what happened here. Very young love; puppy love, really. 
And they weren't ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
Police, neighbors and friends of Guzman provided the following account of what 
led to the murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Three or four weeks ago, Guzman moved out of the apartment she and Ortega 
shared near downtown Los Angeles because, she told friends, he drank too much 
and beat her regularly. Guzman also told them that she hit him back, but was 
worried that he would seriously injure her someday. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved her. She loved him," recalled Ana Marie Lopez, 19, who said she met 
Guzman earlier this year while they waited for free milk at a neighborhood 
church. "You know, it was just that they could not live together." 
</P>
<P>
Guzman supported herself and the baby on a monthly $560 welfare check and also 
attended senior year classes at Jordan, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman's friends knew little about Ortega, except that almost every day since 
the teen-agers separated, he visited Guzman and their baby at the tiny blue 
stucco home of friends in the 800 block of East Adams Boulevard. It was there, 
Detective Luper said, that Guzman had "sought refuge" from Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
While Guzman had not obtained a restraining order in court, the detective said, 
she had filed a non-criminal report with police on a domestic dispute March 13, 
after the couple argued outside a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Guzman never talked of Ortega having a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega arrived in the alley near Guzman's temporary home Monday night, and the 
couple soon began arguing loudly. In her arms, Guzman held their baby, dressed 
in a yellow knit suit. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 p.m., as the infant cried in the cold, the only eyewitness to the 
shooting walked out of his apartment and suggested that Guzman bring the baby 
inside. The man, whose family Guzman was living with, told neighbors that 
Ortega threatened him, then fired a shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega put his arm around Guzman as though to hug her, then suddenly shot her 
in the head, then again in the stomach, police and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman chased the eyewitness briefly, then turned the weapon to his own 
forehead and fired. The sweethearts fell side-by-side, about three feet apart, 
police said. Both were dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Ortega was bloodied and bruised in the arms of her mother, who clutched 
the baby as she fell to the ground. The baby was said to be in the care of her 
maternal grandparents Tuesday.

MADD ACTIVIST GRIEVES FOR SON WHO DIED IN CRASH; ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER HELD

<P>
Marcy DeJesus' worst fear became a reality with a knock on her door at 1:45 
a.m. Sunday, April 8. The police officer standing there told DeJesus, 
administrator of the Los Angeles chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, to 
call the county coroner's office in Palmdale. Her 19-year-old son, Adam, had 
been killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy DeJesus buried Adam one week ago today. 
</P>
<P>
"What's been going through my mind since the first minute (I heard) has been, 
'Ten years of work and what have I been doing? Has it made any difference at 
all if they can still get my son?' " 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus founded the Los Angeles chapter of MADD with Barbara Bloomberg in 1981, 
after Bloomberg's son, Seth, was killed by a drunk driver. Seth and Kiley 
DeJesus, Adam's older brother, had been best friends. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in answer to the question that has been haunting her, she said she knows 
her work has made a difference. "This is random. I've worked with so many 
families I know I'm not the only one this has happened to and I won't be the 
last, although I pray every day that I would be." 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus' work with MADD was "absolutely tremendous," Candy Lightner said 
recently. Lightner founded the organization in Sacramento in May, 1980, four 
days after her daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver. She watched 
Bloomberg and DeJesus build the Los Angeles chapter into a 5,000-member 
organization and take the initiative in creating programs -- such as taking the 
organization's message into schools -- that became models for MADD at a 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a behind-the-scenes person, the nuts and bolts of the organization, 
handling administrative details, going into the courts and monitoring (trials), 
writing letters to the editor -- all of this as a volunteer at first," Lightner 
said. "She was great working with victims. They loved her. She was very 
understanding, and impatient with the courts. That was good." 
</P>
<P>
Now those former victims are counseling Marcy DeJesus, writing letters to her, 
knowing enough, DeJesus said, not "to say anything stupid, like 'I know just 
how you feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus talked about her son and MADD one rainy morning in her Canoga Park home 
while Lightner and another friend quietly worked in the background, sorting 
bills and correspondence, offering lunch or coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Grief weighs heavily on DeJesus. Her voice was flat, her look remote as she sat 
on the couch in her den, the family dog, Max, beside her. Conversation was 
clearly a strain. Frequently lighting cigarettes, she responded to questions 
obligingly, but with little animation, except for an occasional soft smile 
brought on by a memory. Just as often, memories crumbled her facade and brought 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
The rain made the morning dark and the unlit rooms had a gloomy cast to them. 
Looking around at one point, she said, "Five short years ago, there was so much 
laughter in this house and now it's so quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Five short years ago the family was complete -- she and her husband, Luchi, a 
successful musician and composer, and their two sons, Kiley and Adam. Then 
Luchi died within a month of being told he had a brain tumor. The family took 
it hard but held together, and last year, when Marcy, 50, had a stroke, Adam 
came home from UC Santa Barbara to be with her. She returned to work in 
January, and, still moving stiffly and slowly, describes herself as just 
getting back on her feet. Kiley, in his early 20s, is living at home and 
working for a sound system company. Adam had planned to return to UC Santa 
Barbara in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus last saw him when he left the house in his pickup truck that Saturday 
night. He and his girlfriend of two years, Shanya Roberson, 19, were heading 
for Lake Havasu, Ariz., for spring break. They were traveling on Route 18 in 
the Antelope Valley when they were hit at 8:30 p.m. Adam was killed instantly. 
Roberson was seriously injured and taken to a Palmdale Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I drove (Adam) a little crazy about it," she said of her fear that he 
would be killed by a drunk driver. "He never left the house without my saying, 
'Be careful. Watch out for the other guy.' And he never left the house without 
saying, 'I love you, Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her face distorting, she began to weep. "I keep waiting for him to come through 
the door. I could tell the difference between the slams and I'd know what mood 
he was in when he came home. He was very moody -- high highs, low lows." 
</P>
<P>
That is how Adam came across in the eulogies at his funeral service last 
Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Mortuary. Those who knew him described an intense, moody 
young man, highly creative in music and art, who cared deeply and questioned 
everything and everyone, especially himself. All of those who spoke described 
someone who was just beginning to find himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking to myself," DeJesus said, "that someone who hadn't known 
Adam would have come away (from the funeral) with a pretty accurate impression 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
His drums were set up in the chapel, beside the open coffin. Adam had a black 
belt in karate, and his black satin jacket, part of the karate-gi, lay folded 
on his chest, placed there gently by his instructor Rob Margolin, after 
Margolin eulogized him as student, teacher and friend. 
</P>
<P>
The chapel was packed, and people overflowed onto the veranda and into side 
rooms. Police officers in uniform stood in the rear of the chapel -- "the DUI 
squad from Van Nuys, and CHP from Malibu," DeJesus said later, describing 
people with whom she had worked closely over the years. 
</P>
<P>
What was particularly striking about the service was the racially mixed group 
of heartbroken young people in attendance -- young men tightening their jaws, 
and breaking down anyway, young women sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband was black," DeJesus said. "Adam was very diverse in his choice of 
friendships. . . . We tried all our lives to surround the kids with people from 
different races." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling at her memory, she said wryly of Adam: "He usually made a statement by 
the cut of his hair. He wore dreadlocks toward the end. It was like, 'I'm black 
this week.' There was a little identity searching, but he was a well-adjusted 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
They were not a religious family, DeJesus said. "If anything, they're (her 
children) metaphysical. Adam was probably more religious in his attitude than 
any of us -- the way he felt about people, the world in general. He cared very 
deeply about everything going on." 
</P>
<P>
She described him as an accomplished artist and animator who won student prizes 
from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He played the drums, 
studied music and, with brother Kiley on guitar, worked in a garage studio. His 
career ambitions tended toward music. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was trying to follow in his father's footsteps," DeJesus said. 
</P>
<P>
She does not want to romanticize Adam, or paint an overly ideal picture of him. 
He was no angel, she said, and their own relationship had all the predictable 
difficulties. She pestered him with "where are you going?" questions. He 
tortured her with monosyllabic "out" answers. 
</P>
<P>
And at other times he had a lot more to say. 
</P>
<P>
"He was full of questions and statements of fact," DeJesus said dryly. "He took 
everything so seriously. He thought he knew all the answers. He was a very 
intense young man. He was just maturing, trying to make up his mind about what 
he really believed in. His father's death really rocked him. They had been very 
close. He was 13 and did not really deal with it until he was 18." 
</P>
<P>
Darshan S. Grewal, the driver of the car that killed Adam and injured Roberson, 
has been charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors with second-degree murder, 
gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and felony drunk driving causing 
death or injury. Seriously injured himself, Grewal was transferred from San 
Bernardino Country Hospital to that county's jail ward. He has two previous 
drunk-driving convictions. His blood-alcohol level three hours after the 
accident measured 0.2%. The legal definition of intoxication is 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus is staying away from the case because of her anger, she said, leaving 
MADD's role in it to the Antelope Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as possible I've just got to concentrate on my grief. . . . Anger has 
to be put in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Her friendships are sustaining her around the clock. "It's unbelievable. . . . 
They won't leave me alone. I never believed that sort of thing could help, but 
I certainly do now. The mail has been overwhelming, from perfect strangers. 
It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
She visited Roberson at the hospital last weekend, and while it was a rough 
visit on both of them, DeJesus said, "it was very important to me. I love her 
like my own daughter, and I needed to see she's all right." 
</P>
<P>
The two young people graduated from El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills in 1988. Their families lived about five blocks from each other and they 
had attended UC Santa Barbara together. There are two photos of the young 
couple in the DeJesus den, one casual pose taken two weeks ago, and another in 
which they are dressed up for a MADD banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Shanya Roberson is recovering, but DeJesus is concerned for her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so sad right now. She's got a long road ahead of her." 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus intends to carry on with MADD. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to be around people who understand what's going on. . . . We're trying 
to prevent this from happening to anybody else. Now that I really realize, I 
know I can't bear the thought of another family going through this."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past three years, as Congress debated legislation to limit hostile 
business takeovers, Texas corporate takeover specialist Harold C. Simmons and 
his family pumped more than $250,000 into the campaign coffers of key federal 
office-seekers. In the process, Simmons' contributions more than doubled the 
legal limit on political giving by the very rich. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons made more than $120,000 in personal contributions to President Bush and 
members of Congress who were in a position to influence legislation governing 
corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
He gave $59,958 just to candidates seeking election in 1988, more than double 
the $25,000 limit. His relatives, after consulting with Simmons, gave to a 
similar list of candidates for public office after consulting with Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Simmons proved an effective force in Congress. Campaign 
contributions and tireless lobbying by Simmons and others of the nation's 
biggest corporate raiders, according to congressional sources, have played a 
big role in blocking legislation that would have severely restricted leveraged 
buyouts and other hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
While Simmons is a leader among wealthy patrons of the American political 
system, he is certainly not the only millionaire who exceeded civil limits 
established by a Watergate-era law designed to prevent the rich from exerting 
undue influence on the political system. 
</P>
<P>
A Times study, which used computer searches of federal election reports to 
focus on the political giving habits of more than 100 of the nation's 
wealthiest and most influential citizens, found that at least nine others also 
exceeded the legal limit during the 1988 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The nine others were corporate buyout specialists Ronald O. Perelman, Meshulam 
Riklis and Henry Kravis; Kravis' brother, Raymond; Riklis' son, Ira; Manhattan 
developer Donald Trump; grain trader Dwayne O. Andreas, and his wife, Dorothy 
Inez, and Caroline Rose Hunt, daughter of the late Texas oilman H.L. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Kravis, like Simmons, exceeded the limit by more than 100%, according to 
federal records. 
</P>
<P>
When contacted by The Times, spokesmen for each of these rich contributors 
acknowledged the accuracy of the records. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make the problem go away," said John Garrett, Simmons' lawyer, after 
reviewing his client's canceled checks and contribution records. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for most of the other nine donors asserted that the violations were 
inadvertent. A few pointed out that they had exceeded the limit only by a few 
hundred or a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
These heavy contributors are the sorts of people who have important business 
and financial interests affected by decisions made in Washington by officials 
they help to elect. So enormous have such contributions become that many of the 
congressional recipients of the largess are beginning to worry about the 
consequences and to agitate for reform. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much money in politics; there is too much special-interest 
influence," declared Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), who himself has received 
thousands of dollars from these contributors and is leading the drive for 
reform. "It's an open invitation to corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the records suggest, wealthy individuals are giving even more money 
to presidential and congressional candidates than they did two decades ago when 
Congress enacted a law intended to restrain political contributions by the very 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Example of Donations 
</P>
<P>
The Bass family of Ft. Worth, for example, distributed close to $700,000 to a 
variety of candidates for federal office over the past three years -- most of 
them defenders of Texas oil interests. Many others doled out contributions of 
as much as $100,000 to a single presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Times review of federal and state campaign records shows that political 
giving by the rich is now largely unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
Even many of those who technically abide by the $25,000 limit seem to have 
found other ways to channel additional money to candidates. Some have relatives 
who contribute to a similar collection of candidates. Some make so-called "soft 
money" -- contributions to presidential and congressional candidates that are 
not limited by law because they are forwarded to state political parties for 
party-building activities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the givers who used one or both of those entirely legal techniques for 
giving more than $25,000 were the Bass family; Hollywood executive Lew R. 
Wasserman; Disney executives Michael D. Eisner, Frank G. Wells and Jeffrey 
Katzenberg; Chicago industrialist Lester Crown, and several descendants of the 
late Texas oilman, H.L. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wasserman and the Bass family have been fined in the past by the 
Federal Election Commission for their unrestrained giving to political 
candidates, FEC officials acknowledge that they do not adequately monitor 
compliance with the limits on individual donations. A search through federal 
records shows no penalties exceeding $250. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, 
said the information uncovered by The Times' study of campaign giving "means 
that the laws on the books intended to prevent wealthy contributors from using 
large amounts of money to potentially influence government are being ignored." 
</P>
<P>
The FEC's failure to enforce the laws governing donations by individual 
contributors demonstrates the need for a massive overhaul of federal election 
laws, which is currently being considered in Congress, according to Wertheimer. 
He said the FEC does not monitor compliance with the $25,000 limit, and also 
has failed to write regulations that would restrict soft-money contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had effective enforcement of the law today, the soft-money contributions 
would not be taking place and contributions over the aggregate limit would not 
be occurring," he said. "Since the FEC is not doing its job, Congress must 
again act to make sure the law means what it says." 
</P>
<P>
The current law, enacted in 1974, was intended to prevent the kinds of 
activities that occurred during the 1972 presidential campaign of Richard M. 
Nixon. According to public records, Nixon's aides collected contributions of $1 
million or more from such rich industrialists as W. Clement Stone of Chicago, 
Max N. Fisher of Detroit and Richard M. Scaife of Pittsburgh, Pa. At the time, 
those contributions were legal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, contributors are permitted to give up to $2,000 to a 
congressional campaign, $5,000 a year to a political action committee and 
$20,000 a year to a party committee. Total contributions for a single year 
(donations in 1989 to a candidate running in 1990 count toward the 1990 limit) 
may not exceed $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FEC has "no legal authority to fine anyone," according to FEC 
spokesman Scott Moxley, it can try to negotiate civil fines of up to $5,000 for 
unwitting violations and $10,000 for willful violations, but federal records 
showed no penalties approaching more than a fraction of those limits. 
</P>
<P>
In violations deemed to be "substantial and willful," Moxley said, the FEC 
could refer cases to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, and the 
penalties could range up to $25,000 and one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16 years since the law was passed, however, party leaders, candidates 
and their rich contributors have found numerous ways to circumvent those 
restrictions. The result is a system in which, as Wertheimer put it, 
"Watergate-size and Watergate-style campaign money are once again a major force 
in federal elections." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, said some contributors may actually be unaware of the $25,000 limit 
because the candidates, PACs and parties are not bound by law to remind them 
about it. "There's no rule that you have to inform people what the federal 
aggregate limit is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The giving habits of Simmons, Kravis and Perelman vividly illustrate how some 
very rich people are eager to fill the campaign coffers of influential 
candidates -- especially when their business interests appear to be threatened 
by government action. 
</P>
<P>
These three men had a great deal at stake in 1988 and 1989, when Congress 
considered legislation that would have made it easier for corporate managers to 
fend off hostile takeovers. George Bush, first as a candidate and then as 
President, hinted that he might support legislation to toughen the tax 
treatment of corporate debt, which is a vital component of most hostile 
takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
But both Bush and Congress eventually backed down. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress insist that individual contributions are so small when 
measured against their total fund-raising needs that they have little 
influence. "I really do not believe that senators are going to be bought for a 
$1,000 contribution or for a $5,000 contribution," said Sen. John C. Danforth 
(R-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
But economist Robert Reich of Harvard, among others who closely observed the 
process, says campaign contributions from corporate raiders were directly 
responsible for dissuading Congress and the President from taking any action 
against corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street has been pouring money onto Capitol Hill and both Democrats and 
Republicans have developed a strong thirst for it," he said. "All of this is 
manifest in Wall Street's extraordinary power and the resolute timidity of 
Congress in the face of that power." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the Simmons, Kravis and Perelman families each made 
more than $250,000 in political contributions, most of them to Bush and members 
of Congress who were in a position to play a key role in killing any corporate 
takeover legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Simmons gave contributions of between $500 and $1,000 to the men 
with the most control over such legislation: John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), 
chairman of the subcommittee with direct responsibility for financial markets, 
and three other members of the committee -- Mike Synar (D-Okla.), John Bryant 
(D-Tex.) and Joe L. Barton (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
While Markey's subcommittee held extensive hearings on the corporate buyout 
issue during 1989, it did not draft legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Simmons and Kravis gave contributions of $1,000 to $2,000 to 
many members of the Banking and Finance Committees, which have jurisdiction 
over corporate finance. Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) received $5,000 
from the Simmons family and $2,000 from Kravis for his 1988 reelection 
campaign. After publicly criticizing the takeovers, Bentsen announced in March, 
1989, that his panel could propose no legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The year before, the Banking Committee sent to the Senate floor a bill designed 
to curb corporate takeovers. But Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), then the 
committee's chairman, abruptly pulled the bill from the floor after the Senate 
voted 57 to 40 in favor of an amendment that would have curbed the use of 
so-called "poison pills" by managers to avert outside takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
That pro-takeover amendment effectively killed the bill, and 21 of the 26 
senators who had received campaign contributions from Simmons, Kravis or 
Perelman over the past three years voted in favor of it. Only five -- John 
Heinz (R-Pa.), Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), Donald W. Riegel Jr. (D-Mich.), 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.) -- voted to protect 
poison pills. 
</P>
<P>
While contributing these large sums of money, Kravis, by his own account, also 
privately lobbied about 50 members of the House Ways and Means and Senate 
Finance Committees, arguing that corporate takeovers generally are good for the 
nation's competitiveness. One House member who met with him twice recalled that 
Kravis was "very persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Kravis, Simmons seldom if ever does any personal lobbying in Washington. 
Despite his wealth and phenomenal success, he remains a shy, unassuming 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
A poor boy from rural Texas, Simmons, now 58, began his business career with an 
investment of $5,000 and built a successful drug store chain that he sold to 
the Eckard drug store chain. Then, through a series of corporate takeovers, he 
amassed a financial empire currently valued at nearly $2 billion. He recently 
lost a battle for control of Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Name Wife 
</P>
<P>
Although FEC records show that Simmons contributed more than twice the $25,000 
limit to candidates in 1988, his lawyers assert that $7,000 of those 
contributions were actually intended to be donated by his wife, Annette, but 
she did not sign the check. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers acknowledged that the FEC records are otherwise accurate. And even 
by their own accounting, Simmons was $27,958 over the annual limit for 
political giving set by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing Simmons said the couple wrongly believed they would not 
run afoul of the law if they kept their combined donations under $50,000. "That 
may not be the law, but that's the way he does it," Simmons' lawyer said. He 
did not explain how Simmons and his wife failed to abide by their self-imposed 
$50,000 ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Simmons' $59,958 in contributions, federal records show that his 
wife contributed $10,750, his two brothers and sister-in-law gave $15,175 and 
his four daughters -- three of them still college students -- kicked in another 
$51,500. That brought the family's total contribution to more than $137,000. 
</P>
<P>
Like most rich families that make substantial political contributions, all 
members of the Simmons clan gave money to a similar list of candidates. Critics 
of the current system view this pattern as evidence that individuals such as 
Simmons are actually responsible for all the donations. Indeed, according to 
party officials, the candidates who receive the money assume it is all coming 
from one source. 
</P>
<P>
The parallel contributions of Simmons and his family members are particularly 
clear in the case of his three college-student daughters. In 1987, for example, 
Scheryle Simmons gave $5,000 to the PAC of one of her father's corporations, 
Contran, and another $5,000 to the PAC of the Chicago-based law firm that does 
business for her father, Kirkland Ellis. Simmons' lawyer acknowledged that 
Simmons and his wife and daughters discussed their contributions before making 
them. 
</P>
<P>
While Simmons shuns lobbying, Kravis and Perelman are well known in political 
circles, and both clearly enjoy rubbing elbows with Washington's power elite. 
Perelman's national reputation soared in 1986 when he acquired Revlon for $3 
billion, and Kravis is best known for the biggest takeover in history, the 
$25-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Kravis, 45, contributed $56,711 directly to federal 
candidates and political action committees in 1988, or more than twice the 
legal limit. His brother, Raymond, an internationally recognized oil and gas 
consultant, exceeded it by giving $34,500. His wife, fashion designer Carolyne 
Roehm, contributed another $3,711. Like the Simmons family, the different 
members of the Kravis clan gave mostly to the same candidates. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kravis declined to comment on the FEC records of his 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Kravis also made a so-called "soft money" contribution of $100,000 to Team 100, 
a program run out of Republican National Committee headquarters in 1988 by 
Bush's chief fund-raiser, Robert A. Mosbacher, now secretary of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Although the money was raised by Bush's presidential campaign, it was not 
subject to federal limitations because it technically was spent on the state 
level by the Republican Party for such things as voter registration and 
get-out-the-vote drives. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Bush and his Democratic opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, used 
this loophole in federal election laws to raise about $50 million between them 
in soft money in 1988. The money is used to supplement the $92.2 million in 
public funds received by presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Donations 
</P>
<P>
While Simmons and Kravis favored Republican candidates, Perelman, 46, whose 
personal wealth is estimated at $2.75 billion, showed little or no party 
favoritism in his giving during the last election campaign. His soft-money 
contributions were evenhanded -- $100,000 to the Republicans' Team 100 and 
$100,000 to a similar fund created by Democratic fund-raiser Robert Farmer for 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
According to FEC records, Perelman also gave a total of $30,500 in 
contributions that were subject to federal law, or more than $5,000 over the 
legal limit. These included $1,000 each to Democratic presidential hopefuls 
Dukakis, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Gary Hart, Richard A. Gephardt and Gore, and $500 
each to GOP presidential hopefuls Bush and Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Perelman, James Conroy, acknowledged that his boss in 1988 may 
have slightly exceeded the limit on contributions subject to federal law. But 
he argued that $5,000 of Perelman's $30,500 in donations reported to the FEC 
should not be subject to federal law because it was given to the Presidential 
Trust, a Republican Party fund, which Perelman mistakenly thought was a 
soft-money account. 
</P>
<P>
Another corporate raider, Riklis, 77, the Beverly Hills billionaire who owns 
the retail conglomerate Rapid-American and has been in the business of buying 
out corporations much longer than Simmons, Kravis and Perelman, also exceeded 
the limit on political giving by $1,000 in 1988, according to FEC records. 
Riklis' wife, singer Pia Zadora, gave $23,000, and his son, Ira, contributed 
$29,500, more than the law allows, to a list of candidates that was similar but 
not identical. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Arnold Brozer said the elder Riklis was under the mistaken impression 
the law would allow him to credit a $1,000 contribution to Biden's 1988 
presidential campaign to 1987, since that was the year Biden dropped out of the 
race. He said Ira assumed that one of his federal contributions -- he could not 
remember to whom -- was a soft-money gift outside the purview of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"It was believed by both Ira and Meshulam (at the time they contributed the 
money) that they were not violating the law," Brozer said. 
</P>
<P>
The political giving of the Riklis family does not fit the pattern established 
by other corporate raiders. None of the candidates funded by Riklis are members 
of committees with direct jurisdiction over legislation affecting corporate 
takeovers or the varied business interests of his vast financial empire. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite candidate of the Riklis family was Biden, the Delaware Democrat 
who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He received $12,000 in 
campaign contributions from the Riklis family during the past three years for 
his Senate and presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say Riklis' son, Ira, is primarily responsible for these contributions. 
While a student at Wharton Business School, Ira met with Biden, decided he 
liked the Delaware senator's policies and persuaded his whole family to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the corporate raiders who have exceeded the limit on campaign 
contributions. The list includes men and women with other interests in 
Washington as well. 
</P>
<P>
In supermarket tabloids, Donald Trump is known primarily for his stormy divorce 
battle with his wife, Ivana. In New York City, he is known as the owner of 
Trump Tower and the Trump Shuttle. But among many candidates for high office, 
it seems, he is known as a soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
Federal records show that Trump made $42,300 in contributions subject to 
federal law during 1988 and exceeded the federal limit by $17,300. He also gave 
$100,000 in soft-money to Team 100, and his family members kicked in another 
$13,500 in contributions to various candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's beneficiaries range across the ideological spectrum from liberal Rep. 
Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) to conservative Rep. Jim Courter (R-N.J.). Sources within 
the Republican and Democratic Parties say Trump appears to contribute money to 
politicians primarily because it gives him an opportunity to socialize with the 
nation's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Gliedman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said 
that when his boss learned a year ago that he had exceeded the $25,000 limit in 
1988, he quickly asked for refunds. But Gliedman knew of no refunds received by 
Trump, and none of the recipients have reported any refunds to the FEC, as 
required under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co., one of the largest grain 
trading firms in the world, has long been an acknowledged leader in the art of 
influencing government officials. He has been friends with every President 
since Harry S. Truman and currently makes frequent trips to Moscow in his 
corporate jet for private meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The grain industry enjoys government subsidies at every level of production and 
distribution -- all of them regulated by Congress and the Administration in 
close consultation with the big agricultural leaders such as Andreas. Archer 
Daniels Midland owes much of its overseas sales to U.S. grain export subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Find Check 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, Andreas played an unwitting role in the development of the 
legislation that he now appears to be violating. The law was written after 
Watergate investigators discovered that a $25,000 check written by Andreas to 
the 1972 campaign of President Nixon had found its way into a Miami bank 
account of Bernard L. Barker, one of those arrested in the Watergate break-in. 
</P>
<P>
That embarrassing disclosure did nothing to dampen Andreas' eagerness to 
contribute money to the American electoral system. To this day, he remains a 
stalwart financial backer of the Republican Party and a contributor to many 
Democratic candidates as well. In fact, Andreas, a regular churchgoer, has said 
he views political giving as an obligation similar to his commitment to 
contribute to his church. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, according to FEC records, Andreas made $28,680 in political 
contributions that are subject to federal law -- or $3,680 more than the limit. 
Claudia Madding, a spokeswoman, said Andreas inadvertently violated the limit 
because he did not understand that contributions to candidates in a 
non-election year are attributed to the year in which the candidate stands for 
election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Andreas' wife, Dorothy Inez, gave at least $27,680 -- or $2,680 
over the limit -- to a nearly identical list of candidates. Eight other Andreas 
relatives contributed a total of $99,500 to a similar list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Andreas family list of favored candidates is replete with members of 
Congress who have big roles in making tax and agriculture policy governing 
export and sales of U.S. grain, such as House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. 
(Kika) de la Garza (D-Tex.). Andreas also gave a $100,000 contribution to Team 
100, the Bush campaign's soft-money fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunt family of Texas gave $148,000 in 1987 through 1989 to a list of 
candidates dominated by Texas advocates of the oil industry. The leading 
contributors in the Hunt family were Caroline Rose, 77, who gave $25,700 in 
1988 -- $700 over the limit -- and her half-brother Ray, 47, who contributed 
$17,000 plus $10,000 in soft money. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Oberwetter, a spokesman for Caroline Rose Hunt, who runs a chain of posh 
hotels, said her $10,000 contribution to the GOP Presidential Trust was a 
soft-money donation not subject to federal law. But Republican spokeswoman 
Leslie Goodman said all contributions to the Presidential Trust are subject to 
federal law. She added that party records show that a letter was sent to Hunt 
advising her that the donation was not soft money. 
</P>
<P>
Some wealthy donors, such as Disney President and Chief Executive Officer Frank 
G. Wells, say they are meticulous about keeping their political giving within 
the letter of the law. In fact, Wells and other top Disney executives use a 
computer program designed for them by their lawyers to keep them from violating 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state records show that Wells, 58, and his wife, Luanne, gave at 
least $118,250 to candidates and political organizations over the last three 
years, including $50,000 in soft-money contributions to the Democratic Party 
and a $5,000 donation last year to the California Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Disney executives, Wells favors candidates supported by the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America. These include Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), whose 
subcommittee on economic and commercial law has jurisdiction over many film 
industry issues, and California Democrats such as Reps. Howard L. Berman of 
Panorama City, Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles and Anthony C. Beilenson of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Give to Sen. Bradley 
</P>
<P>
The Disney group also gave generously to the campaign of Sen. Bill Bradley 
(D-N.J.), but that was a different matter. Although Bradley serves on the 
tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, he is also a close friend of Disney 
chairman Michael Eisner and a man whom Disney executives would like to see run 
for President in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Another big Hollywood giver, MCA chairman Wasserman, 76, has also carefully 
monitored his contributions ever since December, 1980, when the FEC fined him 
$250 for exceeding the $25,000 maximum. His wife, Edith, also gives to 
political causes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Wasserman has made $72,000 in contributions that 
were subject to federal law and his wife has given $37,500, according to FEC 
records. In addition, he was among those who gave $100,000 to Dukakis' 
soft-money fund in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wasserman, Texas oilman Perry Richardson Bass, 75, was fined $250 by the 
FEC in 1981 for violating the $25,000 limit. Although he said he had intended 
that half of the contributions be listed in the name of his wife, Nancy Lee, 
there was no record of this. The FEC ruled that in order for a contribution to 
be recorded in the name of both spouses, the check or an accompanying letter 
must be signed by both. Otherwise, the full donation would be counted as coming 
from the individual who signed the check. 
</P>
<P>
The fine did not discourage the Bass family from giving huge sums of money to 
political candidates. Bass, his four multimillionaire sons, Sid, 46, Edward, 
44, Robert, 41 and Lee, 33, as well as other relatives gave more than $680,000 
over the past three years, making them the most generous family in The Times 
survey. These gifts included soft-money contributions of nearly $400,000 to 
Bush, Dukakis and the Texas Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Industry PACs 
</P>
<P>
The Bass family, whose wealth was derived originally from Texas oil, have 
contributed primarily to Texas politicians such as Democrats Bentsen, Reps. 
Martin Frost and Jim Chapman and former House Speaker Jim Wright, and 
Republicans including Sen. Phil Gramm and Reps. Joe L. Barton, Dick Armey and 
Lamar Smith. They have also contributed to PACs that advocate the views of the 
oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although most rich contributors insist that their relatives' giving is 
independent of their own, Lester Crown, 64, whose $2-billion financial empire 
includes a 22% interest in General Dynamics, readily admits some cooperation 
with family members. 
</P>
<P>
The Crown family contributed more than $154,000 over the past three years to a 
long list of House and Senate members whose committee assignments give them 
jurisdiction over arms sales, such as House Armed Services Committee Chairman 
Les Aspin (D-Wis.). Among other things, General Dynamics manufactures the F-16 
fighter plane used by the U.S. Navy and many foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
A Crown spokesman explained that many contributions attributed to Lester in 
federal records were actually made by his 96-year-old father, Henry. "His dad 
gave the money," explained an aide, "but his father was not available that day, 
so Lester signed his dad's check."

Hunt contribution -- The Times reported on April 18 that Texas oilman Ray Hunt 
made $17,000 in federally regulated contributions to candidates in 1988 and 
$10,000 in soft money contributions, which are not regulated by the Federal 
Election Commission. The $10,000 was not a soft money contribution, but has 
since been credited to his wife, Nancy, in FEC records.

WON'T SHIELD RELIGIONS FROM LAW, COURT SAYS 
</P>

<P>
In what was called a "radical departure" from previous rulings protecting 
religion, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that there is no constitutional right 
to take peyote as a religious sacrament and declared forcefully that it will no 
longer shield believers whose practices violate general laws. 
</P>
<P>
Religions that are out of the mainstream are most likely to be affected, 
because their unconventional practices and lack of political influence have led 
them to depend on the courts for protection. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made in the case of two members of the Native American Church 
who were fired from their jobs as drug counselors in Oregon after they admitted 
ingesting peyote during a religious ceremony. On a 6-3 vote, the court upheld 
their dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a sweeping opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia went far beyond the case at 
hand and declared that, when religious rights clash with the government's need 
for uniform rules, the court will side with the government. 
</P>
<P>
As a nation, "we cannot afford the luxury" of striking down laws simply because 
they limit someone's religious practices, Scalia said. He advised religious 
adherents to look to the political system, not the courts, for protection. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the high court for most of this century has gone out of its way to 
shield minority religions -- such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Amish -- 
from laws that infringed on their religious beliefs. Those decisions were based 
on the First Amendment's protection of "the free exercise of religion." 
</P>
<P>
The new ruling "will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices 
that are not widely engaged in," Scalia conceded, "but that unavoidable 
consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which 
each conscience is law." 
</P>
<P>
The high court dissenters said that Scalia's opinion "effectuates a wholesale 
overturning of settled law concerning the religion clauses of our 
Constitution." Had his opinion been law during Prohibition, they noted, the 
government could have banned the use of sacramental wine during Communion. 
</P>
<P>
Joining in the dissent were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and 
Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, normally on the conservative side, voted with the 
majority on the peyote case. But she objected strongly to Scalia's opinion, 
which will be binding on lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
His opinion "is incompatible with our nation's fundamental commitment to 
individual religious liberty," she wrote. "In my view, the First Amendment was 
enacted precisely to protect the rights of those whose religious practices are 
not shared by the majority and may be viewed with hostility." 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts on religion said that the opinion marked a sharp change in the 
court's doctrine and could affect mainstream religions. For example, one noted 
that the Roman Catholic Church's practice of ordaining only men requires that 
it be exempt from laws banning sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a radical departure from what they have said before," said Jesse 
Choper, dean of the UC Berkeley Law School. "Clearly, they plan to give much 
less protection to religion than they had before." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, a more conservative court has increasingly ruled 
against those who contend that their religious rights have been violated by the 
government. But, until Tuesday, the conservative majority had not spelled out a 
change in constitutional doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, in response to appeals by Jehovah's Witnesses, the court struck 
down laws banning door-to-door soliciting. In 1943, in the midst of World War 
II, the justices struck down all the mandatory flag salute laws in the public 
schools because children of Witnesses refused to salute a secular symbol. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, the court in a much-quoted opinion said states could not deny 
unemployment benefits to Seventh-day Adventists who refused to work on 
Saturday. Even as late as 1972, the court exempted Amish children from 
compulsory school laws. 
</P>
<P>
The court's approach at that time was clear: Someone claiming a right to 
religious freedom would prevail, except when the government could assert an 
even more "compelling interest" in its general rule. 
</P>
<P>
That doctrine has been eroding over the last few years. In 1986, a Jewish 
serviceman was denied the right to wear a yarmulke with his uniform. In 1988, 
the court said the government may build a road through a sacred Indian burial 
ground. Last year, the court said Scientologists may not claim a tax exemption 
for the cost of "auditing," a central feature of their religious practice. And, 
in January, the court said the states may tax the sales of Bibles or other 
religious literature. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Scalia spelled out a new doctrine. Now, the government need not 
show that it has a "compelling interest" to win. Its general laws will be 
presumed valid, he said, even if they seriously infringe on someone's religious 
beliefs or practices. The only laws that would be struck down, Scalia said, are 
any that were intended to stifle a particular religion. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to Scalia's statement that the nation cannot afford the luxury of 
striking down laws that limit someone's religious freedom, Blackmun shot back: 
"I do not believe the Founders thought their dearly bought freedom from 
religious persecution a 'luxury,' but an essential element of liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Shapiro, counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the ruling 
is in line with the court's recent approach of shrinking constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a continuing erosion of the concept of fundamental rights," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia's opinion in the case (Employment Division, State of Oregon vs. Smith, 
88-1213) was signed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. 
White, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.

MEXICO TO CONFRONT U.S. ON CAMARENA CASE ABDUCTION

The Mexican government today plans to confront U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
with allegations that Los Angeles-based drug agents arranged the kidnaping of a 
Mexican doctor indicted in the United States in the 1985 killing of an American 
drug enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who was arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles 
last week, was abducted from Guadalajara on April 3 and flown to the El Paso 
international airport, where agents of the Los Angeles office of the Drug 
Enforcement Agency were waiting to pick him up, U.S. and Mexican sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 42, is one of 19 Mexicans who have been indicted in Los Angeles on 
charges of kidnaping, torturing and killing DEA agent Enrique S. Camarena in 
Guadalajara in February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican sources close to the case said American officials had advised them that 
the kidnaping was a renegade operation arranged by the DEA in Los Angeles 
without approval from headquarters in Washington or the knowledge of the U.S. 
Embassy in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A bounty of up to $50,000 per person was offered to the four kidnapers, a pilot 
and co-pilot, said a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesmen in Washington refused to comment on how Alvarez arrived in the 
United States, but they denied that his arrest had violated any laws or agency 
regulations. The lead prosecutor in the Camarena case, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Manuel Medrano, declined comment in Los Angeles on the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, however, announced Tuesday that he has called for "a thorough 
investigation" into Alvarez's arrest. At a press conference in Washington, 
Thornburgh said he has asked that all agencies with knowledge of the arrest 
"report to me what the precise circumstances were." 
</P>
<P>
"We must be very sensitive to questions of sovereignty of any of the nations 
with whom we work in cooperative ventures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh is scheduled to meet privately with Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique 
Alvarez del Castillo late today in Ixtapa, Mexico, where the two will be 
attending a Western Hemispheric conference on drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the first items on their agenda, Alvarez del Castillo will demand a 
"clarification" of the alleged abduction from Thornburgh, said Fernando Arias, 
a spokesman for the Mexican attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"Thornburgh knows he is going to be assaulted (with questions) on the Alvarez 
case. We want a clarification of whether U.S. officials were involved in the 
presumed kidnaping of Alvarez," Arias said. 
</P>
<P>
A source in the Mexican attorney general's office said that the government of 
Mexico believes "without a doubt" that Alvarez was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're investigating is who participated, where it was and how he was 
introduced into the United States," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Thornburgh said he was not likely to have a full account of the case 
in time to respond to detailed questioning from the Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was nabbed by drug traffickers outside the U.S. Consulate in 
Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985, and tortured for information about DEA activities 
in Mexico. U.S. officials charge that Alvarez, a gynecologist, observed the 
torture and administered drugs to revive Camarena so that he could undergo 
still more questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is scheduled to face trial in Los Angeles on May 1 along with four 
other defendants in the case, including Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a 
convicted drug trafficker who was captured in Honduras in 1988 by military 
officials and deported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is the primary base for Operation Leyenda, the DEA's investigation 
into the Camarena killing. DEA officials said Tuesday that the probe is 
officially headed by a Washington-based agent, Bill Waters. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, Alvarez's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, 
asserted that his client had been kidnaped but said he would not make an issue 
of that in court because the plea would fall on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
"There obviously was no extradition and no hearing. He left his office and left 
his country without his consent. . . . But others (Matta Ballesteros, for 
instance) have argued kidnaping in two different cases and the court ruled 'too 
bad but they're here,' " Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said Alvarez was abducted from his office in Guadalajara on April 2 
by four or five men in civilian clothing who identified themselves as Mexican 
federal police, presented badges and announced that he was under arrest for 
performing illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor was put into a car and driven north to an unidentified town, where 
the party spent the night before boarding a small airplane. Alvarez claims that 
an American DEA agent was present in Mexico participating in his arrest, 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Alvarez) said there was a gringo with them and he asked if the guy was a 
DEA agent and he (the agent) said he was," Steinberg said. "They flew over the 
border to El Paso, whereupon the DEA agent took him off the plane and he was 
arrested. . . . He thinks the agent who interviewed him in El Paso was the same 
guy as on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was interrogated in El Paso by Delbert Salazar, a special agent and a 
member of the Operation Leyenda team. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesman Frank Shults said the agency would not discuss the circumstances 
that brought Alvarez to the United States. He said the doctor was "located by 
DEA in El Paso and arrested there on lawful authority." 
</P>
<P>
If a DEA agent were involved in the apprehension of Alvarez in Guadalajara, it 
would mark the first time that the agency has taken advantage of a 
controversial new Justice Department legal opinion that gives its agents the 
authority to take part in the "snatching" of fugitives abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's chief spokesman, David Runkel, said Tuesday that Alvarez's arrest 
was "not within the purview" of that ruling because it did not involve U.S. 
agents going into another country. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources in the United States confirmed that Los Angeles-based 
DEA agents had been instrumental in arranging the operation and said the agency 
had promised to pay a reward of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials denied Tuesday that the agency had paid any "bounty" in 
connection with Alvarez's arrest, but they left open the possibility that such 
a reward might be paid in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials, meanwhile, have publicly denied that any Mexican federal, 
state or local police were involved in the alleged abduction. Privately, 
however, they admit they are still investigating the case and expect U.S. 
officials to provide them with information on the identity of those who 
detained the doctor. They also want the registration of the plane that flew 
Alvarez to El Paso, the names of its crew and its flight plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials say Alvarez is a valuable witness in the U.S. case because he 
could provide firsthand medical testimony that Camarena had been tortured. 
</P>
<P>
During his questioning in El Paso, Alvarez did not admit to treating Camarena 
while he was in the hands of drug traffickers, according to a report on the 
interrogation obtained by The Times. However, the report indicates that the 
doctor did admit seeing Camarena in the hands of his kidnapers at a house on 
Lope de Vega Street in Guadalajara where the torture is known to have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez told DEA agents that he saw a dozen other people in the house, 
including reputed drug kingpins Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo, both of whom also have been indicted in the case. He alleged that it 
was another doctor, Juan Mejia Monje, who attended to Camarena, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Alvarez Machain stated that he observed Dr. Mejia Monje check Camarena's 
pupils and blood pressure and that after doing so reported to Alvarez Machain 
that Camarena was in very bad shape," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials say that the United States had never requested extradition of 
Alvarez or any of the other 18 people indicted in the Camarena case. There had 
been no official request for help in detaining Alvarez, Mexican officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. law enforcement officials, including Medrano of the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles, said they had requested the extradition of 
several defendants in the case and that all these pleas fell on deaf ears in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
When Alvarez was arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles on April 10, neither 
he nor his lawyer raised any protest about the circumstances of his arrest. 
Alvarez argued unsuccessfully to U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie that he 
should be released on bail pending a trial scheduled to begin May 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to flee, your honor," he said through an interpreter. "I came 
here to take care of this. . . . I am a gynecologist. I cannot live like this 
and neither can my family," he said, referring to the cloud that has been 
hanging over his head since he was indicted. He said he is innocent of any 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano told the court that informants had told U.S. law enforcement personnel 
that Alvarez is an associate of drug baron Caro Quintero, who is in prison in 
Mexico after being convicted there of participating in the Camarena murder. 
Alvarez "was specifically employed to take care of and heal any (narcotics) 
co-conspirators that were hurt or shot in the line of duty," Medrano said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Arias of the Mexican attorney general's office said his government 
has not filed a formal protest in the case but would do so if it is proven that 
Alvarez was kidnaped. He said, however, that the case is not likely to 
interfere with U.S-Mexican cooperation in the effort to fight drug trafficking.

U.S. TO PROBE 754 ACCOUNTS IN 173 BANKS FOR DRUG LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department moved Tuesday to obtain records from 173 banks on 
hundreds of accounts in which Colombian drug kingpins allegedly deposited 
nearly $400 million from selling cocaine in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Department attorneys, seeking clues to complex money-laundering operations of 
the Medellin cartel, obtained federal court orders requiring the banks and 
other financial institutions to turn over information from 754 suspect 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The court orders require the banks to freeze three-quarters of the accounts -- 
the first step toward seizing any remaining deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady characterized the move as "one of the most 
significant law enforcement undertakings involving bank account seizures in 
U.S. history." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the tactic is designed "to lift the veil of 
secrecy over the financial network of these narco-terrorists." He described 
money as "the drug-traffickers' lifeblood" and said: "If we can seize it or 
disrupt its flow, we can strangle their operations." 
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of recovering substantial amounts directly from the 
accounts is "remote," said Peter G. Djinis, a trial attorney in the Justice 
Department's narcotics section who has been involved in the crackdown from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
That is because most of the funds, which totaled an estimated $400 million in 
early 1989, probably have been moved elsewhere since then or spent on the 
cartel's operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 754 accounts are spread across 22 states, including 
California, as well as the District of Columbia. They are held in many of the 
nation's largest financial institutions, including the Bank of America and 
Security Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials stressed, however, that there is no indication that any of the 
173 banks knew about the true source of the funds in the accounts. "There is no 
information that the banks are anything other than unwitting service 
providers," said David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Djinis noted that bank cooperation had led to some of the early successes of 
Operation Polar Cap, the government's crackdown on drug money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
He said the real value of the court orders -- the latest phase of the Operation 
Polar Cap money-laundering crackdown -- will come from helping the government 
to obtain details about laundering operations and to trace the current location 
of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have been able to trace cash proceeds directly from 
cocaine and crack sales on the streets of American cities to foreign bank 
accounts owned by the Medellin cartel," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in the bank records grew out of the March 6, 1989, indictment of 
four Medellin cartel members -- Pablo Escobar, Jorge Ochoa, Gustavo Gaviria and 
Geraldo Moncada -- and others on charges of importing tons of cocaine and 
marijuana into the United States from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment led to the discovery that $1.2 billion in drug sale profits had 
been laundered, mainly through New York banks into foreign accounts controlled 
by the cartel, mostly in Panama, Uruguay and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh and Brady, in a joint statement, said Tuesday's action resulted from 
"an unprecedented level of cooperation given by eight foreign governments, 
cooperation which was unheard of even a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
The eight countries were identified as Colombia, Panama, Uruguay, Luxembourg, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, after the ouster of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, the 
new government of Panama agreed to U.S. requests for records of bank accounts 
identified as having been used by cartel money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of those and other foreign accounts disclosed that almost $350 
million of the $1.2 billion in profits from U.S. drug sales had been 
transferred by wire back to U.S. banks, primarily in New York and Florida. An 
additional $50 million is believed never to have left U.S. accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the cartel needs the U.S. accounts to provide working capital 
for its daily activities in America and to maintain its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ability to examine these bank records may well be the key to unlocking the 
totality of the secret financial arrangements of the cartel in the United 
States," the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
Djinis, the narcotics section attorney, said the cartel used imaginative covers 
for its accounts. One was maintained under the name of a 2-year-old relative of 
a cartel member. 
</P>
<P>
Despite attempts to disguise the real ownership, however, the accounts 
frequently contain a common element, such as an address or a telephone or 
facsimile machine number linked to cartel members, the Justice Department said 
in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The records, Djinis said, are expected to provide "a really rare look into 
their underground use of accounts in this country. We think this is going to 
point fingers in a lot of directions." 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators believe the cartel has purchased real estate in the 
United States, something the bank records could corroborate, according to 
Djinis. Some of the funds, he said, have been used for "purchases of consumer 
goods for members of the cartel -- to fill up their living rooms." 
</P>
<P>
In California, court orders were sought for accounts held in seven banks and 
one brokerage house. They are Bank of America's offices in Los Angeles and San 
Jose, Security Pacific National Bank and Mercantile National Bank in Los 
Angeles, Foothill Independent Bank in Glendora, Merrill Lynch in San Diego and 
Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of the Orient in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several of the institutions said they will cooperate with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Like other banks, we are called on frequently to cooperate in law enforcement 
investigations, and we'll do that in this case," said Peter Magnani, a 
spokesman for the Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kellogg, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, noted that the bank had helped 
start Operation Polar Cap by reporting to authorities unusually large deposits 
by firms found to be operating as launderers. "We are obviously going to 
cooperate," she said.

<P>
Hurtling north on Highway 99 through the heart of California's farmlands, John 
K. Van de Kamp appeared a little bemused at the hoopla attendant to Sunday's 
widely publicized celebration of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone today is an environmentalist," he said dryly, hunched forward in the 
front seat of a car en route here. 
</P>
<P>
And he was no exception. It was Van de Kamp, environmentalist, who plowed 
through back-to-back press conferences in Bakersfield and Fresno Tuesday. It 
was not -- at least explicitly -- Van de Kamp, candidate. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign for governor didn't merit a mention in two speeches. A new poll 
that boosted him to dead-even with former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein 
in their tug-of-war for the Democratic nomination earned no chest pounding. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's business did, however, cut to the quick of Van de Kamp's effort, as 
he tried to sell to the skeptical Central Valley the sweeping environmental 
initiative he and a host of ecological groups hope to place on November's 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative -- and others on crime and ethics -- form the bulk of Van de 
Kamp's platform, and Tuesday he introduced it for the first time in the 
stronghold of the farming and pesticide industries that oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered around him were symbols of poisoning: a Bakersfield mother who blames 
her 11-year-old son's death from leukemia on the pesticides that were sprayed 
near their home, and a Fresno-area farmer whose ill health prompted him to quit 
spraying pesticides and grow fruits organically. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in California has to worry about pesticide residues on the food we 
buy in the market," Van de Kamp said in a speech given in both locales. "But 
here in Fresno County, people also have to worry about pesticides carried by 
fog, seeping into the ground water, and poisoning neighbors who work in the 
fields or live close by. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should have to live like that. Children shouldn't have to grow up like 
that. We deserve better." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is trying to win over -- for both the initiative and his own 
campaign -- residents throughout the state and particularly the valley whose 
own lives have been touched by environmental troubles. In Fresno, for example, 
while farming interests may oppose the initiative and its sponsor, it is likely 
to strike a responsive chord among those whose water supply has been tainted by 
chemicals. More than 200 wells have been affected by chemicals in Fresno alone, 
local activists said. 
</P>
<P>
He also is trying to take the edge off what is expected to be a hammering 
opposition campaign mounted by farming and pesticide interests. Van de Kamp 
disputed the word spread locally that the initiative would ruin the farming 
industry -- "that's just so much fertilizer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to have a rational approach to pesticides," he said in an 
interview. "In the long term, it's going to be to the benefit of the valley." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the environment is virtually Van de Kamp's turf in the Democratic 
primary. Feinstein has yet to announce her approach to solving environmental 
problems, but she is expected to do so within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
She also has held off a decision on whether to endorse the initiative, the 
broadest ever introduced in the state. The initiative -- called Big Green by 
its supporters -- would ban 24 pesticides that are known to cause cancer in 
humans, ban imported food grown with pesticides, create an environmental 
advocate, ban clear-cutting of redwood forests and prompt deep cuts in gases 
that affect the Earth's ozone layer.

CUSTODY DECIDED FOR S.F. QUAKE ORPHAN; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE 10-MONTH-OLD BOY COULD WIN SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN A POTENTIAL 
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE. THE JUDGE SET ASIDE CLAIMS OF FOUR OTHER RELATIVES 
AND AWARDED CUSTODY TO RANCHING COUPLE.

<P>
An Alameda Superior Court judge on Tuesday agreed to allow a 10-month-old boy 
orphaned last October in the Bay Area earthquake to be raised on his second 
cousin's cattle and hog ranch in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Setting aside the claims of four other relatives, Superior Court Judge Roderic 
Duncan decided to place the boy in the permanent custody of Arthur and Tonia 
Lewis of Chowchilla, a small Madera County town. The complicated agreement, 
which gives the other relatives visitation rights in alternate months, followed 
a recommendation from social workers that the child be placed with the Lewises. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, James Henry (Jimmy) Brown, was orphaned when a section of the 
double-decked Nimitz Freeway collapsed on his teen-age parents. Jimmy, who was 
riding in another car with his grandfather, was unharmed. Attorneys in the case 
have said the child could win several million dollars in a potential lawsuit 
against the state, which built the freeway section. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterly fought custody case has become a cause celebre in the Bay Area, 
where local TV stations and newspapers have provided extensive coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The case began as a battle between two competing grandparents who claimed that 
the other was unfit. Maternal grandmother Anita Williams and paternal 
grandfather James Brown II accused each other of being interested only in 
plundering the baby's potential future fortune. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge surprised both grandparents and their attorneys on March 29 by 
rejecting their claims and placing the child in the temporary custody of the 
Lewises. The case was further complicated when custody petitions were submitted 
by two other members of the Brown family -- Maj. Gerald Brown, the boy's 
great-uncle, and paternal grandmother Vicki Reed, who is separated from her 
husband, James Brown II. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his ruling, Duncan praised all parties for agreeing to the 
arrangement. The relatives had a three-hour meeting earlier that morning to set 
aside their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"The families pulled back and realized that their personal wishes were not the 
most important thing," the judge said. "Even someone who is 10 months old feels 
the vibrations of that battle and will often bear the scars for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Lewis and the boy's attorney both said they hope that the child will now 
be able to have a quiet, uneventful life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the best possible decision for my client," said Simone 
Campbell, Jimmy's court-appointed attorney. "He won't have to see me or (the 
courtroom) again for years."

PROSECUTORS SEEK 10-YEAR TERM FOR MONTOYA ON CORRUPTION COUNTS

<P>
Federal prosecutors are urging that former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, 
convicted of seven political corruption charges, be sentenced to prison for as 
long as 10 years and one month, according to documents filed in federal court. 
U.S. Atty. David Levi, whose office is conducting an ongoing Capitol corruption 
probe, argued that Montoya should serve a particularly stiff sentence because 
the ex-legislator lied at his trial and sought to withhold damaging evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The political corruption he engaged in and for which he had a reputation is 
particularly insidious," Levi said. "Such corruption is easily concealed. When 
the government is able to penetrate the wall of fear and friendship which 
protects corrupt public officials, the sentence should aim for the maximum 
deterrence possible." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya faces a maximum of 140 years in prison for his conviction on charges of 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering. Under federal sentencing 
guidelines, Levi contends that the former Democratic senator from Whittier 
should be sentenced to between 97 and 121 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is scheduled to be sentenced on April 26 by U.S. District Judge Milton 
L. Schwartz. Dozens of the former senator's supporters have submitted letters 
urging leniency and citing his efforts to help groups and individuals in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
But Levi argued that Montoya's corrupt activities and his efforts to conceal 
his wrongdoing call for a harsh sentence under federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most troubling aspects of (Montoya's) testimony at trial is that he 
simply lied when he thought it was in his interest," Levi said. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the prosecutor accused Montoya of lying on the witness stand 
about his role in passage of a bill sponsored by a bogus FBI company seeking 
special treatment from the Legislature. Montoya had been videotaped receiving 
$3,000 from an undercover agent representing the "company." 
</P>
<P>
Levi said Montoya's failure to provide incriminating documents that had been 
subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office also calls for a tougher sentence. 
Among the documents that Montoya did not turn over was a "schedule of fees" he 
had sent to former sports agent Michael Trope seeking $10,000 in honorariums 
and campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, federal investigators have broadened their inquiry into 
the office of Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), subpoenaing her 
campaign contribution records and files on six bills she authored between 1985 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the bills would have changed the regulation of alcoholic beverages. 
Moore's husband, Ronald Dobson, is in the liquor and wine distribution 
business, but it is unclear whether any of the bills would have affected his 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Moore, investigators are looking at the activities of one of her 
former aides, Tyrone Netters. Both Moore and Netters accepted money from 
undercover agents posing as businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Harland W. Braun, Moore's attorney, said the assemblywoman has done nothing 
wrong and ultimately will be vindicated. He accused Levi of dragging out the 
investigation even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this, Chinese water torture?" Braun asked. "Why don't they go public 
with their accusations? Because there's nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trial of former Sen. Paul Carpenter, now a member of the State 
Board of Equalization, on four counts of racketeering, corruption and 
conspiracy has been set for Aug. 13.

COLISEUM PROTECTION BILL GAINS; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: A STATE SENATE PANEL APPROVES A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC VOTE 
BEFORE THE STADIUM COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR REBUILT AS A MEANS OF KEEPING TEAM IN 
TOWN.

A Senate committee entered the fray over the fate of the Los Angeles Coliseum 
on Tuesday, voting unanimously for a bill to require a public vote before any 
or all of the Coliseum could be demolished and rebuilt as a means of keeping 
the Raiders from moving to another city. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-0 vote by the Governmental Organization Committee sent the measure, 
sponsored by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), to the Appropriations Committee 
for more screening. There was no opposition expressed to the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal being considered by the Coliseum Commission to entice the pro 
football Raiders to stay is to tear down and rebuild most of the stadium. Of 
the present structure, the only part to be left standing would be the peristyle 
section, which contains the columns and holds the Olympic torch, according to 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said that, although he is a Raider fan, he opposes the demolition of the 
Coliseum if that is what it takes to keep the team in Los Angeles. Noting that 
the Coliseum is both a state and national historical landmark, Torres said, "At 
the present time, we are not sure what will happen to the Coliseum. It should 
be protected in every way possible." 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to call a 
countywide election on any plan to demolish any or all of the Coliseum for 
major alterations. If the voters opposed changes, the plan could not proceed, 
Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles Times Poll showed that 54% of 1,901 residents surveyed in 
Los Angeles and Orange Counties do not want the Coliseum razed, and 83% would 
not be very upset if the Raiders moved to another town. The poll, directed by 
I. A. Lewis, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Plans calling for structural changes in the Coliseum presently are being 
negotiated with the Raiders by the Coliseum's lead private manager, the 
Spectacor Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' bill is supported by the Los Angeles Conservancy, the American 
Institute of Architects, the California Preservation Foundation and the 
National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters noted that the Coliseum is unique because it was the host site for 
both the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he wanted to meet with Spectacor officials as soon as possible to 
learn specific details of the proposed alterations. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have a tentative deal to move to Oakland, but that has hit a snag. 
A group of Oakland residents are calling for a vote on the plan -- something 
that Raider spokesmen said they oppose. Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson was 
scheduled to ask the Oakland City Council late Tuesday to rescind its approval 
of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mark Fabriani said that the opposition in Oakland 
"opens a tremendous window of opportunity for Los Angeles to retain a 
professional football team and infuse large amounts of private money to 
renovate the Coliseum."

HOCKEY: EDMONTON HAS OVERCOME A 3-1 DEFICIT TO REACH THE SMYTHE DIVISION FINAL

<P>
The final image from Game 6 Saturday night at the Forum remains indelible. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Flame goalie Mike Vernon is on his knees, stretching like an outfielder 
going for a fly ball. Just beyond his straining fingertips sails the puck, 
moving seemingly in slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
With it sails the prospect of keeping the Stanley Cup, won a year ago, but just 
out of the grasp of Vernon and his teammates. The puck, hit by the Kings' Mike 
Krushelnyski, lands in the net to end the series. 
</P>
<P>
It's an image the Flames won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
But it's an image that weighs heavily on the minds of the Kings, too, as they 
prepare for Game 1 of the Smythe Division finals tonight against the Edmonton 
Oilers at the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 23rd season of existence for the Kings. It is their 15th appearance 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And they have never advanced beyond the second round. Good teams and bad, 
Stanley Cup after Stanley Cup has eluded their grasp. It is no problem feeling 
for Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Those not into ancient history need only remember a year ago to appreciate the 
frustration the Kings have endured. 
</P>
<P>
The team was flying high. It was Wayne Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles 
and the Kings had just bumped off Edmonton, then the defending Stanley Cup 
champion, in seven games. To add to the exhilaration, the Kings had done so by 
coming back from a 3-1 deficit, becoming only the sixth team in NHL history to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Calgary in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Exit the Kings, in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the roles are reversed. This time, the Flames were the defending champions 
knocked off by the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, Edmonton has come back from a 3-1 deficit to survive the first 
round, beating the Winnipeg Jets in a seventh game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different this time," Gretzky said. "We are so much stronger this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, it (the playoff against Edmonton) was such an emotional series. 
Then, we were horrendous (against Calgary) and it was over before we knew it." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, Gretzky's Oiler counterpart and the man considered the favorite 
for the Hart Trophy as NHL most valuable player, doesn't want to dwell on last 
season, either. Particularly, his team's collapse against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think what happened is going to enter into it this time," he said. 
"That's all behind us. We're not looking at that. That's like when you rip your 
rear-view mirror on your car. What's behind you isn't important." 
</P>
<P>
Unless you can use it as a motivator. Edmonton Coach John Muckler isn't 
hesitant to bring up Gretzky, who led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups before 
coming to the Kings two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people remember the joy Wayne got from beating us (last season)," 
Muckler said, "and it was joy. I don't blame him, but he's an opponent now and 
has to be treated as such. Wayne will do everything in his power to win and we 
should, too." 
</P>
<P>
Messier, on the other hand, would prefer to leave Gretzky in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"All the emotional ties are gone," he said. "This is a brand new club. Wayne 
hasn't entered into our talks once all year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to contend with Wayne obviously because he's such a great player, but 
it's not us against him. It's the Oilers versus the Kings. That's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
If the emotion from last year has truly dissipated, how about the emotion 
generated the last time these teams met in the regular season? The result was 
an NHL-record 86 penalties in a confrontation that was more a brawl than a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Tomas Sandstrom wound up with a facial fracture and a scratched 
cornea as a result of a punch thrown by Glenn Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming off a bad loss to Calgary," King Coach Tom Webster said, "and 
we were trying to establish ourselves as a team. We both clashed at the wrong 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We played with great discipline against Calgary in the playoffs, and we now 
have to do the same thing against Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got bad news from doctors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, out since March 17 with a lower back injury, may be 
through for the season. 
</P>
<P>
And veteran right wing Dave Taylor, who suffered a strained shoulder in Game 6 
of the Calgary series, may not be back for the Edmonton series. 
</P>
<P>
There was good news. Defenseman Tim Watters, out since Game 4 against the 
Flames with a deep ankle bruise, may be back by Game 3 of this series. 
</P>
<P>
And left wing John Tonelli, who bruised his knee in Game 6, skated Tuesday and 
is expected to play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Taking Taylor's spot on the line with Luc Robitaille and Todd Elik will be 
Scott Bjugstad, finishing his first season with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
For Edmonton, goalie Grant Fuhr is out for the year with an injured shoulder, 
but backup Bill Ranford played well in the Jet series, stopping 26 shots in 
Monday's 4-1 victory to finish the series with a 2.81 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler center Craig MacTavish has a hip injury, but is expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were 4-2-2 against the Kings in the regular season, 2-1-1 both home 
and away. . . . Game 2 will be at Northlands Coliseum Friday, with the scene 
switching to the Forum for Games 3 (Sunday) and 4 (Tuesday). If necessary, 
Games Five and Seven would be back in Edmonton April 26 and 30. Game Six would 
be at the Forum April 28.

NBA: JOHNSON'S LAST-SECOND BASKET BEATS SUPERSONICS, 102-101, AND CLINCHES 
HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT PLAYOFFS.

<P>
Common basketball terms failed to adequately describe Magic Johnson's most 
uncommon last-second shot Tuesday night. Some called it a hook, others a 
one-handed push shot. Johnson himself shrugged and termed it a "turn-push," 
whatever that means. But no one, for sure, called it a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
What the shot meant to the Lakers seemed more important than its label. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's turnaround, one-handed, 15-footer over Nate McMillan's outstretched 
arms not only gave the Lakers a 102-101 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics 
but also the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's victory assured the Lakers (61-18) of the NBA's best record with 
three games to play. It also struck a serious blow to the SuperSonics' playoff 
hopes. Seattle now is a game behind Houston for the final Western Conference 
playoff spot, which means a date with the Lakers in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
After what Johnson did to them Tuesday, the SuperSonics might not want to see 
him again for a while. Using its customary trapping defense and aggressive 
play, Seattle controlled Johnson and the Lakers until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Johnson's shot and a Laker victory, the club's 10th in a row over the 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing you do is sit and watch or stand and watch," Seattle forward 
Xavier McDaniel said of Johnson's shot. "Sometimes he makes you think he sold 
his soul to the devil." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers know better than to be amazed. Vintage Johnson, they called it. They 
expressed no surprise, just pleasure in its execution and result. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised at all with the shot he made," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
"It took simply a great player, simply the most valuable player of this league, 
to win this game and get us the best record." 
</P>
<P>
Even if they had lost Tuesday's game, the Lakers probably would have secured 
the league's best record, needing only one victory this week. But they wanted 
it over with as soon as possible and, it turned out, Johnson was their only 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had the ball at midcourt with Seattle leading, 101-100, and 5.2 
seconds to play. Michael Cooper inbounded to Johnson, who had to fight through 
McMillan just to receive the pass. 
</P>
<P>
His Laker teammates cleared the area and let Johnson create. The SuperSonics 
had double-teamed and trapped Johnson all game but, strangely, they chose not 
to on the final possession. Perhaps they feared that Johnson would find an open 
teammate for an easy basket. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he was as surprised as anyone about the single coverage. But he 
turned his back to McMillan and the basket and dribbled into scoring position, 
taking furtive looks at the clock as he went. With less than two seconds left, 
Johnson spun free of McMillan's defense and let fly the one-handed attempt, not 
unlike a shot-putter but with a softer touch. 
</P>
<P>
The ball went in with 0.8 seconds left. Seattle called time out and set up for 
its last-gasp attempt. But James Worthy swatted away McMillan's inbounds pass, 
and the Lakers had won the game and the league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to set yourself up to take the best shot possible," Johnson said. "I 
got a good look at it, and it went down. Nate did a good job. He cut me off. 
But I got into position so I could go away from his body. Nate's strong, just 
like I am. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to pass it, because they'd been doubling me the whole game. As 
soon as I got it, I was looking for which way it (the double-team) was coming, 
so I could find the open man. But they denied everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I knew I was out there somewhere. I didn't know exactly how far I 
was (from the basket). It really wasn't a hook. It was more like a turn-push. A 
hook from that far out is a little too much." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's teammates knew the ball, an especially high-arched attempt even for 
Johnson, was going in as soon as he released it. Or so they said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets it like that and backs people down, I basically started walking 
backwards, because I knew it was going in," said Byron Scott, who set the 
screen on McMillan so Johnson could receive Cooper's pass. "It's not even a 
mystery anymore. It's not a thing where we go, 'Well, it might go in.' It's 
just going in. You know it is." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy and a few others thought it something of a mystery that Johnson was not 
double-teamed. Granted, the Lakers have several offensive weapons, but none 
more dangerous than Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just what we wanted -- get him the ball and a chance to get into 
position," said Worthy, who led the Lakers with 22 points. "He can dictate the 
shot that way, whereas a lot of times teams will pressure him and make him 
pass. He was in a dictating position." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson clearly was the dictator on this night, scoring 21 points and passing 
for eight assists. But other Lakers contributed to their 61st victory. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Worthy's 22 points, A.C. Green had 18 points and 13 rebounds. 
Larry Drew spelled Johnson and had 11 points, including two three-point baskets 
in the second-quarter that helped maintain the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The second after the game ended, the Lakers celebrated their accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to mean something if we take care of things at home (in the 
playoffs)," Riley said. "We're confident at home if it gets to the finals. I do 
think it makes a difference in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's players silenced their coach afterward by dousing him with a tub of ice 
water, creating an oil slick on the locker-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooper did it," Riley said. "It was ice water. But Earvin's got ice in his 
veins."

ANGELS RALLY TO CATCH A'S BUT LOSE IN 12, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Angels knew for whom the rally bells tolled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the souvenir bells the 34,370 fans at Anaheim Stadium received upon arrival 
didn't ring true as the Oakland Athletics scored twice in the 12th inning for 
7-5 victory over the Angels Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three games that the Angels went to 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Weiss opened the 12th with a single off Mark Eichhorn (0-1), who had 
pitched three scoreless innings. Stan Javier forced Weiss at second. 
</P>
<P>
Javier went to third when Rickey Henderson's hard grounder kicked off the glove 
of shortstop Kent Anderson into left field for a single. Javier scored when 
Carney Lansford's grounder bounced off Johnny Ray's chest. Henderson went to 
second and then scored on Jose Canseco's single to center. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had rallied from a three-run deficit in the sixth inning on Dante 
Bichette's third home run of the season to pull even with the A's at 5-5. It 
was Bichette's home run that gave the Angels a 7-5 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins in 12 innings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mark Langston, who pitched seven hitless innings against Seattle 
last Wednesday in his previous start, did not approach that form Tuesday night. 
He gave up seven hits, including home runs to Lansford and Mark McGwire in the 
third inning, and left after six innings. The Angels rallied in the bottom of 
that inning to tie the score, ensuring that Langston would not be the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with four earned runs and made a throwing error on a 
pickoff play to set up the fifth Oakland run. He struck out six and walked two 
while making 105 pitches, a hefty total for so short a stint. He made 98 over 
seven innings last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by the Angels would have given them a 6-2 record and equaled their 
best starts. They had 6-2 records after eight games in 1970 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
A's starter Mike Moore, once a teammate of Langston's in Seattle, gave up three 
runs Tuesday. Reliever Todd Burns gave up the three-run home run to Bichette. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what Langston would do for an encore was answered quickly. As 
he did during his seven no-hit innings, he walked the leadoff hitter, Rickey 
Henderson. But the pattern was broken when the second hitter, Lansford, rapped 
a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Langston got out of the inning with the help of an excellent pickoff throw to 
second that caught Henderson leaning, but he couldn't escape the third inning 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The A's did their damage with two outs. Lansford powered a 1-0 pitch a few rows 
into the left-field seats, and Canseco followed with a shot up the middle that 
blew past Langston's upreached glove and into center field. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire then reached down for Langston's first pitch and slammed a home run 
deep to left field. 
</P>
<P>
It was his third home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner 
walked and scored when Chili Davis blasted a 2-0 pitch 420 feet to center field 
that pulled the Angels to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Langston seemed to settle into a groove in the middle innings. He struck out 
the last two batters of the fourth and first man in the fifth for a total of 
six strikeouts before Henderson bounced a ground-rule double down the 
left-field line. Canseco followed with a double off the wall in left, scoring 
Henderson for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The A's padded that to 5-2 in the sixth, without benefit of a hit. Dave 
Henderson drew a leadoff walk and went to third when Langston threw away an 
intended pickoff throw to first. Henderson held at third on Terry Steinbach's 
grounder to third, but with the squeeze play on, Lance Blankenship laid down a 
perfect bunt up the first-base line that allowed Henderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels then tied the score with one swing of Bichette's bat. Ray beat out a 
grounder to third for an infield hit and Joyner barely missed a home run, 
sending center fielder Dave Henderson crashing into the wall to make the catch. 
That was all for Moore, who was relieved by right-hander Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Burns threw four straight balls to Davis, who had switched to the left side of 
the plate. That brought up Bichette, a right-handed hitter, who slammed a 3-1 
pitch over the center-field fence. The drive was measured at 422 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa said his club wasn't taking this series against the 
Angels lightly. "You can't waste a golden opportunity to take your best shot," 
he said. "It's kind of unusual because we play them two and then don't see them 
for three months (July 23-26 at Oakland). We can't waste these games." 
</P>
<P>
His team didn't waste any games in the first week of the season, winning five 
of six. "The truth is, we had a solid first week," he said. "The starting 
pitching, relief pitching, hitting. The only problem is that it was last week, 
not this week." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa also said his team is aware of the defensive exploits of Angel 
outfielder Dante Bichette, who had five assists last week, but isn't about to 
change its strategy. "We know he throws well. We knew that last season," he 
said. "Still, our style is to push. If there's a guy on second base and there's 
a single to left field, unless the ball is in the guy's hand, we're going to 
send him. You don't take foolish chances, though." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson's first-inning walk was the 1,000th of his career, fifth among 
active players. Dwight Evans, Willie Randolph, Keith Hernandez and Brian 
Downing are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill 
Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip.

REDS SOAR AS LARKIN STAYS HOT 
</P>

<P>
A shortstop must be a good defensive player. If he also happens to be a hitter, 
it is a tremendous plus. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Larkin, who does an outstanding job on both offense and defense, has 
helped the Cincinnati Reds get off to the best start in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin had three more hits Tuesday at Cincinnati, fielded flawlessly and the 
Reds, behind the strong pitching of Tom Browning, beat the San Diego Padres, 
2-1, for their seventh victory in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
For those who think the Reds made a monumental error when they traded ace 
reliever John Franco to the New York Mets for Randy Myers, it should be noted 
that Myers pitched the ninth, pickup his third save. 
</P>
<P>
The first six victories were on the road, but it was the eighth straight home 
opener the Reds have won. 
</P>
<P>
But the story is Larkin. At the time Larkin, who will be 26 April 28, suffered 
a torn ligament in his right elbow working out before the All-Star game, he was 
hitting .340. He didn't return until September and by that time the Reds were 
out of the race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin is batting .594. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it," Larkin said. "The balls just seem to be falling in here 
and there. I guess the key is for me to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"The hits are nice, but the most important thing is we're winning. I can't wait 
to get to the plate, especially with men in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher also had three hits and drove in a run as the Reds scored twice 
in the second inning to beat Andy Benes. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, New York 6 -- Third baseman Howard Johnson's throwing error with two 
outs in the 13th inning at New York let in the two runs for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
During the game, which lasted more than 4 1/2 hours, there were 22 walks, six 
errors and eight stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets left the bases loaded in the third, ninth and 10th innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg, who tied the major league record with his 97th consecutive 
errorless game, hit the grounder that Johnson threw away. It scored Joe Girardi 
and Jerome Walton and was the fifth Mets' error of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 5, Atlanta 3 -- Franklin Stubbs, who said he is happy to get away from 
the Dodgers, hit a two-run home run and two doubles at Houston to lead the 
Astros. It was the Braves' fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Mark Portugal (1-1) gave up two runs in the first, but retired 12 
batters in a row before leaving in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs' first home run for the Astros came after a single by Craig Biggio in 
the second inning. Biggio had three hits and has nine hits in his last 11 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, St. Louis 2 -- The Cardinals' Greg Mathews, trying to come back 
after being sidelined last season because of an elbow injury, walked six in 2 
2/3 innings at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Neal Heaton (2-0), who won his last five decisions in 1989, went 7 2/3 
innings, giving up five hits. Heaton, who has given up only one earned run in 
12 innings, didn't win his second game last season until July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Cold, gusty winds held the attendance to 3,981. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, Philadelphia 1 -- Rookie Delino DeShields hustled to first base to 
avoid a double play in the seventh inning at Montreal and drove in the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed-hitting DeShields was facing left-hander Don Carman with the 
score 1-1 and runners on first and third and one out. He pulled a bouncer to 
second baseman Tommy Herr and barely beat the throw on the double play attempt.

Sparked by the surprising return of Ray Bourque and the goaltending of Andy 
Moog, the Boston Bruins advanced to the second round of the NHL playoffs with a 
3-1, seventh-game victory over the Hartford Whalers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bourque, who was expected to miss his fifth consecutive game with a left hip 
bruise, had one assist and was on the ice for all three Boston goals. 
</P>
<P>
Moog stopped 27 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins open the best-of-seven Adams Division final at home Thursday night 
against Montreal. Boston avoided becoming the first team since the 1970-71 
Bruins to lose in the opening round after compiling the best regular-season 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Boston led, 2-0, after one period on goals by John Byce, in his second NHL 
game, and Craig Janney. Cam Neely made it 3-0 at 15:22 of the second period on 
a give-and-go play with Janney.

HOCKEY STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
SHORT REST FOR BLACKHAWKS AS THEY PLAY BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After surviving a seventh-game showdown to stay alive in the NHL playoffs, the 
Chicago Blackhawks plunge right back into the game-every-other-night grind 
tonight, opening a second-round Stanley Cup series against the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks at least will be at home, where they finished off the Minnesota 
North Stars, 5-2, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Other second-round series open Thursday night, with the New Jersey Devils 
playing the New York Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens playing the Boston 
Bruins, who won the seventh game against the Hartford Whalers Tuesday night, 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
In their seventh game, the Blackhawks, trailing 1-0, had to kill consecutive 
first-period major penalties that left them two men short for more than two 
minutes. They held Minnesota scoreless during that stretch, then got two goals 
apiece from Wayne Presley and Jeremy Roenick. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues, who eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games, could have 
their best goalie, Curtis Joseph, back after he suffered a severely bruised 
shoulder. If Joseph doesn't return, Vincent Riendeau will start. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues' offense is led by Brett Hull, who followed a record-breaking regular 
season (72 goals, 113 points) with five goals and five assists in the first 
round against the Maple Leafs. The Blues ranked eighth in the NHL in goals for 
(295) and goals against (279) during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Blackhawk goalie Greg Millen, who opened the season with St. Louis and wound up 
in Chicago after a stop in Quebec, played well for victories in Games 3, 5 and 
7, but was pulled in Games 2, 4 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
Presley and Roenick each had five goals and Greg Gilbert scored four against 
the North Stars. Steve Thomas led the Blackhawks with 40 goals during the 
regular season and Steve Larmer had 90 points. The Blackhawks were fifth in 
goals for (316) but 14th in goals against (294) during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Defense was at a premium in games between the two teams this season. Three 
games ended 8-3, another 9-6 and two more were 6-4. The Blues won the season 
series against the Blackhawks, 5-2-1 -- going 3-1-0 at St. Louis.

DATA ISN'T ALWAYS PERTINENT TO THE MAIN QUESTION: CAN HE PLAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every NFL team has its draft pick from hell, the high-round choice that flops 
and flails for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will forever wince at the mention of Mike Schad and Donald Evans, the 
team's first choices in 1986 and '87, respectively. Gaston Green, a No. 1 pick 
in '88, is threatening to make it a flop threesome. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Raiders went through a similar three-year period when they 
wasted No. 1 picks on Jessie Hester (1985), Bob Buczkowski ('86) and John Clay 
('87). None of the three remains on the Raider roster today. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and Raiders aren't alone. The Cincinnati Bengals picked Jason Buck in 
the first round of the 1987 draft. He bombed. Ted Gregory was the Denver 
Broncos' first choice in 1988. Bombed. That same year, the New Orleans Saints 
used a No. 1 pick on Craig Heyward. Bombed. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing NFL potential remains as fickle a process as it was at the draft's 
beginning 54 years ago. The tools have become more sophisticated, but the 
problem is the same -- mainly, whom to select? 
</P>
<P>
The all-star games and scouting combine drills, those pseudo-scientific 
opportunities for study, were supposed to help solve the mysteries of draft 
day. For the most part, they do, giving coaches and scouts the perfect 
opportunity to watch players at close range. 
</P>
<P>
But information overload isn't always such a good thing. It can confuse rather 
than clarify. Perspective gets misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those way-backs that think the final has already taken place during 
the football season," said George Young, general manager of the New York 
Giants. "Now you've got to be very careful. Doing drills and playing football 
are not the same thing. Being a good football player and being a good athlete 
are not the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Running like a gazelle as an offensive lineman doesn't mean anything if you 
won't hit anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Faulkner, Ram administrator of football operations: "Sometimes (we) 
get wrapped up on too much stuff, instead of concentrating to see if the 
son-of-a-gun can actually play in the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, it was Faulkner, then with the Denver Broncos, who helped 
conceive the idea of a scouting combine. At the time, only three teams were 
involved, and the main purpose was to provide exact, detailed medical 
information on each pro prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the combine has become a multi-purpose event, complete with agility 
drills, intelligence tests, weight and strength measurements and, on occasion, 
even something related to football. It is also where many a draft mistake is 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"A great combine means a guy runs a fast time, on AstroTurf, indoors, with a 
track start, and the conditions are great," Faulkner said. "But if (a scout) 
puts too much emphasis on it, that's where you get screwed up. It's only on a 
one-day basis. Plus, those other drills they do, I don't know what they get out 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner takes that back. He likes the vertical jump test, but thinks that 
whoever thought of a four-square cone test ought to stand in a corner and wear 
one of the cones. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is not to overanalyze too much," he said. "Most of these guys in the 
combine you should have seen (on film or in person) during the last two years. 
If you make an evaluation just on (their combine drills in) Indianapolis, you 
can screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
There are other dangers, Faulkner said, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beware of the stopwatch. "Mistakes are made, especially when you rely on 
speed alone," he said. "A (scout) gets overwhelmed when he sees a guy run a 
4.45 (seconds in the 40-yard dash)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Statistics lie. "It all depends on the offense," he said. "A guy might 
catch a jillion footballs. But if you go on that alone, you may be totally 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't always trust a college coach's evaluation of one of his own players. 
"Sometimes they go overboard in their recommendations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Draft for talent, but also draft a player who fits your system. Faulkner 
wouldn't say it, but this may be the reason Green has struggled so much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never overestimate the ability of a small-college player to make the 
transition to the NFL. By the way, did someone mention Schad or Evans? 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner will get little argument from Young, who said that if the combine were 
strictly used for medical exams, "I wouldn't be one of the great complainers." 
Young calls the exams "the most important thing -- essential." 
</P>
<P>
Everything else is to be greeted with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
So wary is Young of a player's all-star game or combine experience, that when 
Giant management first meets to discuss draft picks, no mention of the 
postseason play is permitted. "We grade on what a player does during the season 
and we don't mix the (postseason) grades until later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players can be flashers," he said. "They flash excellent skills (during 
an all-star game), but the problem is, they don't have consistency. I want to 
know how he is over a long period of time."

BULLS CAN'T WIN MIDWEST DIVISION, SO THEY SINK CELTICS' ATLANTIC HOPES 
</P>

<P>
The Chicago Bulls' bid to overtake the Detroit Pistons in the Central Division 
fell short, so they took it out on the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan scored 35 points at Chicago Tuesday night to lead the Bulls to a 
111-105 victory. They not only ended the Celtics' six-game winning streak, but 
the Bulls just about crushed the Celtics' hopes to beat Philadelphia in the 
Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, two games behind the 76ers with only three games remaining, never 
had a lead. The closest they came was 105-104, on a fast-break basket by John 
Paxson with 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Scottie Pippen sank two free throws and Jordan sank a three-point basket to 
end the Celtics' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who fought back from a 16-point deficit, were led by Kevin McHale 
with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 97, Utah 96 -- The one division still up for grabs is the Midwest. The 
showdown is tonight when Utah, leading the Spurs by a game, plays at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
In this one at Dallas, the Mavericks almost blew a 15-point lead in the last 
quarter. The Jazz, with Karl Malone getting 39 points and 17 rebounds, fought 
back resolutely. 
</P>
<P>
With his team leading only 97-96, Derek Harper, who had 24 points for the 
Mavericks, tossed up an airball trying for a three-pointer with 20 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz tried for a last shot, were unable to communicate and when Thurl 
Bailey sank an 18-footer, the final buzzer had already sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was disgusted. "We just blew our biggest game of the season," he said. 
"We controlled our own destiny and we didn't come through. The game was there 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, apparently thinking they had the game won when they led by 21 
points in the first half, relaxed, almost too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 112, Sacramento 97 -- Sleepy Floyd scored 15 of his 22 points in the 
fourth quarter at Houston and the Rockets took possession of eighth place in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's tough loss at home to the Lakers put the Rockets a game in front. 
Each team has three games to play. The Rockets host Denver, which has not 
clinched the seventh spot in the West, visit Dallas and close out at home with 
Utah. The SuperSonics play at Sacramento and Golden State and meet the Clippers 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets had to come from behind without the help of Akeem Olajuwon. Early 
in the third quarter Olajuwon and Greg Kite of the Kings traded punches and 
both were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 99, Minnesota 89 -- The expansion Timberwolves drew 49,551 fans at the 
Metrodome and broke the season attendance record -- drawing 1,072,578 fans -- 
but the Nuggets scored a big victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Lever scored 10 of his 21 points in the final 4:44 as the Nuggets pulled 
out the victory with an 18-6 run. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets have a 41-38 record. Houston has a 40-39 record and Seattle is 
39-40. In their last three games, the Nuggets play at Houston and at home 
against San Antonio and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 96, Milwaukee 88 -- It was the biggest road game of the season for 
the Cavaliers and they turned it on in the fourth quarter to beat the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
John (Hot Rod) Williams played the starring role. Williams scored five of his 
19 points in a 7-0 run at the start of the last quarter that gave the Cavaliers 
a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers need to win two of their last three to clinch the last playoff 
spot in the East. They play at New Jersey, at Orlando and are home to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 118, New Jersey 95 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 10 of his 36 points in 
the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter and the Hawks broke open a tight 
game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Hawks' playoff hopes alive. The Hawks are trailing 
Cleveland by half a game in the battle for the eighth and final playoff spot in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if the Hawks win their last two games, they will not make the 
playoffs unless the Cavaliers lose two of their last three. If the two teams 
tie, Cleveland makes the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 129, Orlando 127 -- Bernard King's jump shot with less than two 
seconds remaining at Orlando saved the Bullets. King had 32 points and a 
career-high 14 assists. DAN HAFNER

Theoren Fleury scored one goal and had three assists, leading Canada past Team 
USA, 6-3, in the World Hockey Championships Tuesday at Bern, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for the Americans. They had reinforced the 
team Sunday night with three NHL players, including Joel Otto and Paul Ranheim, 
Fleury's teammates in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Team USA led, 3-1, before Canada's Shawn Burr and Greg Adams each scored two 
goals. It was Canada's second consecutive victory in the preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Joe Nieuwendyk, center for the Calgary Flames, suffered an injured 
left knee halfway through the first period and Coach Dave King said he doubted 
that Nieuwendyk would return to the tournament.

KOST RETAKES NO. 1 SPOT IN RADIO RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a fluke after all. A "soft hits" radio format triumphed over dance 
music once again. 
</P>
<P>
Adult-contemporary station KOST-FM (103.5) reclaimed the No. 1 spot as Los 
Angeles' favorite radio station from KPWR "Power 106," the Arbitron ratings 
revealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
KPWR-FM (105.5) dropped to No. 3, while Top 40 station KIIS-FM (102.7) rose 
from No. 3 to No. 2 in the ratings survey, which covered the 12-week period 
from Jan. 4 to March 28. The survey bases its data on information recorded by 
listeners in a personal diary over a seven-day period. 
</P>
<P>
KOST had grabbed the top spot two quarters ago from KPWR, which had been on top 
almost exclusively for two years. At that time, KOST executives had been 
surprised but ecstatic. When KPWR rose back to No. 1 last quarter and KOST 
dropped to second, they said that their brief stay in first had been an 
anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
But KOST General Manager Howard Neal was singing a different tune Tuesday after 
he learned his station was again king of the hill. "I think we're on top 
because of the consistency in programming, our air talent, and so many other 
factors," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most stations play a lot of the same music, and the younger audience moves 
around a lot," he added. "You get a less fickle attitude with adult audiences. 
They have a greater loyalty to a radio station." 
</P>
<P>
KPWR promotions director Duncan Payton said that the station was not overly 
concerned with its drop. "We're still the key contemporary station with the 
demographics of between 18 and 34 year olds, which is what we're striving to 
be," Payton said. "Plus we continue to do well with other demographics. This is 
just a slight waver." 
</P>
<P>
In the competitive morning drive-time ratings, KIIS morning personality Rick 
Dees came out on top, followed by Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps on KLOS-FM 
(95.5) and Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur on KABC-AM (790). Minyard and Arthur had 
been No. 1 last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings also brought relief for executives at KKGO-FM (105.1). The station 
staged a controversial switch in format last January from jazz to classical 
music. The station's ratings rose slightly last quarter with the new format, 
and the ranking -- 24th place -- and share of the audience -- 1.4% -- remained 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very thrilled about what is happening," KKGO General Manager Saul Levine 
said Tuesday. "Beyond a shadow of a doubt, we made the right decision. We're 
getting thousands of letters praising us for what we've done. And our audience 
has grown from 300,000 people a week to 430,000." 
</P>
<P>
KKBT-FM (92.3), which was converted from a classical format to a rock format 
last year, surged dramatically in the ratings, from No. 36 last quarter to No. 
25 this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the area's top 15 stations, followed by their ratings for the most 
recent spring quarter and for the preceding winter quarter, as measured by 
Arbitron.

SUPERVISORS ORDER MUSEUM MERGER STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE PLAN WOULD HAVE THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY TAKE OVER THE 
ARBORETA AND BOTANIC GARDENS. OPPOSITION IS DEVELOPING TO THE PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday ordered a 30-day feasibility study of a 
proposal to merge the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History with the 
Arboreta and Botanic Gardens department, but there were strong indications of 
quickly escalating opposition to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The board, acting on a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich -- whose 5th 
District includes the county's two largest arboretum facilities -- unanimously 
ordered the Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission to study the merger 
proposal. The commission was created a decade ago to review possible 
consolidations of county departments. 
</P>
<P>
Even the decision to approve the preliminary study, however, produced 
indications among the board that there is uncertainty over how the merger, 
which has been strongly advocated by the natural history museum, would play out 
politically. The stiffening of discontent was reminiscent of development of 
opposition three years ago to an unsuccessful proposal by the natural history 
museum to take over the privately-owned Southwest Museum in Mount Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the board vote Tuesday morning, the California 
Arboretum Foundation -- the largest of five separate private agencies that 
raise funds for the arboreta -- denounced the merger proposal as a "land grab." 
"To have this occur while the county is reported to be supportive of Earth Day 
seems ironic and incongruous," said Alice Frost Thomas, president of the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman told the board he was aware of developing opposition to 
the merger from among the private arboretum support groups. "They are," said 
Edelman, "very much concerned about any consolidation that will take from them 
their independence." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, whose district includes the main 
natural history museum in Exposition Park and its satellite George C. Page 
Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits, demanded that the natural history museum retain 
supremacy in any merged natural science facilities complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't want to have the Museum of Natural History play second fiddle to 
flowers," Hahn declared. 
</P>
<P>
The development of a political controversy over the plan prompted Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum, chairman of the board, to emphasize that approval of the 
feasibility study does not constitute endorsement of the museum merger. "Nobody 
should get excited," Schabarum emphasized. "We are just taking a look-see." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Black, director of the natural history museum, declined through a 
spokeswoman to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger proposal -- disclosed 10 days ago by The Times following 
several weeks of consideration of the plan by the office of county Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Dixon -- the natural history and Page museums 
would take over the Arboreta and Botanic Gardens. The department includes the 
State and County Arboretum in Arcadia, Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada-Flintridge, the South Coast Botanic Gardens in Palos Verdes and the 
Virginia Robinson Estate in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The six facilities that would make up the combined agency together have a 
current fiscal year budget of nearly $20 million. They have a combined total of 
nearly 400 employees and hosted nearly 2 million visitors last year. Merging 
the two primary entities would constitute one of the largest consolidations of 
natural science museum facilities ever undertaken in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The merged entity -- whose name has not yet been determined -- would also 
provide newly constructed facilities for the privately held Western Foundation 
of Vertebrate Zoology, one of the nation's most significant collections of 
ornithological materials. The foundation, originally organized by Ed N. 
Harrison, president of the natural history museum's county-appointed board of 
governors, has been searching for a new structure for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the foundation has tried and failed to find accommodations on 
the UCLA campus and at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. In January of this 
year, Western Foundation officials visited Descanso Gardens to identify 
potential sites for a new headquarters building with between 20,000 and 40,000 
sq. ft. of space. 
</P>
<P>
The merger plan appeared to be developing into a test of wills between the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History Foundation, the private group that 
financially supports the museum and is legal owner of some of its collections, 
and the California Arboretum Foundation and the four other arboretum 
fund-raising groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unalterably opposed to such use of land that is supposedly dedicated to 
environmental purposes," said the arboretum foundation's Thomas. She said the 
boards of the five fund-raising groups held an emergency meeting last week and 
met on Monday afternoon with Dixon to express their discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas charged that Francis Ching, who retired as director of the Arboreta and 
Botanic Gardens April 1, was forced out after he refused to support the plan to 
build a new headquarters structure for the Western Foundation of Vertebrate 
Zoology at Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Ching said of his departure "I think that now I can see why I was given gentle 
persuasion to leave at this time." He said Dixon urged him to accept early 
retirement last month, telling him he believed Ching could not muster three 
votes necessary on the Board of Supervisors to resist forced ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really no choice," Ching said. He said he was encouraged to leave 
because of his opposition to the Western Foundation relocation, as well as his 
resistence to a plan first proposed a year ago to relocate the natural history 
museum's botany department to the arboretum and disband the independent 
research staff of the Arboreta and Botanic Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The arboretum foundation said it had demanded Ching's temporary reinstatement 
as head of the arboreta and the immediate beginning of a nationwide search for 
a new director. The arboreta department is currently headed by Leon Arnold, an 
interim appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"These facilities are intended to be green space. It's not open space 
(available for) building. It is a living laboratory," Thomas said. "Our 
missions are totally different from the mission of the natural history museum."

A LOVE FEAST FOR NELSON MANDELA IN LONDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the chilly night air at Wembley Stadium, tens of thousands of pop music fans 
gave their loudest and longest ovation to a man who's never had a song on the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
In fact they sang to him, belting out the Broadway show tune turned British 
soccer standard "You'll Never Walk Alone" for anti-apartheid leader Nelson 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
The exuberant but extremely well-behaved crowd of more than 70,000 had no 
problem adjusting to the nearly seamless blend of politics and music at the 
five-hour Mandela tribute concert Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The same fans who went crazy over Simple Minds and formed a 150-person conga 
line during Natalie Cole's "Wild Women Do" paid rapt attention to all the 
political speeches, especially Mandela's. During his low-key, half-hour 
appearance, the African National Congress leader gave his thanks for the 
international efforts which helped win his release after nearly three decades 
of imprisonment and pleaded for continued sanctions against the South African 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered, hissed and kept quiet at all the right times. 
</P>
<P>
With this concert, it appeared that the use of grandiose rock shows for 
consciousness-raising purposes had evolved another notch. This was no 
fund-raising charity event. Though the artists were performing for free, other 
productions costs were high, according to the organizers, and they expect to 
see little, if any profit. Instead it was designed to provide a worldwide forum 
for a political cult hero to deliver his message. This new dimension in pop 
music events brought occasional moments of culture clash. Hundreds of fans held 
up matches and lighters in the darkened stadium just before Mandela came on 
stage, as if they were coaxing him out to play "Born to Run." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Chapman solved the problem of finding an act to follow Mandela, coming on 
stage alone to play her haunting "Talkin' Bout a Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
But the song was turned into an instant commercial. As Chapman sang, the giant 
monitors flanking the stage replayed a slow motion version of Mandela's earlier 
arrival on stage, with the ANC leader waving to the adoring crowd. With Chapman 
singing the line, "Finally the tables are starting to turn," it produced a 
powerful image reminiscent of a 30-second presidential campaign spot. 
</P>
<P>
But while the music was there because of the politics, the fans were there 
because of the music. And they did not appear to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the show, Patti LaBelle performed with backing from Daniel Lanois' 
band. Chapman, who seemed more confident than at previous "event" concerts, 
made the first of several appearances singing "Freedom Now" and "Born to 
Fight." The Neville Brothers kept the audience moving with "My Blood" and 
"Yellow Moon." 
</P>
<P>
As the Nevilles played, performers in a green carpeted room backstage clustered 
around TV sets and watched the BBC's broadcast of the show. Lou Reed and 
Jackson Browne stood outside their trailers watching with a group of South 
African musicians, while Anita Baker, Bonnie Raitt and others clustered around 
the television at the other end of the room. 
</P>
<P>
There was widespread disappointment and resentment among the performers that 
the show was not being broadcast in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scandal," said Little Steven Van Zandt, who spearheaded the all-star 
anti-apartheid single "Sun City" in 1985. Suggesting that the show was not 
broadcast in the United States because of its political content, he said, "It's 
becoming more and more obvious that the media is becoming an organ of the 
government in the United States. I think it's shameful and embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Following appearances by Neil Young, Terence Trent D'Arby and Reed, the 
appreciative, almost entirely white audience bounced to the two sets of South 
African music. Conspicuously absent from the show was Hugh Masekela, who was 
scheduled to appear then dropped out after complaining in the British press 
that the event was being used as a forum for white artists to boost their 
record sales. 
</P>
<P>
New York rappers the Jungle Brothers quickly took control of the crowd, 
prompting an incredible roar when they asked the audience to make as much noise 
as possible for Mandela. But the drum sound was inexplicably turned down when 
Neneh Cherry joined the group, and despite her best efforts, there was no 
regaining the crowd momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The rap segment led to the first of a series of introductions that resulted in 
Mandela's reaching the stage to prolonged cheering. 
</P>
<P>
After Chapman's "Revolution," Simple Minds sent the crowd into a frenzy that 
made it clear how much bigger the band is in Great Britain than in the U.S. 
Lead singer Jim Kerr introduced Van Zandt, who in turn brought out all the 
other stars plus Chrissie Hynde and Peter Gabriel for a rousing version of "Sun 
City." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel ended the show strongly, performing "In Your Eyes" with Senegalese 
singer Youssou N'Dour, and the moving ballad "Biko." 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd filed out, few seemed disappointed, although many noted there was 
never that magic musical moment they had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really the top bands, was it?" asked Colin Francis of London. "But 
the main thing for me was to catch a glimpse of Nelson Mandela in real life." 
</P>
<P>
"Something to tell the children about," added his friend, Neil Chatum. 
</P>
<P>
"I came for the music and the cause," said a man who didn't want to give his 
name. "It was good. But they could have given Simple Minds a larger slot." 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed," said Philip Harrison, who traveled from York for the 
show. "I came mainly in hopes U2 were here."

IDENTITY CRISIS: The feds have issued a list of firms whose names sound like 
financial institutions but are not banks, trust companies or S&amp;Ls. On the 
list of sound-alikes is Great American Bank &amp; Trust in Laguna Beach, easily 
confused with the local branch of San Diego-based Great American Bank -- "the 
legitimate one," according to a federal spokesman. "Somebody is trading on 
their name." Steve Emmons and David Reyes

STRICTLY BUSINESS: Perish the thought that Orange County developer Barry G. Hon 
bought all those golf courses because he's a golf fanatic (D1). . . . The $967 
million that he'll pay for 19 golf courses and other real estate was purely a 
business investment, he says. . . . "I don't play enough golf to have a 
handicap. I set the record for losing golf balls wherever I play. I can hit any

NORCO'S GROWTH BID PUTS ITS RURAL LIFE ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NORCO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Richard MacGregor went horseback riding 25 years ago, it was beside the 
oil wells that proliferated along riding trails in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1970, Huntington Beach had become so urbanized that city officials were 
forced to ban horseback riding on city streets, prompting MacGregor to pack and 
move to Norco, a small town in western Riverside County that bore the motto 
"City Living in a Rural Atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Much to the relief of MacGregor, now a Norco councilman, his adopted hometown 
makes the same boast 20 years later. The city, with just over 25,000 residents, 
has fought off massive residential development -- unlike Corona, its neighbor 
to the south, where neighborhoods dot the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't very many cities like this," MacGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
But restraints on residential development came at the expense of the city's 
property tax base, forcing officials to search for new revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, in what some say is an ironic situation, city officials 
have tried to lure commercial development that will provide a sales tax base. 
The new money will enable Norco to maintain its riding trails and western 
motif, as well as its police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
But some longtime residents fear that the city's drive for commercial 
development is going too fast, and that traffic and other growth problems will 
destroy the city's rural lifestyle. Others argue that commercial development 
has put the city in serious debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community is being bombarded by development," Mayor John Cobbe said last 
week. "It's not easy. We cannot deny a developer the right to develop, but we 
have guidelines he has to go by." 
</P>
<P>
On Hamner Avenue and 6th Street, Norco's two main commercial corridors, about 
half a dozen small strip malls have been built in the past five years. The 
Norco Auto Mall, opened in 1986 on Hamner, has four dealers so far with a fifth 
on the way, although it still has spaces for 11 dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
This growth, city officials say, has helped Norco get itself back on its feet. 
This year, the city will take an estimated $1.4 million in sales tax revenue, 
up from $978,000 in 1988 and $589,000 in 1987. The new development has helped 
the city reopen a once-closed fire station, maintain city parks and renovate 
its 80 miles of horse trails, something almost unthinkable in the early 1980s 
when the city government had almost no money. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also earmarked between $100,000 and $150,000 for horse-trail 
improvements this year, including the installation of a special stoplight at 
Hamner and 6th for horseback riders, said A.J. Wilson, the interim city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city now is negotiating with a developer and property owner for a 55-acre 
retail development on 2nd Street at the south end of town, Wilson said. Such a 
development, targeted for completion in late 1991 or 1992, could increase sales 
tax revenue as much as 200%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norco's salvation, Wilson said, was the completion of Interstate 15 through the 
city in June, 1989. He said that the freeway, more than anything, contributed 
to the city's ability to attract businesses along Hamner Avenue, which runs 
parallel to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
This has also enabled Norco to stem the tide of its residents going to nearby 
cities for shopping and entertainment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be able to keep their money at home in Norco and maintain their 
rural lifestyle," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
But many old-time residents, some of whom have lived in the city since the 
1940s, question the need for such growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," said Phyllis Vaughan, 59, who moved to the community with her 
husband, Bill, in 1961. "It's not Norco anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Where once Hamner Avenue had chicken farms, Vaughan said, it now has shopping 
malls and business parks. Such suburban growth, she said, has changed Norco's 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize it's progress," Vaughan said, "but there isn't much left that 
doesn't have something on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see it go," she said. "What are my grand-kids going to do? Where 
will the open space be?" 
</P>
<P>
Genevieve Taylor, 74, the president of the Norco Historical Society, said the 
city is trying to do too much too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"They're creating a lifestyle that is too expensive for what Norco is," said 
Taylor, who moved to the city in 1950. "They're trying to convince people that 
they need this commercial development to support the rural lifestyle. I don't 
think there will ever be that many people (to support commercial development). 
I think eventually Norco will be a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's husband, Red, helped incorporate Norco in 1964. Its name comes from 
North Corona, as it was originally called. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that the city has landed in debt. Councilman Steve Nathan said that 
the city issued $22 million in redevelopment bonds last year, and it will take 
$60 million to pay them off. He pointed to the auto mall, which he said has 
fallen below expectations. One dealer has already gone out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're borrowing too much money to pay our bills," Nathan said. "Everybody's 
trying to get a shopping center. Everybody's trying to get an auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
"How much money are you going to spend. Where's it going to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
But city consultants say that there is still room for expansion with the 
opening of Interstate 15, said James Daniels, the city's community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also say that fears about commercial growth getting out of hand 
are exaggerated. Wilson stressed that Norco has the unique situation of its 
commercial zone being isolated from major residential areas and parks. Many 
houses are out of view of new convenience stores and fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"In a crazy kind of way, you kind of end up with an automatic planning device," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rural and commercial mix pleases some new residents -- many of whom came to 
Norco from Orange County for affordable housing. Kevin M. Leary, a sales 
representative for Country Trails, a housing development on the northwest side 
of the city, in the Beacon Hill area, said that he even tells prospective 
buyers that in Norco they will be able to ride their horses to fast-food 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the openness, I like the big lots," said Jaynie Fernandes, 50, who 
moved to Norco four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new stores "are all in the commercial area," she added. "I just hope they 
put in a Penguin's yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes down to it, city officials say, they don't have too many other 
choices. Because of an ordinance banning housing units on lots smaller than 
half an acre, residential development has nearly reached capacity, and about 
85% of residential land already is filled. The city's population can't grow 
much beyond 30,000, Wilson said. That makes it unfeasible to count on future 
property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson predicted that in a decade, Norco will be at maximum density. But he 
said he is confident that even then, the city will be unique. 
</P>
<P>
"Norco will probably end up being an island in the middle of an urban sprawl," 
Wilson said. "If they can pull it off, 10 years from now they're going to find 
this one of the best communities in Southern California."

MAGNITUDE 4.6 AFTERSHOCK JOLTS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A magnitude 4.6 earthquake that struck just west of Upland at 3:32 p.m. Tuesday 
was the most recent of hundreds of aftershocks that have startled Southern 
Californians after the Feb. 28 Upland earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon jolt was preceded by two foreshocks Tuesday, a magnitude 3.3 
temblor at 7:12 a.m. and a magnitude 2.6 at 7:19 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Those, in turn, had been preceded by a magnitude 3.4 shock about three miles 
farther northwest at 1:47 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Geologist Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena said the 
number of aftershocks from the 5.5-magnitude Feb. 28 earthquake was "in the 
normal range, but higher than average." 
</P>
<P>
The greater-than-average aftershock activity in the Upland area does not 
necessarily indicate that Tuesday afternoon's quake is the precursor of a 
larger quake, Jones said. In California, she noted, there is a one-in-20 chance 
that any earthquake is the foreshock of a larger shock, and that probability 
holds for this one as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although the afternoon shock startled residents of Upland and Pomona, which 
suffered the most damage in the Feb. 28 earthquake, there were no reports of 
significant damage or injuries. Officials surveyed buildings for damage, but 
none was found except for a few bricks that tumbled from a chimney in the 
city's "old district," Pomona Fire Inspector Ron Gomez said. "There wasn't any 
damage other than nerves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upland Assistant City Manager Mike Matlock said he was sitting at his desk in 
City Hall when the 4.6 aftershock hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strange," he said. "The floor felt like it sank three inches and came 
back up. It was a hard jolt but not a very long one." 
</P>
<P>
On Upland's Main Street, anxious shopkeepers and customers ran out of 
storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.6 quake was also felt from Brea to Huntington Beach, but Orange County 
emergency officials said there were no reports of any significant damage. The 
temblor was felt most strongly in North County, where police agencies in 
Fullerton, Brea and La Habra reported dozens of calls from concerned residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong roll, but we've had so many lately, nobody seemed to panic," 
said Sally Williams, a shopper in a Placentia supermarket. "A few boxes of 
laundry soap fell off the shelf. Nothing serious."

Two Canadian air force jets on a training mission collided in midair over a 
West German city Tuesday, killing one pilot and showering the area with flaming 
debris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and defense officials said the two Hornet F-18 fighter jets were flying 
at an altitude of about 1,000 feet when they collided about 4 p.m. over the 
central city of Karlsruhe. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian military sources said the planes, called CF-18s in Canada and slightly 
modified for the country's air force, had been flying at 10,000 feet, not 1,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
One pilot was killed. The other, who parachuted onto a highway, was severely 
wounded, as was a civilian in Karlsruhe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the burning wreckage of the one-seater jets set several downtown 
buildings on fire but that fire brigades managed to put out the flames within 
an hour of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The crash is bound to rekindle a debate over the dozens of military training 
flights crisscrossing West Germany's skies each day. 
</P>
<P>
The debate picked up steam after a series of deadly crashes in 1988. More 
recently, West Germans have said they would like to see the training missions 
sharply curtailed as East-West relations improve.

Two Canadian fighter jets collided over this southwestern German city during 
the evening rush hour Tuesday, killing one of the pilots and showering sections 
of Karlsruhe with flaming debris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead pilot was identified as Capt. Timothy K. Leuty, 30. 
</P>
<P>
West German television said his parachute apparently failed to open after the 
4:10 p.m. collision. 
</P>
<P>
The other pilot, Capt. Reginald deCoste, 35, ejected safely and landed on a 
highway, breaking both heels. He was listed in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
At least two people on the ground were also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The single-seat CF-18s, Canadian versions of the American F-18, had taken off 
from Baden-Soellingen Air Base near Rastatt, about 25 miles southwest of 
Karlsruhe, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft crashed in areas of this city of 285,000 that were sparsely 
settled, setting off small brush fires, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian air force officials said there were no munitions on board the craft, 
which were apparently involved in training maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
The crash is expected to rekindle a debate over the dozens of military training 
flights crisscrossing West Germany's skies each day.

IRAQ SAID TO HAVE STANDING ORDERS FOR ATTACK ON ISRAEL

President Saddam Hussein says that in the event of an Israeli nuclear attack, 
he has instructed Iraqi commanders to strike Israel with chemical weapons 
without waiting for orders, government media said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several newspapers and the Iraqi News Agency said Hussein made the disclosure 
last week during talks with a group of six visiting U.S. senators led by 
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"I ordered the commanders of air and rocket bases, if they ever hear that 
Israel hits any base or place in Iraq with an atomic bomb, you have to hit 
Israel because Israel could hit us while we (the leadership) are holding a 
meeting in Baghdad," Hussein was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"So you have an advance order to hit back, even in the event that you do not 
have an order from a top commander, if Israel bombs any base or any Iraqi 
city," the Iraqi media quoted Hussein as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets using conventional bombs destroyed an unfinished Iraqi nuclear 
reactor near Baghdad in 1981. Israel said the facility was being used to 
develop atomic weapons, but Iraq denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein had earlier announced that in the event of an Israeli attack on Iraqi 
installations, Iraq would retaliate with advanced binary chemical weapons. 
Binary weapons are composed of different chemical elements that while 
relatively harmless by themselves can turn lethal when combined. 
</P>
<P>
Dole did not provide many details of their talks but did say Hussein was 
worried that Israel would launch a preemptive strike similar to the 1981 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's announcement on binary weapons came after the arrests in London of 
several people accused of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Later, British customs agents impounded eight steel tubes bound for Iraq, 
saying they could be used as part of a huge gun. The tubes were made by a 
British firm, Sheffield Forgemasters. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, another British firm said it may have been duped into supplying 
Iraq with a recoil mechanism to form part of a giant gun. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Somers, a West Midlands steel forging company, said equipment was sent 
to Iraq last October as part of a petrochemical order but that its engineers 
now fear they had produced a hydraulic mechanism for a huge cannon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our engineers are now wondering whether they have been led up the garden path 
(tricked) by the Iraqis," a company official said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it canceled a second Iraqi order for components.

THOUSANDS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF TWO SOVIET PROSECUTORS

Soviets rallied Tuesday by the tens of thousands in Moscow and Leningrad in 
support of two embattled prosecutors whose anti-corruption inquiry has become a 
lightning rod for popular resentment of Communist Party privilege. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people gathered in the shadow of Moscow's Kremlin, and journalists 
said at least as many met in front of the former czarist Winter Palace in 
Leningrad as the Supreme Soviet (national legislature) in Moscow considered 
lifting the legislative immunity of the two, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
"Gdlyan and Ivanov Are Our Conscience!" read signs carried by the Moscow crowd. 
The two gained fame uncovering a trail of bribery and corruption in Uzbekistan 
that involved the son-in-law of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials accused the two of abusing their power and making unjustified 
public accusations against senior leaders in an effort to increase their 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Populist Communist leader Boris N. Yeltsin criticized as incomplete a nearly 
yearlong investigation of Gdlyan and Ivanov by a legislative committee and 
urged the legislators to keep their immunity intact. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet made no decision Tuesday.

Pregnant patients served by the Medi-Cal program for the poor are no more 
likely to sue for malpractice than other women, an independent foundation 
reported. The Sierra Foundation, which finances local health projects in 
Northern California, said researchers compared suits against physicians by 
pregnant Medi-Cal patients to those filed by expectant mothers in the entire 
state. "Because physicians consistently cite fear of lawsuits from Medi-Cal 
patients as a top reason for refusing to serve more of this population, we 
wanted to see whether there was any validity to this perception," said Dr. 
Barbara Aved, a consultant to the foundation.

POWERS DECIDED TO 'MAKE DOCTORS PAY,' COURT TOLD

Bradford Warren Powers Jr. told police that he decided to "take the law into 
his own hands and make the doctors pay" for his father's death when he 
allegedly shot four people in a rampage at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital, a 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler made that assertion in a brief San Diego 
Municipal Court hearing in which Powers pleaded not guilty to two counts of 
murder and three counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes moist and bloodshot, the 46-year-old La Jolla man spoke only once to 
the judge, when he interrupted the hearing and said, "I don't wish for bail." 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Woodward set bail at $2.5 million, despite Eichler's request that 
Powers be held without bail. The prosecutor had argued that Powers had planned 
to flee to Oregon before he turned himself in to Oceanside police an hour after 
he allegedly opened fire in an emergency room last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The spray of bullets killed a nurse and a student trainee -- on his first day 
at the job -- and wounded the on-duty physician and the father of a patient. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred about eight hours after Brad Powers Sr. died in the same 
emergency room, suffering a heart attack while doctors were attempting to 
repair a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities alleged that the younger Powers, who has had psychiatric problems 
dating back at least 25 years, was distraught over the death of his father, a 
well-known architectural illustrator, and returned to the scene to seek 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the shootings, a dark side to the father-son relationship has 
emerged. The younger Powers, who lived at home and seldom held a job for more 
than several months, was occasionally physically and verbally abusive to his 
father, a doctor and a family attorney said in telephone interviews. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of a family member, the coroner's office investigated whether 
physical abuse had contributed to the elder Powers' death, said Dr. H. E. 
Hammerstead, who tried to save the aging man when he was brought into the 
emergency room. The coroner's investigation, however, found no signs of 
physical abuse, he said.

ZELMAN URGES REPLACING PRIVATE HEALTH COVERAGE WITH STATE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance commissioner candidate Walter Zelman on Tuesday urged creation of a 
universal state health care system in California, replacing most private health 
insurance, to be financed through a payroll tax of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman's proposal is one of the boldest by any of the candidates for insurance 
commissioner and he pledged to make enactment of such a system his priority if 
elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
All Californians served by the plan could choose their own doctors, but the 
state would negotiate a price scale with the medical practitioners to hold down 
costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some arrangements might entail modest co-payments by the patients, he added, 
and in some instances patients wanting special care, such as private hospital 
rooms, would be required to pay for that themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployed persons would be covered by the state out of the surplus collected 
through the payroll tax, said Zelman, who is former director of California 
Common Cause. But visitors to the state would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman, saying that more than 5 million Californians have no health insurance 
and that that number has grown by 50% in the last three years, told a Westwood 
news conference that the present system is intolerable and that "surgery," not 
a Band-Aid approach, is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
One other candidate in the crowded race, Democratic ex-television commentator 
Bill Press, has advocated a universal health care plan in his speeches, but he 
has not presented details of how it would operate. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has been considering several less comprehensive plans, ranging 
from requiring all employers to buy private health insurance to giving 
employers a choice between buying private coverage or paying an 8% payroll tax 
for state insurance. A variation would mandate state subsidies to some 
employers who are unable to afford full insurance payments, but this would 
entail a general tax increase.

A 17-year-old girl, whose parents said they never knew she was pregnant, gave 
birth to an 8-pound boy who died after the teen-ager hid the newborn in a 
plastic bag under the bathroom sink, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, who apparently concealed her pregnancy and gave birth in the 
bathroom of her home on Easter Sunday, lost a great amount of blood and was in 
critical condition at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the girl was hospitalized, doctors told police to return to the family 
home to look for a baby.

CITY COUNCIL TO RULE ON HOTEL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Planning Commission and city planning staff at odds over whether a 
35-foot-high, 57-room hotel should be built, the City Council will have the 
final say on the project tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement began in October, when a city design panel recommended 
rejecting plans for a Flagship Inn at Avenida Calafia and Avenida del 
Presidente. 
</P>
<P>
Both the design panel and planning staff say the hotel proposal meets the 
minimum standards set by city ordinances -- but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, the City Council adopted a resolution requiring commercial 
developments to not just meet, but exceed city guidelines. Planning staffer Jim 
Pechous said the hotel plans need more work. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the submittal, the design cannot afford one more foot of setback, 
another square foot of landscape, one less foot of building height or any 
addition of building," Pechous said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the design panel turned down the project a second time, the Planning 
Commission approved the hotel earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It complied with all the requirements, the building codes and our general 
plan," Planning Commissioner Howard Revie said. "It sounded like a compatible 
use. There's not a whole lot more that could be put at that site." 
</P>
<P>
The site is a vacant lot by the Avenida Calafia interchange off Interstate 5 
where tourists exit to visit San Clemente State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pechous called the location a "gateway for tourism" in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very visible project," he said. "That's why it is important that it be 
done right."FRANK MESSINA

INTERFAITH SHELTER RENOVATION BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON TEEBOOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bulldozers rumbled at the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter on Tuesday as work 
began on a $360,000 renovation that will add much-needed living quarters for 
homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, which provides temporary housing mostly for families, originally 
consisted of eight one-bedroom apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
Four of those units will be torn down to make room for a 6,000-square-foot, 
two-story complex. 
</P>
<P>
The new building will contain private rooms for 18 families, each with its own 
entrance. The families will share four kitchens, four living rooms, nine 
bathrooms and two children's play areas. 
</P>
<P>
The new housing is designed to give families a way of getting off the streets 
and back on their feet, said Cindy Ochs, director of the center. The center 
also provides counseling and child care in an effort to help families again 
become self-sufficient, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation is being funded by $250,000 raised by an Irvine developer and 
$110,000 from the state-funded Emergency Shelter Program. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Lindsay, president of the Samis Co., founded the Orange County Foundation 
for the Homeless more than a year ago because he felt that the business 
community was not doing enough to help the homeless. The 14-member group has 
organized fund-raising dinners to support the Interfaith project, and is 
scouting for other shelters to refurbish. 
</P>
<P>
Other business groups, such as the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County, 
have also funded projects to provide housing for the homeless. As many as half 
of Orange County's estimated 10,000 homeless are children, said Susan Oakson, 
coordinator for the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. There are only 
about 450 permanent shelter beds to accommodate the county's homeless families, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Interfaith project is expected to be completed in six months. LEON TEEBOOM

GIONIS TO BE TRIED SEPARATELY IN ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of Dr. Thomas Gionis, accused of attacking his ex-wife Aissa Wayne 
and her boyfriend, was severed Tuesday from that of Jerrel L. Hindergardt, the 
co-defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of Gionis, 36, a Pomona surgeon accused of ordering the Oct. 3, 1988, 
assault on the daughter of the late actor John Wayne, was postponed at the 
defense's request to a tentative date of June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis is now on his fourth set of lawyers, and the change of attorneys has 
been primarily responsible for delays in bringing his case to trial. His 
current lawyer, John D. Barnett, is recuperating from a back injury and will 
not be ready for trial before June. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown ordered Tuesday that the trial go ahead 
for Hindergardt, 38, who is accused of leading the two-man attack on Wayne and 
financier Roger W. Luby in front of Luby's Newport Beach estate. The 
Hindergardt trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hindergardt's attorney, Todd A. Landgren, asked that his client's trial also be 
postponed. But prosecutors opposed the delay, and the judge said there was no 
good cause shown why Hindergardt's trial should not go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Luby were pistol-whipped, and Luby suffered a slash to his Achilles 
tendon during the late night attack. Prosecutors claim that Gionis ordered the 
attack during a bitter child custody battle with Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims have identified Hindergardt as their attacker. He has also been 
identified by Jeffrey K. Bouey, the other attacker, who is cooperating with 
authorities. Also important to the prosecution's case is testimony from private 
investigator O. Daniel Gal, who has testified that he hired Hindergardt. Gal is 
the primary witness against Gionis, claiming that it was the doctor who ordered 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, prosecutors had opposed allowing the case of the two defendants to be 
severed, stating they did not want to put the victims through the agony of 
testifying at two trials. But in court papers, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher 
W. Evans noted Tuesday that the case has already been postponed too many times. 
</P>
<P>
Hindergardt and Gionis will be tried on eight counts: conspiracy to commit 
assault, assault with a knife, two counts of assault with a gun, two counts of 
false imprisonment, one count of witness intimidation and one count of 
residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Each could be sentenced to as much as 12 years in prison if convicted on all 
counts. Gionis, who is still practicing medicine, is free on $100,000 bail. 
Hindergardt remains in Orange County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail. JERRY

TRUSTEES, TEACHERS OK A NEW CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a bitter contract dispute that spanned nearly a year, the school board 
of the Huntington Beach City School District and the teachers union Tuesday 
reached an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
District trustees voted unanimously Tuesday to ratify the contract which it 
tentatively had approved on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, union President Sharon Boudreau announced that union members 
also approved the pact during voting that began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, teachers will receive a 7% pay raise retroactive to July 
1, larger steps in the salary schedule and full health coverage, all of which 
the union demanded throughout negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The votes signal an end to a teachers' protest which affected eight elementary 
and middle schools with a total of 5,400 students. After months of stalled 
talks, the teachers picketed, rallied parents to their side and boycotted 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
This agreement comes just in time for talks to begin on the 1990-91 contract. 
Leaders from both sides said Tuesday they are hopeful that the new bargaining 
talks, scheduled to begin next month, will be devoid of any lingering animosity 
and can be wrapped up within six months. 
</P>
<P>
However, district and union officials acknowledged that specifics of a new pact 
cannot be discussed in detail until the current state budget is finalized and 
next year's health-benefit costs are determined. 
</P>
<P>
The union issued its latest contract proposal on the new bargaining talks in 
February, which calls for a 12% pay raise and improvements in the bargaining 
process. The district's proposal is due May 1. JOHN PENNER

3 NEW MEMBERS END COUNCIL'S STALEMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three new City Council members were sworn into office on Tuesday. Their arrival 
will end months of deadlocks that divided a four-member council. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Ann Pontious, a travel agency owner, Jim Potts, a police sergeant, and 
Charles E. Puckett, a district sales manager, fill seats on the council that 
were previously occupied by Ursula E. Kennedy, John Kelly and Ronald B. 
Hoesterey. 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey resigned in November, leaving the two years of his office that will 
be completed by Potts. Kennedy chose not to run again and Kelly was ousted in 
last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
The new council voted unanimously to retain Richard B. Edgar as mayor and chose 
Pontious to replace Kennedy as mayor pro tem. Edgar has held the post since 
November and several other times.

APPLICATION SENT FOR MEASLES FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County health officials Tuesday hurriedly met the deadline for applying 
for state funds to try to limit the spread of a measles epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
They sent their application early Tuesday for $150,000 in state funds to the 
state Department of Health Services' immunization division in Berkeley. And, 
county public health director L. Rex Ehling said, "the state agrees the grant 
application is accepted." 
</P>
<P>
The county's action resolved a mix-up that occurred late Monday when a state 
official said applications were supposed to be mailed Monday and were due in 
his office no later than Wednesday. Ehling, meanwhile, said he was told the 
county had until the end of April to apply. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the state's immunization services confirmed Tuesday that 
Orange County's application was accepted and that it will compete with those of 
at least 16 other counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any problem. Orange County has done an excellent job" in preparing 
its submission, said John Danijski, assistant chief of California's 
immunization program. 
</P>
<P>
Danijski noted that that there was not enough money to fund every proposal, but 
he declined to say if Orange County was one of several counties asked to trim 
its grant request. 
</P>
<P>
The new state funds come as California is experiencing the greatest outbreak of 
measles in more than a decade. So far this year, 1,800 people -- 204 in Orange 
County -- have contracted measles and an additional 24, including two babies 
from Orange County, have died of complications from measles. 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials like Ehling say the current outbreak of measles is "a 
great setback" in the effort to eradicate measles around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials are hoping the state funds will let them expand their 
immunization clinics by adding evening sessions, educate physicians about 
preventing measles exposures in their waiting rooms and continue to alert the 
public about the need for vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
Ehling last week declared a "state of emergency" in Orange County because of 
measles. That declaration was necessary for a county to be eligible for some of 
the $1.2-million appropriation. Although the County Board of Supervisors is not 
expected to consider the emergency declaration until April 24, state officials 
said they will accept Orange County's application this week anyway. LANIE JONES

COUNTY CONSIDERING BUSINESS LICENSE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday directed its staff to study the 
possibility of establishing business license fees in unincorporated areas of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Several supervisors, however, warned that such fees could incur the wrath of 
the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, whose members would likely bear the 
brunt of any licensing requirements. Even though many cities in Orange County 
already require business licenses, the county has never demanded them. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth, who is seeking reelection in June, agreed to let 
the study go forward but strenuously objected to what he called a "business 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, in my opinion, that is a wrong idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Planning Commission has recommended the study, arguing that 
business licenses in the unincorporated areas would give the Environmental 
Management Agency the ability to keep better tabs on development. In some 
areas, officials said, the commission may approve a particular store, only to 
have it later close and be replaced by one with a different focus. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a dry cleaners may close and be replaced by a restaurant. The 
restaurant would have a greater impact on parking, but the county does not now 
have the ability to monitor and prevent such turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden you have more traffic," said John B. Buzas, the county's 
manager of current planning. "We have to have a better way of monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
Improved monitoring would also give the county the ability to better track 
hazardous materials, officials said. Some materials are inappropriate for areas 
such as retail malls, but their presence is hard to monitor when buildings 
change hands. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which is scheduled for completion within six months, will review 
business license programs in Orange County's cities, said Tom Mathews, the 
county's director of planning. Even if a business license program is adopted -- 
and Mathews stressed that that is by no means a certainty -- it would not be 
intended as a way of generating revenue. It would go only toward paying 
monitoring costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who pulled the item off the supervisors' consent 
agenda so they could discuss it before voting on it, sympathized with the need 
for better monitoring but also echoed many of Roth's concerns. Vasquez asked 
that local chambers of commerce be consulted in the course of studying the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the supervisors' concern, however, reaction from chamber officials was 
tempered. Lucien D. Truhill, the county chamber's president and chief executive 
officer, said his organization would gladly cooperate in any study 
investigating the fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'd be interested in appointing some sort of committee," Truhill 
said, adding that while business licenses are never liked by companies, they 
rarely amount to a major burden. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Tuesday, the board approved an increase in the amount of money 
it sets aside to distribute food stamps, a move required by the growing number 
of county residents seeking federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Although food stamps are paid for by the federal government, the county assumes 
25% of the cost of administering the program locally. Tuesday's vote increases 
the distribution budget for the stamps by $23,000 for the remaining three 
months of the current fiscal year. JIM NEWTON

IT'S AS EASY AS SPELLING SUPERFICIES

<TEXT>
<P>
John Yun was bombarded Tuesday night with words like hamotzi, but it was the 
word superficies that propelled him to victory in a countywide spelling 
competition for junior high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Yun, a seventh-grader at the Douglas MacArthur Middle School in Santa Ana, 
studied for months to prepare for the Orange County Spelling Competition. He 
advances to the national spelling bee championship in Washington on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
Yun came to the United States from Korea nine years ago and said he learned 
English by watching television. He attributed his success to "studying real 
hard and being committed." 
</P>
<P>
The runner-up was Scott Peterson, a 13-year-old spelling bee veteran from Cerro 
Villa Middle School in Villa Park. Forty-two children from throughout the 
county competed in the contest, which was held in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's competition had two parts, a written exam followed by a traditional 
spelling bee in which students had to spell the words outloud. 
</P>
<P>
The contestants busily studied until the contest began -- jotting notes, 
shuffling index cards and quizzing one another until the last possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not really fun," said Eric Kim, 14, a seventh-grader at Walker Junior 
High School in La Palma. "I guess I like the challenge. Sometimes, it seems 
like a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
Most students said they spent only a few hours preparing for the competition. 
Peterson and a classmate -- Joe Mullin, 13, of Orange -- said they studied for 
about three hours, mostly on the advanced words listed in a spelling bee 
vocabulary pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important not to overcomplicate the words, especially at the beginning," 
Peterson said, remembering one girl who lost a contest last year by spelling 
blot b-l-o-u-g-h-t. "The final round is where you get the complex words." 
</P>
<P>
Mullin said most of the words used in the bee are rarely seen "in real life. 
Like cleavability -- c'mon, who uses that?" 
</P>
<P>
Because the students don't have to know the definitions of the words, they 
sometimes have fun imagining them. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch out, or I'll oologize your kilster," Mullin joked. "I don't know what 
that means at all." 
</P>
<P>
Every student at the bee had war stories to swap. Peterson, for example, 
remembered the time he misspelled skedaddle. But his friend Mullin added, "That 
was a cheap shot, because it was slang. Those are the ones that really tick me 
off." SHELBY GRAD

OAKLAND SCORES TWICE IN 12TH TO BEAT ANGELS

The Angels knew for whom the rally bells tolled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With 34,370 fans at Anaheim Stadium ringing the souvenir bells they had 
received upon arrival, the Angels rallied from a three-run deficit in the sixth 
inning on Dante Bichette's third home run of the season to pull even with the 
Oakland A's at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
But Oakland scored two runs in the 12th to win, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mark Langston, who pitched seven hitless innings against Seattle 
last Wednesday in his previous start, did not approach that form Tuesday. He 
gave up seven hits, including home runs to Carney Lansford and Mark McGwire in 
the third inning, and left after six innings. The Angels rallied in the bottom 
of that inning to tie the score, ensuring that Langston would not be the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with four earned runs and made a throwing error on a 
pickoff play to set up the fifth Oakland run. He struck out six and walked two 
while making 105 pitches, a hefty total for so short a stint. He made 98 over 
seven innings last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by the Angels would have given them a 6-2 record and equaled their 
best starts. They had 6-2 records after eight games in 1970 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
A's starter Mike Moore, once a teammate of Langston's in Seattle, gave up three 
runs Tuesday. Reliever Todd Burns gave up the three-run home run to Bichette, 
who leads the Angels in home runs with three. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what Langston would do for an encore was answered quickly. As 
during his no-hitter, he walked the leadoff hitter, Rickey Henderson. But the 
pattern was broken when the second hitter, Carney Lansford, rapped a single to 
right. Langston got out of the inning with the help of an excellent pickoff 
throw to second that caught Rickey Henderson leaning, but he couldn't escape 
the third inning unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The A's did their damage with two outs. Third baseman Carney Lansford powered a 
1-and-0 pitch a few rows into the left-field seats, and Jose Canseco followed 
with a shot up the middle that blew past Langston's upreached glove and into 
center field. McGwire followed by reaching down for Langston's first pitch and 
slamming a home run deep to left field. It was his third home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston did recover his poise, striking out two in the fourth inning for a 
total of five. He had struck out three Mariners in his seven hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner 
walked and scored when Chili Davis blasted a 2-and-0 pitch 420 feet to center 
field that pulled the Angels to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Langston seemed to settle into a groove in the middle innings. He struck out 
the last two batters of the fourth and first man in the fifth for a total of 
six strikeouts before Rickey Henderson bounced a ground-rule double down the 
left-field line. Canseco followed with a double off the wall in left, scoring 
Henderson for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The A's padded that to 5-2 in the sixth, without benefit of a hit. Dave 
Henderson drew a leadoff walk and went to third when Langston threw away an 
intended pickoff throw to first. Henderson held at third on Terry Steinbach's 
grounder to third, but with the squeeze play on, Lance Blankenship laid down a 
perfect bunt up the first-base line that allowed Henderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels then tied the score with one swing of Bichette's bat. Johnny Ray 
beat out a grounder to third for an infield hit and Joyner barely missed a home 
run, sending center fielder Dave Henderson crashing into the wall to make the 
catch. That was all for Moore, who was relieved by right-hander Todd Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Burns threw four straight balls to Davis, who had switched to the left side of 
the plate. That brought up Bichette, a right-handed hitter, who slammed a 
3-and-1 pitch over the center field fence. The drive was measured at 422 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa said his club wasn't taking this series against the 
Angels lightly. "You can't waste a golden opportunity to take your best shot," 
he said. "It's kind of unusual because we play them two and then don't see them 
for three months (July 23-26 at Oakland). We can't waste these games." 
</P>
<P>
His team didn't waste any games in the first week of the season, winning five 
of six. "The truth is, we had a solid first week," he said. "The starting 
pitching, relief pitching, hitting. The only problem is that it was last week, 
not this week." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa also said his team is aware of the defensive exploits of Angel 
outfielder Dante Bichette, who had five assists last week, but isn't about to 
change its strategy. "We know he throws well. We knew that last season," he 
said. "Still, our style is to push. If there's a guy on second base and there's 
a single to left field, unless the ball is in the guy's hand, we're going to 
send him. You don't take foolish chances, though." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson's first-inning walk was the 1,000th of his career, fifth among 
active players. Dwight Evans, Willie Randolph, Keith Hernandez and Brian 
Downing are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill 
Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip. Trainer Ned Bergert said Schroeder 
(sore right elbow) is throwing again and is feeling better. However, Schroeder 
will still see Dr. Paul Jacobs, who surgically repaired his elbow in 1985, 
Friday. Schofield (strained right hamstring) is running and hitting but not 
taking grounders. McClure (inflamed left elbow) is undergoing therapy to 
strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels set a club record with sacrifice hits in five consecutive games 
before Tuesday. . . . Every player on the 27-man roster except Sherman Corbett 
had played before Tuesday night.

ANGELS' POWER SPOILS MOORE'S NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Before it had been decided precisely whose bash that was at Anaheim Stadium 
Tuesday night, the gathering seemed mostly to belong to Oakland pitcher Mike 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
That was because the Angels belonged to Mike Moore. 
</P>
<P>
It was a matter of the two parties following form. Moore was 5-0 against the 
Angels in his past six starts, and hadn't lost to them since 1987, when he was 
a Seattle Mariner. 
</P>
<P>
But the sixth inning came, and form ceased to function. The Angels chased 
Moore, and in an inning filled with twists, scored three runs that tied the 
score, 5-5. It stayed that way until the 12th, when Oakland scored twice to 
win, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
During the first five innings Tuesday, Moore gave up only two hits. One was a 
second-inning single by Lance Parrish, who was stranded. The other was more 
substantial, a two-run homer in the fourth by Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Moore might not have had the Angels in his pocket, but thanks to his teammates' 
offense, including home runs by Carney Lansford and Mark McGwire, he had a 5-2 
lead. For the Athletics, that's the comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore's outing began to unravel on an infield hit, of all things -- by 
Johnny Ray, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, it is worth remembering, is the Angel second baseman whose speed and range 
have been criticized. Ray found himself benched late last season after failing 
to run out an infield pop, prompting Manager Doug Rader to criticize him for 
lack of hustle. 
</P>
<P>
Ray led off the sixth, and hit a deep grounder down the third-base line to 
Carney Lansford, who backhanded it and made a one-bounce throw to first. Ray 
beat it. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up Joyner, who flied to deep center. Dave Henderson sprinted to 
the wall, and made a backhanded catch against it. 
</P>
<P>
No damage done, but the A's had seen enough, bringing on Todd Burns to relieve 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Burns promptly walked Chili Davis on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette, a right-handed hitter, was due up next to face Burns, also a 
right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Pure theory might dictate using a left-handed pinch-hitter. Pure theory 
wouldn't recall that Bichette won a 12-inning game against Minnesota for the 
Angels Saturday with a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Rader did recall, and Bichette came to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The count went to 2-0, and the scoreboard flashed "Ring Those Bells." The Angel 
fans rattled their rally bells, an Anaheim Stadium giveaway Tuesday whose sound 
had heretofore been only clatter. 
</P>
<P>
The count went to 3-1. Bichette sent the next pitch to center, sending 
Henderson sprinting back again. He didn't have a chance, as the ball cleared 
the wall perhaps 10 feet to the left of the 404-foot mark in center, tying the 
score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
The fans rang their bells, and the A's had their bells rung. 
</P>
<P>
It was anybody's bash again.

MATER DEI'S KOBATA NOW WATCHING HER STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mater Dei High School softball pitcher Terri Kobata hasn't pitched in more than 
two weeks because of a strained shoulder, but what distresses her more than the 
injury is being penalized for illegal pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Kobata was called for crow hopping and leaping 11 times in the championship 
game of the Cypress tournament, which Mater Dei won, 5-1, last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt confused," said Kobata, a sophomore. "I didn't know what to do because 
I had a drag on a lot of the pitches they called. I was just getting upset in 
my head, but I couldn't let it affect me." 
</P>
<P>
Crow hopping is when a pitcher plants her pivot foot a second time and fails to 
drag her toe across the ground as soon as it leaves the pitching rubber. If the 
toe does not drag the ground as soon as it leaves the rubber, it is considered 
an extra step, and the pitch is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
This season, umpires are trying to crack down on crow hopping and leaping, 
which have been illegal since 1976. Kobata was singled out in the umpires' 
meeting before the tournament, said Cathy Quesnell, who coaches Mater Dei, the 
county's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
"She hadn't been called all season, then all of a sudden she gets to the 
Cypress tournament and the umpire is the focus of the game," Quesnell said. 
"The parents were irate. Here we are in the championship game and we weren't 
even happy we won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the game. We looked at the plate umpire and he called a ball or a 
strike. Then we looked at the first-base umpire to see if he called an illegal 
pitch. It was just ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just exhausted we had to go through that. It wasn't fair. I don't know 
if the umpires misinterpreted the rule or if she did it that badly. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first game that she (was) called quite a bit. I mean 11 times is 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Kobata and her father, Howard, who coaches fast-pitch softball in the summer, 
say umpires are misinterpreting Kobata's technique. 
</P>
<P>
In the Canyon Tournament of Champions, in a loss to Thousand Oaks, Kobata 
pitched in the 5-A championship game and wasn't called once for an illegal 
pitch, Quesnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Kobata admits she used to routinely leap on many of her pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I had taken a long break (from playing softball) one summer and when I came 
back I just had it," she said. "It is like a natural thing to me now, and 
nobody said anything to me until this year." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Cypress game, Kobata, her father and her pitching coach, Ernie 
Parker, have been working to eliminate the leap from Kobata's technique. 
</P>
<P>
Parker makes Kobata dig a hole in front of the mound and put her toe in it, so 
when she pitches, her heel is on the pitching rubber and her toe is in the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
"So when I push off from the rubber it is easier for me to keep my foot on the 
ground and to have a drag mark for the umpire to see," Kobata said. 
</P>
<P>
Kobata puts fresh dirt over her drag mark after each pitch so officials can see 
a new impression in the dirt after each pitch. Though some umpires try to work 
with her during this forced transition period, warning her when she is getting 
close to crow hopping, Kobata says they do not accept her drag mark as proof 
that she did not take an extra step. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest complaint with the umpires is that true, every once and a while a 
pitcher will crow hop," Howard Kobata said. "But if a pitch is called illegal 
and a pitcher is cleaning off her mark after every single pitch, why are the 
umpires not acknowledging that? There is physical evidence right there. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitchers right now are at a disadvantage because they have no recourse. 
When they clean off their drag mark after every single pitch, and they cannot 
get a reversal on a call, I am saying that is unfair."

UMPIRES ARE PUTTING THEIR FOOT DOWN ON CROW HOPPING; 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL: GAME OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE EXTRA STEPS AND LEAPS 
TAKEN BY HIGH SCHOOL PITCHERS. 
</P>

<P>
Like the Lindy Hop and the Bunny Hop before it, the crow hop is becoming a fad. 
The only difference is, the crow hop is not a dance. It is some fancy, 
against-the-rules footwork used by some softball pitchers to make their pitches 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
This high school softball season, the National Federation of High School Assns. 
-- which governs high school sports -- has emphasized to umpires that the crow 
hop must be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The crow hop always has been against federation rules for high school softball, 
but enforcement in California has been haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem was the fact that many of the better high school 
pitchers played -- and some umpires worked -- summer fast-pitch softball, which 
is governed by the Amateur Softball Assn. Under ASA rules, a similar technique 
called the leap, is legal. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer competition, umpires rarely, if ever, called the crow hop, 
which resembles the leap. 
</P>
<P>
Because it's difficult for many coaches, umpires, pitchers and fans to 
distinguish between the crow hop and the leap, the crow hop -- though against 
the rules -- has maintained a foothold on many high school pitching mounds. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, in an effort to eliminate the leap, the ASA changed its rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The (old) rule would have been OK as written before if umpires would have 
called the illegal pitch (the leap), but they wouldn't," ASA's Southern 
California Commissioner Bobby Jordan said. "Now all of a sudden you had people 
flying at you and by the time they got through, they were outside the 
(pitching) circle and on top of the batters. Someone got upset and decided we 
had to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the ASA rule change. Now it doesn't matter if umpires can distinguish 
between the leap and the crow hop. Both are illegal in ASA and national 
federation softball. 
</P>
<P>
And umpires are cracking down on both illegal techniques, though they are not 
doing so uniformly. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterfinals of the Orange Glen Tournament in Escondido, Willa Parchen, 
who pitches for the county's third-ranked team, Marina, was called 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
In the championship of the Cypress Tournament last month, Terri Kobata, a 
sophomore who pitches for top-ranked Mater Dei, was called 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth-ranked Kennedy's season-opener against Cypress, umpires called Cheryl 
Longeway numerous times. But in the championship of the Woodbridge tournament, 
Longeway was not called once for an illegal pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the years you just kind of get out in front and (the crow hop) just 
happens," said Longeway, who has been working on changing her style. "It is a 
bad habit, but the umpires don't call it, so you just go ahead and do it, and 
it's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wilhem, the national federation's softball rules interpreter for 
California, says he has been trying to get California umpires to conform for 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a lot of different rules interpreters within the Southern Section. I 
think they all instructed their umpires to call it. Whether the umpires called 
it or not, I don't know. I know it wasn't called as much as it should have 
been. And I know it wasn't called as much as it has been this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have finally gotten through to the umpires is that ASA made 
a major change so everybody has to do it the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Just what are the crow hop and the leap? Because they are sometimes hard to 
identify and distinguish, the national federation produced a tape -- "The 1990 
National Federation Pitching Film." For $24.95, coaches, players and umpires 
can get a slow-motion lesson in the do's and don'ts of softball pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Crow hopping occurs when a pitcher uses her power leg to push off the mound, 
then replants that leg to push forward again before releasing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Leaping occurs when a pitcher jumps up or forward in the air without driving a 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
Basically the pitchers must make sure their back foot keeps in contact with, or 
drags, the ground after it leaves the pitching rubber. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty is similar to a balk in baseball. In baseball, the pitch is ruled a 
no-pitch and the runners advance a base. In softball, the pitch is ruled a ball 
and runners advance. 
</P>
<P>
The hop and the leap have been illegal since softball became a national 
federation high school sport in 1976, but they didn't appear in the rule book 
by name until 1988, said Brad Rumble, editor of the national federation 
softball rules book. 
</P>
<P>
As the schools developed programs and pitchers went on to play summer ball, the 
techniques crept into high school softball and developed names of their own, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We addressed (illegal pitches) in our first videotape in 1984," Rumble said. 
"In 1988 we decided to go ahead and list those techniques in the book just to 
make sure everybody knew they were illegal, so there wouldn't be any confusion 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to pin down why a technique that has been illegal since the national 
federation sanctioned softball in 1976 is still around. 
</P>
<P>
Especially since most pitching coaches say they don't teach it; many players 
say they didn't study it, they just picked it up like a bad habit; and many 
pitchers don't believe it gives them any special advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Ron LeFebvre says the crow hop does give a pitcher a definite advantage, but he 
is not an advocate of the technique. 
</P>
<P>
He heads Ron LeFebvre's Schools of Baseball and Softball in Orange and Laguna 
Hills, the largest pitching school in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The hop increases the arm speed of a pitcher," said LeFebvre, who has a degree 
in kinesiology -- the study of motion. "The average arm speed of a pitcher is 
about 120 miles per hour and the crow hop can increase it to 220 m.p.h. The arm 
speed is faster. The landing is closer. It is like taking a (baseball) pitcher 
and saying, 'All right. We are going to throw all the guys from the Dodgers at 
54 feet instead of 60 feet.' " 
</P>
<P>
LeFebvre says students have left him for other pitching coaches because he 
refuses to teach the crow hop. He refuses because he believes its benefits are 
short-lived and its detrimental effects can last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I have noticed throughout the last three years is that, because of 
the crow hop, there has been at least 100% more injury to female ballplayers," 
he said. "There is probably not a sound crow hop pitcher around by the time 
they get to be a senior. They have an injury of some kind -- from shoulder to 
back to knee, to lower back to a growth plate injury in younger pitchers, to a 
wrist injury -- because of the explosiveness the crow hop area increases." 
</P>
<P>
LeFebvre says uninformed parents and unscrupulous, unlicensed pitching coaches 
are the cause for the proliferation of the hop. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to win this year and you don't have any desire to worry about the 
kids next year, what difference does it make?" he said. "(The crow hop) is like 
taking a shot in the arm. The pitcher will be good maybe for a year at most and 
then they come down." 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Parker, another Orange County pitching coach, said he has not seen those 
injuries. "I don't think it is going to get you hurt," Parker said. "I don't 
teach the crow hop. I would like for all of my pitchers to stop it, but I don't 
insist that they do as long as they are effective and are legal, as long as 
they aren't getting called too much." 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches see the rule change as one more attempt to reduce the dominance of 
the pitchers and make the game more exciting at the collegiate level. The first 
attempt was in 1988 when four-year colleges moved outfield fences in and moved 
the pitchers to 43 feet from 40, ASA commissioner Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some coaches are saying we need more excitement in the game, the pitchers are 
dominating," Parker said. He has even heard of an umpire who narrows his strike 
zone with a good pitcher to give the batter a better opportunity to hit the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"But pitchers take lessons year-round and practice year-round," Parker said. 
"The hitters don't. What they are doing is anything they can to help the 
pitchers. They are handicapping the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
But not enforcing rules against the crow hop and leap could be even more of a 
handicap for players who plan to pitch in college. 
</P>
<P>
Collegiate freshman pitchers already have to adjust to throwing from 43 feet 
instead of 40 feet. They also have to have both feet on the rubber at the start 
of their pitch, which differs from high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't let my girls crow hop because they'll go to college and get their 
heads knocked off," said Robert Melendrez, who coaches the Southern California 
Blasters, the Laguna Hills-based 16-and-under ASA team. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Wehren, a Woodbridge graduate who starts for San Jose State, trains with 
LeFebvre. She had little trouble making the transition in college because she 
did not crow hop in high school. She said the little extra speed a pitcher gets 
from crow hopping is not of much use in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed is not really effective at this level unless you're Michele Granger or 
somebody like that. It is more spin and stuff like that. I personally get more 
leg power from leaving my feet on the rubber, just staying right there and 
driving my leg off the rubber." 
</P>
<P>
Wehren has not been called for the crow hop nor has she seen another college 
pitcher called for it. 
</P>
<P>
The willy-nilly enforcement of the rule has upset some coaches. "I think it is 
like traffic cops," Mater Dei Coach Cathy Quesnell said. "They go in and have a 
meeting and say, we've got to crack down on something to get these drivers. And 
some are going to do it and just be real forceful about it, some will only do 
it if it is really obvious, and some just aren't going to do it, and that is 
basically how the umpires have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Canyon Coach Lance Eddy: "Either get the rule out of there or if they are 
going to have the rule, call it." 
</P>
<P>
As instructional chairman for the Orange County Softball Umpires Assn., John 
Hill tells his umpires to call the leap and crow hop. "I tell them that they 
have to use their judgment, and if they don't call it, that is their problem," 
Hill said. "But the rule is there and it needs to be called." 
</P>
<P>
Hill says there is a parallel between the enforcement of the illegal pitch rule 
and the enforcement of the basketball coaching box rule. 
</P>
<P>
The coaching box rule states that when not seated, coaches can only stand 
within a certain box, and then only to instruct the team or cheer 
spontaneously, but not to harass the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some officials who were looking for it, and then other officials 
who would not call it," Hill said. "Some umpires won't call it if both pitchers 
are doing it because they figure what's the advantage? Unless the other coach 
complains or brings it to their attention, they won't call it." 
</P>
<P>
Rumble said he has not yet received any telephone calls or complaints about 
spotty enforcement in California. 
</P>
<P>
But if there are problems, it will appear on questionnaires that 
representatives fill out at the federation's June rules meeting and they would 
be addressed then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches have a responsibility in this whole thing, too," Rumble said. "If they 
know the rules, they should be teaching the kids to pitch according to the 
rules, too. If umpires called it like they were supposed to be calling it, that 
would help eliminate the problem also. It is a team effort so to speak. But you 
have to recognize the problem first. We have take some measure to recognize and 
correct the problem and that is what it will take."

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK: BOYD GETS ONLY A PART OF HIS WISH LIST FOR CHAPMAN 
BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first full season of recruiting at Chapman College, Coach Bob Boyd hoped 
to get help inside and outside for his basketball team. Last Wednesday, the 
first day players could sign national letters of intent, he got one but not the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman signed two 6-foot-6 community college forwards, Alan Schlines of Orange 
Coast and Chris Warmerdam of Cabrillo College in Aptos, Calif. Both averaged 14 
points and nine rebounds and should help spell the Panthers' inside starters, 
Rog Middleton and Frantz Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have helped ourselves," Boyd said. "We needed some support in there 
with Roger and Frantz, but we do need to get a couple of perimeter people." 
</P>
<P>
One player who got away was Cypress College's Vince Hizon, the Orange Empire 
Conference player of the year. Boyd said Hizon, a guard/forward who averaged 
15.2 points, had considered Chapman before choosing Boise State, a Division I 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd hopes to add two more players. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting at the Division II level has been a new experience for Boyd, who 
coached 20 seasons at Division I schools (Seattle, USC and Mississippi State). 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a puzzle to solve," he said. The situation at Chapman is trickier 
than most because the school offers only 10 scholarships -- two less than the 
Division II maximum. And as the only private school in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn., it has the highest tuition costs in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have the opportunity to split up scholarships like a lot of 
the state schools in our league. You just don't find anybody in a position, 
financially, to not go on full scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Job searching: Chapman has four finalists its search for an athletic director: 
David Adams, a former athletic administrator at the University of Akron; Joseph 
Biedron, athletic director of Monmouth College in West Long Branch, N.J.; Dave 
Currey, an assistant football coach at UCLA who was football coach at Cal State 
Long Beach and athletic director and football coach at Cincinnati, and Kay Don, 
the senior women's athletic administrator at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The finalists will be interviewed Monday, and college administrators hope to 
make a decision by May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Another search: Christ College Irvine administrators want to hire a men's 
basketball coach by next Tuesday. The final two of eight candidates will be 
interviewed this week. Estancia High basketball Coach Tim O'Brien, will be 
interviewed today. 
</P>
<P>
Hard sell: Advancing to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
basketball tournament last month in Kansas City, Mo., for the first time hasn't 
yet proved to be a boon for recruiting for the Southern California College 
men's team. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think it might help," said SCC Coach Bill Reynolds, who 
half-jokingly added: "I told my wife to keep the phone lines open. . . . But 
they aren't knocking our doors down." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said he isn't sure how helpful the postseason success will be for 
recruiting in the long run, but hopes it will at least ensure that more players 
will have heard of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Staying hot: SCC's baseball team dropped out of a tie for first in the Golden 
State Athletic Conference after losing to front-runner Cal Baptist, 6-5, last 
week, but catcher Denny Berni continued his stay among the conference's hitting 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Berni went five for seven with five runs batted in, raising his batting average 
to .418. He has nine home runs and 40 RBIs. In conference games, he is batting 
a conference-leading .531. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
High school softball pitcher Laurie Bauer of Butte, Mont., signed a letter of 
intent to play for Chapman. . . . Heather Mead, a Mater Dei High graduate and 
Saddleback College volleyball player, will attend Chapman, as will Andre 
Fahamivu (Faha) Banks, a 5-foot-6 point guard on the Santa Barbara City College 
women's basketball team. . . . Christ College Irvine has hired Edward Brown to 
coach the men's soccer team. Brown, who played soccer at Pacific Lutheran in 
Tacoma, Wash., has coached a number of youth clubs in the Pacific Northwest.

KEATING ASKS TO GET LINCOLN S&amp;L BACK FOR TAXPAYERS' SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Keating, the former chairman of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn., asked a federal judge Tuesday to let him operate the thrift under 
judicial supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin that he could invest "every 
ounce of my energy" but no cash into the Irvine, Calif., thrift if it is 
returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
Why no cash? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely broke, as is all of my family," Keating said. "We're absolutely 
broke as a result of this debacle." 
</P>
<P>
"My question," Sporkin asked, "is how can someone say, 'Here, take it back,' 
and expose $4 billion in depositors' money to someone's promise?" 
</P>
<P>
Keating replied that he could save taxpayers' money by operating Lincoln's 
assets instead of liquidating them as part of the government's thrift bailout 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Something else has to be tried. Something has to make history," he said. "You 
always look back in the court of history. Here you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange took place during a pretrial hearing on a government motion 
seeking to dismiss a lawsuit Keating filed last May seeking the return of 
Lincoln, which was seized by the government last April. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have estimated that protecting Lincoln's depositors from losses 
could cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion, a figure Keating disputes. The 
government also has filed a $1-billion fraud and racketeering suit against the 
Arizona executive. 
</P>
<P>
Keating told Sporkin that with his expertise, combined with the talents of 
former Lincoln employees, the thrift could be operated profitably, preventing 
any losses to depositors. He submitted a package of resumes of former employees 
for Sporkin's review. 
</P>
<P>
"The bondholders would recover, the taxpayers would have no loss, we could 
outperform anybody else with the assets we've assembled," Keating said. "I 
think it would be great to return Lincoln without any liquidation." 
</P>
<P>
Keating's proposal came near the close of his fifth day on the witness stand 
and moments before his attorneys rested their case. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Keating's attorneys produced a government memo showing that 
federal examiners miscalculated Lincoln's net worth by $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Lincoln said the memo is significant because regulators ordered 
Lincoln to operate under government-issued supervisory directives after finding 
the thrift to be undercapitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The directives limited the types of transactions the thrift could make. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, dated Feb. 17, 1989, less than two months before the government 
seized the Irvine thrift, was addressed to the regulators in charge of 
overseeing the examination of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I find this error, if verified, most distressing -- not because it 
changes my view of Lincoln and what has and will have to be done, but because 
of how Lincoln will use it," wrote Alvin Smuzynski, a senior regulatory 
official with the Office of Regulatory Affairs, a division of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kevin O'Connell, who supervised the government's examination 
of Lincoln, discounted the memo as being based on "first blush" numbers and 
said the mathematical error was never verified. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no mistake by examiners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gentleman either can't add or he's a liar," responded Keating outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's attorneys also produced a 1985 letter from Alan Greenspan, then a 
private economist and now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urging 
regulators to grant Lincoln an exemption from stricter direct-investment rules. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan wrote that denial of an exemption "would work a serious and unfair 
hardship on an association that has, through its skill and expertise, 
transformed itself into a financially strong institution that presents no 
foreseeable risk to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp." 
</P>
<P>
Keating's attorneys attribute the demise of Lincoln to a "vendetta" by 
regulators incensed over Keating's opposition to the direct-investment rule.

FDIC SOUNDS WARNING ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: SEVERAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE HIGH UP ON A LIST OF POTENTIAL 
TROUBLE SPOTS. ANAHEIM IS AN AREA OF SPECIAL CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Commercial real estate markets in several major California cities, including 
Los Angeles and Anaheim, may be headed for trouble if lending excesses are not 
curbed, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. indicated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman released a list of 40 large American cities, ranked 
according to risk, that is supposed to serve as an "early warning system" for 
regulators and lenders on where commercial real estate loan problems are 
brewing. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have lenders know more and move quickly when supply and demand 
appear to be getting seriously out of balance," Seidman said in a speech in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman cited two cities -- Nashville and Anaheim -- as places where heavy 
office construction is occurring against a backdrop of high vacancy rates and 
low job growth. "Does this mean that Nashville and Anaheim are in for real 
estate crashes?" Seidman asked. "We don't know, but we'd like to know." 
</P>
<P>
Regulators are concerned about the example of Phoenix, a city that four years 
ago was a boom town but now is in the throes of a banking and real estate 
collapse. "They're looking at the Phoenixes of four years ago," said one 
commercial real estate analyst. "One hiccup and they go boom." 
</P>
<P>
Problem real estate development loans have become a major stain on the nation's 
banking system. They were the major reason why Congress had to bail out the 
savings and loan industry last year and are becoming a major blot on the bottom 
lines of the nation's major commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's remarks are part of growing chorus of skeptics who feel that 
California may not be able to escape the real estate slump that has affected 
other parts of the country, such as Arizona and New England. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a tough call at this point," said Alex Sheshunoff, a banking 
consultant from Austin, Tex., who noted that current defense cutbacks do not 
bode well for the future of the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the state still has a large migration of people coming in 
from other states, which does bode well. "A strong economy can cover up a whole 
lot of problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most bankers and real estate experts in California still maintain that the 
commercial real estate markets are not headed for major trouble. "There is 
plenty of demand for almost any kind of space," said James Didion, chief 
executive of Coldwell Banker Commercial, a real estate brokerage based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to regulatory statistics, San Jose and Anaheim had commercial office 
vacancy rates of more than 20%, while Los Angeles had a vacancy rate of 18.4%. 
Anything above 16% is high and anything above 19% is very high, said Sanford 
Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego for KPMG Peat Marwick, the 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's remarks are almost sure to aggravate growing tensions between 
regulators and commercial bankers. Many commercial bankers already feel that 
regulators have cracked down far too hard and indiscriminately on real estate 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the regulators are part of the problem," Goodkin said. "It's almost as 
if they want to force bankers completely out of the real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no changes, at least in official policy," replied Roger 
Watson, research director at the FDIC. "There is no evidence that the exams are 
tougher today then they were yesterday or than they were 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman also released a list showing where residential housing prices are 
growing the fastest, which he also considers a danger sign. They're growing 
fastest in Seattle and Honolulu, followed by Sacramento, San Jose, San Diego, 
Los Angeles and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasing prices often trigger more development, which at some point in the 
future might lead to an excess of supply, and lower prices," the FDIC chairman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman also compiled another separate list of 40 cities where construction 
lending is growing the fastest and problem real estate loans are unusually 
high. Orlando and Miami in Florida lead that list, with Riverside, Los Angeles 
and Anaheim ranked Nos. 9, 10 and 11, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman made his remarks at a seminar in Dallas sponsored by the Resolution 
Trust Corp., the agency established by Congress last year to sell the assets of 
failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, who is also chairman of the RTC, noted a few facts to drive home his 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1986, bank assets have grown 12%. Bank real estate loans, however, have 
grown four times as much -- 48%. Unfortunately, nonperforming real estate loans 
have grown even more -- 54%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's remarks also coincided with another report released Tuesday that 
blamed depressed real estate markets for a sharp drop in commercial-bank income 
in 1989. Bank income fell 34% to $15.8 billion in 1989, according to Sheshunoff 
Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
The profits were "disappointing," Alex Sheshunoff said, "but hardly surprising 
in view of the speculative excesses building up in the real estate sector, 
particularly in the Northeast." 
</P>
<P>
THE 20 RISKIEST MARKETS 
</P>
<P>
Cities are ranked according to a weighting system that takes all indicators 
into account. California cities appear in boldface.

JAMES FLANIGAN: JAPAN'S AMBITION VS. BOEING'S ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A huge -- but shortsighted -- sigh of relief greeted Boeing's announcement last 
weekend that Japanese subcontractors would have less participation in its new 
jetliner than was previously suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy 
Industries will work on 20% of the new plane, which will be dubbed the 777 if 
Boeing gets a couple of big orders and decides to go ahead. And that's more 
work than those same subcontractors have had on the 767 and other Boeing jets. 
</P>
<P>
But by mutual agreement with Boeing, Mitsubishi and the others will not take an 
equity stake in the project by putting up 25% of the $3 billion to $4 billion 
in development costs. Nor will they get close-up lessons in how the Seattle 
company coordinates such a massive project, or markets planes to the world's 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
That lesser role for Japan is being hailed as protecting Boeing's technology -- 
and by extension U.S. leadership in the world aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
But that's too narrow a view. It misunderstands technology, business, world 
markets and how a great company stays ahead in a major industry. 
</P>
<P>
Shutting Japanese subcontractors out of Boeing won't shut Japan out of the 
aerospace business. Nor will it preserve Boeing's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The companies -- all of them sizable and well financed -- have other ways to 
learn the ropes. They can work with McDonnell Douglas on its planned MD-12 
jetliner, for one thing. In fact, their help would be welcomed by cash-short 
McDonnell, which has worked with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on the F-15 and 
F-4 fighter planes. "We've had a long history of collaboration," says a 
McDonnell Douglas spokesman. "They're fine people." 
</P>
<P>
Or they can work with Europeans. Mitsubishi is already discussing joint 
development, with Daimler-Benz of West Germany, of a commuter jet. "It could be 
through that venture that they will develop a supersonic plane in this decade," 
says John Harbison, aerospace expert at Booz Allen Hamilton consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The market is simply too attractive to leave alone. Boeing estimates that 9,935 
jetliners will be sold by all aircraft makers in the next 15 years. That's a 
$40-billion-a-year business worldwide, and an industry moreover that creates 
high-skilled jobs and opportunities for hundreds of subcontractors to advance 
the state of the art in everything from reclining seats to computerized 
navigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder that talk of the 777 has raised expectations in U.S. aerospace. 
"We hope there's more Boeing in our future," says a spokeswoman for Grumman, 
which has subcontracted on Boeing planes back to the 727. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Boeing stay on top in such a business? It takes risks. Over a 
decade ago, when it had less than $2 billion in equity capital, Boeing spent 
$2.6 billion to bring out two planes at once, the 757 and 767. Why two? To make 
sure it covered all the passenger capacity ranges in the market, from the 
146-seat 737 through the 400-plus passenger 747. 
</P>
<P>
It's doing something of the same today, risking $3 billion to launch the 
350-seat 777, even though McDonnell Douglas and Europe's Airbus Industrie 
already have orders for similar-sized jets and will be in production before 
Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
Another company might leave that market segment to competitors and concentrate 
on another niche -- arguing that such a policy maximizes profits, not merely 
market share. Not Boeing. "It will count on the economies of using two new 
engines and other technical advances to be able to offer more plane for less 
money," says analyst Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities, the brokerage arm of 
Union Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Then it will market the plane as one that can help an airline make money. 
Boeing isn't known for making pretty airplanes -- sleek tubes of metal like the 
French Caravelle years ago. Rather, it designs seat configurations and other 
elements to make profit for the operator. Airlines appreciate that, which is 
why Boeing has a 65% share of the world market -- and remains the largest U.S. 
exporter. 
</P>
<P>
It plays a subtle game. Its invitation to Japanese subcontractors to 
participate in the 777, for example, was a move to cement business with Japan 
Air Lines and All Nippon Airways, big Boeing customers and transportation 
leaders of the fast-growing Asian market. 
</P>
<P>
It may also have been a ploy to keep potential competitors from developing a 
plane too quickly on their own -- or a move to lay the groundwork for future 
collaboration on a supersonic plane -- that could cost $30 billion to develop. 
Only Boeing knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the collaboration never came off. Both sides hesitated, say 
analysts, because of political reactions, especially in Congress, where some 
members fear that foreign collaborations give away U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's technology? It can't be given away. What it boils down to is that 
Boeing keeps the target moving, a strategy that recalls some of the best lines 
ever written on how to succeed in business. They come not from a textbook but 
from "The Mary Gloster," Rudyard Kipling's poem about a 'cussed old shipbuilder 
dying in Scotland and trying to explain it to his son: 
</P>
<P>
 They asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text, 
</P>
<P>
 'You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!' 
</P>
<P>
 They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind, 
</P>
<P>
 And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

Changes at US Sprint Parent: United Telecom said it will exercise its option to 
buy GTE's remaining 19.9% stake in what originally was a 50-50 joint venture 
that created US Sprint in July, 1986. The firm now owns 80.1% of US Sprint, 
which has become the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier. Shareholders 
at United Telecom's annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., also overwhelmingly 
approved changing the parent firm's name to Sprint Corp. to capitalize on the 
subsidiary's more widely recognized name.

MCDONALD'S WILL BUY RECYCLED GOODS TO BUILD OUTLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to greatly expand the U.S. market for recycled products, McDonald's 
Corp. on Tuesday pledged to purchase up to $100 million worth of recycled 
materials a year for use in building and remodeling its U.S. restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The new "McRecycle USA" program is designed to create markets for hundreds of 
products made from recycled material ranging from wallboard to trash cans and 
table tops. Manufacturers and distributors of recycled products are encouraged 
to offer their wares to McDonald's by calling a new toll-free number or by 
contacting an information center set to open in the fall at the company's Oak 
Brook, Ill., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to use the recycled materials in the 400 or so restaurants 
built each year and in the 1,000 that undergo remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling is one of the most important environmental steps America can take," 
said Ed Rensi, president of McDonald's USA. "But there is an urgent need to 
expand the market for recycled materials so that individuals, communities and 
businesses can sustain -- and even increase -- their recycling efforts." 
</P>
<P>
The American public's reawakened interest in environmental issues has sparked 
corporate America to respond in dramatic ways. Last week, three major tuna 
canners said they would stop buying tuna caught with nets that also trap and 
kill dolphins. Dozens of major companies are also linking their advertising 
campaigns to the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, to be celebrated on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's is already one of the largest users of recycled paper products in 
the fast-food business, according to Shelby Yastrow, McDonald's senior vice 
president of environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also using a soft, rubber playground covering made from recycled 
rubber tires and is recycling some of the polystyrene containers used to hold 
hamburgers and other foods. Yastrow said the lightweight containers can be 
recycled into trays and trash cans, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I would pray someday that we can build a restaurant out of 100% recycled 
materials," said Yastrow, who also serves as the company's general counsel. He 
said he expects the new recycling program to be a success because "the top guys 
are 100% behind me." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's, which serves about 22 million customers a day at its 11,500 
restaurants worldwide, currently spends about $60 million a year on recycled 
paper products. About 250 restaurants are involved in a polystyrene recycling 
program that is scheduled to be expanded to about 2,000 restaurants in the next 
few years, Yastrow said. He said anyone who produces recycled materials should 
contact the company at 1-800-453-1000. They will be sent information about the 
program and learn how to qualify to sell their products to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the organizers of Earth Day 1990 said they are watching the efforts 
by major corporations to solve environmental problems with interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If companies are going to make real improvements, that's great," said Denis 
Hayes, a San Francisco attorney who is credited with founding Earth Day in 
1970. "If it is just for public relations, then I condemn it." 
</P>

Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has about 5,000 U.S. restaurants, has a pilot 
polystyrene recycling program at five restaurants in Massachusetts, spokesman 
Dick Detwiler said. He said the company hopes to expand its recycling efforts, 
which now include a paper and aluminum recycling program at its Louisville, 
Ky., headquarters, 
</P>
<P>
Except for its hot drink cups, which are made out of polystyrene, Burger King 
uses paper products, according to corporate spokeswoman Cori Zywotow. She said 
the company is looking into several pilot recycling programs but currently does 
not use recycled paper products in its restaurants.

Joint German Bank Planned: West Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, took 
a decisive step into East German banking, announcing plans to set up a joint 
bank with East Germany's Deutsche Kreditbank AG. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche's goal is to control more than one-third of existing bank branch 
offices in East Germany. East Germany's Deutsche Kreditbank was created earlier 
this month when the East German State Bank split off its commercial activities, 
and it is still managed by the State Bank. Deutsche said it would hold 49% of 
the new joint bank, which will be based in East Berlin.

Auto Sales Drop: Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks tumbled 
11.2% in early April from the incentive-boosted sales levels of the same period 
last year, auto makers said. Chrysler posted the biggest drop, with its car 
sales falling 29.2% during the April 1-10 period from a year earlier, when the 
No. 3 auto maker had just announced interest-free financing on some vehicles. 
Ford's car sales slid 20.7% and General Motors's fell 13.6% from the 
year-earlier period, the companies said.

HON TAKES HIS BIGGEST GAMBLE WITH LANDMARK DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, developer Barry G. Hon quit as chairman of Tustin-based 
Eldorado Bank and decided to try to build a bigger pile of gold in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Hon has found riches. He also found fulfillment, frustration and foes as his 
Hon Development Corp. in Laguna Hills took on increasingly larger and more 
complex projects from Foothill Ranch in southern Orange County to the 
controversial plans for a resort hotel and residential community in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Hon is attempting the biggest gamble of his career. He must come up with 
more than $200 million in cash as a down payment for his $967-million purchase 
of Landmark Land Co.'s vast real estate holdings, including some of the 
nation's choicest golf course properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some are skeptical that Hon can pull off the deal. Investors who are betting on 
Landmark's stock to fall contend that the deal is suspect, aimed more at 
appeasing federal regulators who are poring over questionable real estate deals 
made by Landmark and its primary subsidiary, Oak Tree Savings Bank in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The properties Hon is buying are funded, owned and managed by Oak Tree and its 
subsidiaries. Landmark had to sell the properties to satisfy new federal 
regulations limiting equity real estate investments by thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
While the proposed investment has thrown Hon into the spotlight, it is clearly 
not a place he relishes. A quiet man publicly, the 51-year-old Arkansas native 
said the negative side-effect of his growing operation is the publicity it has 
engendered. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His public persona is multifaceted. To some, Hon is a fundamentalist Christian 
who supported presidential candidate Pat Robertson in 1988. He is a "creative" 
developer, said Gerald G. Barton, Landmark's chairman. And a former Orange 
County Planning Commission member recalled that Hon and his company were 
"straight-arrows." 
</P>
<P>
To others, Hon represents a darker side. A Silverado Canyon resident charged 
that Hon Development wasn't forthright about its Foothill plans and misled the 
public, if not county supervisors, on a number of issues. And a Rancho Palos 
Verdes councilman said the developer can "play hardball." 
</P>
<P>
While the public exploration of his endeavors is troubling, it will not stop 
him from the grand plans he has for the Landmark properties, which he is buying 
and running separately from Hon Development. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-phase purchase agreement, subject to regulatory approval and his own 
review of the assets, Hon will pick up 19 golf courses, four hotels and 
thousands of acres of residential and commercial land, much of it ready for 
development and sale to builders. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, one of the largest real estate transactions in the country this year, 
includes such well-known resorts as PGA West, La Quinta Golf &amp; Tennis 
Resort, Mission Hills Country Club, all near Palm Springs, and Palm Beach Polo 
&amp; Country Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't buying just the properties, though, he's acquiring the operating 
companies and 3,500 employees who design and operate hotels and resort 
properties and develop land primarily for residential use, anchoring the home 
sites, as Hon does, with golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to us to buy the operating companies so we have the team with 
the experience of building a championship project," Hon said. "I wanted not 
only the golden eggs, but the goose that laid the golden eggs." 
</P>
<P>
Though Landmark's golf course projects are all in the United States, "its name 
and reputation is worldwide," Hon said. Taking advantage of that reputation, he 
wants eventually to build or manage golf courses in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hon Development previously has used the Landmark golf course team in its 
Southern California developments. 
</P>
<P>
But his recent deals have engendered some skepticism and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"As you grow bigger, you become a bigger target," Hon said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Landmark deal, short-sellers -- those who invest in the hope that a 
target company's price will fall -- contend that Landmark is a troubled company 
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and thrift 
regulators. The investigators have questioned the accounting on some of 
Landmark's real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
The critics believe that the sale to Hon is merely for show, and a delaying 
tactic. They believe that Hon will be unable to finance it or will have to sell 
off properties to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Barton denied Landmark was in any trouble, and Hon said he will come up 
with the needed money -- more than $200 million in total -- and will not sell 
any of the prime golf courses or hotels to do it. The only sales, he said, will 
be the usual sales of residential and commercial land to builders. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2,750-acre Foothill project, Hon has been praised by some for figuring a 
way to develop the old Whiting Ranch that other developers, including Barton, 
had passed on. But he has done it at a cost to the environment, say others. 
</P>
<P>
Hon also has stepped on toes in Rancho Palos Verdes. City Council member Bob 
Ryan says Hon "seems to have the wherewithal" to "play hardball."

Eastern Cuts Payout Estimate: Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines would 
receive only between 6.7 cents and 14.3 cents on the dollar if the airline were 
to be liquidated, the airline's lawyers revealed in court. The new estimate is 
much lower than the 25 cents on the dollar the airline offered earlier this 
month. The new figures were revealed as the airline's creditors pressed their 
case for the appointment of a trustee to oversee the day-to-day affairs of the 
airline, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, 1989.

Marketing Program: On a more down-to-earth note, Catalina Marketing Group in 
Anaheim has announced Tuesday that it has signed the nation's fifth-largest 
supermarket chain to participate in the company's unique direct-marketing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Winn-Dixie, which has 1,223 stores, is a pretty big deal in the South, even if 
few people know of it around here. It joins other major chains, including 
Ralphs and Lucky supermarkets, in participating in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's "Checkout Coupon" system uses information about consumer purchases 
gleaned from computerized scanners at checkout counters to provide customers 
with coupons that they will probably want or use. Catalina will keep track of 
the purchases of 30 million households.

As national manufacturers scramble to portray their products as environmentally 
safe, county retailers and clothing producers are cashing in on Earth Day as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
While a little late for Sunday's Earth Day, the MainPlace/Santa Ana mall plans 
a raft of activities next month under the tongue-twisting banner, "Earth Day Is 
Every Day in May." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the mall plans to open a recycling center in its west parking lot 
for glass bottles, aluminum cans and newspapers. Its backers have set a lofty 
goal of trying to break the Guinness world record for the most recyclable 
material collected in a 30-day period. 
</P>
<P>
The mall also plans to show environment-related displays from groups ranging 
from the Audubon Society to the Orange County Transit District next month. 
</P>
<P>
A rain forest exhibit will be on display for two weeks in the Robinson's Court. 
Jungle guides will lead package-toting shoppers on a walk through a living rain 
forest, complete with native plants, animals and sounds -- but presumably free 
of malaria-bearing mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't quench a thirst for modern jungle living, the mall is also 
giving away a Hawaiian vacation for two that includes a trip to the rain forest 
on Kauai. To further bolster its planet-conscious effort, the mall is featuring 
save-the-ocean issues in the May edition of its magazine. It's printed on 
recycled paper, of course.

WELLS FARGO EXTENDS RUN OF HEALTHY PROFIT RESULTS; 
</P>

FINANCE: H. F. AHMANSON AND GREAT WESTERN POSTED HIGHER NET INCOME. SECURITY

Wells Fargo &amp; Co., continuing its string of strong quarterly performances, 
disclosed that its earnings in the first quarter rose 13% to $159.8 million 
from the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, directors of Security Pacific Corp., reacting to a strong 
performance last year, raised the banking firm's quarterly dividend Tuesday by 
10.5% to 63 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements came on the day both banks held their annual meetings in Los 
Angeles. Executives at both companies spent considerable time trying to ease 
investor fears of a real estate downturn in California, ironically on the same 
day when a top government regulator warned of potential problems in some of the 
state's major commercial real estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt responded to concerns by touting the 
California economy, citing such factors as strong job, population and 
manufacturing growth. 
</P>
<P>
Reichardt also restated the belief of Wells Fargo executives and others that 
many of the real estate problems experienced by banks elsewhere in the country 
stem from poor underwriting of loans by bankers there. Wells Fargo has been one 
of the nation's most profitable banks, in part because of growth in its real 
estate lending. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific Corp.'s new chief 
executive, made similar points in a meeting with reporters following the Los 
Angeles banking firm's annual meeting with shareholders at its headquarters. 
Smith said Security Pacific has been hurt some by the overall slowdown in the 
nation's economy but added that he believes California's economy is strong. 
Among the factors Smith cited were strong immigration and a relatively tight 
supply of housing caused in part by slow-growth pressure in many communities. 
</P>
<P>
Investors have been wary of buying bank stocks in recent months in the wake of 
a spreading real estate recession that has hit hard in New England, Arizona, 
Texas, the New York area and Florida. Regulators from the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency have been especially tough on banks for sloppy real 
estate lending, to the point where some critics say the regulators are choking 
off credit by making lenders skittish. 
</P>
<P>
California banks have worked hard to persuade investors that the state remains 
somewhat insulated from those problems and that troubles in areas such as New 
England and Arizona were caused by overbuilding. Still, that controversy will 
probably be renewed by comments Tuesday from L. William Seidman, head of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. During a speech in Dallas, Seidman included 
Anaheim and Los Angeles on a list of potential trouble spots for commercial 
lending. (See story on D1.) 
</P>
<P>
Separately, earnings disclosed Tuesday by other banks nationwide were mixed. 
Union Bank in San Francisco said its net income rose slightly to $34.6 million 
for the quarter from $33.5 million a year earlier. The bank, which is 
controlled by the Bank of Tokyo, said that profits were hurt by a decrease in 
its net interest margin, basically the difference between what it earns on its 
money and what it pays to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Major thrifts in California showed strong earnings, an indication that the 
biggest thrifts are doing well amid the savings and loan industry chaos.

JUDGE OKS PLAN FOR MAUI AND SONS' REORGANIZATION

A federal bankruptcy judge cleared the way Tuesday for a plan that would allow 
Maui and Sons, a major surf-wear manufacturer known for its logo featuring a 
shark wearing sunglasses, to emerge from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Maui and Sons would license its surf-wear label to other 
companies and would no longer manufacture the clothes itself, said William N. 
Lobel, an Irvine attorney representing Maui and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan in Santa Ana approved a draft of a 
disclosure statement that will be sent to a committee of Maui and Sons' 
unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an agreement with the (unsecured) creditors' committee that they have 
approved the plan and are sending a letter to the creditors saying . . . they 
believe the plan is in their best interests," Lobel said. He said he expects 
Ryan to approve a final reorganization plan in June. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Maui and Sons' unsecured creditors will receive at least 68% of 
the more than $2.1 million that they are owed. The firm has paid $2.8 million 
to clear its debt with Mitsui Manufacturers Bank, its one secured creditor, 
Lobel said. 
</P>
<P>
Maui and Sons filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in April, 1988, 
at a time when the $1-billion-a-year surf-wear industry was flooded with 
competitors. At the time, analysts faulted Maui and Sons for diversifying out 
of its mainstay of surf wear and into other types of sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Prested, a company co-founder, said the firm has begun to get back on its 
feet by focusing on its surf wear products. Prested and his former partner, 
Jeff Yokoyama, founded the firm in 1981 by investing $3,500 to buy madras cloth 
to make drawstring shorts. 
</P>
<P>
"The shark is back. Definitely. No question about it," Prested said.

DETROIT FEELING THE PINCH IN BRAZIL; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: THE FREEZE IN AUTO OPERATIONS BY BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT IS HURTING GM 
AND FORD, WHICH HAVE MAJOR OPERATIONS THERE. 
</P>

<P>
With their Brazilian automotive operations frozen in place for the last three 
weeks, General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen are suddenly relearning an old 
lesson -- that there can be a downside to going global. 
</P>
<P>
The three auto giants, which dominate Brazil's auto industry, have been forced 
to shut down all of their car and truck assembly lines throughout the country 
since Brazil's Draconian anti-inflation measures were put in place by the 
nation's new president. Overnight, the idlings brought to a complete standstill 
a huge industry that normally produces 600,000 cars and 200,000 trucks a year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ford and Volkswagen, which have merged their Brazilian operations 
into a large joint venture called Autolatina, have been forced to furlough 
28,000 workers with full pay and now have just 17,000 employees still on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
GM, meanwhile, has laid off, with pay, most of its 21,000 workers in the 
country. GM's only manufacturing operation that has not shut down there is a 
factory that produces car engines for export to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sales in Brazil have been non-existent," said Ronald Theis, a spokesman 
for GM's international operations. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Ford and GM are starting to feel the pinch on the bottom line. For 
Ford, Brazil represents one of its largest foreign markets outside of Europe -- 
its Autolatina venture accounts for 58% of Brazilian car sales. For GM, 
meanwhile, its 210,000 sales of cars and trucks in Brazil account for nearly 
10% of its total overseas sales of 2.4 million vehicles per year. 
</P>
<P>
GM has yet to comment officially on how Brazil will affect earnings, but 
earlier this week, Ford told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that 
the economic crisis could have a "substantial adverse effect on Ford's 
earnings" worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Ford officials on Tuesday refused to say just how big an impact there will be. 
But Wall Street analysts said that if the shutdown lasted for the rest of 1990, 
Ford and GM would stand to lose anywhere from $400 million to $700 million 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they reopen their plants soon, the dramatic reduction in buying 
power among most Brazilians that will result from the anti-inflation program is 
almost certain to prompt a long-term slump in Brazilian car sales. 
</P>
<P>
Their Brazilian troubles could hardly have come at a worse time for GM and 
Ford, which have become increasingly reliant on overseas earnings to offset the 
slump in U.S. car sales. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement by the Brazilian government that it plans to unfreeze 
some funds so that consumers can take delivery of new cars already on order 
when the anti-inflation measures were imposed was greeted cautiously by the 
auto makers. The government said it would unfreeze funds previously locked into 
auto "consortiums," a complex retail system that accounts for more than half of 
Brazil's car sales and that grew up as a result of Brazil's fierce 
hyper-inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said they don't believe the liberalization will allow 
potential car buyers to place any new orders for cars in Brazil, and so it 
isn't likely to speed the industry's recovery. "Both of them need overseas 
profits to protect themselves against cyclicality here," noted Raymond Mucci, 
an automotive analyst with Baird Patrick in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of Brazil's inflation-fighting measures -- especially the dramatic 
shut-off of liquidity and credit by the nation's central bank -- has apparently 
caught the major auto makers off guard, and officials at both GM and Ford 
acknowledged that they don't know how long they can keep their workers on full 
pay while they sit at home. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Greenslade, a spokesman for Ford's international operations, said 
Autolatina has tentatively scheduled to resume operations on April 23. But he 
conceded that the joint venture's shutdown has so far been extended on a 
week-to-week basis and could be continued if economic conditions in the country 
remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost a day-to-day thing," said GM's Theis. "When we will start back up 
has not been determined. And how long we can keep paying people is a good 
question."

HOW BOEING'S PLANS FOR MAKING 767-X EVOLVED; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: SINCE THE JAPANESE BUY MOST OF ITS PASSENGER JETS, THE COMPANY 
WANTED THEM ON THE PROJECT. BUT FEAR OF POLITICAL CRITICISM OR PRESSURE FROM 
U.S. RIVALS PROBABLY KEPT THEM FROM GETTING AN EQUITY STAKE, ANALYSTS SAY.

<P>
A tentative agreement announced by Boeing Co. last Friday to share up to 20% of 
the production work for its new 767-X wide-body passenger jet with three 
Japanese firms represents both a milestone and a setback for Japan's aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
It was a milestone because it underscored a continuing role for Japan's leading 
aircraft manufacturers in the business of the world's largest producer of 
passenger jets, despite growing fears in U.S. political circles that the 
Japanese are targeting aerospace for domination in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a disappointment because Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy 
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries were denied the equity stake in the 
project that they had anticipated. Instead of becoming full partners with 
Boeing, the three giant firms remained mere subcontractors -- suppliers of 
fuselage panels and other parts. 
</P>
<P>
Such an arrangement is nothing new. The three companies have been supplying 
Boeing for about two decades already, and a total of about 30 Japanese 
aerospace companies have ongoing subcontractor relationships with the American 
manufacturer. Japanese firms contribute 15% of the production work for the 
Boeing 767 airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese suppliers had been waiting years for Boeing to come through on 
promises of a co-development project, allowing them to delve into research and 
design as well as manufacturing to acquire know-how. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to co-develop a 150-seat airliner called the 7J7 was abandoned only 
recently, ostensibly when Boeing decided it was not marketable. Hopes were then 
pinned on the proposed $3-billion to $4-billion 767-X, a plane that would seat 
350 to 370 passengers, larger than Boeing's 767 but smaller than its 747 jumbo 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as December, Boeing officials stated publicly that the 767-X 
project might end up as a joint venture with Japanese partners. But analysts 
here speculated that Boeing dropped that option to evade congressional 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the overbearing concern was a possible politicization of the project 
in the way the FSX project got out of hand," said Bruce Roscoe, an aerospace 
analyst for S. G. Warburg Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The FSX, Japan's next-generation fighter plane, is now being developed jointly 
by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and General Dynamics based on technology from 
the latter's F-16 fighter. A government-to-government agreement to transfer 
U.S. technology to Japan for the development was nearly scuttled last year when 
critics argued that Japanese companies would use the F-16 technology to catch 
up to -- and overtake -- the United States in the commercial aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for limiting Japanese participation in the 767-X project may 
have been pressure from rival subcontractors in the U.S. defense industry, 
which are hurting from Pentagon budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"These companies are going to be increasingly dependent on the commercial 
aerospace sector as orders in the defense industry decline," said Samuel 
Ramsey, an analyst for the French brokerage W. I. Carr. "There had to have been 
a lot of political pressure from Washington." 
</P>
<P>
But Boeing has little choice but to maintain significant manufacturing ties 
with Japanese companies because Japanese airlines buy the largest share of its 
passenger jets, S. G. Warburg's Roscoe said. More than half the orders for 
Boeing 747 jumbo jets in the beginning of 1989 were placed in Japan, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Without a de facto "offset program," by which production contracts are awarded 
and technology is transfered to Japan, Boeing fears its competitors, such as 
the European consortium Airbus Industrie or the U.S. firm McDonnell Douglas, 
might be able to lure away the market, Roscoe contends. 
</P>
<P>
That potential was suggested by a recent announcement from the Mitsubishi group 
and Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, saying the two business combines planned 
to cooperate in a range of industrial sectors, including aerospace. Last year, 
Daimler acquired Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, a major player in the Airbus 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's early history in aerospace was marked with significant achievements: 
Mitsubishi, for one, built the Zero fighter, which was the best war plane of 
its kind in the early years of World War II. Japan was temporarily barred from 
aerospace after its defeat, and companies got back into the industry servicing 
U.S. fighters and bombers during the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's first commercial development, the YS-11 turboprop transport 
plane, was technologically successful and still serves short-haul domestic 
routes. But Japan missed out on the development of the jet engine and its 
industry remains far behind that of the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that Japan will never catch up and does not necessarily want to 
challenge commercial aviation giants such as Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan doesn't need to make its own airliners," said a senior ruling party 
member of Parliament, who is active in international affairs. "We should be 
content with a subcontractor's role." 
</P>
<P>
But the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry has plans that 
may steer the industry, which relies heavily on defense contracts, into a niche 
in the commercial market for small passenger jets. Last year, MITI commissioned 
the Japan Aircraft Development Corp., a nonprofit body, to study replacing the 
aging YS-11s with a 75-seat jet airliner that could also be used on 
international routes within Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Japanese have any ambition to compete with Boeing in the 
commercial airliner market," said S. G. Warburg's Roscoe. "Why would they want 
to? They have a guaranteed production share of every Boeing plane produced 
without any risk. They may have an image problem being subcontractors, but 
that's as far as it goes. They're still making a lot of money."

FREMONT GENERAL RECEIVES BID TO BUY ITS MAIN BUSINESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fremont General Corp. of Santa Monica received an unsolicited offer Tuesday to 
buy its Fremont Compensation Insurance Co. subsidiary for about $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective buyers, an investment partnership called Catalina Acquisitions 
Inc., did not reveal terms of the deal and were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina, however, is affiliated with a group of investors that owns a 7.8% 
stake in Fremont General. 
</P>
<P>
James McIntyre, president and chief executive of Fremont, said that the company 
has not had a chance to review the offer but that Fremont Compensation is not 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not really open to offers, but as a public company we are required to 
look at everything," McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont's stock price jumped $1 per share, closing at $18 in over-the-counter 
trading Tuesday. Analysts said the deal was worth about $17.25 per share, and 
Fremont shareholders would retain their interests in several other company 
subsidiaries, including Fremont's commercial finance operation and its medical 
malpractice and life insurance businesses. 
</P>
<P>
However, because terms of the sale -- including whether the buyers would pay 
cash or securities for the company -- were not available, analysts would not 
evaluate the deal's viability. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont Compensation is Fremont General's primary subsidiary, accounting for 
50% of the company's 1989 revenues and 100% of its profits.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HART'S WEIL TOPS FORD'S WIN MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kym Weil had a terrific baby-sitter -- always a lot of fun, never too strict 
about bedtime and just about the best softball pitcher any would-be windmill 
whipper could hope to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Weil went to bed when Samantha Ford said so. Last week, Weil put 
Ford to bed in the Hart High record books. 
</P>
<P>
Weil recorded four victories last week, surpassing Ford as the winningest 
pitcher in school history while leading Hart (15-2) to the championship of the 
Righetti tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As she has been throughout her four-year career, Weil was nearly flawless, 
throwing two one-hitters and a pair of two-hitters. She shut out Santa Barbara, 
6-0; Cabrillo, 4-0; Lompoc, 1-0; and Simi Valley, 1-0. Weil's efforts did 
wonders for Hart, which batted only .211 in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, she was selected the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with Tuesday's two-hit 7-0 win over San Gabriel, the tournament 
victories raised Weil's career record to 75-15, eclipsing Ford's school record 
of 71 career wins from 1982-85 and moving Weil to within six of the Southern 
Section record. 
</P>
<P>
"Goals are always important to reach," Weil said. "But I don't want to be too 
concerned with statistics." 
</P>
<P>
That's too bad because her career numbers are noteworthy. Weil has recorded 36 
shutouts, 10 no-hitters, 12 one-hitters, 874 strikeouts and an 0.43 earned-run 
average in 588 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Weil is 14-1, has nine shutouts and has struck out 172 in 108 
innings. She has not allowed an earned run in her last 59 innings. At one 
stretch last season, Weil pitched 101 innings without allowing an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
In the Righetti tournament, Weil struck out 43 in 29 innings while holding the 
opposition to an .064 batting average. And to cap off the week, she signed a 
letter of intent to attend Hawaii on a softball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lot of hard work and determination," Weil said. "I wouldn't 
consider it natural (ability)." 
</P>
<P>
Weil didn't start slinging softballs competitively until she was 13 -- long 
after the days of 9 p.m. bedtimes. But Ford, who pitched for UCLA from 1986-89, 
was still around to offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she was really good when she was younger," Ford said. "I'm really 
happy for her. I think it's great. But I wouldn't want to take any credit for 
her accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
Weil, however, shuns the spotlight, repeatedly emphasizing the contribution of 
teammates. Catcher Stephanie Keeler, who also has signed with Hawaii, leads the 
Indians in nearly every offensive category, including batting average (.500), 
hits (21), doubles (three), triples (three) and home runs (one). 
</P>
<P>
"Stats don't mean that much to me," Weil said. "Records will always be broken. 
I think what's most important is not so much your numbers but how you perform 
and how people think of you as a person. I don't just want to be remembered as 
the girl who beat out Sam."

CHILD PORN BAN EXTENDED TO HOMES

States may outlaw all possession and viewing of child pornography -- even in 
one's own home, the Supreme Court ruled today as it imposed new limits on 
freedom of expression and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld an Ohio law that makes it a crime to possess 
so-called kiddie porn. The decision extends a 1982 ruling in which the justices 
said production and distribution of sexual depictions of children can be 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
The justices had been told the Ohio law is the toughest kiddie porn legislation 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the court, on narrower grounds, struck down the conviction of 
Clyde Osborne of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said the jury was not instructed properly. They ordered a new 
trial for Osborne, who had been sentenced to six months in prison and fined 
$100 for possessing nude photos of a boy believed to be 13 or 14. 
</P>
<P>
The case pitted the sanctity of the home against the safety and welfare of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said Ohio legitimately seeks to 
"destroy a market for the exploitative use of children" by making possession of 
child pornography a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the importance of the state's interest in protecting the victims of 
child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting to stamp out this vice 
at all levels in the distribution chain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White also said Ohio's law is not too broad because it specifically forbids 
possession of lewd material or material that focuses on genitals. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecution could not be based on possession of innocuous photos of one's 
children wearing no clothes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. 
Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Justice William Brennan, the court's leading liberal and a major free-speech 
advocate, said in dissent that the law was too broad, extending far beyond 
child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
"Pictures of topless bathers at a Mediterranean beach, of teen-agers in 
revealing dress and even of toddlers romping unclothed, all might be 
prohibited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pictures of fashion models wearing semitransparent clothing might be illegal," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Osborne's pictures may be distasteful, but the Constitution guarantees 
both his right to possess them privately and his right to avoid punishment 
under an overbroad law," Brennan concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Brennan's opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the sale and 
distribution of obscene materials, ruling in a series of cases that it is not 
constitutionally protected. 
</P>
<P>
But the court in 1969 barred states from outlawing the mere at-home possession 
of obscene materials. 
</P>
<P>
The court in 1982 carved out its newest exception to free-speech rights. It let 
states outlaw material depicting children in sexual performances or poses -- 
even if not obscene.

A 39-year-old Lake Los Angeles man was killed this morning when his pickup 
truck was hit head-on by another pickup truck near Palmdale, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Mario Lee, 39, died at 5:30 a.m. in the accident on 170th Street East 
just north of Avenue T, CHP Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was driving southbound on 170th when a northbound pickup driven by John P. 
Hughes, 26, of San Bernardino drifted into his lane and the two collided, 
Siordia said. Hughes suffered minor injuries and was treated and released from 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said that the accident is still under investigation and that it is 
unknown why Hughes' truck went into the oncoming lane.

Two people were killed and two others were critically injured when a passenger 
car collided with a bobtail truck on the Golden State Freeway early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman, described as in their 30's, were pronounced dead at the 
scene, said Pat Marek, spokesman for Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Their names were not released pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred just before 5:00 a.m. on the northbound lanes of the Golden 
State Freeway, just south of the Glendale Freeway, when the passenger car 
collided with the truck and was crushed beneath its frame, said Officer Vince 
Zambrana. It took firefighters 45 minutes to pull the two trapped victims from 
wreckage. Traffic on the heavily traveled freeway was tied up for hours at the 
height of the early-morning rush.

State Supreme Court Justice David N. Eagleson, one of three conservatives 
appointed after voters ousted Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other 
liberals in 1987, will retire in November, a court spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson's retirement marks the last departure of the three justices appointed 
by Gov. George Deukmejian to replace Bird and Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz 
Reynoso after a bitter confirmation election in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John A. Arguelles left last year and Justice Marcus M. Kaufman retired 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
The latest departure will give Deukmejian his eighth appointment to the court. 
The governor has appointed Justice Joyce L. Kennard, 48, to replace Arguelles 
and Justice Armand Arabian, 55, to replace Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson is considered one of the most conservative members of the court and 
often joins in decisions with Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, who was appointed 
by Deukmejian in 1984. He is considered a hard-liner on the death penalty.

GRENADE HITS SCHOOL BUS, KILLS 15;

11 CHILDREN AMONG VICTIMS AT EAST, WEST BEIRUT CROSSING

A grenade fired by battling Christian forces hit a school bus at a crossing 
gateway between east and west Beirut today, setting it on fire and killing at 
least 15 people, including 11 children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the pupils yelled for help as we tried to extinguish the fire. At 
least one teacher also was among the dead along with the driver," a soldier on 
the scene told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the bus was hit at 2:30 p.m. while trying to cross to 
Christian East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who is unidentified in accord with regulations, said the bus 
from Mraijeh Elementary School, a new private school in south Beirut, was hit 
by an incendiary rifle grenade, which ignited the fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't be determined who fired the rifle grenade," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Another account by Reuters news service said the school bus was hit by 
Christian militia machine-gun fire and it then crashed into a fuel truck and 
went up in flames 
</P>
<P>
It is not known why children from predominantly Christian East Beirut were 
attending primary school in South Beirut, a Shiite Muslim stronghold. But many 
students are among the estimated 30,000 people who commute across the line 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
The radio station of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun said the bus was fired at by 
rival gunmen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia. 
</P>
<P>
"Geagea's fire burned out the children," the broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
Geagea's command could not be reached by telephone from West Beirut to comment 
on the report. 
</P>
<P>
However, the pro-Geagea Voice of Lebanon radio station called the hit 
"mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
The gutted wreckage of the yellow bus lay on the pavement in the 
Aoun-controlled sector, a few yards east of the crossing that links Beirut's 
eastern and western sectors across the dividing Green Line. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher who escaped collapsed when she learned that her three children had 
perished. "I wish I had stayed with them in the bus. I would have died with 
them," she wailed. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a blast ripped through a barracks used by Aoun's troops in the 
Christian village of Yarze, killing four soldiers and wounding several, 
including two captains. Security sources said the explosion occurred by 
accident while artillery shells were being moved. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun has been locked in bloody power struggle with Geagea for more than two 
months. They have been battling since Jan. 30 for control of the 
310-square-mile Christian enclave. The fighting has killed 877 people and 
wounded 2,388. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rival Shiite Muslim militias fought a 90-minute gun battle this 
morning in Syrian-policed West Beirut, and one person was killed and four 
wounded, a police spokesman said.

CUSTOMS FINES BUSH EX-AIDE $648 IN FAILURE TO DECLARE FURS

Jennifer Fitzgerald, deputy chief of U.S. protocol and a former aide to George 
Bush, was fined $648 by the Customs Service for failing to declare the true 
value of two fur coats from Argentina, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Stockman, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said the investigation 
of the case is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
Stockman confirmed that the investigation began in January after an anonymous 
tip was received on the "hot line" of the department's inspector general. The 
caller said that Fitzgerald, traveling on a U.S. government aircraft, had 
failed to declare some items when she returned to Andrews Air Force Base from 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Kittredge, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service, said Fitzgerald was 
summoned to the Office of the Special Agent in Baltimore on March 23, where she 
was assessed $648 under the Custom Fraud Statute. He said the case was handled 
as a civil matter, not as a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs Service, Fitzgerald, who had traveled to Argentina as 
part of an official U.S. delegation, returned with a raincoat purchased abroad, 
which she declared to be worth $300. She did not mention in the customs 
declaration that the coat was lined with nutria fur. The customs agent 
appraised the coat at $1,100, and Fitzgerald was asked to pay a penalty of 
$440. 
</P>
<P>
For a fur cape worth $1,300 that she failed to disclose altogether, Fitzgerald 
was assessed $208.

JUDGE CANNOT RAISE TAXES, JURISTS RULE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL FUNDING: SUPREME COURT DECLARES, HOWEVER, DISTRICTS MAY BE ORDERED TO 
IGNORE STATE LIMITATIONS IN SEEKING DESEGREGATION REMEDIES.

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal judge may not personally increase 
property taxes to pay for school desegregation but can order school officials 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
By a 9-0 vote, the court said U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark abused his 
discretion when he personally imposed a school district tax hike in Kansas 
City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But in a victory for civil rights forces, the court upheld most of the steps 
Clark ordered school officials to take to racially desegregate the schools. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge could order officials to raise taxes to 
pay for the ordered desegregation remedies and could instruct them to ignore 
state laws limiting the amount of school taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Justice Byron R. White used sweeping language that could 
affect school desegregation cases nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"A local government with taxing authority may be ordered to levy taxes in 
excess of the limit set by state statute where there is reason based in the 
Constitution for not observing the statutory limitation," White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day 
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented on that issue, decrying the court's 
"casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured federal 
judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
Clark went too far, the court said today. "Local officials should at least have 
the opportunity to devise their own solutions to these problems," White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
White's opinion was joined by Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood 
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
In arguments before the justices last October on the Kansas City case, Missouri 
lawyer H. Barton Farr III, representing the state, called a tax increase 
ordered by an unelected judge "taxation without representation." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to federal courts, Farr said then, "There is no power to tax, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Today's decision rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
School district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to increase taxes 
for education. Clark nearly doubled the local property tax -- ordering the 
school district to raise the tax from $2.05 to $4 per $100 of assessed 
valuation to help finance school capital improvements that he ordered. 
</P>
<P>
In another important ruling today the high court said an overnight guest in a 
private home enjoys the same privacy rights as the homeowner. By a 7-2 vote, 
the court struck down a Minnesota man's murder conviction. It said police 
unlawfully arrested the man without a warrant in a home where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate Fourth Amendment decision, the court ruled, 5-4, that police 
sometimes may use confessions from suspects arrested unlawfully at their homes. 
The justices reinstated the murder conviction of Bernard Harris of New York 
City, who confessed to killing a former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling carves out a new exception to the so-called exclusionary rule 
designed to prevent police misconduct by barring use of unlawfully seized 
evidence.

OIL AND GAS FLOW NORMAL, LITHUANIA OFFICIALS REPORT

<P>
Oil and natural gas flowed normally into Lithuania today, officials of the 
breakaway government said, despite Moscow's announced plan to halt the supplies 
to curb the republic's independence drive. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian officials said they had expected the Kremlin to begin cutting oil 
and natural gas supplies early today to enforce Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's threatened economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops were seen near a pumping station at an oil refinery in 
northwestern Lithuania this morning, but there was no change in the supply of 
fuel at the facility, according to a report on Lithuanian television. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's energy minister said oil supplies were normal and he had not been 
informed of any planned reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian gas officials received a telegram late Monday from the acting 
general director of the Soviet Union's western gas network saying natural gas 
supplies would be "sharply reduced from the 17th of April." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of critical supplies 
unless Lithuania rescinded within 48 hours several laws meant to bolster its 
March 11 declaration of independence. Lithuanian leaders have made no move to 
meet Gorbachev's demands, but say they are willing to negotiate. Gorbachev 
refuses to meet with them until they rescind their declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today told the House Ways and Means 
Committee that U.S. support for perestroika, Gorbachev's economic reform 
program, is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bilateral commercial contacts with the U.S.S.R. may be more directly in 
their interest than in ours. And those contacts are being put to risk by Soviet 
actions in Lithuania," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker did not specify which commercial ties could be harmed if the Soviets 
suppress the independence movement in the Baltic republic. But Senate minority 
leader Bob Dole of Kansas and others in Congress who have taken a hard line 
toward Moscow are suggesting a suspension of superpower trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's parliament, the Supreme Council, met today to forge an official 
response to the Soviet leader, and they were still debating the tone of the 
resolution into the afternoon, said Rita Dapkus of the legislature's 
Information Office. Also under sharp discussion was the composition of a 
delegation to be sent to Moscow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a Soviet mental patient hijacked a plane in Moscow and forced it to 
fly to Lithuania, saying he wanted to help the breakaway republic in its 
independence struggle. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Radio Vilnius said the unidentified man, who carried a 
package which he claimed contained explosives, surrendered quietly when the 
plane landed in the Lithuanian capital. No weapons were found.

Pepsi said today that it signed an agreement to operate in Burma, despite calls 
by dissidents and human rights groups not to invest after a military crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed last month with a private partner, and Pepsico 
International has a 35% share in the venture, said Barry Shea, company vice 
president for Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The company will ship soft drinks to Burma and is building a $3-million 
factory, which should be completed by the end of the year, on the outskirts of 
Rangoon, the Burmese capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shea was unwilling to comment on the human rights issue. "Obviously we like to 
stay out of politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The military government seized power in September, 1988, by crushing a mass 
uprising for democracy. Hundreds of people were killed.

DOW OFF 32.89 DESPITE BULLISH TRADE REPORT

<P>
The stock market posted a broad loss today, registering little enthusiasm over 
the latest news on the nation's international trade balance. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.89 at 2,732.88 on moderately 
heavy volume of 150 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining stocks led advances by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit in February shrank 
to its narrowest reading in more than six years. Imports exceeded exports by 
$6.49 billion, down from $9.32 billion in January. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that held out the prospect of stronger-than-expected growth in 
economic output, and improved profits at many companies with a substantial 
international business. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the figures touched off fresh worries about the 
outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $10 
for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.84 percent-8.90 
percent range. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was driven down by reports from Tokyo that Japanese 
institutional investors were selling as much as $6 billion in U.S. government 
securities. The Japanese are big holders of U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said the February trade data put out today further fueled 
concerns that the economy is strengthening and that interest rates are heading 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the trade gap eased from a revised $9.32 billion 
in January to $6.49 billion in February -- the lowest monthly trade imbalance 
since December, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that this (trade data) will add to the growth of first 
quarter gross national product, which is a negative for the bond market," said 
Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of high inflation and an improved economy could prompt the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would depress bond prices, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell about 1/16 point, intermediate maturities lost between 5/32 point and 1/4 
point and long-term issues were off around 1/2 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 2.44 to 1,141.65. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills stood at 8% as the discount gained 1 basis 
point to 7.75%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.21% as the discount gained 
1 basis point to 7.79%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.38% as the 
discount climbed 3 basis points to 7.80%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at midday at 8 7/16%, up from 8 3/8 percent late Tuesday.

A jury has decided that a cab company and driver should pay $1.36 million to 
the family of a man who died after being abandoned in snow five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court jury's verdict was returned Tuesday after a two-week 
trial of a wrongful death lawsuit brought by relatives of George Beatty against 
FME Auto Leasing and driver Michael Dsingelis. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, a 72-year-old retired bank executive, died 150 yards from his 
Huntington house on Feb. 3, 1985. He was being driven home from a saloon but 
was dropped off when the cabbie was unable to find the house, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Joachim, lawyer for Beatty's family, said the driver had been directed 
by the company to get rid of the drunken passenger and go to two other calls. 
</P>
<P>
The medical examiner testified that Beatty had downed about 20 drinks.

Arabia, to discuss overproduction by the latter two nations, which had played a 
role in the recent 14% plunge in world prices. 
</P>
<P>
The three are key players in the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, which pumps more than a third of the world's crude and which 
attempts to support higher prices by limiting production. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears (Saudi oil minister Hisham) Nazer's little tea party didn't come up 
with anything significant. At least that's what the market is saying today," 
said Peter Beutel, a trader with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.

STARS RAP GANG VIOLENCE IN NICKERSON GARDENS VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top stars of rap music, including Tone Loc, Def Jef, NWA and MC Hammer gathered 
Tuesday afternoon at the Nickerson Gardens housing project to film an anti-gang 
violence video. 
</P>
<P>
"We're All in the Same Gang" follows a familiar format, featuring top recording 
stars lending their talent to a record with the proceeds going to a charity, in 
this case Project Build, a local anti-gang outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Rappers came to the Watts housing project to film a video for the song, due for 
release May 15 by Warner Bros. on the Grand Jury Records label. 
</P>
<P>
While publicity for the event said participants would call for a truce between 
gangs, rappers and others chose their words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to stop gang violence, I'm just doing my part to slow it down," 
rapper Def Jef said. "I most definitely think it should be stopped, but before 
you can stop it, you have to go to the source of where it started." 
</P>
<P>
While about 200 Nickerson residents watched, the rappers gathered in front of a 
building to begin filming the clip, which will take three weeks to produce, 
said Laurice Bell of Fragile Films. She said scenes of gangs will be cut into 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
Eazy E, who also performs with the rap group NWA, said rappers are the best 
mediums for the anti-violence message. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the middle. We tell you what could happen. We don't tell you what to 
do and what not to do. . . . We give an example: 'If you go through the whole 
day doing wrong, you might end up dead or in jail. Sometimes you might get 
away,' " he said. "We just let them see what could happen, and they take it 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
Tone Loc grew up in West Los Angeles, the son of a successful businesswoman, 
but was so attracted to gangs as a teen-ager that he rode buses into 
South-Central Los Angeles to hang out with them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more easier for me to come out and express my point of view, because 
I've already been there. . . . We were all brought up in the same era," Loc 
said. "These young brothers are rapping about stuff that's going on with the 
environment, with gangs, with drugs."

CANNES FILM FESTIVAL SALUTING CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cannes film festival pays its own political tribute to the triumph of 
democracy in the former Communist Bloc by giving grim East European films 
prominence at next month's event. 
</P>
<P>
Only one East European director was short-listed last year for the "Golden 
Palm," awarded after 12 days of screenings in the glamorous Riviera resort. 
</P>
<P>
This time four East European directors will be up for the prize, with another 
two showing outside the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The sinister aspects of life under the now discredited Communist regimes are 
the focus of most of the East Bloc offerings. 
</P>
<P>
In Polish director Ryszard Bugajski's "Przesluchanie" (The Interrogation) a 
woman is questioned in a police station, while Czechoslovak director Karel 
Kachyna explores the effect of systematic eavesdropping in "Ucho" (The Ear). 
</P>
<P>
Polish director Andrzej Wajda, whose "Korzcak" is not up for the award, tells 
the story of a doctor and a group of children struggling to survive in a 
concentration camp in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet director Pavel Lounguine's cinematic debut -- "Taxi Blues" -- centers on 
the relationship between a cabdriver and an Israeli saxophonist in present-day 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Festival president Gilles Jacob, who sat on a panel that whittled the 326 films 
originally vying for a place down to 24, stressed that Eastern Europe will not 
be allowed to overshadow other countries' offerings. 
</P>
<P>
"We took some of the East European films because they are free and liberated 
now, but all parts of the world have been represented," Jacob said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, fresh from winning an honorary Oscar in Los 
Angeles last month, will open the festival May 10 with his autobiographical 
"Dreams."

'LONELY AND HOMESICK,' GARBO WROTE TO SWEDISH FRIEND IN '26

<TEXT>
<P>
Sweden opened a secret file on Greta Garbo today, disclosing a 1926 letter in 
which the star described herself as a lonely girl longing for her native land. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, written by Garbo from Hollywood to her friend and actress colleague 
Vera Schmiterlov, was released by Stockholm's Royal Library after the reclusive 
star's death in New York on Easter Sunday at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
It was signed "Gurra," the name Garbo used to her friends at that time and had 
a drawing of a girl crying, on top of which the word homesick was written. 
</P>
<P>
"I live very lonely in a place where I am left absolutely alone, I go out for 
walks sometimes alone, look at the sky and the water and talk to myself," Garbo 
wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Librarian Eva Dillman told Reuters that the letter had been sealed shut and not 
published before Garbo's death at the request of the person who donated it to 
the library in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"But now it is official. Anybody can see it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Garbo wrote of a great love for her country and said she longed 
for her old friends. She said she did not like her life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I never will care for anybody here. I never go to parties. I sometimes go to 
the cinema and see a bad film," she wrote. "Oh, that it should be such a long 
distance to home."

MIKE NICHOLS TO SUB FOR LIZ TAYLOR AT AIDS EVENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Director Mike Nichols has agreed to pinch-hit for the ailing Elizabeth Taylor 
at tonight's Art Against AIDS fund-raiser in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is hospitalized in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica with 
pneumonia, issued a statement late Tuesday to quash the reports that she has 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to dispel the plethora of rumors that have been circulating that 
I have an AIDS-related condition," she said. "I feel it is important that 
people should not be afraid to be tested for AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, said she has been tested for AIDS and that the results of those 
tests "are negative." The two-time Oscar winner has raised millions of dollars 
for AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del 
Rey on April 9 for a severe sinus condition, was transferred to nearby St. 
John's for tests, her physician, Dr. Patricia Murray, said.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRY SKIN REMEDY IS AS CLOSE AS NEIGHBORHOOD FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Recently, I read in your column about a product called Bag Balm that 
helps dry skin. I've never seen it in my drugstore. The pharmacist looked at me 
as if I were a nut case when I asked about Bag Balm. 
</P>
<P>
Where can I get it? I tried all the advertised products for this skin 
condition, with no results. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You and dozens of other readers have written to us to help you find Bag 
Balm. What you need is an old-time pharmacy or a farm supply store. 
</P>
<P>
Bag Balm is a veterinary product, designed to keep cows' udders from chapping 
and drying out. Old dairy farmers learned that it worked as well for their 
hands as for their cows' udders. 
</P>
<P>
It contains petroleum jelly, lanolin and a disinfectant. You could probably 
substitute a product with similar ingredients, such as A&amp;D Ointment, 
Cutemol or Lanoline. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to try the original Bag Balm (which hasn't changed its ingredients 
or green tin can in decades), you can contact the manufacturer, Dairy Assn. Co. 
of Lyndonville, Vt., 05851. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'm recuperating from a reaction to Feldene. My doctor prescribed it a month 
ago for sore shoulders and mentioned it might cause indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
I liked the way it eased the pain in my shoulders, but after 30 days my stomach 
suddenly started bleeding. I lost three units of blood. My blood pressure 
dropped so low I couldn't stand up. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly in my case the cure was worse than the ailment. How often does this 
happen to Feldene users? 
</P>
<P>
A. You are not the first, and assuredly won't be the last to develop a bleeding 
ulcer while taking Feldene (piroxicam). Almost any of the anti-inflammatory 
agents such as Motrin (ibuprofen), Naprosyn (naproxen), Indocin (indomethacin) 
or Voltaren (diclofenac) can cause stomach irritation, ulcers or bleeding. As 
you found out, the bleeding may occur without warning. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that about one patient in 100 will develop an ulcer or serious 
intestinal bleeding when taking one of these arthritis drugs for three to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
In patients treated for a year, 2% to 4% experience such problems, which appear 
to be more serious, if not more common, among older people.

LIZ SMITH: HOLZER MAY HAVE OWN STORY FOR PRISON READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Liz Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YOU CAN expect some books spotlighting the convicted Broadway producer Adela 
Holzer. Since she pleaded guilty to a grand larceny rap Monday, she can be 
sentenced to four years or at least 34 months in prison. (Adela already served 
a previous term wherein she became friends with the imprisoned Jean Harris.) 
</P>
<P>
Michael Alpert, who was Adela's theater press agent during her career as a 
functioning producer, will write his own version -- "the true story of what 
happened." (One of Adela's best and funniest shows was the priceless Terrence 
McNally comedy "The Ritz.") Literary agent Betsy Nolan is already circulating 
Alpert's manuscript to publishers and it has the title "Laid on the Willing 
Only." 
</P>
<P>
This is a quote from Thomas Jefferson about lotteries, which he described as "a 
tax that was laid on the willing only." I assume this means that Adela took 
money from people who were willing. (But did she have to tell them she was the 
secret wife of David Rockefeller?) 
</P>
<P>
This week in court, the judge asked Adela her birth date. She conferred with 
her lawyers, then quietly inquired: "Can they tell it to the clerk privately?" 
</P>
<P>
NOW ABOUT that fetching photograph of Donald and Ivana Trump stepping out of a 
movie theater in Stamford, Conn., last Saturday night. (Did anybody bother to 
find out what movie the Trumps saw? Well, they took in "Pretty Woman," starring 
Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.) 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, let me muse a second. Before going on vacation, I ran a story that 
Ivana's side thought they had the goods on Donald in the matter of his possibly 
keeping Marla Maples in an apartment in the Trump Tower. To be certain Donald 
got to respond and refute, I made an early, firm appointment to talk to him at 
a specific time. I called on the dot but he had departed. So naturally I didn't 
get to offer Donald's side of this. 
</P>
<P>
While away, I note he again accused me of being a tool of Ivana's press agent 
and her lawyer, who he said, again, were "playing Liz like a fiddle." (Donald 
has to get some new imagery; I guess we all do.) 
</P>
<P>
I ask you -- who is it Donald plays like a fiddle? Could it be the New York 
Post? Or do you really think that paper just happened to have a photographer at 
the ready near the Stamford movie house last Saturday? Could such a tip 
possibly have come from Donald? Or is the Post just prescient? 
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation? Well, Ivana certainly wants it; she's funny that way. But she 
still doesn't want it at any price (other women are a no-no) and she still 
wants a new nuptial contract that is more equitable. Donald, meantime, just 
might want things to cool down and going to the movies after alerting the Post 
seemed like such a lovely idea. Then there is always La Publicite which, in his 
mind, never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
IVANA ON the cover of May's Vogue in lovely photos by Patrick Demarcelier, 
overseen by Andre Leon Talley -- this is a real sweetheart story. The writer, 
Vicki Woods, met Ivana several years ago in London, was prepared to dislike her 
but ended full of admiration for a "self-assured woman who looked her age, 38." 
</P>
<P>
When Vicki met Ivana again, after the recent unpleasantness, she found her 
"fragile and delicate, with a sense of being hunted." However, she says Ivana 
now looks "vulnerable. She looks about 15 pounds thinner than I remember, also 
15 years younger."

Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly today beat back a lawsuit filed by a woman 
who claimed she suffered tooth damage when Kelly threw beer-filled balloons at 
her during a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Edbauer's claim that she needed root-canal work after being hit in the 
face with a balloon boiled down to a credibility contest between her and Kelly, 
and she lost, Buffalo City Court Judge Michael L. Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
"A review of the evidence leaves unreconciled gaps and conflicts in plaintiff's 
proof," Broderick said. "The proof itself was replete with conflicts, 
contradictions, exaggerations, distortions and confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Edbauer had been seeking $250,000 from Kelly, who signed a $20 million contract 
recently that made him the NFL's highest-paid player. After testimony concluded 
last week, she reduced her claim to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly was not present for the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Edbauer, 40, of Clarence, said she was hit in the face with a balloon during an 
Aug. 16, 1987, picnic sponsored by a now-defunct Williamsville bar. The blow 
caused a plastic cup to shatter against her face, damaging her front tooth so 
that it subsequently needed a root canal, she said.

Australian Jeff Fenech will attempt to capture his fourth world title when he 
meets Juan LaPorte of Puerto Rico for the vacant WBC super-featherweight title 
in Sydney on May 26, promoter Bill Mordey announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Fenech, 25, will give up the WBC featherweight title he currently holds to 
fight for the super-featherweight crown, which is being vacated by Azumah 
Nelson of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
He's unbeaten in 24 professional fights with 18 knockouts and previously held 
the WBC super-bantamweight and IBF bantamweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
LaPorte, 30, is the current NABF super-featherweight champion and is ranked 
ninth in the division by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
He held the WBC featherweight title from 1982-84 and has a 36-9 record. He 
never has been stopped inside the distance. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based LaPorte last fought on Feb. 15, when he retained his NABF title 
with a split decision over Rogelio Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Fenech, who said he has fully recovered from hand surgery, said he aims to 
become the third man in the world -- Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns are 
the others -- to win world titles in five divisions.

The Halas family, owners of the Chicago Bears, could lose the football team 
under a federal tax assessment that might surpass $50 million, according to a 
report published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Halas family owes about $43.5 
million in gift and inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
With penalties and interest, the tax bill could increase to more than $50 
million, a sum the family could pay only by selling the team, a report in the 
sports daily The National said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Halas McCaskey, daughter of Bears founder George Halas, and Michael 
McCaskey, Halas' grandson and president of the team, have filed petitions in 
U.S. Tax Court in Washington challenging the assessments, The National 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The family is also asking permission to pay any taxes the court rules it owes 
in 10 annual installments, a request the IRS had already refused. 
</P>
<P>
A trial was scheduled for May 15 before U.S. Tax Court Judge Lapsley W. Hamblen 
Jr., the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from a series of moves begun in December, 1981, by George 
Halas aimed at passing on the franchise to his 13 grandchildren while avoiding 
heavy taxation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS contends that a 1981 reorganization of the team placed an artificially 
low value on the 49.35% of the team's stock then held in the name of the senior 
Halas, who died Oct. 31, 1983.

Trade talks between the Atlanta Falcons and the Indianapolis Colts, aimed at 
sending the first overall choice in Sunday's NFL draft to the Colts, have 
stalled, a newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in today's editions, quoted an unidentified 
Colts source as saying Tuesday: "It looked like we were headed in a pretty 
decent direction for a while. But then things started moving away from a deal. 
I'm not saying things are dead, but they're certainly on life-support systems." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts would use the choice to select Illinois quarterback Jeff George, an 
Indianapolis native. Barring a trade, the Falcons have said they will take 
George, but they have not yet begun contract negotiations with his agent, Leigh 
Steinberg.

Law enforcement sources say at least four members of the men's lacrosse team at 
St. John's University in Queens raped a woman at a fraternity house, New York 
Newsday reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kaiser, the university's athletic director, confirmed that members of the 
lacrosse team were being investigated, according to today's editions of 
Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Piperno, spokesman for the Queens district attorney's office, and 
sex-crime police detectives and would not discuss the alleged gang rape. 
</P>
<P>
However, one law enforcement source said the victim has identified at least 
four attackers, Newsday said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were investigating whether other members of the team were "egging 
on" the alleged attackers, the source told Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
"The St. John's community is deeply concerned by the reported incident," Martin 
J. Healy, a spokesman for St. John's, said in a statement.

<P>
Two days after achieving a career-high No. 3 world ranking, Monica Seles is 
heading into the round of 16 with a determined note of caution. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old native of Yugoslavia cemented her newest ranking Tuesday night 
with another big victory, quashing qualifier Sandy Collins 6-1, 6-1 without a 
hitch in the Eckerd Tennis Open. 
</P>
<P>
But Seles, who now faces Donna Faber, said after defeating Collins that she 
doesn't want to become overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be going along full of confidence, then it can go away just as 
quickly," Seles said after the Tuesday match. "I feel good about my game and 
things are going very well. I'll just continue to try my best." 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, sixth-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada outlasted Mercedes Paz of 
Argentina 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 7-6 (7-5); while No. 8 Susan Sloane rallied to upset 
Shaun Stafford 6-4, 2-6, 7-5. No. 7 Sandra Cecchini of Italy downed Ann 
Grossman 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the tournament's No. 2 seed, is to 
play her first-round match against Tami Whitlinger. 
</P>
<P>
Kelesi said she was relieved after pulling through a three-hour test in 
88-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a point when I was down 5-4 in the third set and I was thinking I 
had lost the match," Kelesi said. "I wasn't doing anything right, and she was 
playing very well. I really had to fight to keep my spirits up. But if there's 
one thing about me, it's that I'm a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if Kelesi would close out the match after breaking Paz in the 11th 
game to go ahead 6-5. But Paz broke back and forced a tie-break, and surged 
ahead 4-1 in the tie-break. 
</P>
<P>
Kelesi then won the next three points. At 5-all, Paz netted a backhand, then 
her forehand sailed wide, giving Kelesi the match.

BIRMINGHAM IS WORLD LEAGUE 'CLEAR CHOICE'

<TEXT>
<P>
Commissioner Tex Schramm of the World League of American Football said today 
that Birmingham was a "clear choice" to be one of the 12 cities in the 
intercontinental league, scheduled to begin play in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm also said the league, contrary to the old World Football League and 
United States Football League, is projected for "the long range because of its 
association with the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
He said the league will hold its first draft next February and begin play the 
weekend of March 23. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Arrington welcomed Schramm and said he was excited about having a 
WLAF team coming to 75,000-seat Legion Field. 
</P>
<P>
The WLAF, with 12 teams, is scheduled to start play with teams in six American 
cities, four European cities and in Montreal and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The last pro team in Birmingham was the Birmingham Stallions in the United 
States Football League, from 1983-85. Earlier, the World Football League had 
the Birmingham Americans, in 1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
The WLAF is awarding franchises first to cities, with the NFL owning a part of 
each team and its local ownership handling the rest. The Birmingham owners are 
reported to be Larry Lemak, an orthopedic surgeon who was involved with the 
Stallions; Bill Harbert, an industrialist, and Wayne Rogers, an actor who is a 
native of Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
The only American city named prior to today was Orlando, Fla., but the 
prospective list is believed to include Nashville, Tenn.; San Antonio, Texas; 
New York, and either Sacramento or San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The international cities include Barcelona, Milan, Frankfurt, Mexico City, 
Montreal and London.

ACQUISITION: THE LAGUNA HILLS DEVELOPER'S DOWN PAYMENT ON SOME OF THE NATION'S

LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, developer Barry G. Hon quit as chairman of Tustin-based 
Eldorado Bank and decided to try to build a bigger pile of gold in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Hon has found riches. He also found fulfillment, frustration and foes as his 
Hon Development Corp. in Laguna Hills took on increasingly larger and more 
complex projects from Foothill Ranch in South Orange County to the 
controversial plans for a resort hotel and residential community in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Hon is attempting the biggest gamble of his career. He must come up with 
more than $200 million in cash as a down payment for his $967-million purchase 
of Landmark Land Co.'s vast real estate holdings, including some of the 
nation's choicest golf course properties. 
</P>
<P>
There are those skeptical that Hon can pull off the deal. Investors who are 
betting that Landmark's stock will fall contend that the deal is suspect, aimed 
more at appeasing federal regulators who are poring over questionable real 
estate deals made by Landmark and its primary subsidiary, Oak Tree Savings Bank 
in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The properties Hon is buying are funded, owned and managed by Oak Tree and its 
subsidiaries. Landmark had to sell the properties to satisfy new federal 
regulations limiting equity real estate investments by thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
While the proposed acquisition has thrown Hon into the spotlight, it is clearly 
not a place he relishes. A quiet man publicly, the 51-year-old Arkansas native 
said the negative side effect of his growing operation is the publicity it has 
engendered. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Hon is a multifaceted person. 
</P>
<P>
He is a "creative" developer, said Gerald G. Barton, Landmark's chairman. And a 
former Orange County Planning Commission member recalled that Hon and his 
company were "straight-arrows." 
</P>
<P>
In building his company, Hon has also been building bridges with civic leaders 
as well as local and national politicians. He said he has supported all five of 
the Orange County supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
He is a fundamentalist Christian who supported Presidential candidate Pat 
Robertson in 1988. Campaign records show he and his wife, Valerie, contributed 
$20,000 to a political action group headed by televangelist Robertson. They 
also gave a total of $2,000 to Robertson's presidential campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hon has also been active in civic matters. He is a board member of the South 
Coast Medical Center, a founder of the Orange County Performing Arts Center and 
a former member of the now idle Orange County Transportation Commission's Toll 
Road Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
But some say there is a darker side to Hon the developer. A Silverado Canyon 
resident charged that Hon Development wasn't forthright about its Foothill 
plans and misled the public, if not county supervisors, on a number of issues. 
And a Rancho Palos Verdes councilman said the developer can "play hardball." 
</P>
<P>
While the public exploration of his endeavors is troubling, Hon indicates that 
it will not stop him from pursuing the grand plans he has for the Landmark 
properties, which he is buying and running separately from Hon Development. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-phase purchase agreement, subject to regulatory approval and his own 
review of the assets, Hon will pick up 19 golf courses, four hotels and 
thousands of acres of residential and commercial land, much of it ready for 
development and sale to builders. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, one of the largest real estate transactions in the country this year, 
includes such well-known resorts as PGA West, La Quinta Golf and Tennis Resort, 
Mission Hills Country Club, all near Palm Springs, and Palm Beach Polo and 
Country Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't buying just the properties, though, he's acquiring the operating 
companies with 3,500 employees who design and operate hotels and resort 
properties and develop land primarily for residential use, anchoring the home 
sites, as Hon does, with golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to us to buy the operating companies so we have the team with 
the experience of building a championship project," Hon said. "I wanted not 
only the golden eggs but the goose that laid the golden eggs." 
</P>
<P>
Though Landmark's golf course projects are all in the United States, "its name 
and reputation is worldwide," Hon said. Taking advantage of that reputation, he 
wants eventually to expand the operations internationally, building or managing 
golf courses in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hon Development has previously used the Landmark golf course team in its 
Southern California developments. 
</P>
<P>
But his recent deals have engendered some skepticism and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"As you grow bigger, you become a bigger target," Hon said philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
In the Landmark deal, so-called short sellers -- those who invest with the hope 
that the company's price will fall -- contend that Landmark is a troubled 
company under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
thrift regulators. The investigators have questioned the accounting on some of 
Landmark's real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
The critics believe that the sale to Hon is merely for show and a delaying 
tactic. They believe that Hon will be unable to finance it or will have to sell 
off properties to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Barton denied that Landmark is in any trouble, and Hon said he will come up 
with the needed money -- more than $200 million in total -- himself and will 
not sell any of the prime golf courses or hotels to do it. The only sales, he 
said, will be the usual sales of residential and commercial land to builders. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2,750-acre Foothill project, Hon has been praised by some for figuring a 
way to develop the old Whiting Ranch that other developers, including Barton, 
had passed on. But he has done it at a cost to the environment, others say. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, a Silverado Canyon resident and environmentalist, contended 
that Hon Development executives weren't forthright. "When they were standing up 
saying one thing, they were doing another," she said. The company, for 
instance, hadn't surveyed property that executives said was staked out already, 
and the company was bulldozing land without permits. 
</P>
<P>
Alden Kelly, a Fullerton arborist hired by Hon Development to work out a plan 
to save trees in Foothill Ranch, accused the company of using him to make it 
look as if it were truly interested in saving trees. 
</P>
<P>
"The pattern that emerged was that they did what was necessary to look good and 
get approved, and when the gates were closed, they'd do what they wanted -- get 
rid of trees and build," Kelly said. "Their basic approach is make as much as 
you can as fast as you can and to hell with the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Hon, however, said he doesn't believe that his firm has misled anyone. His 
company spent more than $3 million keeping or relocating up to 90% of the trees 
in Foothill. "For that money, we could have planted a forest," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORANGE COUNTY'S HEAD LIBRARIAN COMES TO 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's head librarian, who earned a reputation for cultivating 
multi-ethnic library services for a changing public, has been selected as Los 
Angeles' city librarian. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Martinez Smith, 47, is the first Latino to direct the city's 
63-branch system. 
</P>
<P>
She was appointed to the position, with its $105,000 annual salary, after a 
nationwide search to replace Wyman Jones, who resigned to go into publishing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the library has an opportunity to become a haven, a beacon for such a 
multicultural, diverse community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
During her 11 years in Orange County, Smith oversaw construction of eight new 
branch libraries in a system whose cardholders numbered 58% of the population. 
Orange County operates 27 library branches with a budget of over $24 million. 
L.A.'s system has a budget of $35 million and a cardholder rate of about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said one of her chief tasks will be supervising the re-emergence of the 
Central Library, ravaged by arson fires in 1986. "I'm sure there's going to be 
some (fiscal) constraints, but I think the city and the populace are behind the 
new library and community services," she said.

PHILLIP L. ROSSMAN; FOUNDER OF THE VENICE FAMILY CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. today at Hillside Memorial Park for 
Dr. Phillip L. Rossman, the much beloved and honored internist who gave birth 
to the Venice Family Clinic 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rossman was 76 when he died Monday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center, 
where he had been on the staff for many years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970 he and Dr. Mayer Davidson, now director of the diabetes program at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, established the clinic after Rossman learned there 
was only one doctor serving 18,000 people in the Venice area, as opposed to a 
1-400 ratio statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Rossman first became aware of the Venice community's need when he attended the 
opening of a county health facility in nearby Santa Monica. What was to have 
been a celebration, he recalled years later, nearly became a riot. 
</P>
<P>
"Loud chants of 'We want medical care!' came from protesters outside," he said. 
The demonstrators were poor people from Venice who would have had to take two 
buses just to get to the new Santa Monica clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Rossman, who was there as the appointee of the Los Angeles County Medical 
Assn.'s Bay District 5 Public Health Committee, went outside to hear their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told them to give me their names and a number where I could reach 
them," he said. "And in the meantime I told them to go inside and eat their 
cookies and drink their tea. . . . Just behave yourselves and we'll work it 
out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
From that conversation and meetings with Davidson, who arranged for volunteer 
physicians, a nonprofit free clinic was established in a UCLA dental facility 
on Lincoln Boulevard near Rose Avenue. Rossman guided the clinic in its 
formative years. In the clinic's first year it served only what few patients he 
could see at the end of his own professional day. 
</P>
<P>
But as physician interest expanded and drug and X-ray services became more 
plentiful, the clinic grew to a point where it now serves 30,000 a year. With a 
recent building addition at its new location at Rose and 6th avenues, it is now 
capable of serving 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Rossman was honored by the National Philanthropy Committee as 
"Outstanding Founder in Philanthropy"; the same year St. John's named him its 
outstanding physician. This year the clinic -- which many thought would 
eventually have to be funded by county taxpayers but instead exists on 
fund-raisers, some state help and private foundation grants -- also honored 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Ruth, a daughter, two grandchildren, a sister and a 
brother, who ask donations in his name to the clinic at 604 Rose Ave., Venice 
90291.

Orange County's head librarian, who earned a reputation for cultivating 
multi-ethnic library services for a changing public, has been selected as Los 
Angeles' city librarian, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Martinez Smith, 47, becomes the first Latino to direct the city's 
63-branch system. She was appointed to the position, with its $105,000 annual 
salary, after a nationwide search to replace city librarian Wyman Jones, who 
resigned to go into publishing. 
</P>
<P>
It was Smith's commitment to cultural diversity and outreach in libraries that 
appealed to Los Angeles, said Mayor Tom Bradley, who praised her work toward 
"people-friendly" libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries are only useful if they are used," Bradley said. "They cannot be 
utilized if people are intimidated by them." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who lives in Upland, told The Times that working in Los Angeles holds 
special appeal because "the library has an opportunity to become a haven, a 
beacon for such a multicultural, diverse community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to be a place that people will call their own, where they'll find 
expressions of their own culture and ability to learn about others, whether 
that's books, music or art, or literacy." 
</P>
<P>
Her Orange County colleagues wished her well on her new assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all take much pride in this recognition of Elizabeth's abilities and 
accomplishments so amply demonstrated in her tenure as Orange County 
librarian," General Services Agency Director R.A. Scott said in a memorandum to 
Orange County supervisors. "Elizabeth will be a tough act to follow." Scott 
added later that he has not yet decided how to replace Smith. 
</P>
<P>
She does not begin her new job until sometime in June, and Scott said that in 
the meantime, he will meet with the supervisors to discuss a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
During her 11 years in Orange County, Smith oversaw construction of eight new 
branch libraries, and presided over a system whose cardholders number 58% of 
the population -- one of the nation's highest in a large system. Orange County 
operates 27 branches with a budget of about $24 million. The Los Angeles 
system, with its 63 branches, has a budget of $35 million and a cardholder rate 
of only about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about how she would change that figure in Los Angeles, Smith said: "In 
Orange County, I think the demographics -- generally higher education, high 
income levels -- seem to further libraries, but I don't think that's the only 
answer. . . . That's going to be one of our major concerns: every resident in 
this city should have a library card. (Ideally) if you register at school, you 
get a library card. If you pay for a phone, you get a library card. There must 
be ways you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith will also be supervising the reemergence of the new $187-million Central 
Library, the heart of the city's system, ravaged by two arson fires in 1986 and 
scheduled to reopen in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there's going to be some (fiscal) constraints, but I think the city 
and the populace are behind the new library and community services." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's innovations in Orange County, among them computer services, a 
cost-saving automation program, books by mail, ethnic author lecture series and 
on-site bookstores, earned the praise of this month's California magazine, 
which called her efforts "daring and imaginative." 
</P>
<P>
Before her 11 years in the Orange County system, where her most recent salary 
was $78,000, she worked for 13 years in Los Angeles County's public library.
