A woman and four children from Newcastle, Me., got a bonus when they went to 
visit the White House. President Bush pulled them out of the line of people 
awaiting a tour of the mansion to see the six puppies born March 17 to Bush's 
English springer spaniel Millie. On returning home after giving a speech at a 
Washington hotel, Bush went to the White House public tour area and invited the 
first people in line to see the puppies. Leading 8-year-old Julia Bensen by the 
hand, Bush ushered the group to an enclosed pen where the puppies were playing. 
"Aren't they cute?" he asked the little girl, who was accompanied by her 
mother, her brother and two friends. Bush told the tourists that the surprise 
was "a little dividend for waiting in line" to see the White House.

Sergei Petrov is happy about the way things are developing for him. Petrov, a 
Soviet photographer, is being allowed to immigrate to the United States after 
an eight-year quest. "I will believe this is all over once I step off that 
plane in America," the photographer said after receiving the authorization. 
Petrov, 36, became known in New York and Paris through exhibits of his 
black-and-white photos of daily Moscow life. Former President Ronald Reagan met 
Petrov during his trip to Moscow last May.

Even though he did not get the job he wanted, former Sen. John Tower has work 
to do. The Texas Republican, who failed to win Senate confirmation to become 
secretary of defense, has been appointed to the board of directors of New York 
publisher Macmillan Inc., its parent company, Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC, 
said in London. Tower has also resumed posts as chairman of Maxwell 
Communication subsidiary Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publications 
Inc. and of U.S. Armed Forces Journal. Tower recently signed with publisher 
Little, Brown to write a book on relations between presidents and Congress.

Barbara Lambert of Chicago was interrupted when she was preparing her income 
tax return Saturday. It was then that she learned that she was one of four 
holders of winning tickets in Illinois' record $69.9-million Lotto jackpot. "I 
was flipping the tickets over and over, grumbling that I was going to blow $25 
and not even match a single number, and there it was," Lambert said. Two 
winners came forward Monday to claim their $17.4-million shares of the payoff. 
The fourth winner has contacted lottery officials but delayed claiming the 
prize. Lambert said she would split the money with her sister, Linda, of Forest 
Lake. SHIRLEY MARLOW

SCHOOL BOARD GRAPPLES WITH BLACK-LANGUAGE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one at Tuesday's school board meeting argued with the fact that too many 
black students in San Diego city schools speak and read standard English 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
But an uncertain Board of Education danced around the controversial issue of 
whether such students should be helped by creating separate classes to teach 
them standard English. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators admitted that not enough is being done for black 
students who come to school speaking a nonstandard English learned at home, 
known as Ebonics, which most researchers now recognize as a separate oral 
language with its own rules of grammar and structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efforts Have Lagged Recently 
</P>
<P>
But rather than special language training, which might involve pulling black 
students out of regular classes for 30 minutes to an hour each day, the 
administrators suggested a renewal of efforts to make teachers more aware of 
the language gap. Those efforts, while first begun in 1979, have lagged 
significantly among district priorities in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Language-arts administrator Jesse Perry argued that special pullout programs -- 
under way in Los Angeles, Richmond, Fresno and several other districts in the 
state and nationally -- go against San Diego's integration philosophy and rely 
too heavily on work sheets that emphasize grammatical exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Shirley Weber found Perry's report inadequate, saying teachers need 
specific strategies for moving black children from Ebonics to standard English, 
not simply more workshops in sensitivity training where teachers are taught not 
to criticize blacks for having a different oral language background. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, a San Diego State University professor who has researched the Ebonics 
issue, said that if structured second-language type programs such as those in 
Los Angeles work to bridge the gap between home language and standard English, 
they should be pursued. Black achievement, when taken as a group, falls far 
below that of Asians, Caucasians and Latinos when measured on standardized 
tests, and Weber cites the disparity week after week in calling for action. 
</P>
<P>
"What is more important, the integration thing or getting kids to the point 
where after the first or second grade they do not have difficulty" making the 
switch between Ebonics and standard English? Weber asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We take LEP (limited English-proficient) kids out of class every day for 
special instruction. I don't want blacks to be the sacrificial lambs for 
integration." 
</P>
<P>
During the hourlong discussion, other board members appeared to accept Weber's 
view that Perry's proposals are not enough as they heard more of what 
constitutes "black English" and why it differs from regional dialects and other 
language variants that do not have separate syntax and grammar from standard 
English. 
</P>
<P>
But they hesitated in endorsing efforts that would involve black students being 
taught as a distinct group. Trustees Jim Roache and Ann Armstrong were both 
</P>
<P>
bothered by pullout programs because, in Roache's words, "Someone would come 
down here and say we have separate but equal." 
</P>
<P>
Most educators today accept the existence of Ebonics as a legitimate oral 
language, which has its roots in a common West African pidgin that slaves 
developed to overcome differences in their tribal languages and to communicate 
with one another and their English-speaking slave masters. 
</P>
<P>
It is the predominant language among many urban blacks today and is used at 
least some of the time by an estimated 80% of blacks -- not in business or 
professional settings but informally at home and among friends. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of black English phrasing include, "The boy, he be goin' to school." 
"She cain't play till she do her homework." "I ate my toas', den I run to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Most black students have a knowledge of a combination of black language and 
standard English structures to varying degrees, and some are able to make the 
transition to standard English for oral and written communication much easier 
than others, according to Ebonics authorities such as Orlando Taylor of Howard 
University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Bridges Today 
</P>
<P>
But Weber said that though some black students in San Diego city schools can 
make that transition, too many do not and end up as high school students who 
cannot functionally write or read standard English. 
</P>
<P>
When Roache asked Weber how she managed her own transition as a student, Weber 
attributed her success to a combination of luck and the fact that she had black 
teachers throughout her schooling "who knew how to help me make the bridge . . 
. but that isn't true today" for black students. 
</P>
<P>
And, Weber added to a question from colleague Kay Davis, she still uses Ebonics 
in certain social situations, such as at times while talking with her children. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to the point where you switch unconsciously, almost like coding, 
without having to think about it. . . . The ability (to make the transition) is 
tied to exposure, but often that is connected with" socioeconomic status, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weber emphasized to board President Susan Davis that she is not suggesting that 
Ebonics be taught similar to the way Spanish- or Vietnamese-speaking students 
receive social studies or math in their native language while they learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't teach (Ebonics) in a classroom even if you tried; it's not a 
written language, it's not something you would want to learn," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
Roache told Perry he wants to see some "objective assessment of the needs in 
the district. How many students may be out there? If there, we do have an 
obligation, so what are we going to do to address curriculum needs? And is 
there a curriculum out there we can use to do that?"

SDG&amp;E SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. shareholders Tuesday endorsed a $2.4-billion 
stock swap that would blend the utility into Southern California Edison and 
create the nation's largest gas and electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E officials said that, among shares that were voted, the proposed 
merger drew support from at least half of the utility's common stockholders and 
two-thirds of its preferred and preference shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, are expected 
to approve the merger during a meeting Thursday. The merger also must be 
approved by various regulatory agencies, including the California Public 
Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adjournment Feared 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's annual shareholders meeting generated some tense moments for 
SDG&amp;E executives because votes were still being tabulated as the 11 a.m. 
meeting opened. Chairman Tom Page began the session by warning the nearly 900 
shareholders in attendance that the slow-moving vote count might force an 
adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 1 p.m., however, executives announced that the merger had been 
approved by margins required in the corporation's bylaws. Official results will 
be made public this afternoon, according to Jennifer Lewis, SDG&amp;E's manager 
of investor relations. 
</P>
<P>
The vote count was delayed because a New York-based proxy solicitation company 
was slow to forward proxies to SDG&amp;E, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Tuesday's shareholder vote to fold SDG&amp;E into the much 
larger Edison came on SDG&amp;E's 108th birthday. That irony was not lost on a 
handful of SDG&amp;E shareholders, who peppered Page with questions about the 
wisdom of a merger with Edison. 
</P>
<P>
One stockholder pointed to the "firestorm of protest" the merger has generated 
in San Diego County. The shareholder questioned whether the merger is really 
necessary because "SDG&amp;E has made steady, modest progress over the past few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Sources Needed 
</P>
<P>
Page defended the proposal, saying that alone, SDG&amp;E would not be able to 
meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity in San Diego and southern 
Orange counties. "Our rates were going to be trending upward" for SDG&amp;E's 1 
million customers unless new sources of electrical generation were secured, 
Page said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's board approved the proposed merger Nov. 30, largely because it will 
give SDG&amp;E access to Edison's vast electric transmission grid and excess 
electricity generated by Edison plants. 
</P>
<P>
Page repeated his previous claim that 
</P>
<P>
the merger with Edison became a necessity after SDG&amp;E's proposed merger 
with Tucson Electric Power in Arizona fell apart. He expressed doubt that that 
merger will be revived if the Edison merger falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
According to the merger agreement, SDG&amp;E shareholders will receive 1.3 
shares of Edison stock for each share of SDG&amp;E. That swap provides a 23% 
premium for each share of SDG&amp;E common stock, according to the utility. The 
swap would also boost SDG&amp;E common stock dividends by 24% and boost the 
book value per share of each SDG&amp;E common share by 29%, according to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E closed up $.25 Tuesday, at $37.50. SCEcorp closed up $.25 at $32. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pickets Outside 
</P>
<P>
While SDG&amp;E shareholders gathered for the meeting at the Sheraton Harbor 
Island East, a handful of SDG&amp;E employees picketed outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 50 people here," said Dave Moore, business manager for Local 
465 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "They think it's 
important for shareholders to know what we feel about this merger." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who carried anti-merger signs and wore black armbands, gathered 
at the hotel about 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Tom Page and the board are selling all the employees down the 
road," complained John Minto, an SDG&amp;E employee for 31 years. "Page and the 
board were against this merger at the beginning, but then the pot got richer 
for them and they changed their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Minto was referring to lucrative employment contracts that Edison offered Page 
and other key SDG&amp;E executives.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN SENTENCED IN BARMAID'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man imprisoned for a killing in 1983 has been sentenced to another 22 years 
to life in prison for murdering a Pomona barmaid who slapped him. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury took less than one hour to convict Rigoberto Beltran 
Abeja, 30, of second-degree murder. He was sentenced by Judge Robert M. 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Abeja pulled a gun inside the Jack &amp; Jill tavern last June 
19 and shot Nina Rubio, 25, four times from behind after she slapped him 
because he touched her. 
</P>
<P>
Abeja served part of an eight-year sentence for manslaughter in the slaying of 
a man in Bakersfield.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5TH SUSPECT HELD IN DEATH OF GIRL, 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fifth and final suspect has been arrested after surrendering to police in the 
death of an 11-year-old girl who was caught in the line of fire of a gang 
shooting, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old gang member, believed to be one of two triggermen in the Feb. 
25 drive-by shooting, was with his attorney when he surrendered Monday night at 
the Los Angeles Police Department Hollywood Division station, Detective Jim 
McCann said. The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, was held on 
suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
He is the last of five youths to be arrested in the killing of Jasmine Guevara 
and wounding of her aunt as they and Jasmine's 14-year-old sister walked into 
the line of the gang's gunfire near their home in the Pico-Union area. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girls and the aunt had bought popcorn to eat while watching a 
video program and were walking home from a store when a car with four gang 
members drove by and opened fire on rivals standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested previously were a 15-year-old suspected of being the other gunman, two 
16-year-olds and an 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in touch with his family and let them know that we knew about his 
involvement," McCann said of the fifth youth. "We were quite determined to get 
these people."

DEALER ADMITS GUILT IN ART FORGERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego art dealer pleaded guilty Tuesday to six counts of grand theft in 
connection with a scheme that included selling forged works he claimed were 
done by the late Olaf Wieghorst, a renowned Western artist who lived in El 
Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Almeida, owner of the Brentwood Custom Frames &amp; Gallery, entered his 
plea in front of Municipal Judge Robert J. Cooney before the start of a 
scheduled preliminary hearing. Almeida, 49, faces as long as 7 1/2 years in 
state prison when he is sentenced July 20. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Almeida's agreement to plead guilty to six counts, the district 
attorney's office dropped six other counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed on Consignment 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the scheme began in November, 1982, when Almeida 
began selling Wieghorst paintings and sketches placed on consignment by their 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Almeida had the works copied or photographed. The photographed 
forgeries were placed on canvas and shellacked to give the appearance of an oil 
painting. Almeida would then sell the originals and return forged copies to the 
owners. Almeida is not believed to have painted the forgeries himself, 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Lantz Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The works involved are two paintings -- "Watering His Pony," also known as 
"Evening Drink," and "Arizona Trails" -- and a charcoal sketch from 1939 titled 
"Bucking Bronco." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have been able to locate the original "Watering His Pony" and 
"Bucking Bronco," but the original "Arizona Trails" remains missing. So far, 
only two forged copies of the work have been recovered, Lewis said. 
Investigators said the value of the three originals ranges from $8,000 to 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis placed the amount involved in the fraud -- because more than one copy was 
made -- at $200,000 and said Almeida has pledged to make some restitution to 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Produce Painting 
</P>
<P>
Leif Tessem, the lawyer for Almeida, said Almeida hoped the restitution might 
lessen his sentence, but said the money owed is closer to $125,000. Tessem also 
said there is a possibility that the original "Arizona Trails" may be produced 
before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we know where it is," Tessem said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Almeida's scheme was discovered when Dr. Frank L. Pavel, a San Diego dentist, 
became suspicious and took his copy of "Watering His Pony" to Wieghorst and his 
son, Roy, to authenticate it, Lewis said. The Wieghorsts declared it a forgery, 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Almeida first became acquainted with Wieghorst, who died last April 
27, while working as a framer at another San Diego art gallery. He said Almeida 
eventually became Wieghorst's personal framer and later began dealing in 
Wieghorst's art when he opened his own gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney permitted Almeida to remain free on his own recognizance while awaiting 
sentencing, but ordered that he not sell or buy art during that time.

HUNTING WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of those raw, chilly mornings that typify late autumn in the 
treeless beauty of the high plains near Casper, Wyo. My son and I were up early 
in a gently falling snow, surveying the hills and gullies which formed the 
subject of his master's degree research. 
</P>
<P>
Many pronghorned antelope and a few deer grazed nearby, alert but unconcerned 
with our presence. Quite suddenly, we heard the distant but distinct sound of 
light machine-gun fire apparently coming from a neighboring ranch. The gunshots 
were increasingly clear, carried to our location by the soft wind. The deer and 
antelope seemed to have sensed it, as well. 
</P>
<P>
As we crouched low on the slope of a deep gully, peering over the ridge, we saw 
great numbers of antelope racing toward us. The ranch was bordered by 
barbed-wire and when the animals reached the fence many jumped over it. Some 
ran through it and away in frantic bounds along both sides of the gully. Others 
became entangled and impaled upon the wire. 
</P>
<P>
As the sound of hoofs receded, the guns abruptly ceased. The quiet of the 
morning was restored except for the sporadic bleats of the trapped antelope. 
Later, some of the animals were freed from the wire. Others, badly injured, 
were destroyed by the local sheriff and his deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries as to the reason for the machine guns, the legality of the exercise, 
were met with grins and calm assurance. "That's just Ted and some of his boys. 
They sure love to hung with them Uzis." 
</P>
<P>
As I stood there with my son, my mind flashed back to another time years ago 
when I, a young boy, was walking with my father in a Nebraska field. We were 
hunting. I had not yet been allowed a weapon of my own and his, as always, was 
an old Springfield bolt-action rifle with one round in the chamber. Dad's view 
was simple and effective. If the deer was close enough to hit easily, one round 
was enough. If far off, in brush or forest, one shot again was sufficient and 
prudent. Thus a hunter learned to stalk, listen, and shoot well. 
</P>
<P>
And now it is 1989. Purportedly rational men tell us that semiautomatic 
weapons, easily converted to full automatic, are the necessary God-given right 
of all hunters and "sportsmen." 
</P>
<P>
Wars require a broad variety of killing devices. But the plain truth is that 
these massively destructive weapons are of no legitimate use to the mentally 
well hunter or target shooter.

I'm a Chinese-American parent of four college graduates. I'd like to comment on 
the editorial. 
</P>
<P>
From the day my children entered kindergarten through university, I implored 
that they mix as much as possible with their fellow students. White, 
Afro-American, Latino or Asian. I inculcated into their young minds that by 
being friendly to all races during their formative years, it would make the 
transition to adult life and into the multiethnic American mainstream much 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
I told them it was not only the right way, but the American way. 
</P>
<P>
My early advice was well-taken. Today, my four grown kids are successfully 
active in their chosen professions and well integrated into the American Dream.

RACISM ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for its strong editorial. 
</P>
<P>
We live in an increasingly multiethnic country. Long gone are the days when 
predominantly white college students could graduate into a world where they 
need not interact with nonwhites. That being the case, long gone are the days 
when colleges could be a place where white students need not live with or study 
about nonwhites. It was never right. Increasingly, it doesn't even make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial cites a Stanford study recommending required ethnic studies 
courses for undergrads. As you point out, few students take classes about 
facets of American culture other than "their own." Many students experience 
little or no interaction with other ethnic groups and learn little or nothing 
about them in their elementary and secondary years. 
</P>
<P>
This ignorance about others, combined with residential separateness during 
their formative years, breeds much of the racial tensions we see growing on 
increasingly multiethnic college campuses -- especially as young people are 
just beginning to learn who they are themselves. Campus life is a laboratory 
where more than academics must be learned. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-active programs to encourage understanding and appreciation of diversity 
must be accompanied by courses for undergraduates about people and cultures 
other than their own. And they must be required courses, like English and 
mathematics, to be effective and to round out a college education. 
</P>
<P>
Many other pro-active steps are necessary, but at least let's give college 
students an intercultural education and experience. This would be a great 
contribution to reducing the alarming growth of racism in America. It's a step 
we must take -- and soon.

CONSUMING INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shopping list is much like what an American consumer would take to the 
market: toothpaste, razor blades, detergent, shoes, panty hose, among other 
items. The quantities, though, are on a scale that manufacturers dream of. The 
Soviet Union plans to increase its imports of Western consumer goods this year 
by $8 billion, on top of the more than $51 billion already budgeted. Included 
are new funds to buy 300 million razor blades, 10 million compact cassette 
recorders, 15 million pairs of leather shoes, 10,000 tons of toothpaste. It is 
indicative of the growing climate of Soviet consumer discontent that orders for 
these products have gone out, as a deputy trade minister acknowledges, with 
"uncharacteristic urgency." Soviet shops are supposed to start receiving this 
bounty within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And then? And then, so Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other 
advocates of economic reform hope, the idea should begin to percolate through 
the labor force that the regime's repeated promises of a higher living standard 
have some credibility after all, and that harder work can bring greater 
material rewards. A contented worker, so the argument runs, will be a more 
productive worker, and increased output and productivity are vital if Soviet 
economic stagnation is to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in making consumer products more available doesn't mean that the 
Soviet Union's traditional spending priorities, with their emphases on heavy 
industry and the military, have been abandoned. But clearly the emphasis has 
shifted somewhat, toward a greater willingness to spend more hard currency to 
try to reduce some of the chronic and, lately, worsening shortages in the 
consumer sector. 
</P>
<P>
One of the considerations that helped to spur this long-debated change was the 
defeat suffered in last month's national elections by a number of senior 
Communist Party officials, in many cases after they -- and the party -- were 
criticized in public forums for the growing scarcity and shoddy quality of most 
consumer products. Even before then, the seriousness and urgency of the problem 
were a matter of public discussion. As a columnist in the increasingly 
outspoken Moscow News wrote earlier this year, "It is clear to everyone that if 
the country is not supplied in the next few years with foodstuffs, and people 
with clothing, shoes, furniture, electric appliances and so on . . . all faith 
in perestroika will evaporate and the party will be deprived of the people's 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
High-level opposition to spending more on consumer imports remains, however. 
Traditionalists prefer to see the billions of dollars in credits the Soviet 
Union has obtained from the West used for machinery and other capital goods. 
The reformers counter that unless purchasing patterns are changed to provide a 
broader flow of consumer products the labor force will have no motivation to 
work harder. The decision to spend more on imports this year doesn't mean the 
argument has been finally settled. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives can be expected to insist that a bigger budget for consumer 
imports must show a prompt return in the form of higher productivity and 
expanded output. Otherwise, presumably, they will try to have the experiment 
branded a failure and insist that the old spending priorities be restored. 
Demanding such a regressive step may be a lot easier than taking it; any 
attempt to snatch back from consumers the little more that they have been given 
could surely be expected to deepen popular resistance, cynicism and resentment, 
making things worse than they were before. The opponents of reform may think 
that the spigot of high-quality consumer goods that is being opened can simply 
be turned off if things don't go the way they would like. It can be, if that is 
what the regime wills, but perhaps only at the cost of inviting a political 
explosion.

TIME OOZES ON AT VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigations into the tanker Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska's Prince William 
Sound on March 24 will continue for months, but the angry comment of one 
fishing boat captain on April 12 helps to explain a major part of the problem: 
"We are out here working our hearts out without accomplishing anything because 
there's no one in charge and that's the real problem." 
</P>
<P>
That was nearly three weeks after the grounding of the Exxon Valdez on Bligh 
Reef. On the next day, Admiral Paul A. Yost, the commandant of the U.S. Coast 
Guard, arrived in Valdez to take charge of the federal government's role in the 
cleanup of the 240,000-barrel oil spill. At last, someone could be seen 
actually giving some orders. Still, Yost was only in charge of the federal 
government's role in the cleanup, not in charge -- period. President Bush had 
declined, and continues to decline, to take full control of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Up until Yost's arrival, Exxon still had not issued any comprehensive cleanup 
plan. In fact, the giant oil firm did not do so until last weekend, after Yost 
had demanded one. Even then, both Yost and Alaskan state officials questioned 
the sufficiency of the plan to clean crude oil from beaches only in Prince 
William Sound. By this week, the slick had spread well beyond the sound, as far 
as 250 miles from Valdez, and had lapped onto the shores of two national parks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one in charge." That seems to have been a critical problem from the 
moment that the Exxon Valdez ran onto the reef a little less than three hours 
after leaving Valdez, the terminal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, with 
1.26 million barrels of oil aboard, bound for Long Beach. At the outset, 
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of seven oil companies that 
operates the pipeline and oil terminal, was responsible for responding to an 
oil-spill emergency. The consortium's prepared contingency plan had offered 
assurance that any spill in the sound would be contained within five hours. It 
was clear that a speedy response was critical. But Alyeska's standby emergency 
oil team was abolished in the early 1980s to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard log of the oil spill tells the rest of the story. More than 
seven hours after the accident, at 7:27 a.m. on March 24, an Alyeska helicopter 
reported observing a slick 1,000 feet wide and 4-to-5 miles long. At 9:50 a.m., 
the Coast Guard noted that Alyeska boats were under way with estimated arrival 
at the Exxon Valdez at 1 p.m. The first Alyeska equipment actually arrived at 
2:30 p.m., and the ship was not finally surrounded by a containment boom until 
11 a.m. on Saturday, March 25, or 35 hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Had any such spill occurred in San Pedro Bay as the Exxon Valdez navigated into 
the Port of Long Beach, the Coast Guard would have been immediately and fully 
in charge. This is what should have occurred in Valdez on March 24. Nearly one 
month afterward, this is still what should occur.

LIKE SO MANY TEXAS POLITICIANS, WRIGHT'S RUT LANDED HIM IN MUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not any fun unmasking Jim Wright anymore. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain delight in depomping the more gaseous representatives of the 
political species, but only when they are fully inflated. Once they start 
twisting in the wind, the party's over. Where's the sport? When the old 
amusement gives way to the first pangs of pity, there's nothing left but the 
formalities. Whatever verdict his colleagues in the House may pass down, The 
Hon. Jim Wright has been found out; the rest is anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz" is a great book -- but only until Toto draws back the 
curtain and the Wonderful Wizard of Oz is revealed as a poor, pitiable mortal 
with a good public relations program. Then all the author has to do is tie a 
few loose ends together and get Dorothy back to Kansas. The suspense has gone, 
and with it any sense of indignation or satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard not to think of Jim Wright as the Speaker of Oz, and by now he 
incites not scorn but pity. Oh, he's still pontificating. His 
denials/excuses/sentimentalities are as numerous as ever, but the curtain has 
been drawn back. Soon even congressmen will have to admit the transparent, or 
deny it so unconvincingly that they will indict their own judgment -- and their 
own institution. 
</P>
<P>
L. Frank Baum could have written the Speaker's lines at this point: "I didn't 
do it, but if I did, I didn't mean to, and doesn't everybody do this sort of 
thing, and how dare you?" If the audience is supposed to feel pity for this 
poor, defrocked wizard, it cannot hope to match the Speaker's own self-pity, 
which is now as thick as his bluster was before. He's reached the point of 
rolling out his wife and family. It is not pleasant to watch. Pathos has become 
bathos. 
</P>
<P>
There is still something in this petty affair that is satisfying to expose, and 
that is the attitude among the oh-so-knowing in press and politics that it 
really doesn't matter if a Speaker of the House takes a little baksheesh. It is 
explained sotto voce, just between us sophisticates, that this fuss over ethics 
is a luxury, considering the really important issues facing the country -- like 
the drug war, environmental protection and what to do with Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
It's a terribly sophisticated attitude, with the emphasis on terribly. Because 
it shows not the vaguest understanding of the importance of an ethical standard 
in leaders and thus in a society. Has Watergate been so long ago that the 
country has forgotten that a government without character is soon enough a 
government without conviction or credibility? Ethics is not an afterthought in 
society, much as it has been treated that way in this one. It is the 
foundation, as those who ignore it will find out soon enough. And that is the 
moral of this story.

BOLD YET FRUSTRATED IN CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
AS COUNTRY STRUGGLES, IT FINDS REVOLUTION, REFORM DON'T MIX BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS TERRILL, Ross Terrill's two most recent books on China are Mao and 
Madame Mao: The White-Boned Demon, both just published in Chinese in China. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It doesn't pay to speak," the dissident journalist Wang Ruoshui said to me in 
Beijing, "and also, to have spoken proves of no use." Yet he has been speaking 
out. Like other intellectuals, Wang, a protege of ousted Communist Party leader 
Hu Yaobang who died Saturday, is at once bold and deeply frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the mood in China is mixed. There is an appreciation of the benefits 
of the 1980s reforms, in rural areas especially where farmers' incomes have 
risen fourfold in a decade, but a lack of clear agreement on the next steps. 
Living standards and expectations are rising, yet there is pessimism about the 
political system. There is now a surge of sympathy for Hu, the boldest reform 
leader, but it comes three years too late to salvage his role in China's 
struggle to modernize. 
</P>
<P>
This ambiguity has two causes. Modernization -- in any country -- is a 
deceptive beast that changes its skin as the seasons pass. And China is ruled 
by a Communist regime that, in economic affairs, wishes it wasn't one. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders who still cling to shreds of orthodoxy, like Premier Li Peng, say 
paternalistic things that clash with the logic of economic policy, of which 
party chief Zhao Ziyang has been a bold champion ("Without reform, China will 
lose the right to exist on the globe.") Meanwhile, senior leader Deng Xiaoping 
sits enigmatically on the mountaintop, watching his younger tigers jostle 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent policy innovations are intriguing. A start is being made to turn 
urban housing into a commodity, instead of a highly subsidized, state-owned 
virtual freebie. And in the land where Mao made a revolution, shareholding is 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The worrisome thing is that few innovations are carried through. A regional 
airline arises to give the state company, CAAC, a taste of competition -- but 
it remains so hamstrung that CAAC is not challenged. Small business is 
encouraged to provide needed services and lower unemployment, but the small is 
forbidden to grow into the large. Shareholding is designed to give workers 
incentive to excel, but workers are not permitted to sell their shares until 
they retire or leave the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's blunt speech at the recent parliament session showed he is putting 
reform under such pressure that it is in danger of remaining a token. As a 
token it can't produce great results. Yet, if reform goes beyond the token 
stage, it challenges the Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
A China that 40 years ago "revolutionized" itself has for the past 10 years 
been trying to "reform" itself. This is a startling idea. At minimum, 
reform-after-revolution suggests that something went wrong with the revolution; 
indeed, this is the near-universal view in China. But the big question remains 
of what the goal of reform-after-revolution can be. 
</P>
<P>
Can the goals be clear if, as I suspect, modernization has edged aside 
socialism as the prized value? 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese communists used to toss aloft the colored balls of "class 
struggle"; today they prefer the metal-and-plastic toys of "the four 
modernizations." But modernity is an ever-changing destination. The process of 
modernizations creates a diversity of interests, experience, expectations and 
values. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the problem of Deng's reforms -- and the reason for the mixed mood 
-- is that the revolution set in place a Leninist political system, while 
reform is seeking to set in place a commodity economy -- and the two don't mix. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party hides the fact that politics and economics are tugging in 
opposite directions by a fancy theory -- "Preliminary stage of socialism." This 
concept justifies small business, family farming, shareholding and all the 
other unsocialist things that so excite the Chinese government and people 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Marxism isn't suitable for China," a leading economist said with agitation. As 
if wary of his own conviction, he climbed back to political safety: "Of course, 
one day it will be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Preliminary stage of socialism" is simply a delaying device to satisfy 
orthodox communists who insist that the words of Marxism still have a meaning. 
It is somewhat akin to saying that the preliminary stage of sleeping is being 
wide awake. 
</P>
<P>
Although China's rulers know that communism has run dry as a fount for future 
policy, and in economic policy have their feet on an un-Marxist path,? they are 
still China's rulers. Liking their own power, they are not about to step aside 
for any non-Leninist, alternative rulers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, either economic reform will bring substantial political change, or 
political nonchange will cripple the economic reform. In my view, the latter is 
almost certain. Li Peng is certainly responding to severe problems of inflation 
and corruption, which worry the Chinese people. But to stand still now would be 
perilous. And the basic reason for not pressing ahead is that the Leninist 
system -- backed by Zhao as well as Li -- might be put at risk by further 
substantial opening up to market forces. 
</P>
<P>
China's most basic need is for economic and political freedom, and some of its 
intellectuals are belatedly starting to say so. A bold young electrician, Wei 
Jingsheng, is in a prison, wasted and ill, serving a 15-year sentence for 
saying that, without democracy, Deng's goal of modernization will not be 
attained. In February a group of Chinese intellectuals -- including journalist 
Wang Ruoshui -- signed a petition asking for his release. No wonder this sad 
case lives on. Wei was put away because he uttered a very unpalatable truth.

GOP ACTIVIST FILES TO OPPOSE BELEAGUERED WRIGHT IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Larkin, a veteran Republican activist and former Simi Valley Chamber of 
Commerce president, has filed papers to oppose embattled Assemblywoman Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) in the 1990 primary. 
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that he was leaning toward running but planned to make his 
decision this weekend and announce it Monday. He would be the first candidate 
to challenge any San Fernando Valley area lawmaker in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to talk to a few more people," said Larkin, who added that he has been 
considering a possible GOP primary bid in the far-flung and strongly Republican 
37th Assembly District since January but began exploring it seriously only this 
month. He submitted documents to the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
on Monday that will allow him to begin raising money 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, 52, who is first vice chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central 
Committee and a member of the state GOP committee, could be a formidable 
opponent because of his party and business connections. He has managed three 
successful Simi Valley City Council campaigns and would be poised to cut into 
the heart of Wright's strong base in the city of 101,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antagonized Colleagues 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 59, a five-term lawmaker and former Simi Valley mayor, is considered 
potentially vulnerable to a well-financed Republican challenge because she 
antagonized Republican colleagues in Sacramento in December and is under 
investigation by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
Wright caused a furor among GOP lawmakers in December when she refused to 
support their bid to replace Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
with Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon of Whittier, one of five Democrats who had 
opposed Brown's leadership. Wright said she abstained because she had promised 
constituents that she would not vote for any Democrat for Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury launched his inquiry in March to determine whether Wright improperly 
sought to intervene with Simi Valley police, judges and the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles to keep her frequently ticketed daughter Victoria from losing 
her driver's license or incurring other penalties. Bradbury is expected to 
issue his report next week. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright, who has received 27 traffic tickets since 1981, lost her 
license on March 9. She began a 30-day jail term on Monday for violating the 
conditions of her probation for a traffic offense. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright, who has known Larkin about 15 years, declined through a 
spokeswoman to comment Tuesday on his possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downplays Probe 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, a father of four who owns a State Farm Life Insurance Co. agency in 
Simi Valley, downplayed Bradbury's probe of Wright's efforts to aid her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a parent," Larkin said. "I can empathize with that." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would make Wright's ties to Brown the focus of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Republican, and when I go to vote in the primary next time, I want to go 
and vote for somebody other than a friend of Willie Brown," said Larkin, who 
calls himself a pragmatic conservative. "She's cut herself out of the 
Republican Party in Sacramento and has associated herself with the Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that he would need to raise at least $200,000 for a viable 
campaign in a district that stretches from Lompoc in Santa Barbara County to 
Lancaster in the Antelope Valley in northern Los Angeles County. Reaching this 
goal, he said, "might be possible." 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, a Simi Valley resident for 21 years, managed the campaigns of Jim Smith 
and Dave Rees for the Simi Valley council in the 1970s and Councilwoman Vicky 
Howard in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin is the second Republican activist to express interest in challenging 
Wright. Robert Wilcox, 23, a former aide of Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette 
(R-Northridge), has been exploring a primary bid for a month. Wilcox said 
Tuesday: "The response has been very good. I'm still looking at it."

Lobbying by builders and real estate interests dealt a blow Tuesday to efforts 
to prevent the building of homes and other community structures near garbage 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
A state Senate committee approved a watered-down version of legislation that 
would place some limits on new homes within 2,000 feet of landfills in the San 
Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
But state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) was forced to scale back his initial 
proposal, which sought a ban on new homes within half a mile of existing or 
proposed dumps anywhere in the state. Robbins narrowed the focus to landfills 
in the Valley area, including a proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised proposal, the city of Los Angeles or Los Angeles County would 
be required only to hold a public hearing when homes, hospitals, schools or 
day-care centers were proposed within 2,000 feet of an operating or proposed 
landfill. If safety and health risks had been addressed by the builder, local 
governments could approve construction. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate Housing and Urban Affairs Committee approved the revised bill 
by a 5-1 vote, sending it to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins predicted that by forcing local governments to hold a special hearing, 
residents would be alerted and given "an opportunity to raise opposition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Councilman's Request 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced at the request of Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson to protect Elsmere and Towsley canyons from "encroachment by 
residential uses." Los Angeles is considering both canyons for possible 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Greig Smith, a Bernson aide, said the goal for the measure was also to prevent 
new dumps from eliciting the kind of community opposition that led to the 
closure of Mission Canyon Landfill in the Sepulveda Pass and that threatens to 
block the proposed expansion of the Lopez Canyon dump in the north Valley. 
Smith said he hoped the revised legislation would nonetheless be strong enough 
to prevent construction of homes around Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins' proposal sparked objections from the California Building Industry 
Assn., the County Supervisors Assn. of California and the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Shelby, lobbyist for the real estate association, said his group opposed 
the measure because it would place an unfair burden on landowners by 
restricting land use around dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics maintained that current environmental reviews provide adequate 
safeguards and that it is not necessary to hold separate hearings on projects 
near dumps. After Tuesday's hearing, they said it was unclear whether they 
would continue to oppose the amended version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The scope of his mischief has been dramatically reduced," said Donald Collin, 
lobbyist for the Building Industry Assn.

TRAUMA CENTER CLOSURE PLAN SENDS OUT SHOCK WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Memorial Hospital may have difficulty treating additional patients 
that could flow in as a result of the closing of a trauma center at St. Joseph 
Medical Center in Burbank, officials of the Pasadena facility said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County health officials said Huntington is the closest hospital to 
St. Joseph in the county's emergency services network and likely would absorb 
patients from St. Joseph. St. Joseph announced Monday that it will shut down 
its trauma center because of substantial financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what's going to happen yet, but we're at capacity right now," 
said Maggie McPhillips, a Huntington spokeswoman. "We have really got our hands 
full. We're going to have to see what the county is proposing before we know 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
McPhillips said patients in Burbank and in a large section of the northeast San 
Fernando Valley served by St. Joseph may be too far away to be treated quickly 
and effectively at Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
McPhillips added that the hospital is treating between 50 to 60 trauma patients 
a month. St. Joseph serves an average of 55 trauma patients a month. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph officials have scheduled a news conference today to discuss the 
facility's withdrawal from the county's troubled emergency services network. 
St. Joseph has not officially notified the county that it intends to close the 
center. By law, it must give the county 60 days notice. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price Hastings, chief of paramedics and trauma hospitals for Los 
Angeles County, said each hospital's trauma care unit serves a zone. If 
Huntington is unable to absorb patients from St. Joseph's area, the patients 
would be taken to the nearest emergency room or hospital outside the network 
that offers trauma care. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, patients would be taken to Burbank Community Hospital or other 
24-hour emergency rooms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Next Closest Hospital' 
</P>
<P>
"When a center pulls out of the network, we have to look at the next closest 
hospital," Hastings said. "We hope we can prevent a domino effect, but there 
will be a significant fallout because the area won't have the services of a 
trauma center any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Huntington, the closest trauma centers to St. Joseph in the emergency 
network are Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the expected withdrawal, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors voted Tuesday to submit a plan by St. Joseph officials to the 
county Department of Health Services to revise criteria for participation by 
hospitals in the trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
That change would include having physicians on call. The county requires a 
hospital in the emergency services network to have a neurosurgeon and other 
trauma-care specialists on duty 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Health Services officials were asked to study the plan and report 
back within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel H. Fahey, St. Joseph's senior associate administrator, said the hospital 
would continue to provide some trauma and emergency care when the trauma center 
shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to employees in February, Fahey said the hospital's financial 
losses resulted from "grossly inadequate reimbursement by the county" for the 
hospital's participation in the trauma network. The hospital lost $1.5 million 
annually over the last five years on the program, officials said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND BEATEN TO DEATH IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Awoman found dead Monday in her Canoga Park home was identified Tuesday as 
46-year-old Barbara Shanks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman appeared to have been beaten in the upper body, Los Angeles Police 
Detective Patrick Conmay said. Los Angeles County coroner's office supervisor 
Claude Boucher said Shanks probably died of "blunt force trauma to the head." 
</P>
<P>
Conmay and coroner's office investigators said the exact cause of death had not 
been determined. An autopsy was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Shanks' body was discovered about 11:30 a.m. Monday by a friend who entered the 
home in the 6500 block of Comanche Avenue looking for her, Conmay said. Shanks 
probably died sometime in the two days before her body was discovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said there were no suspects in the case.

CLARK HAS BIG NIGHT FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
EX-GIANT SPARKS 4-2 VICTORY OVER SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a funny way, it makes him feel at home, this angry wind and these angry fans 
and the fog that rolls in so thick during the fifth inning, you'd swear the 
parking lot was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a strange, strange place," Jack Clark said of Candlestick Park early 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But he said it with a smile. And then he spent the night dancing around the 
joint with a two-run homer, a single, a couple of fine fielding plays, and even 
a stolen base in leading the Padres out of their three-game losing streak with 
a 4-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants in front of 11,509. 
</P>
<P>
None of the previous six Padre victories have ended without an appearance by 
Mark Davis and this one didn't either. Davis replaced Padre starter and winner 
Walt Terrell in the ninth after Robby Thompson had opened the inning with a 
ground single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
With his best stuff of the season -- and even in this young season that's 
saying something -- Davis struck out Will Clark on a pitch at which Clark swung 
so hard, he twisted himself into the ground. Then Kevin Mitchell looped a fly 
ball to right for a certain second out, except Marvell Wynne overran the ball 
and then dropped it on the foul line for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped potential winning run Candy Maldonado. But Davis fooled him on a 
curveball that he rapped to third baseman Luis Salazar, who started a 
game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
Davis now has a six saves in six save opportunities. And Terrell, who allowed 
just six hits in eight innings, has his first National League victory since 
September of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But most of Tuesday's memories belong to Clark, who entered the game hitting 
.171 with one homer and eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Mark Grant said, "This must have been great for him. To have a 
nice day against a team that traded him, it feels great. It's just natural." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fans here spent the night booing Clark, just as most of them booed 
him in the series opener Monday, just as they will probably boo him here for 
the rest of his natural life. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you hear them," said Clark, who was a mouthy young superstar here with 
the Giants from 1975-1984. "But that's just these people. I can't count how 
many times guys from the Dodgers would go up in the stands after these people. 
These people booed Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear them. But you don't." 
</P>
<P>
And so he didn't in striking a line drive shot over the left-field wall on an 
0-and-1 pitch from Giants' starter Rick Reuschel in the fourth inning for his 
season's second homer, also scoring Tony Gwynn, who had earlier singled. 
</P>
<P>
The guy who chased down the home run ball was such a Clark fan, he threw the 
ball back over the fence and on to the field. Clark, who had just given the 
Padres a 2-0 lead, and was followed two batters later by Benito Santiago's 
second homer, never seemed to notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's beyond hearing or thinking what the fans think," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps Clark was trying to make a mental imprint of what he just did. With 
an earlier single off Reuschel, he just had two hits off a pitcher who 
previously in his career had held Clark to five hits in 42 at-bats (.119). 
There's nobody Reuschel loves to face better. And nobody Clark hates worst. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just the start of a night of milestones. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack Clark reached third base in the second inning after his first steal 
this season and a throwing error by catcher Terry Kennedy, it was the first 
time a Padre had reached third base in 22 innings. Clark didn't score, but what 
the heck. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's homer represented the Padres' first extra-base hit in 28 innings, and 
their first run of any sort in 24 innings. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget Clark's defense, which he admits is sometimes an easy thing to 
do. He made a good catch of a Terry Kennedy grounder in the first inning and 
actually started a double play on a Brett Butler grounder in the sixth, 
catching Butler's grounder, stepping on first, and throwing to shortstop Garry 
Templeton who placed the tag on Ed Jurak. 
</P>
<P>
"That great defense tonight really helped," said Terrell, now 1-2 with a 3.10 
ERA. "Of course, they had better play good defense when I pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of pitchers, the other guy, Reuschel, entered the game as 6-foot-3, 
230 pound, balding pain in the Padres neck. His off-speed, sinking, thinking 
kind of pitching had fooled the Padres like no other could. Of 28 decisions 
against the Padres in his 17-year career, he has won 20 times, with a 2.72 ERA. 
Last season he beat the Padres four times in five starts with a 2.59 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year he had beaten the Padres once, opening night, when he held 
them to three runs on six hits in six innings. He did nearly the same thing 
Tuesday night. But this time, it seemed the Padres finally figured him out. 
They hit him harder, waited him out longer. This time, when he left after six 
innings having allowed three runs on four hits, he was trailing 3-1. And for 
some reason, he looked less like a Padre killer and more like the third oldest 
player in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
He set the Padres down 1-2-3 in the first but then allowed a Clark single to 
left to open the second, just Clark's eighth hit this year. He then allowed 
Clark to steal a big lead, and then second base. His first steal equaled his 
entire number of steals in each of the years from 1984 through 1987. It so 
shook up Giants' catcher Kennedy, he bounced the ball into center field and 
Clark ran to third on the error. Reuschel struck out John Kruk while Clark was 
stealing, and then struck out Santiago and Flannery on amazingly slow pitches 
to end the inning with the Padres still scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Things quickly changed in the third inning, though, with Clark and Santiago's 
heroics. And a couple of innings later Reuschel was gone, only to be replaced 
by rookie Jeff Brantley, who promptly walked Tim Flannery to start the seventh 
and later allowed an RBI single by Marvel Wynne for the Padres final run. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
A quick look at some of the more fun Padre league rankings entering Tuesday 
night, none of which should surprise anybody. Yes, they were the worst fielding 
team in the entire major leagues, with a major league leading 18 errors and a 
26th-best fielding percentage of .968. The pitching staff has been hit more 
consistently than any other in the league, as opposing teams have a .261 
batting average. They've allowed more homers than any team in baseball -- 16 -- 
or more than one per game. Offensively, they ranked next-to-last in the league 
in on-base percentage (.290) and have been shut out more than anybody in league 
(three times). Perhaps to show how much opposing pitchers fear them, a Padre 
batter has been intentionally walked just once, which is more than only the St. 
Louis Cardinals, who had yet to have an intentional walk. But not all is 
terrible. The Padre pitchers have struck out more hitters than any staff in 
baseball -- 96, for an average of 6.8 strikeouts per game. And the Padres, who 
have stolen nine bases, are the only team who has not yet been caught stealing. 
. . . Last week Cincinnati's Hall of Fame ex-catcher Johnny Bench noted that 
the best indication of Benito Santiago's effectiveness is the number of 
baserunners who do not attempt to steal against him. "How many guys does he 
intimidate?" asked Bench. The early returns say, many. In Santiago's first 12 
games, runners attempted to steal just four times. San Francisco's Brett Butler 
and Houston's Gerald Young have been safe, while Santiago threw out the Giants' 
Jose Uribe and Atlanta's Andres Thomas. "I don't understand why more guys 
aren't going on me," Santiago protested. "All I can do is throw the ball. Why 
don't they take more chances? It is crazy." Right. And Santiago's amazing 45% 
success ratio of throwing out runners last year -- 35 of 77 -- also was crazy . 
. . . How bad is Candlestick Park for visiting team? Forget that the visitor's 
dugout contains no heat, unlike the home dugout. Forget that the visitors can't 
escape to the warmth of their clubhouse because it is not attached to the 
dugout, unlike the home clubhouse, which is attached. The hardest part for the 
players is still what happens on the field, as is illustrated in this story by 
Rick Monday, the Padre broadcaster who played here for many years with the 
Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. "I was chasing down a fly ball in center field and a 
gate in the fence blew open and I ran right through it and outside of the 
fence. When I turned to go back on to the field, the gate blew shut, and I was 
stuck outside the fence while the ball was rolling around the outfield and the 
guy was running around the bases. I tell you what, this park is really unfair."

LATEST SETBACK IS BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR BUTZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Butz has reached the point in his football life where he's become the 
game. Free as a 305-pound bird, ready and seemingly eager to be bagged by the 
highest bidder, he may be the only player in National Football League history 
twice able to sell his services in a mostly unrestricted market. Coming to the 
Washington Redskins and, perhaps, going. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions about where Butz might play next season, if he plays at all, are 
oil-slick slippery. With two Super Bowl rings, he might be the sort of 
on-the-field and clubhouse presence a contender covets. He also might be a few 
hundred thousand dollars, or two twisted knees at defensive tackle, away from 
his 15th season as a Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
There is one certainty: this free-agent experience will not be remotely as 
rewarding as his last. The leverage this time is on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
As he expected, Butz did get a letter from the Redskins the other day. 
Registered no less. But it apparently was little more than a glorified howdy. 
Nowhere was there mention of a qualifying offer about next season's pay. 
</P>
<P>
For a man who will turn 39 about a month before any NFL training camp opens, 
this is not pleasant news. It means that the Redskins are fairly certain either 
27 other teams will not woo him with much passion or that he will not be a 
major factor if somebody does meet his price. 
</P>
<P>
While not putting it in writing, the Redskins are suggesting Butz could once 
more try to earn a place here -- but on their terms. It's demeaning, 
essentially making a man bigger in ways other than size beg for a job, but not 
to the degree that it seems at first glance. Even if he's let go, Butz has a 
parachute suitable for a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
Butz is in the phase-out portion of a gutty and lately glorious career; if they 
can get away with it, the Redskins will refuse to pay him regular wages 
(estimated at $500,000) for what might well be part-time work. Playing-time 
incentives always could be part of any contract at a drastically reduced base 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say the Redskins and everybody else insist the last member of the Over 
The Hill Gang actually is over the hill. A player with as much service as Butz 
is entitled to $150,000 in severance pay. It's the sort of league-wide gesture 
(earned through tough bargaining) once offered only by George Allen, the man ho 
brought Butz to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's big business, baby," Butz told The Washington Post's Tom Friend. "Here 
today, gone tomorrow. It doesn't matter how many times you played hurt. It 
doesn't make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Pro football certainly is a bigger business than when Butz arrived, though 
perhaps actually less cold to the hired hands. How long has Butz been around 
the Redskins? Well, about 14 years longer than lots of fans imagined and at 
least a few teammates hoped. When his colossally wide feet first dented 
Redskins' sod, in early August 1975, John Riggins was still a New York Jet. 
</P>
<P>
Free agents in the NFL were even less free when Butz made his escape from St. 
Louis. The price he fetched, two first-round draft choices and a No. 2, still 
is considered the largest compensation ever, wildly exorbitant even for Allen. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and Redskins offered equally flattering contracts; double his 
salary with the Cardinals and all of it guaranteed, Butz said. Allen's offer 
was the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
What Allen paid in draft-choice terms seemed especially outrageous because Butz 
had missed all but one game the year before with as ugly a knee injury as 
anyone his weight can suffer. For many, the deal was typical Washington 
overspending -- Allen's answer to the $400 screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
Butz is fairly certain some Redskins conspired against him almost as much as 
opposition guards and centers during his early years here. He thought it 
strange that his tackle partner, Diron Talbert, called so many audibles during 
combat that Butz never recognized. He would hesitate, just a fraction of a 
second, but long enough to be embarrassed and for Talbert's buddy, Bill 
Brundidge, to be sent into the game. 
</P>
<P>
So Butz more than anything has been a survivor. From serious knee surgery. From 
teammates trying to delay his ascent as long as possible. From coaches and 
players around the league who whispered he was not quite inspired enough to 
reach his full potential. He's outlasted nearly all his critics and 
contemporaries. Randy White, a child of 36, announced his retirement from the 
Cowboys last week. 
</P>
<P>
Butz can be enigmatic. Some friends thought he would retire gracefully after 
last season, when the Redskins seemed to be hinting that might be a fine idea 
after he set the record for consecutive games played; suddenly, he was talking 
not only about another season but also all but crawling to training camp. 
Incredibly, he described the scourge of all veterans, that annual intrusion 
into the offseason, mimicamp, as "fun." 
</P>
<P>
Often unapproachable, Butz can be delightful. After returning an interception 
26 yards, to the one-yard line, against the Bears in 1981, Butz said one of his 
concerns was being whistled for delay of game. He always adds that it took the 
offense two cracks to advance the ball that measly extra yard into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
More than any Redskin, Butz has watched the experience he now faces. Business 
as usual in the business of sport.

NOAH'S SLUMP CONTINUES IN JAPAN; CURREN, GOMEZ FALL

<P>
Until he ran into an American buzz saw in the April 7-9 Davis Cup quarterfinals 
in San Diego, France's Yannick Noah was playing some of the best tennis of his 
life. And some of the best tennis being played in the world in the months of 
February and March. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, he lost in straight sets to John McEnroe and Andre Agassi and 
also lost in doubles as the United States prevailed, 5-0. Tuesday in Japan, in 
his first competition since San Diego, Noah was eliminated in the second round 
of the $752,000 Suntory tournament by unheralded American Glenn Layendecker. 
</P>
<P>
Layendecker, a Californian who was born in Stanford, lives in Portola Valley 
and is a 1983 graduate of Yale, pitted his No. 99 world ranking against Noah's 
No. 13. Layendecker won, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Layendecker attributed his upset of the No. 4 Noah to "a 
combination of Noah's off form and my consistent serve-and-volley game." 
</P>
<P>
Also upset were No. 6-seeded Kevin Curren and No. 7 Andres Gomez of Ecuador. 
Curren lost a marathon to Richard Matuszewski, the 25-year-old former Clemson

</P>
<P>
Pat Cash, former Wimbledon champion from Australia, making a comeback after 
resting a sore elbow for three months, got past Grant Connell of Canada, 4-6, 
7-6 (12-10), 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Carlsson of Sweden, top-seeded player in the $200,000 clay-court Swatch 
Open in Nice, France, lost in the first round. Italy's Claudio Pistolesi 
defeated the world's No. 6-ranked Carlsson, winner of five clay tournaments in 
1988, 6-0, 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I won this tournament two years ago, and I was looking forward to it," 
Carlsson said, "but he was the better player today." 
</P>
<P>
Henri Leconte of France, last year's champion in Nice, struggled to get past 
qualifier Cedric Poline of France, No. 465 in the world, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, seeded third in the $200,000 Eckerd Open in 
Largo, Fla., was upset by unseeded Donna Faber, an 18-year-old from Bradenton, 
Fla., who didn't turn pro until this year's Australian Open. Faber won, 6-3, 
1-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina escaped from a first-set scare to 
defeat countrywoman Bettina Fulco, 7-5, 6-2.

MORNING BRIEFING: COACH SAYS ABBIE HOFFMAN WAS A CONSERVATIVE ON COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sportscaster Bud Collins was the first tennis coach at Brandeis University, 
where his No. 3 singles player was Abbie Hoffman, the 1960s radical who died 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbie and I didn't get along then," Collins told Newsday's Stan Isaacs. "I 
guess it was because he didn't like authority figures. When I first met the 
squad, he said, 'I'm the captain.' They had had a club team, so he figured that 
he would pick that title up again. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'No,' and he didn't like that. I was jealous of him because he had a 
better car than I did -- which he got because he was a pretty good 
entrepreneur. He was in charge of pizza sales on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoffman later emerged as a leader of the radical left, Collins said 
Hoffman was a conservative on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"As a tennis player, he was a right-winger," Collins said. "He played a 
conservative style, never attacking at the net. He was a retriever, running 
down balls. He was pretty good as a singles player, not losing a match as I 
recall. He took it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to build character; I didn't realize the kind of character I had 
built." 
</P>
<P>
Only in Hockeywood: Now that Jack Nicholson has discovered the Kings, columnist 
Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post says the National Hockey League has 
truly arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the future of sports in America," Kornheiser wrote. "It is Jack 
Nicholson pounding on the glass sideboards at a Kings' game. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw it, didn't you? It made all the highlight packages. The Cuckoo Man his 
ownself, leering devilishly, smacking his palms on the glass in exultation at 
the Great One." 
</P>
<P>
The Other Woman: In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Margo Adams listed 
the pros and cons of being the mistress of a major league baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the best thing about being a baseball mistress was getting good 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
The worst aspect?: "Going home by yourself at the end of the road trip." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Boggs' wife, Adams said: "I think she should give Wade a good 
shaking. I hope everything works out for her." 
</P>
<P>
You Know You're Old When: Warren Spahn, retired major league pitcher, was 
signing autographs when a youngster approached. 
</P>
<P>
Spahn, 66, noted that the young fan hadn't even been born when he was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"You're getting old and you're going to die soon and it's going to be 
valuable," the young fan replied. 
</P>
<P>
Gag Order: Ken Griffey Jr. has been declared off limits to reporters by Mariner 
Manager Jim Lefebvre so that Griffey can concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The night the gag order started, Griffey hit his first major league home run in 
his sixth major league game. Griffey's father hit his first major league home 
run in his 12th game.

SCOTT OSTLER: NEGATIVE OUTLOOK IS PERFECT -- UNLESS YOU'RE DODGER FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Mr. Negative . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What's with that twinge in Orel Hershiser's right arm, Mr. Negative? It hit 
him his last two starts. He and the team doctors play it down, but give it to 
us straight -- is this anything to worry about? 
</P>
<P>
 Only if you're a Dodger fan. We're not talking about a twinge in Tom Lasorda's 
arm, are we? Or Fred Claire's. 
</P>
<P>
Twinges can be tricky. San Francisco once was destroyed by a twinge in the San 
Andreas Fault. If you're halfway to Hawaii and the pilot of your 747 announces 
that a slight twinge has been detected in the cargo door, do you go right back 
to sleep, or do you ring your flight-attendant call button and ask for a 
parachute? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this twinge is something Orel can work out by playing Ping-Pong, but 
maybe it's something that will eventually require a delicate and risky 
twingeotomy. 
</P>
<P>
As the old saying goes, baseball is a game of twinges. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry is angry with his Met teammates because they're devoting too 
much time to playing cards and golf. He says, "We don't get paid to play cards 
and golf." Your reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 Those players have lousy agents. Most baseball players do get paid to play 
cards and golf. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I can't understand why Darryl is taking such a strong stand against 
baseball tradition. Cards and golf have been popular with ballplayers since 
baseball was invented. Managers insist only that players refrain from cards and 
golf while the baseball game is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
The last ballplayer who said he was going to give up cards and golf and find 
something better to do with his time was Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with parking-lot attendants these days? Mike Tyson parks his limo 
in the wrong space at a nightclub and the attendant gives him static. Tyson is 
a tough hombre. Why didn't the guy simply back off? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Tyson parked his limo on the guy's foot. 
</P>
<P>
 First Jeffrey Leonard had his flaps-down home-run trot, and now he has his 
"sling-trot," where he carries one arm as if in a sling. What next? 
</P>
<P>
 After his next home run, Hac-Man will put on aviator goggles and a flowing 
scarf, and circle the bases on a moped. Of course, the very next Mariner batter 
will get a high, inside fastball lodged in his left nostril, but that's 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two sleazy sports agents, Norby and Lloyd, were you glad to see them 
brought to justice? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, those are the fellows who were convicted of using cash to lure 
athletes into signing improper contracts, and threatening to harm the athletes 
if they tried to renege. Gee, that sounds like a description of standard 
college athletic recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
How can you cheat a cheater? Punishing people for doing unethical things to 
big-time college athletic programs is like sending a guy to the electric chair 
for short-changing Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are getting the shaft from the schedule maker so far. They open 
the season with a horrendous trip, then open at home the afternoon after a 
night road game. Most of the players are very upset. Mickey Hatcher calls it 
"the worst schedule I've ever seen in the history of baseball." What should the 
Dodgers do? 
</P>
<P>
 Hire several violinists. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to last year's nail-chewing, steel-whiskered, tough-guy World 
Series champeens? 
</P>
<P>
Those guys, you could've sent on a trip by Greyhound and they would have showed 
up snarling and ready to play ball. Have the Dodgers regressed to the days when 
team performance would fall off if the postgame wine was improperly chilled? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they are trying to enlist public sympathy, which should be no problem, 
even though they're the highest-paid team in the big leagues at an average 
salary of $852,518. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the lads. For years it was the Angels who 
whined about getting jobbed on the scheduling, and look at how much good that 
complaining did for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm worried about Fernando Valenzuela's zip. Has anyone clocked slower this 
year on the Dodgers radar speed gun? 
</P>
<P>
 Only Nancy Reagan. And it was close. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela also clocked slower than Mike Scioscia, the plate umpire and Roger, 
the peanut vendor. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are sensitive about this. They are still steamed at the unknown 
wise guy who, just before Valenzuela's last start, painted a happy face on the 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidential to Desperately in Need of a Kind Word: 
</P>
<P>
 Love to help, dude, but I've got a twinge.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
THE AMAZING METS AREN'T -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently, Manager Davey Johnson is going to have to hold more meetings. He 
held one after the New York Mets, favored to win everything this season, lost 
their second in a row to the St. Louis Cardinals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They responded Monday with a power display that featured three consecutive 
homers and trounced the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
But then, with no meeting Tuesday, the Mets reverted to the poor play that has 
characterized their early season Tuesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt hit a three-run home run and Larry McWilliams, in his first start 
for the Phillies, pitched a strong five innings and the Phillies romped to a 
7-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Dodgers have scored fewer runs than the Mets, who are 4-8. In their 
four victories, they have scored a total of 24 runs, but in their eight 
defeats, they have scored only 17. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams has been a losing pitcher most of his career. The 35-year-old 
left-hander was 6-9 last season with St. Louis. But, fortified with a seven-run 
lead in the third inning, he gave up two hits and walked four before the 
bullpen took over. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt hit his fourth home run of the season and 546th of his career. It came 
off Ron Darling (0-3), who didn't make it through the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Darling, a 17-game winner last season, has pitched 11 2/3 innings, given up 19 
hits and 15 earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were without first baseman Keith Hernandez, who has a groin injury. 
The Phillies lost right fielder Ron Jones, when he hit his knee on the fence 
making a dazzling catch in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Met shortstop Kevin Elster tied a major league record set by Detroit's Eddie 
Brinkman in 1972 when he played 72 games in a row at short without an error. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 11, Chicago 2 -- The Expos have brought the Cubs back to earth with 
two victories in a row at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, who won eight of their first 10 games, lost a tough 2-1 game Monday 
night, but Tuesday night's was over in the first inning, when the Expos scored 
six runs to make it a breeze for Bryn Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach and Nelson Santovenia doubled in runs in the inning. Cub starter 
Paul Kilgus, who managed to retire only one batter, was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks, who singled in the first run, went four for five and drove in two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I think I really hit the ball the way I can," said 
Brooks, batting cleanup and hitting .320. "Ever since we started the season, 
it's been a case of some guys hitting and some guys not. Tonight, we all did it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, St. Louis 3 -- Ozzie Smith continued his hot hitting at St. 
Louis, but the usually flawless shortstop flubbed a ground ball in the ninth 
inning that cost the Cardinals the game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith singled in two more runs in the fourth inning to give Cris Carpenter a 
3-0 lead. In the four games he has played since coming off the disabled list, 
Smith is 9 for 17 and has driven in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals held a 3-1 lead with bullpen ace Todd Worrell on the mound. R.J. 
Reynolds and Jose Lind opened the ninth with singles, but Worrell retired the 
next two batters. Bobby Bonilla hit a grounder right at Smith. The ball bounced 
off Smith's glove and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, in a strong outing, gave up six hits and a run in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's error gave Morris Madden his first major league win. Jeff Robinson 
pitched the ninth to get his third save. The final out was made by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, Houston 4 -- Tommy Gregg's fifth hit of the game, a single with one 
out in the 11th at Atlanta, scored Lonnie Smith and gave the Braves a .500 
record after 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg had two doubles, three singles and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Glavine of the Braves went into the game the only pitcher with a perfect 
ERA in the league. But he gave up a run in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine lost his bid for a third consecutive complete game when Billy Hatcher 
hit a two-run home run with one out in the ninth to send the game into extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, San Francisco 2 -- Walt Terrell held the Giants to six hits in 
eight innings at San Francisco to gain his first victory for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel, winner of his first three starts this season, gave up home runs 
to Jack Clark and Benito Santiago in the fourth inning to lose his first. DAN

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HART'S WEIL TAKES THE HILL, IT'S ZERO HOUR FOR THE OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kym Weil might be the best high school softball pitcher in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask her father. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, don't ask her father. Al Weil is Kym's coach at Hart High, 
and like any doting dad of an only daughter -- and coach of an ace windmill 
whipper -- he is very proud, yet very humble. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the only daughter I have," Al Weil said. "I'm very proud." 
</P>
<P>
See? 
</P>
<P>
For an objective opinion of Weil's pitching merits, try Don Sarno, her personal 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Sarno, a member of the International Softball Congress Hall of Fame and 
"pitching consultant" for about 20 Division I schools, insists that Weil, 
though only a junior, can plan to accept a Division I scholarship next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Kym's one of the top 10 pitchers in Southern California," Sarno said. 
"Effectively, that means the whole country." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Weil certainly holds her own. In her third season, she is 14-1 with 11 
shutouts, including six in a row to start the season. Weil has three 
no-hitters, including two perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
Weil pitched her second perfect game Tuesday, striking out 15 as Hart blanked 
San Gabriel, 4-0. She also pitched a perfect game against El Camino Real, the 
defending City Section 4-A Division champion. Her only loss was to Righetti, 
which scored an unearned run in the sixth inning to defeat Hart, 1-0, in the 
championship game of the Righetti tournament. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Weil whipped Schurr, 5-0, pitching a no-hitter with 13 strikeouts. 
Two days earlier, Weil yielded five hits in a 7-0 win over Burbank. Hart is 
16-1 overall and leads the Foothill League with a 3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Weil has struck out 178 of the 332 batters she has faced and walked just eight. 
Most impressive, however, is Weil's earned-run average. She doesn't have one. 
</P>
<P>
Through 100 innings, Weil has not allowed an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Weil says, trying to explain her scoreless streak, "all of us are 
working together. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know. It's weird. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
It's Weil. Last season, her ERA was 0.30, her freshman year, 0.89. Weil's 
career record is 49-13 with 566 strikeouts in 395 innings. This season, she 
recorded four shutouts in the Hart tournament, notching 60 strikeouts in 27 
innings. And, of course, zero earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
"That streak is going to end sometime," Al Weil said. "And I've talked to Kym 
about it and she knows that. But she knows if she gives up a run and we win, 
that's all that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Weil attributes her success to working with Sarno and former Hart Coach Dennis 
Ford, the father of UCLA pitcher Samantha Ford, who pitched at Hart from 
1982-85 and posted a 0.00 ERA and 18 shutouts in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"She has just developed a work ethic you wouldn't believe," Ford said. "She 
does aerobics and lifts weights. She has improved so much."

<P>
Darren Lloyd's two-run double in the sixth inning snapped a 2-2 tie and lifted 
Ventura College to a 6-2 Western State Conference win over visiting Moorpark on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark also threatened in the sixth, but sophomore right-hander Shane Espitia 
struck out Dan Smith with the bases loaded and the Raiders came away scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura added two runs in the seventh on a single, an error, David Eggert's 
scoring fly ball and a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
John Chiaramonte (5-3) gave up nine hits and five runs to suffer the loss as 
the Raiders (20-13, 9-7 in conference play) lost their third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Espitia (6-2) gave up two runs and six hits to pick up the win for Ventura 
(25-8, 13-3). RALPH NICHOLS

FAT'S ON THE FIRE AT SDSU; 
</P>
<P>
LUGINBILL'S NEW CONDITIONING PROGRAM HAS ESPECIALLY TARGETED THE WEIGHTIEST 
MATTERS

<P>
Would the people who tinkered with the scale in the San Diego State weight room 
please fess up? 
</P>
<P>
The fulcrum of the balance arm must have been moved, because some of the 
weights that have registered lately could not be correct. 
</P>
<P>
Already this spring, Joe Heinz, a sophomore offensive tackle from Chula Vista 
High, has been seen weighing in at 255 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, Little Joe tipped the scales as much as Hoss did -- around 
330. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Carlson Leomiti, who weighed 368 in January, passed up his 
final semester at Banning High to come to SDSU and then passed on 50 pounds. 
And he expects to lose 30 more by the end of spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
Senior offensive tackle Chuck Hardaway reportedly haschucked 35 pounds from a 
frame that once carried 310. 
</P>
<P>
Something's awry. The figures don't figure. 
</P>
<P>
How can a football player who loses 75 pounds in 3 1/2 months be expected to 
deliver a crushing block, let alone survive one? 
</P>
<P>
Has Coach Al Luginbill, who used to be a wall at 220 pounds but now is just a 
rail at 175, been watching too many Richard Simmons Shows? 
</P>
<P>
What's going on, or coming off, at SDSU? 
</P>
<P>
It's simple. To borrow Bill Murray's line from the movie "Stripes," Luginbill 
wants a lean, mean, fighting machine. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be carrying around excess baggage if you're going to play football," 
he said. "However, I certainly don't want them looking like me. 
</P>
<P>
"I like them to be big, don't get me wrong. But we want them in shape. I've 
never seen a football team, in my mind, that can play a physical football game 
if it is not in top condition." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill wants a top-conditioned team, and a top 20 team. One of the first 
things he said after being named coach in November was that the Aztecs should 
have a big-time program. He said SDSU should be banging heads with, and 
beating, the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first actions he then took was to reduce some of his big players. 
</P>
<P>
He implemented a mandatory off-season conditioning program for all of them. And 
he ordered Heinz, Hardaway and Leomiti to go on diets with this edict: Shape 
up, or you will no longer be an SDSU football player. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Bressler, who specializes in internal medicine, and Margaret Forys, 
a nutritionist, were consulted to provide personal programs, and the players 
were to report to Dave Ohton, the conditioning coach, for weekly weigh-ins. A 
five-pound-per-week loss was the minimum requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Losing so much weight over a short period was a concern, but Ohton said, "I was 
not worried about them becoming anorexic or having any health problems because 
they were under constant supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little concerned with their initial loss in strength, but that will 
come back. They will be just as strong as before and a lot more mobile." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill was so adamant about the program that when Hardaway was overweight 
one week, he was suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't actually believe he was on a diet," Ohton said. "When (Luginbill) 
suspended him, (Hardaway) had a hard time dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hardaway: "Coach was pretty upset. He said that Hardaway didn't have the 
desire to be here. I had to prove to him that I wanted to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Hardaway, I don't think you'll make it.' I don't think he meant 
it, but he used it as a motivational thing. It took a lot of will power and 
turning away a lot of meals, but I made it. Today, I'm a handsome, slim, trim 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Well, he's 275 and moves much better than he did at 310, as does Leomiti, who 
arrived at SDSU from Banning in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when Leomiti first showed up," Ohton said, "he was approaching the 
370 mark. And he couldn't run a lap to save his life." 
</P>
<P>
Now, says Leomiti, "I feel real good. I feel my stamina has increased a lot. I 
don't get nearly as tired as I used to." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Leomiti potentially stands to lose the most weight, it is Heinz who has 
everybody wondering what happened to his other half. 
</P>
<P>
He is the poster child of Luginbill's first conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
His secret: "Two Lean Cuisines a day and a little exercise." 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," he said. "No more fast food. I think the main contributor to all 
my weight was fast food. Roberto's at Broadway and H in Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Heinz said he was 275 as a sophomore, 285 as a junior and 310 
as a senior, when he made the all-section second team in 1986. Last season as a 
redshirt freshman, he weighed as much as 332. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, I didn't think it was that bad," Heinz said. "I felt I could 
still play at that weight." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill disagreed. "At the weight these guys were at, they were of little use 
to our football team," he said. "Now they'll be able to make an impact." 
</P>
<P>
Heinz started his weight loss program with a goal of 260 pounds on Dec. 20, his 
19th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Bressler advised him away from certain foods and told him to watch his intake 
and get plenty of exercise. Heinz stuck to his diet and began losing chunks of 
weight, sometimes daily. 
</P>
<P>
At first he weighed in daily, but once he proved his effort was sincere, he 
needed only weekly checks. Ohton says that Heinz was concerned about getting 
weighed only once a week. He wasn't sure if he could do it. But he did, losing 
about seven pounds per week. 
</P>
<P>
At one of those weigh-ins, Ohton recalls Heinz was supposed to weigh 308.2 
pounds and had weighed 305 just a few days before. But when he stepped on the 
scale for the official weight, he was at 309. 
</P>
<P>
Ohton, who normally would have punished Heinz with extra running, decided to go 
easy on him because he knew Heinz had been working hard and had been under the 
weight two days before. 
</P>
<P>
After Heinz left, Ohton said, "He called about 10 minutes later and said, 
'Would it be possible for you to punish me?' I couldn't believe it. He said it 
just like that: Would it be possible for you to punish me? 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it was OK, just make the weight tomorrow. And he said, 'I promise 
to be under tomorrow or else you can punish me double.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was the funniest thing I had heard in a long time. But I didn't want to 
laugh because he was dead serious." 
</P>
<P>
So is Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Blyth, a senior center, ruptured a tendon in his right knee Tuesday at 
practice. He will be operated on this morning at Mercy Hospital by team 
physician Dr. Robert Straumfjord. Blyth, who was moved to nose tackle last 
season from the offensive line, was moved back to the offensive line this 
spring by Coach Al Luginbill. He will miss the rest of spring practice but 
should be back by the fall.

SPORTS ET CETERA: ATHLETES IN ACTION WILL MOVE OPERATION TO CINCINNATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athletes in Action will move its operation from San Diego to Cincinnati this 
summer. AIA, a Christian-advocacy organization that played a schedule of 
college teams in exhibition games, had moved from Vancouver, Canada, to San 
Diego in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes as part of a structural and leadership change within the 
national organization. The national offices also will be moved to Cincinnati 
from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The AIA will operate a West Coast branch in San Diego and continue to offer 
summer camps and its three-on-three tournament. 
</P>
<P>
AIA will move to Cincinnati with no coach and only one confirmed player -- 
Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rle Nichols left the team in January and AIA is searching for a coach and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
AIA was 83-49 in four seasons in San Diego. The organization was in Vancouver 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, the top-ranked women's tennis player in the world, will compete in 
the $200,000 Great American Bank Tennis Classic at the San Diego Tennis and 
Racquet Club July 31 to Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Graf became only the fifth player to win tennis' Grand Slam -- the Australian, 
French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon -- last year. This will be her only tournament 
appearance on the West Coast this year. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hudson and Shawn Jamison, both of Pratt Community College near Wichita, 
Kan., signed national letters of intent with San Diego State Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison, 6-foot-8, had verbally committed to the Aztecs last Tuesday. He 
averaged 19.9 points and 9.2 rebounds for Pratt. Hudson, a 6-2 guard, averaged 
13.8 points, five rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison is a graduate of Gahr High in Cerritos. Hudson prepped at Los Angeles 
Washington. In 1987-88, both played at Casper College in Wyoming where they 
finished sixth in the national community college tournament. Last season, they 
led Pratt to a fourth-place finish in the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
GOLF 
</P>
<P>
Judy Furst of Palm Desert holds a two-stroke lead going into today's final 
round of the San Diego Women's Classic at the Chula Vista Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Furst shot a 37 on the front nine Tuesday, then came back with a 35 on the back 
nine for a combined score of 72. Teresa Schreck and Kim Saiki followed at 75. 
</P>
<P>
Shelly Tulao, a Chula Vista amateur, is among a group of three golfers three 
back at 75. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego scored seven runs in the third inning, including back-to-back home 
runs by Gary Fessia and Jim Martinez, to lift the Tritons over visiting 
Pomona-Pitzer, 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the third, eight batters reached base, the first seven scoring, before 
Fessia's grand slam and Martinez's solo home runs. The Division III 
eighth-ranked Tritons improved to 18-14. Pomona-Pitzer dropped to 7-21-1. Rick 
Rupkey (8-3) picked up the win. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Bruce Moutaw hit a three-run homer in the ninth to get US 
International close, but the Gulls (16-27) still fell to UC Riverside, 7-5, in 
a nonconference game. Scott Einhorn hit a solo homer for USIU. 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego broke its 15-game losing streak by winning the second 
game of a doubleheader with UC Irvine, 1-0. UC Irvine won the opener, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
DISTANCE RUNNING 
</P>
<P>
Ultra distance runner Sarah Fulcher of Pacific Beach will run in the 
Soviet-sponsored Pravda International Super Marathon June 15-30 in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Fulcher, an assistant track coach at Mission Bay High, is one of 10 Americans 
on a relay team that will run 1,000 miles -- approximately 20 miles a day per 
runner -- beginning in Tynda, 200 miles east of Lake Baykal in eastern Siberia. 
The marathon will finish at Pyongyang, on the border of North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
There are 12 teams, mostly Eastern bloc countries, running in the relay, 
according to Fulcher, 27. The race is a warmup to the May 1990 "Run Down 
Russia," a 16-city, 3,100-mile, four-month race that Fulcher has spent five 
months organizing.

<P>
The San Diego Select Team player selection committee has extended invitations 
to 20 area high school basketball players as San Diego prepares to play host to 
the AAU/Soviet 1989 Junior Boys' Basketball Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen local players will be picked for the May 13 game against the Soviet 
Union. Camp begins Monday at Torrey Pines High School, and the cuts probably 
will be made by the end of the week. Kearny's Bill Peterson will coach the 
team, assisted by John Farrell of Torrey Pines, Dennis Kane of San Diego High 
and David Ybarra of Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 who received invitations: Brooks Barnhard (Escondido), David Berteaux 
(La Jolla), Carlos Campbell (Sweetwater), Tony Clark (Valhalla), Darren Cox 
(Torrey Pines), Kevin Flanagan (Torrey Pines), Terrence Hamilton (Patrick 
Henry), Clark James (San Diego), Chris Johnson (Crawford), Adam Jones (Poway),

Meek (San Pasqual), Courtie Miller (Torrey Pines), Milton Miller (San Diego), 
Todd Swanson (El Camino), Will Tate (Southwest), Joe Temple (Lincoln) and Aaron 
Wilhite (Lincoln). 
</P>
<P>
The game will likely be either at Mira Mesa High School or Serra; it was hoped 
it would be in the San Diego Sports Arena, but a conflict with the Sockers has 
made the building unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's representatives for the Griggs Cup -- the high school division of 
the Ojai Tennis Tournament -- have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
In singles, the section will be represented by Marco Zuniga (St. Augustine), 
Jeff Miyamoto (Patrick Henry), Mike Miringoff (San Dieguito), Paul Dyson (La 
Jolla), Gene Carswell (Mt. Carmel), Tim Clark (San Marcos), Francisco 
Santillian (Hilltop) and Sean Willette (Serra). 
</P>
<P>
Doubles teams are Mike Kestler-Chris Swortwood (Torrey Pines), Dan 
McKenzie-Jeff Bethard (La Jolla), Ignacio Martinez-Pablo Zaragoza (St. 
Augustine), Eric Tebbs-Jeff Young (San Pasqual), Bruce Timm-V. Gonzago (Mt. 
Carmel), Oliver Davidian-Kevin Berry (Poway), Gil Bolton-Chris Hickson 
(Bishop's) and Nathan Schaedler-John Wadleigh (Coronado). 
</P>
<P>
The Griggs Cup will be contested April 27-29. 
</P>
<P>
Best line from the recruiting season comes from Aaron Wilhite of Lincoln, who 
signed a national letter of intent Monday to play basketball at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of stress, but we ate real good," Wilhite said of the 
recruiting trips. "I gained about 10 pounds. We had steaks, prime rib and 
lobster just about every day." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite was the first county high school basketball player to sign with a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I school since the beginning of the 
spring signing period Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Add recruiting: Granite Hills point guard Mark Phillips, who was recruited 
locally by Christian Heritage College, has signed a national letter of intent 
to play at Cedarville (Ohio) College, an NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, 5-feet-11, averaged 16.8 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last add recruiting: Beau Pack, an All-City Eastern League basketball player 
for Point Loma, has signed a letter of intent to play for Chapman College in 
Orange, his father said . 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pack said his son, a 6-5 forward, selected Division II Chapman because of 
its sports medicine program and the fact that Bob Boyd, former USC coach, has 
just taken over the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Weber State, Irvine and Pacific were among other schools that expressed 
interest in Pack, Jim Pack said. 
</P>
<P>
High School Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Price of University City leads the state with a long jump of 24-4 3/4. .

Great Western Financial Corp.: The Beverly Hills-based financial services 
company reported first-quarter earnings of $57.2 million, compared to $56.1 
million for the 1988 period. The firm's net interest income, the primary source 
of operating income, reached a new quarterly high of $230 million, a 14% 
increase. The firm said it generated a 63% increase in new real estate loan 
volume during the quarter, at a time rising interest rates and weak deposit 
flows resulted in the withdrawal of many companies from the mortgage lending 
market.

WRITER'S 18TH-CENTURY LOVE AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ciji Ware laughingly confessed that she could not remember her subject for that 
afternoon's broadcast on "The Wink &amp; Bill Show" on KABC Radio. She said 
this while walking at a fast clip through a rose garden, heading back to the 
books on 18th-Century England that line her desk at the Huntington Library in 
San Marino where she is one of three novelists to have research privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Ware, who is the health and life-style commentator for KABC Radio, had already 
written a 90-second radio spot and would broadcast it from home, but she had to 
call the station soon to give them a "lead in" to the broadcast. She did not 
seem worried or harried about forgetting her subject. It would come to her. 
There would be time. She would get it done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real juggling act," she said of her life. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her involvement with her husband, Tony Cook, and her 17-year-old 
son Jamie, Ware, who has been with KABC Radio for 12 years, also finds time for 
a regular round of speaking engagements and appearances. Until baseball season 
started she was hosting and producing "Ciji Ware's World of Books," a KABC 
Radio talk show with novelists. 
</P>
<P>
And in March her first work of fiction was published. "Island of the Swans" is 
an 18th-Century historical novel based on the life of the Duchess of Gordon, a 
Scottish woman and confidante of kings and queens. The book, published by 
Bantam Books, is doing well, Ware said. Bantam has printed 500,000 paperback 
copies and has shipped out almost 400,000 of them. Ware has already started 
work on her next book, another 18th-Century novel set in London's theatrical 
world. She had started her day with a 6:40 a.m. broadcast on birth control 
pills and surgery from her Beverly Hills home for "The Ken &amp; Bob Company." 
Then came the 45-minute drive to the Huntington Library where she does her book 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Not until she got home shortly before "The Wink &amp; Bill Show" broadcast and 
looked it up did she remember her subject of the day: news of a study on 
children born late in the year. The study counseled parents not to enroll their 
children early for their first year of school. 
</P>
<P>
It would turn out to be a typical, frenzied week for Ware. All told, she 
delivered 10 original 90-second spot broadcasts for KABC, spoke at a luncheon 
meeting of the Town Club in Pasadena on the process of writing a historical 
novel, signed copies of her book over tea at the Tudor House in Santa Monica 
and, dressed in a gown made from 12 yards of Clan Gordon taffeta, attended the 
MacLeod Scottish Rant, or ball, in South Pasadena where she gave a reading from 
her novel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born in Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
Corlis Jane Ware (her brother shortened it to Ciji in childhood) was born in 
Pasadena 47 years ago and moved with her family to Carmel in 1954. She was 
graduated from Harvard in 1964 and majored in Renaissance History, but she 
spent more time in musical comedy and ended up as the first female dance 
captain of the Hasty Pudding Club. "I was not what you would call a brilliant 
scholar. I wish I'd been an 18th-Century history and lit major." 
</P>
<P>
Her interest in that century came later. She developed a career in radio and 
television, reporting and producing, often on consumerism or public affairs and 
wrote for magazines. She married and then separated from her first husband 
after the birth of their son, Jamie. They have amicably worked out joint 
custody, she said, although that experience led her to write a handbook on 
joint custody, "Sharing Parenthood After Divorce," in 1984. She also won a 
local television Emmy in 1977 for a program on children whose own parents 
kidnap them during custody disputes. 
</P>
<P>
She has Alex Haley to thank for the new direction in her already busy life. 
After Haley's "Roots" was published, Ware was one of many Americans inspired to 
look into her own background. Earlier, Ware's great-grandmother, Elfie 
McCullough, had told her stories of their Scottish roots. 
</P>
<P>
Ware started her genealogical research here, made a few trips to Scotland and 
kept coming across tantalizing references to the Duchess of Gordon, also known 
as Jane Maxwell, including one discovery that a remote McCullough married into 
the Maxwells of Monreith, Jane's family. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Maxwell was an impoverished aristocrat who was in love with two men who 
loved her. She married one of them, had a daughter by the other, clung to her 
independence and was fascinated by the male world of politics. In her early 
research, Ware discovered that Maxwell had been an informal adviser to William 
Pitt, King George III and Queen Charlotte, and that she had been a patron of 
poet Robert Burns. Profoundly influential in arenas usually closed to women, 
Maxwell was at the same time an ambitious mother who married off her daughters 
well, tapping into the United Kingdom's short supply of dukes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous in Her Day 
</P>
<P>
She was, Ware said, "as famous as Jane Fonda in our day" but had all but 
disappeared from history by the time Ware found her. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Ware thought of writing Maxwell's biography, but instead chose to 
fictionalize her life. "I'm a storyteller who has to be accurate about the 
details. I'm not a historian," Ware said. But she was careful to base her 
Maxwell character on what actual historical letters revealed. "I never put in 
anything I knew to be untrue and took intelligent guesses based on my 
research," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, it was Ware's personal experience of such seemingly 20th-Century 
concerns as divorce, child support and custody that made her feel connected 
with Maxwell. "Early on I discovered her parents had separated and the mother 
and girls were struggling with no money in Edinburgh. The mother was writing 
begging letters to the father saying 'the children have no shoes.' I thought, 
'God, nothing has changed,' " Ware said. Saying she identified with Maxwell, 
Ware added, "I think she always felt fragmented, as so many woman do, between 
the needs of family and her own desire to chart a course for herself based on 
her talents. It's a modern dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on a bench under a shade tree in the rose garden at the Huntington, 
Ware reflected on the recent changes in her life. "The change really started 
when I began working on the book. I drove over here three or four times a week. 
I was cloistered in this beautiful place, facing the quiet. It was a time to be 
a lot more reflective. There were no deadlines except the ones I imposed." 
</P>
<P>
"Island of the Swans" is only the beginning. She has another three historical 
novels in mind, all set in the 18th Century. She is at work on one on the world 
of the theater, knows the characters for the novel after that, and said she 
will set the third in the Hudson Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Boisterous Age 
</P>
<P>
She said she loves the 18th Century "because it really was a boisterous age." 
She added, "Certainly women in an educated echelon were very much a part of the 
culture, using their talents more than in the 19th Century. It was the time of 
the enlightenment, of political and social ferment. . . . It must have been a 
really exciting time." 
</P>
<P>
"Islands of the Swans" is making the rounds to producers, and Ware says there 
is some interest in turning her book into a mini-series. If a deal is struck, 
she said, her husband, who is a screenwriter and free-lance journalist, would 
be involved in the production. 
</P>
<P>
The recent speeches and appearances Ware has made to promote the book aren't 
that much of a change for her. Ware's life was already very public and active. 
</P>
<P>
Although she calls her life fragmented, there are times when all the fragments 
come together. And it happened one morning last week at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There she was shortly after sunup on the day of the Dodgers' home opener, and 
she was broadcasting live from home plate with the rest of "The Ken &amp; Bob 
Company." She was wearing a blue Dodger jacket with "Ciji" emblazoned on the 
back and she was far removed from Scotland, the Duchess of Gordon and the 18th 
Century. A high school band was practicing, she said, and some of the parents 
were in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
A woman called out to her, "Hey, Ciji, I read your book." 
</P>
<P>
Beaming as she recounted it, she went on: "I said to myself, 'This is the best 
thing. It is so rewarding. So satisfying.' "

JACK SMITH: YOUR KITSCH MAY BE MY KITCHEN SINK 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As I do every year, I dropped in the other day on the women of the Pasadena Art 
Alliance to catch them in the frenzy of preparing for their annual treasure 
house sale. 
</P>
<P>
This year the sale is not being held in an old house but in the vacated Gene 
Burton store at 505 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena. They're calling it the Super Souk, 
souk meaning an open-air marketplace in North Africa or the Near East. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered through the store's various spaces was what looked like the yield of 
every garage, basement and closet in the northeastern area. Near the entrance 
was what they used to call their "garage" area. "Now we call it the attic," 
someone told me. 
</P>
<P>
It was a jumble of objects that looked as if they had outlived their usefulness 
or hadn't quite worked out: typewriters, toasters, sewing machines, waffle 
irons, scales, bicycles, clocks, power tools, a water polo ball, baseball bats 
and numerous sets of skis and ski boots. I had an idea that skiing was high on 
the list of things that didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Rising from a bed of roses on a cluttered table was a pink plaster of Paris 
nude. A straw hat leaned against her ankles; a large butterfly was perched on 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't believe that anyone would buy such junk. Peggy Phelps said, "Our 
motto is that one person's junk is another person's treasure." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked, "Have you seen the piano tuner?" 
</P>
<P>
There were hundreds of baskets and dozens of framed prints -- a beach scene by 
Henri de Kruif, Monet's water lilies, man in cowboy hat and raincoat by Michael 
Schwab. Dogs in chic clothing sat at a bar, drinking, in a 12-foot mural. Very 
high kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Haines had the book section pretty well in hand. She showed me some 
treasures: Milton's "Paradise Lost," illustrated by Gustave Dore; Pearl Buck's 
"All Men Are Brothers," illustrated by Miguel Covarubius. "But Enough about 
You," by Cynthia Heimel (author of "Sex Tips for Girls"), was on display and 
opened to a chapter titled "What Makes Women Tick." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know women ticked," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"We purr," said Haines. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a cozy corner," I said of a corner with a sofa and an easy chair, a rug 
with animals on it, a large standing globe of the ancient world, a brass 
machine that looked as if it might be a wine opener, and a silk-screen print of 
a mounted cowboy by Bill Schenck (said to be worth close to $2,000). 
</P>
<P>
"Interesting you'd say that," Phelps said. "We call it the men's corner." 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Bohr got a bottle of Pouilly-Fume to show me how the opener worked. It 
had a wooden base, a steel shaft and a brass head with a handle. She fitted the 
bottle into the head and worked the handle up and down. It pushed the cork into 
the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
"It does work," she said, exasperated. "I know it works." 
</P>
<P>
The racks in the boutique were already bulging with the rages of long-past 
seasons: beaded flapper frocks, a flapper dress of lace with appliqued velvet 
flowers; a purple felt hat, a gray fedora, a pith helmet, a blond wig. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody will buy them," I was assured, "and give them back next year." 
</P>
<P>
In the dining room section Vicki Baker was polishing English china. "Everything 
has to be shining clean," she said. "It's probably the only part of the sale 
that's that way." 
</P>
<P>
A table was covered with bags and envelopes of sachet. "You put your undies in 
a drawer with this stuff," said Sally Hurt. She picked up a conch shell and 
blew into it. It made a sound like a French horn. Phelps said, "I thought only 
little boys on Polynesian islands knew how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Bohr caught up with us. She was lugging the wine opener and had a new 
bottle of Pouilly-Fume. She fitted the bottle into the opener and worked the 
handle. The cork came out. She worked the handle again. The cork was replaced 
in the neck. "I told you it worked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The public sale takes place Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 
4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know whether I want the plaster of Paris nude or the bottle opener.

FEAR OF FUSION: WHAT IF IT WORKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When two scientists announced last month in Utah that they had achieved 
room-temperature nuclear fusion, the news shot through the halls of science 
like a scalded cat. "It was," one Berkeley physicist said, "like seeing your 
car suddenly jump on the roof." It was that unexpected and stunning. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the first waves of astonishment, wonder and euphoria have passed, 
a few scientists, environmentalists and ecological activists have begun to have 
more troubling thoughts. For one thing, they say, even if desktop fusion really 
works -- a matter still very much up in the air -- it is unclear that the power 
produced will be as cheap or clean as many have suggested it might be. 
</P>
<P>
And even if it were, given society's dismal record in managing technology, the 
prospect of cheap, inexhaustible power from fusion is "like giving a machine 
gun to an idiot child," Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich says. 
</P>
<P>
Laments Washington-based author-activist Jeremy Rifkin, "It's the worst thing 
that could happen to our planet." 
</P>
<P>
Inexhaustible power, he argues, only gives man an infinite ability to exhaust 
the planet's resources, to destroy its fragile balance and create unimaginable 
human and industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Power to Pollute 
</P>
<P>
That fusion itself may be a clean energy source, especially in comparison with 
fossil fuels, is beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
Not all pollution is caused by burning fuel; there are many other pollutants 
that fast-growing industrial societies throw into the atmosphere -- compounds 
from rubber tires, fumes from drying paint, and hundreds of other byproducts of 
industrial processes. And clean-burning, non-polluting, hydrogen-using 
bulldozers still could knock down trees or build housing developments on 
farmland. 
</P>
<P>
A mere technological change in fuel sources also does nothing to change man's 
attitude toward nature -- what UC Berkeley physicist John Holdren calls the 
"pave the planet and paint it green" mentality. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Holdren says, despite the claims made, there is no guarantee that 
fusion will necessarily be a clean process; in some circumstances it can 
produce deadly neutron radiation and poisonous tritium. Worst of all to some 
observers, its cheap inexhaustible energy would let the planet support many 
more people than its current population of 5.2 billion. And this, they say, 
would be a crowded Earth, without forests, wilderness, open space or the chance 
for solitude. What would the planet be like without "psychological space?" asks 
Richard Charter, a coastal lobbyist and environmentalist who notes that many of 
the aberrations and turmoil of inner cities can be blamed on "just plain 
crowding without hope." 
</P>
<P>
In the euphoria over fusion power, UC Berkeley anthropologist Laura Nader says, 
many people just assume that cheaper, more abundant energy will mean that 
mankind is better off, "and there is no evidence for that." Between 1950 and 
1970, Nader says, there was "a doubling of energy use," while at the same time, 
quality of life indicators all declined. 
</P>
<P>
"The Age of Progress is really an illusion," Rifkin says. Far more people -- 
800 million -- go to bed hungry today than at any time in history. "There has 
never been a previous example of that. And yet we continue to delude ourselves 
with the illusion that this is the Age of Progress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Panacea 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Paul Ehrlich says he has no problem with the notion of cheap, clean, 
inexhaustible power, per se, which could be a tremendous boon to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: Industrialized societies, so far, have not used power wisely. The 
world's limited supply of fossil fuels is rapidly vanishing up smokestacks and 
out tail pipes. Rifkin cites a 1985 University of New Hampshire study showing 
that 88% of the Earth's oil and gas reserves will be depleted by 2025. 
</P>
<P>
And even if fusion turns out as well as it has been promoted, Ehrlich says, it 
won't be a panacea. Most problems in the Third World, for example, are social, 
political or economic, not technological, he says. "The idea that you can solve 
the human dilemma with a single technological breakthrough is incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
For the foreseeable future, much of the world will remain involved in 
small-farm agriculture and it's unclear how fusion power would alter that life 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Fusion proponents, he notes, also estimate that commercial applications of 
their work are at least 20 years off. And it will be 30 years beyond then 
before fusion power has significant impact. In this sense, says Ehrlich, fusion 
is irrelevant because, he asserts, the world will have long since succumbed to 
over-population, famine, global warming and acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What About Solar Power? 
</P>
<P>
The current unqualified euphoria for fusion also concerns Barry Commoner, 
director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
He argues that fusion power could prove to be a dangerous distraction from 
existing energy sources. It does not make sense, he say, to jump on an 
unproven, possibly dangerous technology like fusion when a safe, proven and 
decentralized technology like solar power is there for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
Since fusion "does not yet exist," Commoner says, "it would be foolish to 
design a transition based on the assumption that it will exist. It's like 
starting to build a bridge over a river without knowing where the other side 
is." 
</P>
<P>
To those people old enough to have been present for the original debates on 
nuclear fission, the unbridled enthusiasm for fusion power sounds strangely 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, Holdren says, a famous physicist named Arnold Sommerfeld predicted 
that with the development nuclear energy, "electricity would be too cheap to 
meter" and nuclear energy would abolish poverty from the face of the Earth by 
1960. "They always oversell," Laura Nader says. It is only much later that you 
hear about the downside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick-Fix Hopes 
</P>
<P>
To Rifkin and Ehrlich, this is the real danger of fusion power -- it gives 
people the false hope that a technological quick fix to the world's problems is 
just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"Fusion energy is an expedient short-lived diversion to the real problem," 
Rifkin says. "It gives some people the false hope that there are no limits to 
growth and no environmental price to be paid by having unlimited sources of 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
But in thermodynamics, which is to say in real life, there's no such thing as a 
free lunch. "Even if one component is cheap," Rifkin says, "you pay the price 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRO FUSION AND CON FUSION 
</P>
<P>
Even if fusion power works, its first applications are still 20 to 30 years 
away, and any significant impact from it is 50 years off, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
PROS 
</P>
<P>
It could provide cheap, clean, inexhaustible power. 
</P>
<P>
It could provide a means to end world poverty, hunger, acid rain, 
deforestation, the damming of free- running rivers, global warming, smog, oil 
spills, strip mining and nuclear meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It could stabilize world population by raising the living standard worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
It could result in the mining of minerals out of rocks, the desalinization of 
seawater. It could make the Sahara bloom. 
</P>
<P>
It could result in hydrogen-powered cars that emit water vapor, not 
smog-producing hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
It could reduce geopolitical tensions over oil and produce a solution to the 
balance of payments problem at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
It could fuel interplanetary exploration, providing a new power source for 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONS 
</P>
<P>
It could serve as a power source for space-based laser and particle beam 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Its provision of unlimited power could prompt a global population explosion 
that could create unmanageable industrial and human waste, destroy open space 
and cause the extinction of plant and animal species while destroying the 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
It could have little or no effect, because many world problems are unrelated to 
energy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
It could produce exaggerated claims that never will be realized, as happened 
with nuclear fission. 
</P>
<P>
It could create naive belief in technological solutions that might delay 
necessary efforts at social, economic and political progress. 
</P>
<P>
It could be that it will be neither cheap nor clean, producing, for example, 
tritium byproduct that is a deadly poison. 
</P>
<P>
It could cause the public to neglect safe, proven renewable resources such as 
wind and solar power.

Even Michael Mish was surprised at the passion of the response when he asked 
7-year-old Matthew Andron how he felt about air pollution in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The first-grader didn't even pause: "Capture the people that do pollution!" he 
demanded. "Put them in jail! That's what I think they should do." 
</P>
<P>
Mish, actor/composer/producer/environmentalist, has been asking this question 
and others like it over the past four months, dragging his tape recorder from 
preschools to kindergartens to elementary schools, alternative schools and 
Sunday schools, to talk about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've interviewed kids all over the place, from 3 to 9 years old," he said 
recently. "They are very worried about what's happening to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The killer for me," he continued, "was just last week at P.S. 1, a little 
school on a residential street in Santa Monica. It was so poignant. The kids 
were between 9 and 10 -- older than I had been interviewing -- and they were so 
articulate. 
</P>
<P>
"With my first question, 'What do you think of the air?' I nearly got 
avalanched. Hands were waving all over the room. Some of them were telling me 
more than I even know myself -- and I'm fairly well researched. They were 
citing specific facts about the ozone layer. One little girl said the thing 
that bothered her the most is that big companies that pollute will pay their 
fine and go on as if nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advance Waivers From Parents 
</P>
<P>
Mish, who launched his project by "just calling schools cold," gets advance 
waivers from parents, records the sessions and lets each one take its own 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"I just ask a straightforward question and let the answers govern my next 
question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they say they're unhappy with the way cars pollute the air, I ask how they 
might make a smokeless vehicle. I try to keep all the discussions positive, not 
negative. That's the underpinings of my project: to give them the idea of a 
kids' coalition." 
</P>
<P>
With the classroom interviews finished, he's now working from the notes, 
writing rock-beat songs and a few ballads with titles like "The Air," "My 
Electric Car" and "Recycle It." They are all solution songs ("What you gonna do 
with all that trash? Recycle it, recycle it!"). 
</P>
<P>
The result will be a music casette for children, "A Kid's-Eye View of the 
Environment," which Mish envisions as "an upbeat, uniting call to action." 
</P>
<P>
"Children are wonderful visionaries," he said, "and they have ideas for 
solutions -- but they feel powerless to do anything about it." And children 
aren't alone, Mish maintains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most adults have this powerless feeling," he continued. "I feel 
powerless. So do all my friends. This Exxon oil spill -- what a travesty! The 
oil companies said unequivocally they would be ready to act in dealing with it. 
They weren't. . . . We should let them know we don't like being treated like 
this. We should do a month of boycotting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't people do that more? Because we have an overriding sense of 
powerlessness. We have been trained since childhood to think some authority -- 
the government, or business -- will take care of things. I think change will 
have to start from a grassroots level -- when we change that powerlessness into 
the feeling that a vital individual can make dynamic change." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mish had spent several years fuming about the environment before he 
reached his own personal turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Now 39, he grew up in Reseda, in a house tucked in between farms. "There were 
beautiful alfalfa fields and you could always see the mountains," he recalls. 
"Last Christmas I made a video for my parents and put together all our old 
8-millimeter family movies. In one, my little brother and I were flying kites 
in the front yard and I could see how blue the sky used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mish has lived the last 17 years at the beach in Pacific Palisades, he 
suffers an increasing allergy to smog, which may eventually force him to leave 
Southern California. "It was mostly clear in the Palisades -- you could count 
the smoggy days on your fingers -- until about three years ago, when something 
changed," he remarked with a touch of wistfulness. "My doctors said I am just 
very sensitive to smog. I'm not sure I can continue to live here." 
</P>
<P>
It's a depressing possibility for an 
</P>
<P>
ordinarily cheerful man who has built a multifaceted career in Hollywood. As an 
actor he is rarely seen but frequently heard in voice-overs for radio and 
television commercials. ("I'm the guy promising quick delivery of Domino's 
Pizza in their radio commercials.") 
</P>
<P>
And though he is a bachelor, working with children would prove to be a natural 
connection, partly because of his work in entertainment. Mish's show business 
resume includes the TV cartoon voices of Turbo-Teen, Hop-Bug and Timothy on 
ABC's "Dragon's Lair," and his last two recording projects have been for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
For Macmillan-Checkerboard Press he produced an eight-volume cassette version 
of "The Real Mother Goose," and, having formed his own Mish Mash Music Records, 
has created and produced an updated version, with music, of "Aesop's Fables." 
</P>
<P>
Through the smog attacks, he continued to operate at full steam as a jingle 
writer, singer, composer and voice-over actor. He also produces music tapes in 
his home studio, an elaborate facility of computer-controlled tape recorders 
and synthesizers. But he was beginning to get obsessed about air quality. 
</P>
<P>
"Until last spring," he said, "I was concerned about my own unhealthfulness, 
about being crippled by the smog. I was angry about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed His Life 
</P>
<P>
A tumbling accident changed his approach. Mish had been a competitive gymnast 
at Hollywood High School and in college. (He attended Valley College and San 
Jose State.) He kept up the sport, tossing off an occasional back flip to 
impress friends and "fancying myself as a never-grow-old kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
Then last April, auditioning for a Toyota commercial in a Hollywood casting 
office, he "pushed too hard," he said, on a series of back handsprings and 
ruptured an Achilles' tendon. Four months of recuperation, he said, gave him 
time to think and reposition his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided only to do things that are important to me, and contributing in a 
positive way to society." To Mish, that meant becoming an environmental 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
His first step was to become involved with Proposition O, the ballot measure 
passed Nov. 8 that prohibited Occidental Petroleum Corp. from drilling for oil 
in the Pacific Palisades. "I called (co-sponsor) Councilman Marvin Braude's 
office and asked what I could do, and that's how I got active. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mish's upbeat song, "Don't Drill Here," became the unofficial theme for the 
campaign, says Karen Kelly, Braude's executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need the Activists 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's terrific," she added. "He's very creative, and he digs right in. 
That's what we need if we're going to make any difference. We have plenty of 
lip service. We need the activists." 
</P>
<P>
Mish also picketed for Proposition O with businessman friend Channing Clarkson 
for a month before the election. 
</P>
<P>
He has also involved himself in an informal educational program. With a friend, 
Peggy Klein, he has been inviting friends to his house for a screening of last 
September's ABC special, "The Poisoning of America," hosted by Hugh Downs. 
"It's a very compelling look at the American environment," Mish said. "We watch 
it, then talk about what we can do to change things." 
</P>
<P>
But those were peripheral activities. As his central focus, he decided to do 
something positive for kids. "For one thing," he explained, they have the mind 
unfettered and they can see solutions far more clearly than we. 
</P>
<P>
"For another, they are the generation we are handing this to." 
</P>
<P>
That is what has sent him on a round of classroom interviews, sometimes 
standing in front of a class, occasionally sitting in pint-sized chairs around 
a grade-school table and asking such questions as: "What do you think of air? 
What do you think of the water shortage? What do you think of cars?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Are Concerned 
</P>
<P>
He was not surprised, he said, to find that children have spent some time 
pondering the state of the planet's air, water and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost anticipated them telling me what they did: I figured kids are 
mystified, miffed and bereaved. . . . They are very concerned and very aware." 
</P>
<P>
For example, among the schoolhouse suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Try to build a car that has a little container in the back of it that 
catches the smoke and every 500 miles you take the thing out and get a new 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We could get drinking water from ice cubes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It would be good to have a pesticide that's not bad for you, like a soap 
and water spray." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We should have the ocean water going through a pipe, a net catches the 
fish so they don't get hurt, then water goes into a steamy room where the salt 
gets separated. We could use the salt for table salt and the water could go to 
places with water shortages." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "They should line the water pipes with a plastic, so no lead comes 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "When I get old enough, I'm going to get myself an electric car, so I can 
charge it up while I'm sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Maybe they could use cooking oil for an alternative fuel." 
</P>
<P>
When Mish reminded a group of Santa Monica youngsters that they could air their 
discontent in letters to elected officials, the children unanimously protested 
that they were just little kids and no one would listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refinanced His House 
</P>
<P>
As a result, one of the songs on the cassette will be titled "Write Your 
Senator." 
</P>
<P>
Mish has refinanced his house to support his work on "Kid's-Eye View of the 
Environment" and is totally consumed by it. The ruptured Achilles' tendon, he 
thinks, was fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw all the things I've done in the past as part and parcel of what I should 
be doing," he said. "Singing in nightclubs for six years, composing, animated 
voices, selling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be stopped dead to make a life-changing decision. We get so caught 
up in the treadmill, we really don't make important decisions until somebody 
smacks us down."

A Senate committee on Tuesday approved a bill that would write into law the 
so-called "fairness doctrine" that the Federal Communications Commission 
repealed in 1987. The bill would require broadcasters to air opposing views on 
controversial issues. It is virtually identical to a measure passed by Congress 
in 1987 but vetoed by President Reagan. When the FCC overturned the fairness 
doctrine, it cited First Amendment concerns and said the rules were outdated. 
The doctrine came about in the 1940s on the premise that broadcasters should be 
required to be fair because only a few "voices" had access to public airwaves. 
But critics today contend there is no shortage of voices in this era of cable 
TV, satellites and VCRs. Broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a "chilling 
effect" on discussions of controversial issues and is unconstitutional. But the 
bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), thinks the need for such 
legislation is greater than ever. He said there is evidence that broadcasters 
have been devoting less time to controversial issues since the FCC repealed the 
doctrine. The bill was sent to the full Senate on a voice vote by the Senate 
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. A companion measure was passed 
out of committee April 11 to the House, where it is awaiting floor action.

NEIL DIAMOND GIVES A REASON TO BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Neil Diamond really is a believer. 
</P>
<P>
Not in anything thorny or controversial, mind you. But in an era when belief in 
anything is hard to find, anyone who expounds ideals with heroic zeal and 
wholehearted conviction is going to find a willing audience. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that a lot of people find something believable in Diamond, and he 
showed why on Monday at the San Diego Sports Arena, the closest to Los Angeles 
he'll play before his record-breaking nine-night stand at the Forum in June. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Diamond's two-hour concert was freighted with nearly every 
phony, deadening device that big-time show biz has to offer: lasers, 
unrelievedly sentimental songs, stentorian vocal stylings, bombastic patriotic 
display. 
</P>
<P>
But at the core was a singer who brought such unabashed, unflagging ardor and 
energy to his music of high romance and optimistic zeal that it was all . . . 
believable. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Diamond made his big, leathery baritone sound convincingly heroic, but 
not pompous. Don't ask for analysis: This feat was as mystifying as the Utah 
fusion-in-a-bottle experiment. Somehow, the lasers and lavish showers of light 
served as appropriate, skillfully applied backdrops for an already commanding 
performer rather than as a cover for a lack of compelling human presence. And 
these titanic trappings didn't prevent Diamond from showing an unassuming, 
down-to-earth delight in being face to face with his fans. 
</P>
<P>
When Diamond put his force behind middle-of-the-road schmaltz, he made it 
bearable, even palatable. When he dug into his older backlog of catchy, 
rock-oriented nuggets -- including a long hit-parade sequence that included 
"I'm a Believer," "Red Red Wine" and "Sweet Caroline" -- the show became a pure 
delight. 
</P>
<P>
It almost didn't matter that there is a huge gulf between Diamond's 
romanticized vision of things and the vexatious, doubt-filled, irony-laden 
reality of things that the best pop songwriters often try to capture. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of a career, that's a serious flaw. But over the course of two 
hours, Diamond made it a pleasure to suspend disbelief.

The Malaysian government is putting a lid on racy television advertisements and 
commercials that show only non-Malaysian models. Beginning July 1, Caucasian 
and other non-Malaysian models can appear in commercials only if the ads also 
include Malays, Chinese, Indians or other races that predominate in Malaysia. 
Commercials with women in swimsuits and scanty clothing also will be banned. 
Michael Tang, president of the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents of 
Malaysia, called the ban "a little too harsh and debatable" and asked for a 
review. Malaysia's population of 17 million is 55% Malay, 37% Chinese, with the 
remainder mainly Indian. The country has three TV channels, two owned by the 
government and the other belongs to the ruling party. ALEENE MacMINN

'The Ambassador From India' 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, 1987, 85 minutes 
</P>
<P>
9:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitfully amusing comedy about a compulsive liar in Colombia who comes to be 
lionized by an entire town after affecting an accent and passing himself off as 
a visiting ambassador. Out of this escalating mistake, director Mario Ribero 
elicits gentle laughs throughout, yet any real satirical potential is dulled by 
a weak ending that lets its weak protagonist off the hook. "People see what 
they want to see," is the maxim here, but the simplicity of the townspeople 
shouldn't excuse the duplicity of the masquerading hero. CHRIS WILLMAN

</P>
<P>
Japan, 1988, 127 minutes 
</P>
<P>
9:00 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Nobuko Miyamoto plays that most implacable of tax inspectors, but 
this time her husband Juzo Itami's comedy is actually more accessible than the 
original. Instead of spoofing the specific foibles of the inscrutable Japanese 
tax system Itami this time comments with pitch-dark, fatalistic humor on 
widespread corruption at the highest levels of government. As before, Itami 
displays unflagging energy and panache as Miyamoto zeroes in on the sleek head 
of a lucrative religious cult, played suavely by the veteran Rentaro Mikuni.

'Macho Dancer' 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, 1988, 100 minutes 
</P>
<P>
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino film-maker Lino Brocka is a minor master of violent, sentimental 
melodramas, usually with left-wing political undercurrents. That description 
fits this movie, but what makes it unusual is its milieu: the twilit Manila 
world of gay bars, male hustlers and "macho dancers" -- whose soapy, 
hip-rolling, nude and quasi-nude routines make up a lot of its footage. Brocka 
spins a typical young-man-from-the-provinces gangster plot, but he doesn't 
stint on depicting the underworld nor the political and police corruption that 
fuels it; if he falls at last into gun-toting melodramatics, its probably the 
price of knowing one's metier. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Displaying growing dissatisfaction with the Sheriff's Department, San Diegans 
favor removing the jails from Sheriff John Duffy's control and strongly support 
establishing an independent civilian board to review complaints against 
deputies, a Times poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
While San Diegans were divided on their view of overall jail conditions, the 
poll found that two-thirds favor creating a civilian review board and that, by 
a more than 3-to-2 margin, they would prefer to see the jails run by a separate 
corrections department answerable to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly three-fourths of those polled said they believe recent 
allegations -- detailed in a San Diego County Grand Jury report and news 
stories -- that deputies have beaten and harassed jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's personal performance drew lukewarm reviews in the poll. Although people 
approved, by a 36%-20% margin, of Duffy's handling of the job that he has held 
since 1971, only 28% of those polled said they likely would vote for him if he 
seeks reelection next year. However, both questions found a large percentage of 
undecided San Diegans -- 44% in the case of Duffy's overall performance and 35% 
in regard to their early preferences in the 1990 sheriff's contest. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do San Diegans strongly desire changes in the jail system, but they 
also are willing to pay to upgrade and expand local detention facilities, the 
poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, San Diegans said they would support another measure 
similar to last year's Proposition A, a half-cent sales tax for jails and 
courts narrowly approved by voters but struck down by a court last month. 
Recent ballot propositions, however, have attracted considerably less support 
for such taxes. Over the last 2 1/2 years, two separate sales-tax ballot 
proposals for jails -- both of which required two-thirds majorities for passage 
-- received barely more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unhappy With Duffy, Jails 
</P>
<P>
"What it comes down to is that people aren't all that happy with Duffy or the 
jails, and they're apparently willing to reach into their pockets to do 
something about it," Times pollster I.A. Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday of 811 
people throughout San Diego County. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus 
or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Coming less than a month after the Grand Jury report sharply criticized the 
sheriff's operation of the jails, the poll found strong support for some 
potentially sweeping changes that in the past have been proposed by the 
supervisors and others. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven percent of those polled said an independent civilian panel should 
be set up to investigate complaints against sheriff's deputies such as those 
detailed in the Grand Jury study, which concluded that there have been 
systematic abuses in the jails and that some deputies "delight in cruelty" to 
inmates. Twenty-four percent opposed the idea of a civilian review board, while 
9% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Found 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Golding, who has proposed that top county officials review all 
jail deaths, said that she interprets the poll's findings as evidence that the 
public "wants a more thorough and independent review of these cases than we're 
getting now." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we have now is one of the fox guarding the hen house," Golding 
said. "It should not be just the sheriff who reviews jail deaths. There has to 
an an outside, independent evaluation. These (poll) results show me that the 
public sees a need for greater accountability." 
</P>
<P>
By a 47%-30% margin, San Diegans favor shifting operation of the jails from 
Duffy's jurisdiction to a separate corrections department that would report 
directly to the Board of Supervisors. Under the current system, the board sets 
Duffy's annual budget but cannot control how he spends the money appropriated 
or allocates manpower -- a division of authority that some supervisors complain 
severely restricts their ability to set priorities or directly influence jail 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anathema to Duffy 
</P>
<P>
Both ideas -- the review board and a corrections department -- are anathema to 
Duffy, who has strongly resisted such proposals. 
</P>
<P>
During a protracted budget dispute with Duffy last year, some supervisors 
suggested examining the feasibility of a county Department of Corrections -- a 
plan similar to one that the board adopted in 1975 but then let die amid 
intense public opposition generated by Duffy. With Duffy threatening to repeat 
that effort, last year's proposal never even reached the serious discussion 
stage. Similarly, Golding conceded that Duffy's vehement opposition is one 
reason why the purview of her proposed reviews would be limited to 
investigating only jail deaths, rather than any abuses or other allegations of 
prisoner mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department on Tuesday refused to comment on the poll's findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equally Divided 
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, San Diegans are almost equally divided on the question 
of whether the jails are basically sound, with 39% saying that they are in 
relatively good shape and 38% disagreeing. There was a similar, though less 
close, division among the poll's respondents on another question dealing with 
the effectiveness of the Sheriff's Department's management of the jails, with 
38% expressing disapproval and 30%, approval. That 8 percentage-point gap, 
however, falls within the poll's margin of error. In addition, 32% were 
undecided on that question. 
</P>
<P>
By an overwhelming 72%-12% margin, people said that they believe the recent 
allegations of harassment and abuse in the jails. However, 45% described the 
abuses as isolated instances rather than widespread practices, and 46% believe 
that the media have exaggerated the extent of the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what they see as the major cause of those problems, 69% of those polled 
cited the seriously overcrowded conditions in the jails, where inmate 
populations typically are double the facilities' official capacities. Other 
explanations, however, point either directly or indirectly at Duffy: 36% 
attributed the problems to poor supervision of the deputies, 19% saw inadequate 
deputy training as the cause and 10% blamed the jails' woes on Duffy's lack of 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
If Duffy seeks a sixth four-year term next year, the potential electoral 
fallout from those attitudes about jail conditions -- as well as about Duffy's 
and his department's overall performance -- could pose difficulties for the 
sheriff, the poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Only 28% of those polled said that they would be inclined to vote for Duffy if 
he seeks reelection, compared to 37% who said they likely would vote against 
him, with 35% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Another question asking for an appraisal of Duffy's handling of his job drew a 
favorable response from 36% of the people questioned, while 20% disapproved and 
44% were undecided. Disapproval of Duffy's performance was highest among those 
people who said they have paid relatively close attention to the recent news 
stories about jail conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the 44% undecided figure "unusually high for anyone who's been in 
office nearly 20 years," Lewis termed the statistic "hardly a solid 
endorsement" of Duffy's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Teed Off' 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say anyone or anything -- Duffy, the deputies or the jails -- comes 
off looking very good here," Lewis said. "It looks like the people are getting 
a little teed off." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the poll found a strong link between people's attitudes about 
jail conditions and their perception of Duffy's overall performance. For 
example, those who approved of the Sheriff's Department's management of the 
jails gave Duffy a favorable job performance rating by a 54%-16% margin, while 
those who found fault with the jails' management disapproved of his 
performance, 36% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>

SOVIETS ADD A PLAY TO S.D. ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Leningrad's Maly Drama Theatre will present the U.S. premiere of a seven-hour 
play, "Brothers and Sisters," here during the "Treasures of the Soviet Union" 
arts festival this fall, festival officials announced at a press conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Festival administrators in San Diego also announced that the number of Faberge 
Imperial Eggs committed for exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Art during 
the festival, which will run from Oct. 21 to Nov. 11, has grown from 17 to 22. 
The gold and gem-encrusted ornamental eggs come from the collections of the 
Kremlin Armory Museum, the Forbes Magazine Galleries and five museum and 
private collections, festival officials said. The egg exhibition will extend 
beyond the festival to Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"Brothers and Sisters," a dramatization of a trilogy of novels by Fyodor 
Abramov, depicts the realities of rural life in the Soviet Union following 
World War II. It will be performed by a cast of 40 in two parts that will 
normally be seen on consecutive evenings at the Old Globe Theatre from Oct. 22 
to Nov. 12. Thirteen complete cycles will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
The play, budgeted at $750,000, will be performed in Russian. Audience members 
will be given a device that will allow them to hear an English translation. 
</P>
<P>
The $6-million festival will feature, in addition, folk art, dancing and music, 
and film and culinary exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the organizers have lowered their expectations as to the festival's 
potential economic impact. When Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced the festival 
early last year, she compared the event's prospects with the 1987 Super Bowl, 
which generated an estimated $136 million. The estimated economic impact now is 
placed at $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other new festival attractions announced Monday: an exhibit of Faberge mineral 
and gemstone carvings at the San Diego Museum of Natural History, a display of 
Russian lacquer miniatures at the San Diego Museum of Man and a Soviet/American 
space art exhibition presented by the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and the San 
Diego Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of San Diego's 90 cultural and arts institutions are involved 
with putting on 19 different festival events, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Festival highlights previously announced include: 
</P>
<P>
* Three performances of Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 film epic, "Alexander Nevsky," 
accompanied by the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Master Chorale under 
Soviet guest conductor Evgeny Kolobov. The symphony will play three weeks of 
programs featuring Russian music and Russian musicians, including the Soloists 
of Leningrad, a chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Opera production of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," with Soviet 
bass Alexander Morozov and soprano Irina Bogacheva, conducted by Jansoug 
Kakhidze of the Tbilisi State Theatre of Opera and Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
* A film festival and symposium featuring four renowned Georgian directors and 
a Georgian film critic. 
</P>
<P>
* "Masterworks in Metal," an exhibit of 30 elaborately decorated icons and 
religious objects from the State Art Museum of Georgia, organized by the Timken 
Art Gallery, and displayed at the B Street Pier.

CHINA POLICE BREAK UP PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTEST 
</P>

<P>
Chinese police early today dispersed hundreds of pro-democracy student 
protesters who had marched on Communist Party and government headquarters in 
the most dramatic display of anti-government sentiment in the Chinese capital 
in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The action by nearly 1,000 police officers shortly before dawn ended a 
five-hour standoff that began after the protest by about 5,000 students erupted 
Tuesday evening in the streets of central Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Long live freedom, long live democracy . . . down with corruption!" the 
excited crowd chanted as it surged from Tian An Men Square toward the ornate 
two-story, red-columned gate of the nearby Zhongnanhai compound. 
</P>
<P>
"Go in!" some screamed as the crowd approached a thin line of a couple of dozen 
soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder in the 15-foot-wide entryway. The 
soldiers did not appear to have guns. Many of China's top leaders live behind 
that gate, and even more of them work there. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoving and scuffling ensued between students and plainclothes security 
officers near the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
But the crowd made no serious attempt to sweep the soldiers aside. Instead, 
students set up wreaths in honor of the late Communist Party reformist leader 
Hu Yaobang and staged a midnight sit-in at the gate to demand action by the 
government on a variety of pro-democracy demands. 
</P>
<P>
A standoff ensued, with the crowd gradually dwindling to about 1,500 by 4:15 
a.m. today, when about 1,000 police officers suddenly appeared and cleared the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The students' activities, which had blocked most of Beijing's main boulevard, 
were "irregular" and had interfered with traffic safety, police announced over 
a loudspeaker as waves of officers pushed most of the crowd west toward the 
city's suburban university district. 
</P>
<P>
At least one student who resisted verbally was manhandled by police, but in 
general the students gave ground without resistance. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the protest shortly before midnight, the crowd chanted, "Li 
Peng, come out," in an appeal for the premier to emerge and discuss their 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders stood and read a list of demands released earlier in the day, 
including free speech and free press, removal of restrictions on street 
demonstrations, rehabilitation of those victimized by two major anti-liberal 
political campaigns of the past six years, public disclosure of national 
leaders' income, more funds for education and a reassessment of Hu that would 
credit him for his contributions to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li, who takes a cautious approach to reform and is unpopular with many 
students, is believed by many analysts to be locked in a rivalry with Communist 
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang over personal power and the proper course 
for China's economic development. But the crowd did not appear to support Zhao 
or anyone else at the top levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
One student said in an interview that the crowd singled out Li in its chant 
because he heads the government but that most of the protesters do not support 
anyone in the ruling Communist Party Politburo. The student said that even the 
liberal reformer Hu -- in whose memory, nominally, the march was being made -- 
would be seen as a target for criticism by the students were he still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Hu Yaobang is just an excuse for them," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hu Was Viewed as Liberal 
</P>
<P>
Hu, who died last Saturday at age 73, was widely viewed as the most liberal of 
China's top leaders. He was forced out of his post as head of the Communist 
Party two years ago, after orthodox hard-liners criticized him for failing to 
suppress pro-democracy student demonstrations that swept the nation in late 
1986 and early 1987. The largest of those demonstrations were in Shanghai and 
involved tens of thousands of people, but no protests in Beijing at that time 
were as big as Tuesday's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Hu's fall in January, 1987, was followed by a hard-line ideological campaign 
against the importation of Western ideas of democracy and capitalism. But by 
the end of the year, relatively liberal leaders such as Zhao were firmly 
pushing reform forward again. 
</P>
<P>
China's major emphasis has been on market-oriented economic reforms. Political 
controls have also been relaxed to some degree. But to the frustration of many 
students and intellectuals, there has been little movement toward genuine 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students still at Zhongnanhai when the police moved in apparently 
felt some surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect them to use the police," one student said as he walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Another young man, who spoke excellent English, approached a reporter to say 
that 70 years ago, his grandfather had been a demonstrator in the famous May 
4th incident of 1919, an anti-government protest that developed into a broad 
progressive campaign. "Today," he said, "we're demonstrating for the same 
things: democracy and science." 
</P>
<P>
For the first several hours after the crowd gathered in front of Zhongnanhai, a 
police vehicle equipped with a loudspeaker insistently blared out: "Don't stop. 
Move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Although the crowd blocked traffic in most lanes of the broad avenue that 
passes by the compound, three police officers standing near the car with the 
loudspeaker around midnight simply chatted with each other in a relaxed manner, 
without making any serious attempt to disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized demonstrations have been illegal in Beijing since late 1986. 
Today's order to disperse, which required demonstrators and journalists to 
leave the Zhongnanhai area, was issued by the Beijing city government. But it 
was not immediately clear whether the actual decision may have been taken at a 
higher political level. 
</P>
<P>
During much of the day Tuesday, the Monument to the People's Heroes in the 
middle of nearby Tian An Men Square was the main center for protest activity. 
Around midnight, about 1,000 students who seemed unaware of the demonstration 
at Zhongnanhai were still gathered beneath the monument, discussing reform and 
issuing demands for democracy. They had dispersed of their own accord before 
police cleared the students from the area around Zhongnanhai.

HOUSE VOTE SPELLS END FOR 86 BASES; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSURE CLEARS LAST LEGISLATIVE HURDLE BUT FOES FILE SUIT

<P>
The House Tuesday cleared the way for the closing of 86 military installations 
and the consolidation of others, overwhelmingly rejecting a measure that would 
have blocked a politically sensitive cost-savings plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 381-43 vote virtually wiped out the last legislative chance to save four 
major military bases in California listed for closing, including Norton Air 
Force Base and George Air Force Base, both in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Also slated for extinction are the Army's historic Presidio in San Francisco 
and Mather Air Force base near Sacramento, as well as such national landmarks 
as Illinois' Ft. Sheridan and Ft. Dix in New Jersey. Two smaller California 
facilities, Hamilton Army Airfield in Marin County and the Navy's inactive 
Salton Sea Test Base, also would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Senate Action Needed 
</P>
<P>
With the House vote, any action by the Senate becomes irrelevant, because 
disapproval by both houses of Congress was necessary to prevent the findings of 
a blue-ribbon base consolidation panel from going into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the base closings acknowledged that the prospects for halting the 
plan now are nearly nil. 
</P>
<P>
"The House has spoken rather emphatically," said Rep. George E. Brown Jr. 
(D-Colton) after the vote. "The chances of reversing that are very slim." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who introduced the House measure to save the bases, said: "It's time now 
to focus on getting the job done, on getting (Norton Air Force Base) cleaned 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the outcome of the vote, however, the National Federation of 
Federal Employees had filed suit Monday in federal court in the District of 
Columbia to block implementation of the panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civilian Group's Suit 
</P>
<P>
The federation, whose membership includes 5,000 civilian employees at George 
and Norton Air Force bases, charged that in establishing the commission to pick 
military facilities for closing, former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci 
unconstitutionally had delegated powers that belong in the hands of elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, struggling with a severe federal budget deficit and the inevitable 
political obstacles to shutting down major government employers, last year 
passed legislation creating the commission and charged it with identifying 
obsolete military installations that could be phased out to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci was directed to appoint the members, and Congress agreed to accept its 
recommendations unless both chambers acted to block them. On Dec. 29, the panel 
proposed closing 86 military installations and shifting many of their functions 
to 54 other bases, for an estimated savings of $5.6 billion in the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's House vote followed three days of intermittent debate, during which 
opponents of the closings criticized the commission's screening methods and 
charged that the savings promised were far less than Carlucci had once 
estimated might be possible -- $3 billion to $5 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bait and switch at its worst," said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins (R-Ky.). 
"What we wanted were real savings. What we're getting is false economy." 
</P>
<P>
They insisted that many of the bases were targeted arbitrarily, that they still 
perform valuable defense services and mean much more economically to their 
regions than the relatively small cost savings to be gained from closing them. 
</P>
<P>
However, supporters insisted that hard choices had to be made if Congress were 
to trim back defense costs that the nation can no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
"This objective piece of work has passed the test," said Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.). ". . . I know it's painful for the communities involved. But the 
bottom line is that defense dollars are for defense needs, not for community 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who lobbied vigorously to block the closings 
plan, estimated chances of saving the installations now at 5%. He said that 
lawmakers could have additional opportunities to keep bases open during the 
budget appropriations process. The Bush Administration will need to seek 
further congressional approval for funds to begin the closures. 
</P>
<P>
"Because this resolution passed doesn't mean the ballgame is over," Lewis said. 
"There's a long way between now and the end of the process." 
</P>
<P>
But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), who called the 
commission's work "well done," warned opponents that his panel will work to 
thwart any efforts to remove funds for the closings. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, members of the committee echoed opponents' concerns that the 
Defense Department will be slow to clean up toxic waste that has accumulated at 
several of the installations slated for closure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sympathetic," Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a defender of the 
closures, told Lewis during floor debate. "We know that California has been 
mistreated before. We're going to do everything to see that these cleanups are 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has estimated that it will need $800 million to clear obsolete 
bases of toxic waste over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Bernardino officials joined Brown at the conclusion of Tuesday's vote 
to announce that they will pursue "parallel paths" of encouraging efforts to 
save the bases while also planning for new civilian uses for the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are tempted to continue the fight, we must be honest with our 
constituents," Brown, San Bernardino Mayor Evlyn Wilcox and San Bernardino 
County Supervisor Robert Hammock said in a joint statement. "Blocking the base 
closures is an uphill struggle against a vast majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We therefore believe it is in the interest of our communities to shift the 
focus of our efforts to ensuring that the base's closure leads to economic 
growth for our region," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The closings affect 6,653 military and civilian workers at Norton and 5,358 at 
George. But March Air Force Base, 9 miles southeast of Riverside, would pick up 
an additional 3,420 military and civilian employees from proposed 
consolidations, many of them from Norton. 
</P>
<P>
Hammock and Wilcox said that during their trip to Washington, they had secured 
concessions from Pentagon officials, including permission for county managers 
to begin planning for the use of Norton Air Force Base by civilian planes. The 
officials said that the petition to open Norton to commercial air traffic was 
made before the commission recommended Norton's closure. But they added that 
the Pentagon's approval now could ease the base's transition to life as a fully 
commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
Hammock and Wilcox also won assurances that the Defense Department will seek 
$40 million by 1991 to clean toxic wastes from Norton, and secured a Pentagon 
grant of $140,000 to help fund the development of plans for the conversion of 
Norton and George Air Force bases.

LUCILLE BALL STRICKEN, HAS HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Lucille Ball suffered a heart attack Tuesday and was rushed to 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she underwent several hours of emergency 
open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"She appears to have come through all right," hospital spokesman Ron Wise said 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Her condition was described as stable and "guarded, but optimistic," by Dr. 
Robert Kass, the surgeon who performed a lengthy procedure in which he replaced 
part of the aorta -- the largest blood vessel in the body -- and the aortic 
valve, using tissue from the body of a 27-year-old male donor. 
</P>
<P>
Kass said "the next 24 hours would be crucial" for the comedian, who he said 
has a history of high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
He described the surgery as a "very high-risk procedure . . . but the fact that 
she came through it well makes us all optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon said Ball would remain hospitalized for "at least two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Ball's husband, Gary Morton, who drove her to the hospital, told reporters his 
wife experienced "terrible pain" at their Beverly Hills home. "She'd been 
feeling just great until this morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Ball, who with then-husband Desi Arnaz, gained worldwide fame 
during the 1950s as the zany, red-haired wife of the Cuban bandleader in 
television's "I Love Lucy," arrived at the hospital about noon. 
</P>
<P>
Wise said Ball was conscious and able to talk to doctors as she entered the 
hospital in a wheelchair but added that she was "very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Morton told reporters that Ball's daughter, Lucie, was at the house when her 
mother was stricken. He said Ball's son, Desi Arnaz Jr., was notified and both 
children were at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Ball was taken to Cedars-Sinai twice last year, once in May for what Morton 
said had been a slight heart attack. He dismissed at that time reports that she 
had suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't have a stroke," Morton told reporters after she returned home. 
"Right now she's recovered from a very slight heart attack. She's doing super. 
Sensational." 
</P>
<P>
Cardiac tests at the time apparently failed to pinpoint the problem. By the end 
of May, Morton said, his wife was up and about the couple's home on Ridgecrest 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Four months earlier, Ball had undergone what her secretary said was minor 
throat surgery. Wise said then that doctors had removed a small cyst from her 
throat beside her thyroid gland. He said the operation was performed while she 
was in the hospital for her annual physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
Ball appeared on television March 29 with comedian Bob Hope during the Academy 
Awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucille Ball is one of the most wonderful women I've ever known," Hope said 
Tuesday from his home in Toluca Lake. "I'm shocked, especially since we worked 
together so recently . . . and she was so full of energy. Like the rest of the 
world, Dolores and I are praying everything will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Ball was honored last month by the Beverly Hills City Council for her 
contributions to show business and to the city in which she has lived for 37 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The council proclaimed this "Lucille Ball Year." 
</P>
<P>
In February of last year, she was honored by Harvard's Hasty Pudding Club as 
its Theatricals' Woman of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, who was born in Jamestown, N.Y., Aug. 6, 1911, dropped out of school at 
15 and attended the John Murray Anderson school of drama in New York City. She 
was briefly in the cast of a Ziegfeld Follies road show, then appeared in a few 
Broadway chorus lines. 
</P>
<P>
She became a model, then came to Hollywood in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
With her hair bleached platinum blonde, she got her first screen work in the 
chorus of Samuel Goldwyn's "Roman Scandals." 
</P>
<P>
She later dyed her hair red and became known as "Queen of the Bs." 
</P>
<P>
She met Arnaz in the 1940 musical "Too Many Girls," in which she played the 
ingenue lead and he was cast as a Cuban football player. They married seven 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
Arnaz was on the road most of the time with his band and she was working in 
films. They salvaged their marriage with the "I Love Lucy" television show, 
which enabled them to operate their own production company and studio, Desilu. 
</P>
<P>
After their tremendous success on television in the 1950s, the couple divorced 
in 1960. Arnaz eventually sold his share of Desilu to Ball for $3 million. She 
sold the company to Gulf &amp; Western in 1967 for $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ball married Morton, a stand-up comedian, in 1961. He became executive producer 
of her "Here's Lucy" television show, which ran from 1968 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Ball portrayed a bag lady in the television movie "Stone Pillow." 
</P>
<P>
She launched her "Life With Lucy" series in 1986, but it failed to last the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Arnaz died that same year.

SALCIDO SPEAKS OF DEATH IN CALL TO MOTHER IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS MOCHIS, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Valentina Bojorquez Armendariz received the telephone call about 9 o'clock 
Friday morning, she immediately knew something was wrong. Her son, Ramon 
Salcido, usually in good spirits, was now in tears on the other end, calling 
from California to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Mama,' " she recalls him saying. " 'This is the last time you will hear my 
voice.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her memory is fuzzy, and she sobbed openly Tuesday as she recounted the 
conversation, but Bojorquez recalled that her eldest child told her, "I have 
problems and I'm going to kill myself," or "I have problems and they're going 
to kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Then he hung up. She said she has not heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until relatives began to call, spurred by news accounts in Mexico, 
that Bojorquez realized that her son was the knife-wielding gunman wanted for a 
bloody killing spree in the California wine country that began about 7 a.m. 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
By 9:30 a.m. Friday, authorities had discovered Salcido's wife, Angela, shot 
dead, his mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law slain miles away, and Salcido's 
supervisor at work also shot and killed. The next day, the bodies of two of 
their three daughters were found dumped by a road, their throats cut. A third 
daughter whose throat was cut has survived. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's mother reacted to the news with stunned disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Until the telephone call from Ramon Salcido last week, she said, she assumed 
that her son was living a kind of model life of the new immigrant, adapting 
himself admirably to foreign ways in his new country. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't eaten or slept or washed clothing or anything since that call," said 
Bojorquez, 49, as she stood outside her back door sobbing. "I'm all nerves. I 
want to see my son. I want to know how he is." 
</P>
<P>
And if her son does call again, Bojorquez says she will have advice for him. 
"Even though it pains my soul, I'll tell him to give himself up," she said, 
wiping away tears. "If he's not guilty, he should have nothing to fear. . . . 
He believed in his family. He loved them, and was very proud of them. I don't 
believe that Ramon could have done this." 
</P>
<P>
It seems no one who knew him in Mexico can fathom the possibility that the 
outgoing, affable boy and man they knew and loved could be one and the same 
with the sadistic slayer depicted by California authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Believe It' 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't believe it," said Edel Fernandez, who says he grew up with 
Salcido in the tree-lined, working-class neighborhood of Colonia Anahuac, not 
far from the center of this bustling agricultural and seafood processing city 
on the mainland, 20 miles from the Gulf of California. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just like everyone else. He was very peaceful. He had fights like 
everyone else, but it was nothing violent," said Fernandez, 25, who is now a 
sportswriter with El Debate, a daily newspaper in Los Mochis. 
</P>
<P>
At least one acquaintance hinted that Salcido may have had a darker side, 
perhaps a criminal past, but she declined to provide further information. A 
cousin said that Salcido left a wife and child behind when he left for the 
United States eight years ago, but his mother denied this. She said, to her 
knowledge, he had not married the woman, who, the mother said, had become 
pregnant by another man. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities here said they were investigating to determine whether Salcido had 
any criminal record, and also to learn if he may have fled to his home area. 
"There is concern that he may arrive here," said Jesus Enrique Berrelleza, 
commander here of the Sinaloa State Judicial Police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Incredulity 
</P>
<P>
But, along the unpaved streets of Colonia Anahuac, and other places where Ramon 
Salcido was known, there was widespread incredulity that the skinny, talkative 
and sociable person whom they knew was the glaring visage that stared at them 
this week from newspapers and television. While Salcido may have ultimately 
experienced difficulties adjusting to life in California, he was deeply rooted 
in this fast-growing city of 250,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
"He always seemed muy alegre (very happy)," said a cousin, Jesus Alonso 
Contreras Bojorquez, as he stood outside his wooden house, situated on fertile 
farmland on the outskirts of the city, where bougainvillea and rose bushes 
conceal one of the area's many canals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe he did it. I don't remember him having a problem with anyone 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Even non-relatives who had no particular reason to portray Salcido in a 
positive light professed shock at his current troubles. 
</P>
<P>
At the Duarte family television repair shop, where Salcido worked for more than 
a year as a driver and general helper more than a decade ago, the 
plain-speaking owners had nothing but praise. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a real good way of dealing with people," recalled Daniel Duarte Garcia, 
the owner, as he stood behind the counter in the shop, framed by yellowing 
boxes of assorted television components. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any problem with him," said Duarte, who expressed particular 
shock when told that Salcido stood accused of killing his boss in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Salcido Bojorquez, according to his mother, was born in Los Mochis on 
March 6, 1961, the eldest child of a family that would include four sons and 
two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
From all accounts, he and his family lived together in the simple two-room 
house on Calle Comonfort (named for a revolutionary hero), until he decided to 
leave for the United States about eight years ago. His mother, a very religious 
Roman Catholic -- she wore a medal cross Tuesday proclaiming Jesus es Mi Senor 
-- said she promised Saint Ramon that she would name her firstborn son after 
him. He completed six years of elementary school in the neighborhood but 
dropped out during his first year in secondary school, taking the first of 
several jobs, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was born into a family headed by a strong-willed mother and a father, 
Arnoldo Salcido Villarreal, who was frequently ill and would die in 1975 of 
heart problems at the age of 37, according to friends and relatives. The father 
had worked as a driver and maintenance chief for a local sugar mill, a job that 
provided a certain amount of security, until his death. 
</P>
<P>
The family struggled, but there was always enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
After working at the repair shop, Ramon Salcido took a position as a driver for 
a Carta Blanca beer distributorship, friends and relatives said. He apparently 
kept the position for more than a year, until he decided to leave for the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why Salcido decided to uproot himself remains murky. His relatives and 
friends say just that Salcido, like many of his countrymen, wanted to earn a 
more liveable wage and experience the "adventure" of the north. "Why does 
anyone leave," asked his mother, who remarried in 1977. "Ramon wanted a better 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido last visited his family here during the Christmas season of 1987, 
bringing his wife, whom they knew as Angela, and his three daughters from that 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"We all had a great time together," recalled Martin Salcido Bojorquez, 18, the 
youngest brother, who works in a tortilla factory near the family home. "She 
(Angela) was very beautiful," added the brother, who noted that the wife spoke 
no Spanish, making communication difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said they only knew of Angela, not the other woman in the United 
States with whom he had a child. During the 1987 visit, family members said, 
they saw no evidence of marital stress. And Salcido's mother said that her son 
spoke of having a warm relationship with the in-laws he is accused of savagely 
murdering.

FINANCING FOR RAIDERS DEAL IS MILLIONS SHORT, MEMOS REVEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH and EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new exchange of angry memos among those who have been, at various stages, 
responsible for trying to put together Irwindale's stadium deal with the Los 
Angeles Raiders is providing fresh evidence that the city remains short of 
financing for the $150-million project. 
</P>
<P>
In one memo, sent late last week to Irwindale City Manager Charles Martin, 
attorney Robert Corrado, who was retained by the Irwindale City Council on this 
and other matters, remarks that the city is $35 million "short . . . in trying 
to finalize the deal with the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Corrado, criticizing a recently fired Irwindale negotiator with the Raiders, 
Fred Lyte, wrote at another point that Lyte's failure to "deliver crucial 
items" of financing and political support for the project has left Corrado and 
other current negotiators "trying to keep the deal together without those 
crucial elements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project 'Jeopardized' 
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal memo released Tuesday that was also addressed to the city 
manager, Lyte said that the city's stadium project with the Raiders is now 
"jeopardized" and suggested that the new negotiators are "amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte lamented the recent firing by the City Council of yet another negotiator, 
Washington attorney Kenneth Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that opponents of the Raider project are greatly amused at this turn 
of events," Lyte remarked. He described Adams as "highly successful" in his 
efforts to defend and consummate the Irwindale-Raider deal and deplored "his 
replacement as attorney (for the city) by a criminal lawyer (Corrado) and 
another lawyer (Michael D. McCaffrey), both with little background in either 
this project or the sports field." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, dismissed March 23 by a 3-2 vote of the City Council, said in an 
interview Tuesday that the memos, and the public airing of financial shortfalls 
in the Raider negotiations, are "all very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"At the point that I departed, I was confident that the deal could be 
financed," Adams said. "It was a doable deal. Such stadium deals are always 
thin. This would not be easy. There were big obstacles, but it was doable." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Adams said he fears that "this kind of public dispute within the 
Irwindale group can only make it difficult for everyone to accomplish the 
people's objective, which is to bring the Raiders to Irwindale." 
</P>
<P>
Raider officials, who have seen a parade of different Irwindale negotiators 
propose various arrangements to them in the nearly two years since the team 
first announced that it would move to the small San Gabriel Valley city from 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, had no comment Tuesday on the latest 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
In his memo, Corrado accused Lyte, then an Irwindale redevelopment consultant, 
of failing to deliver on financial or other support commitments "on four 
previous occasions in the Raider deal." Specifically, Corrado cited Lyte's 
assurances that: 
</P>
<P>
* The Miller Brewing Co. would provide $19 million for advance payments to 
Raiders' owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
* He would deliver $35 million from other major companies in the area to help 
fund the stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
* He would handle political problems with Los Angeles County government to 
secure parking land for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
* He would handle political problems over the parking with the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte, in his rebuttal, said the request to Miller brewery for the $19 million 
had been turned down before the Irwindale City Council had approved the idea of 
a Raider deal. 
</P>
<P>
"As to my 'promise' to get major companies to contribute $35 million to the 
Raider project, I was legally stopped from doing this while Irwindale was under 
(a court restraining order delaying Raider negotiations) which ended in 
February, 1989," Lyte said. He noted that he had been fired before the court 
order was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Because the court order banned any further negotiations until an environmental 
impact report was prepared, Lyte said he was legally barred from working on the 
political problems with the county and the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Corrado also suggested in his memo that Lyte had recommended the services of 
the Washington law firm of Dickstein &amp; Shapiro, for which Adams worked, in 
part because the firm employed Lyte's son-in-law. The firm "cost the city more 
than $1 million in legal fees" before Adams was dismissed, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte said that at the council's request he conducted a search for a legal 
adviser "among about 30 leading law firms" and that in recommending Dickstein 
&amp; Shapiro he had "fully disclosed that my son-in-law, Bruce Holcomb, was 
one of the 150 junior members" of that firm.

GOVERNOR PUSHES RIDE-SHARING -- CELEBRITY MOTHERS GIVE A KEY ASSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian Tuesday launched a re-energized, $1-million advertising 
campaign aimed at reducing traffic congestion and smog by persuading solo 
drivers to leave their cars at home and join ride-sharing pools. 
</P>
<P>
To help him announce the campaign at Universal City, the governor enlisted the 
support of the mothers of entertainment and sports celebrities to promote the 
campaign theme that "your mother always taught you to share" and she "still 
knows what is best for you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Mothers 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Deukmejian at Texaco Plaza were Jackie Stallone, mother of 
Sylvester Stallone, and Georgia Holt, mother of Cher. Later in San Francisco, 
Robin Williams' mother, Laurie Williams, and Joanne Horton, mother of 
television's Peter Horton, joined the governor to promote ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Christina Johnson, mother of Laker star Magic Johnson, has made a 
radio spot that declares that her pro basketball son "got where he is today 
because I taught him how to share." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who has drawn criticism for the deterioration of California 
highways and for worsening traffic congestion, asserted in a brief speech that 
"construction alone won't solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
"That is where ride-sharing comes in," he told a group of Texaco employees, 
many of whom commute in van pools. "Your mother always told you to share. It 
was good advice then, and it's good advice to meet California's transportation 
challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said currently there is an average of six persons in every five cars 
during peak commute periods. He said that "we can virtually eliminate 
congestion" if the average could be increased to seven people in every five 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
For the last couple of years, Deukmejian -- who arrived 13 minutes late for the 
kickoff ceremony after being stuck in traffic -- repeatedly has urged 
Californians to join in car and van pools or to take public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
However, while gaining a substantial number of converts, his appeals have 
fallen short of winning the kind of widespread acceptance that would make a 
drastic dent in congestion and automobile-caused smog. Also, his earlier pleas 
were not linked to a well-financed advertising effort. 
</P>
<P>
The $1 million in state funds will finance what Administration officials call 
an intensified campaign, featuring radio and newspaper advertising, billboards 
and public service announcements on television. Chiefly, the promotion of 
ride-sharing will focus on the Los Angeles and San Francico areas. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Deukmejian issued an executive order directing state government 
agencies to develop a "decongestion" traffic plan for employees and outlined a 
series of incentives for workers to leave their vehicles at home. These 
included a state subsidized transit pass for commuters and 30 minutes a day of 
compensated travel time for those using transit or van pools.

EX-U.S. TREASURER ANGELA BUCHANAN TO OPPOSE HAYES FOR STATE OFFICE 
</P>

Setting the stage for a costly primary fight, former U.S. Treasurer Angela M. 
(Bay) Buchanan barnstormed California Tuesday to announce her candidacy for the 
Republican nomination for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, 40, an Irvine resident, flew to Sacramento, Fresno, Burbank and San 
Diego to promote her challenge to incumbent Treasurer Thomas Hayes, a 
Republican. Hayes, 43, was appointed to his post by Gov. George Deukmejian last 
year following the death of Jesse Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
Calling herself "the underdog" to the governor's candidate, Buchanan 
nevertheless dismissed suggestions that she was defying Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's Not Her Foe 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not running against George Deukmejian," Buchanan said at a press 
conference in Fresno. "If he (Deukmejian) wants to run for treasurer, I'll be 
glad to step out," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and other Republican leaders had hoped to avoid the primary fight 
that now appears likely. Many GOP insiders were unhappy that Deukmejian had not 
chosen someone with stronger party credentials than Hayes to succeed Unruh in 
the only constitutional office that has fallen vacant during Deukmejian's term 
in office -- and the only one aside from Deukmejian's now held by a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, the nonpartisan state auditor general for 10 years, had purposefully 
stayed clear of party politics during his tenure. His job required him to make 
recommendations to the Legislature and governor regarding state government 
operations. He registered as a Republican when he was appointed treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Buchanan avoided attacking Hayes' record, but sharply 
questioned his party credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for conservatives to mount a campaign on behalf of Tom 
Hayes. He has never lifted a finger for the (conservative) movement," Buchanan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the GOP primary is expected to face Kathleen Brown, the leading 
Democratic candidate, in the 1990 general election. Brown is the sister of 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown Sr. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I can beat Kathleen Brown. I can keep this office for Republicans," 
Buchanan said in Sacramento. Buchanan herself is the sister of a political 
figure, conservative Washington commentator Patrick Buchanan, who also served 
in the White House during the Reagan and Nixon administrations. 
</P>
<P>
"A run of Jerry Brown's sister against Pat Buchanan's will bring national 
attention and national money," Angela Buchanan said Tuesday, estimating that 
she will need up to $1.5 million for the primary alone. 
</P>
<P>
Should Buchanan and Brown both win their parties' nominations, it will be the 
first time in California history that two women have faced each other in a 
general election for a state constitutional office. Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu and former Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest -- who coincidentally also was a 
U.S. treasurer before she ran for the state post -- are the only two women to 
have been elected to statewide office, according to Caren Daniels Meade of the 
secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is expected to be able to raise money statewide and nationally for her 
campaign because of her former position as U.S. treasurer and her extensive 
national Republican connections. At 30, she was named in 1979 as national 
treasurer of Reagan's presidential campaign. In 1986 she managed the U.S. 
Senate campaign of Los Angeles commentator Bruce Herschensohn, a fellow 
conservative who came in second for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan has hired Washington consultant Roger Stone and pollster Lance 
Tarrance for her effort. She pledged Tuesday to refuse donations from anyone 
who does any business with the treasurer's office.

BROWN FAVORS SAFER GUN BAN ROUTE

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on Tuesday cautioned against sending to a 
two-house conference committee a bill to ban the manufacture and sale of most 
military-style assault weapons in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said there is too much "risk" of losing a second vote in the 
Assembly, where the bill passed Monday night without a vote to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Brown (D-San Francisco) urged the Senate to send the measure by President Pro 
Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) directly to Gov. George Deukmejian, who 
has said he favors banning assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti indicated earlier this week that he might want to send the bill to a 
conference committee in order to "strengthen" it because law enforcement 
supporters of the proposal liked earlier versions better before it was 
"weakened" by the Assembly Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
A conference committee's final bill, however, still would be subject to votes 
on the floors of both houses -- a prospect that Brown said he found unsettling, 
given the difficulty he has already encountered in rounding up a simple 
majority in the 80-member Assembly in support of even the milder version of the 
gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
"If you only have 41 votes, you can lose one or two (votes) for whatever 
reason," Brown said at a press conference Tuesday. "They could go away to a 
funeral. Something could happen to them on the roadway. They could become 
injured. When you operate with that margin, you don't play with it." 
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of any increase in the 41 are fairly nil," he said, adding that 
he believed it would probably take "five more Purdys in the next week" to 
increase the vote total. 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to Patrick Purdy, the drifter who attacked elementary school 
students in Stockton with a Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifle in January. He 
killed five children, wounded 29 of their classmates and a teacher, and then 
commited suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to run the risk of losing this opportunity," Brown said. "This is 
a significant achievement. This is the first state, to my knowledge, that has 
gone as far as we have gone on semiautomatic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to consider concurrence in Assembly amendments to 
Roberti's bill Thursday. At the same time, it is scheduled to take up a similar 
Assembly bill sponsored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). If Roberti 
decides against sending the legislation to a conference committee, it could 
then possibly go directly to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures would outlaw the manufacture and sale of about 60 semiautomatic 
rifles, pistols and shotguns that are used by some street gang members and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
A Roberti spokesman said the Senate leader and Roos are still talking about 
strategy. "He (Roberti) has not made up his mind yet," said Bob Forsythe, the 
Senate leader's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Brown also said that: 
</P>
<P>
* Assembly Democrats may strip some of the governor's favorite programs, such 
as the Office of Tourism and foreign trade offices, from his proposed 
$47.8-billion state budget and use these items as leverage for negotiations 
with Deukmejian. "The budget problem is far greater than it has been projected 
to be," the Speaker said. "It's scary. It's going to require some progressive 
leadership from the governor." 
</P>
<P>
* He does not know what will happen in the Assembly to a Senate-passed bill 
that would lower from .10% to .08% the blood alcohol concentration level at 
which a driver is presumed to be under the influence of alcohol. Sponsors argue 
that the measure would make it easier to prosecute and convict drunk drivers. 
Authored by Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), it cleared the upper house by a 
24-3 vote last week. "I frankly think we should have a bill that says if you 
drink, don't drive, period," Brown said. "I don't understand the difference 
between .10% and .08%."

SOCCER FANS HARASSED POLICE HELPING VICTIMS, BRITON SAYS

Soccer fans kicked and harassed police as the officers tried to rescue victims 
of the Sheffield stadium disaster, a Conservative lawmaker charged Tuesday as 
the government officially began its inquiry into Britain's worst sports 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
During the night, the death of a 14-year-old boy pushed the number of 
fatalities to 95. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been sharply criticized for their handling of crowd on Saturday at 
Hillsborough Stadium, where the deaths occurred just minutes into a semifinal 
league championship match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Patnick, a Conservative member of Parliament representing Sheffield, 
said officers told him Liverpool fans hindered police as they tried to save 
people. Similar claims, attributed to unidentified police officers, appeared in 
press reports. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they were hampered, harassed, punched, kicked . . . by Liverpool 
fans," Patnick said. "All of this happened to them . . . and now they are being 
blamed." 
</P>
<P>
But Peter Taylor, a lord justice of appeal who is conducting the official 
inquiry, said it is too soon to assess blame. 
</P>
<P>
He said his investigation will cover all aspects of the tragedy, including the 
behavior of fans outside the match, policing, sports ground safety, crowd 
control and government plans to require soccer fans to carry identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus will be to find out what happened and make recommendations as to how 
this situation can be avoided in the future," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Switzerland, Europe's chief soccer executive withdrew an earlier 
remark comparing English fans to wild animals. But Jacques Georges, president 
of the European Union of Football Assns., also has indicated that fans' 
behavior in Sheffield may keep British clubs barred from European Cup 
tournaments, despite a recent vote to readmit them in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Liverpool, nine injured fans filed writs seeking damages for 
personal injuries. The writs allege negligence or breach of duty against South 
Yorkshire police and the Sheffield soccer club. 
</P>
<P>
All the victims were Liverpool fans crushed against a crowd-control fence.

BIG SUPPLY CONVOY BREAKS THROUGH REBELS' BLOCKADE TO REACH KABUL

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convoy of up to 1,000 armored vehicles and 500 trucks carrying Soviet arms 
and food broke through a guerrilla blockade and rumbled into Kabul on Tuesday 
in the biggest operation of its kind since Moscow's troops left Afghanistan two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter gunships flew overhead as the columns of tanks, armored cars, 
mounted multiple-rocket launchers and food trucks reached the capital after 
running a gauntlet of guerrillas dug in on mountains dominating the Salang 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers said the convoy carrying arms, rice, flour and wheat took 45 days to 
get from the Soviet border -- normally a three-day journey. 
</P>
<P>
Its arrival was a significant victory for the Soviet-backed Kabul government, 
which has fought a powerful moujahedeen alliance on its own since the last 
Soviet troops pulled out Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The convoy had to battle moujahedeen determined to starve Kabul into surrender, 
and drivers said they saw dozens of trucks and armored cars burning along the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers said they saw soldiers handing over truckloads of food and 
ammunition to the moujahedeen as security for safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
With the Salang Highway closed, a Soviet airlift of food and military equipment 
has enabled the government of President Najibullah to continue fighting the 
moujahedeen, armed and financed by the West. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the highway had caused a pileup of up to 140,000 tons of essential 
supplies on the Soviet border, with wheat germinating and other perishable food 
rotting. 
</P>
<P>
A 90-truck vanguard reached Kabul last Friday, but the moujahedeen, who 
sometimes operate only 12 miles from the capital, had prevented the rest from 
getting through.

ISRAEL ACCUSED OF CONDONING ATTACKS ON ARABS

Amnesty International on Tuesday accused the Israeli government of effectively 
encouraging troops to kill or wound Palestinians during the uprising in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The international human rights group also urged Israel to set up an independent 
judicial inquiry into what it called a wide range of rights violations by 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Amnesty International believes authorities were "in effect 
encouraging" misuse of force by failing to speak out against excessive violence 
or issue clear guidelines to soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner called the 
charge "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are under strict instructions not to cause any casualties and we 
take great care when it happens that there is an inquiry in every case," Pazner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In continuing violence in the occupied territories, three Palestinians were 
killed by unknown assailants in Nablus on the West Bank and in Gaza City. 
However, Palestinian sources said Tuesday they believe the killers were other 
Arabs retaliating against suspected "collaborators" with Israel's secret 
police.

THOUSANDS FLEE BEIRUT IN BRIEF TRUCE FOR WOUNDED

Thousands of civilians fled West Beirut on Tuesday as Christian and Syrian 
gunners held their fire briefly to allow the evacuation of 70 severely wounded 
Muslims to a French hospital ship. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of cars packed with suitcases and mattresses sped down a seaside 
highway to south and east Lebanon as the wounded were assembled outside the 
home of acting Premier Salim Hoss. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and 43 wounded overnight as the city's divided 
population huddled in bunkers and bomb shelters for another night. That raised 
the toll to 243 killed and 890 wounded since fighting erupted March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Pillars of flame from burning buildings lit the sky, and the city was laden 
with smoke as Christian army units and Syrian and Muslim gunners bombarded the 
capital with rocket, artillery and tank fire. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the state's Christian television station in East Beirut took 30 
direct hits. It has stopped broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
A Christian barrage gutted Muslim Radio Beirut's nine-story building Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
France's President Francois Mitterrand asked President Bush, British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders Tuesday to help end the 
fighting in this former French colony, a Mitterrand spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee the United States is unable to end the violence and has little 
influence with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council called an emergency meeting for Friday on Lebanon, 
although it has failed to stop the fighting with three unsuccessful truces. 
</P>
<P>
The council is composed of the foreign ministers of the 22 member states, which 
in 1976 granted Syria a mandate to pacify Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded Muslims were driven with 50 relatives in ambulances and taxis to 
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. They are to be ferried to the hospital ship 
Rance, then flown to France. 
</P>
<P>
In the Christian port of Juniyah, north of Beirut, witnesses said that hundreds 
of panic-stricken Christians boarded small motor launches to reach a ferry 
plying between Lebanon and Larnaca, Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cypriot-flagged ferries provide the only link with the outside world for 
the besieged Christians and have carried thousands to Larnaca since the 
fighting started. 
</P>
<P>
Another French vessel, a tanker, was sailing off Lebanon while French officials 
negotiated to unload fuel oil to reactivate power stations. Beirut has been 
without power since Sunday.

OIL REMOVED FROM BEACH OUTSIDE SOUND

VALDEZ, Alaska

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taffy-like tar mixed with seaweed was scoured off a beach Tuesday at the end of 
Resurrection Bay near Seward, the first town outside Prince William Sound to 
have oil reach its shores. 
</P>
<P>
High tides and southerly winds off the Gulf of Alaska pushed the crude oil up 
the fjord-like channel, where two Coast Guard oil-skimming ships were out of 
action because the goo gummed up their pumps, Deputy Seward City Manager Darryl 
Schaefermeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We put protective booming up around the critical (salmon) spawning streams in 
the bay four weeks ago," Schaefermeyer said. "But as far as the rest of the bay 
there was no effective way of booming it all off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Oil Sightings 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard reported fresh sightings of oil on remote beaches on the Kenai 
Peninsula. A Valdez center for cleaning oil-fouled birds said at least 1,850 
birds had died from the spill, along with 328 sea otters. The center has 
cleaned and released 22 birds. 
</P>
<P>
Resurrection Bay, with a channel 600 feet deep, is about 125 miles from where 
the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, dumping 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard chief, approved Exxon's cleanup plan for the 
sound Monday, but expressed reservations about whether it could succeed. He 
gave Exxon until May 1 to complete a cleanup plan for outside the sheltered 
sound, where the work is likely to be even harder along the Gulf of Alaska 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Huge swells along the exposed coast will often prevent boats or crews from 
working close to the beach, said Peter Fitzmaurice, chief ranger at Kenai 
Fjords National Park, which stretches from Seward southwest along most of the 
southern coast of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"They can work the inner bays, but if a big swell comes in, there's no way 
they'll be able to work near the rocks," he said.

LOW SAVINGS RATE SEEN AS MAIN U.S. PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS' JOINT ECONOMIC PANEL SAYS ECONOMY HAS PERFORMED WELL, CONCEDES SOCIAL 
FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In another sign that the confrontational years of Ronald Reagan are over, both 
Democrats and Republicans on Congress' Joint Economic Committee Tuesday 
accepted for the first time since 1980 a common statement on the strengths and 
weaknesses of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats acknowledged that the economy has performed fairly well in the 1980s 
in sustaining growth with modest inflation. Republicans conceded that such 
major problems as poverty, homelessness and inadequate public education have 
been allowed to fester during the Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers agreed that the nation's chief economic problem is a low savings rate 
that has been aggravated by the outsized federal deficit. But they remained 
sharply divided over measures to close the gap between anemic domestic savings 
and the higher investments needed to increase U.S. competitiveness in a global 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The top Republican on the panel, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, told 
reporters that Congress should restore individual retirement accounts to all 
taxpayers in an effort to spur savings and investment. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic chairman, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, said that the 
"top economic priority" should be balancing the federal budget, because that 
would stop lawmakers from proposing new tax breaks that would decrease 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In separate sections, the Republicans on the panel argued that less government 
intervention and lower federal spending are the best ways to foster continued 
growth, but Democrats emphasized the threat of a large trade deficit and urged 
greater federal spending on public works, education and other social 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resort to Generalities 
</P>
<P>
To paper over such differences, the lawmakers resorted to a host of vague 
generalities rather than specific policy recommendations in their joint report. 
For example, although condemning "uncomfortably large deficits," the report did 
little more than acknowledge that "the hard choices remain." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers' reaction to last Friday's budget agreement between the White House 
and congressional leaders was symptomatic of their approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I am very disturbed by the number of budgetary games that are 
played in that agreement," Hamilton said. "I think that we are eroding the 
strength of the American economy as we put off the question of serious deficit 
reduction." 
</P>
<P>
But Hamilton nonetheless endorsed the budget package as "the best agreement 
that can be reached." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, panel members displayed considerable ambivalence about the role 
played by the Federal Reserve in keeping inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Steve Symms (R-Ida.) worried that the Fed makes inflation worse when it 
pushes up interest rates in response to inflation signals. 
</P>
<P>
"That may not have the effect of being non-inflationary," he said, "but have 
just the opposite effect as it increases the cost of doing business and pushes 
the price index up." 
</P>
<P>
There was one reminder of the era when the panel was sharply split between 
Democrats, who attacked Reagan's economic policies, and Republicans, who 
defended them. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), a former chairman of the committee, signed the 
joint report but described it in a separate statement as betraying "an 
inappropriate sense of complacency. . . . I believe we face economic weaknesses 
of such magnitude as to warrant remedial action. . . . The present recovery has 
been long-lived, but longevity is not necessarily a good indicator of success."

TANKER'S OIL GOES ASHORE OUTSIDE SOUND 
</P>

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taffy-like tar mixed with seaweed was scoured off a beach Tuesday at the end of 
picturesque Resurrection Bay near Seward, the first town outside Prince William 
Sound to have oil wash up on its shores. 
</P>
<P>
High tides and southerly wind off the Gulf of Alaska pushed the crude oil up 
the fjord-like channel, where two Coast Guard oil-skimming ships were out of 
action because the goo gummed up their pumps, Deputy Seward City Manager Darryl 
Schaefermeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We put protective booming up around the critical (salmon) spawning streams in 
the bay four weeks ago," Schaefermeyer said. "But as far as the rest of the 
bay, there was no effective way of booming it all off." 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard reported fresh sightings of oil on remote beaches on the Kenai 
Peninsula. A Valdez center for cleaning oil-fouled birds said at least 1,850 
birds had died from the spill, along with 328 sea otters. The center has 
cleaned and released 22 birds. 
</P>
<P>
Resurrection Bay, with a channel 600 feet deep, is about 125 air miles from 
where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, dumping more than 10 
million gallons of Alaska crude oil into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservations Expressed 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard chief, approved Exxon's cleanup plan for the 
sound Monday, but expressed reservations about whether it could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp., reacted angrily Tuesday. At a news 
conference in New York, he said he was confident that most of the beaches and 
rocks would be clean by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm not going to tell you that if you go up there a year from now you 
won't find some black places on some rocks, but we're going to make every 
effort to get it off," he said. "I am telling you that a year from now the 
toxicity will be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with Fortune magazine, Rawl acknowledged that it was 
"bad judgment" for Exxon to allow a captain with a known drinking problem to 
command the tanker responsible for the disastrous spill. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone in management should have been notified" when Capt. Joseph Hazelwood 
took his first drink after being treated for alcoholism in 1985, Rawl said. 
"Our policy would not have permitted this man back on the ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that there was bad judgment involved in even putting a 
person with a critical skill back in that kind of work. It is pretty clear we 
have to tighten those things up," he said.

The Army disciplined 27 noncommissioned and commissioned officers at Ft. 
Benning for mistreating recruits, a spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The mistreatment, which occurred in February, sent 36 new soldiers to a 
military hospital, where doctors diagnosed them as suffering from a muscle 
deterioration condition brought on by excessive exercise. All but one of the 
recruits has returned to training, the spokesman said.

MAN TESTIFIES HE WAS PAID TO BEAT WAYNE, BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the men accused of beating John Wayne's daughter and her boyfriend 
testified Tuesday that he was hired by a private investigator who told him that 
a doctor client involved in a child custody battle wanted to "teach his wife a 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, said the investigator never 
mentioned by name Aissa Wayne's ex-husband, Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis, 
who is charged with masterminding the Oct. 3 attack against Wayne, 32, and 
Roger W. Luby, 53, at Luby's Newport Beach estate. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis has denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
But Bouey said the investigator showed him and an accomplice photos of Wayne 
and Luby, described the client's car as a black stretch limousine and provided 
them with a floor plan of Wayne's Corona del Mar home, where the attack was 
originally intended to take place. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 35, has a black stretch limousine and visited the homes of Wayne and 
Luby in order to pick up an infant daughter by his former marriage to Wayne, 
according to testimony in his preliminary hearing this week in Harbor Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were in the midst of a custody battle over 2-year-old Anastasia when 
the incident occurred. Gionis was awarded custody of the child in February, but 
Wayne won temporary custody last week pending the outcome of the criminal 
proceedings against her ex-husband. Gionis is being held in the Orange County 
Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, being held in lieu of $1 million bail on charges of assault with a 
deadly weapon in the attack, testified Tuesday that he did not know the 
identity of the two victims until two days after the attack, when the 
investigator, O. Daniel Gal of Beverly Hills, mentioned that the woman was the 
daughter of the late actor. 
</P>
<P>
During five hours on the stand -- much of it under grueling cross-examination 
by Gionis' lead attorney, F. Lee Bailey -- Bouey portrayed himself as a 
reticent participant in the crime, while casting blame for all the violence 
that took place on his partner and longtime friend, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, 
an unemployed apartment manager from Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, described in police reports as a neo-Nazi, is also jailed in lieu 
of $1-million bail, charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

VIET GROUP ENDS RECALL DRIVE AFTER COUNCILMAN APOLOGIZES 
</P>

Leaders in Orange County's Vietnamese community accepted an apology from 
Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr. on Tuesday and ended a recall effort 
initiated after he made some "insensitive remarks" at a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of demonstrating against him, we're going to circulate his statement 
of apology," said Chuyen V. Nguyen, chairman of a Vietnamese ad hoc committee, 
which formed last week to represent more than 30 groups in Orange County's 
Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar began when the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee was 
denied a parade permit by the Westminster council. At a meeting televised on a 
local cable channel, Fry told the veterans' group that they should commemorate 
their war dead on a U.S. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman added, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 flyers and 500 posters attacking Fry were printed in Vietnamese 
by the ad hoc committee, which planned to kick off the recall drive Tuesday 
afternoon in the county's Little Saigon area, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
Posters bearing a smiling photo of the retired grocery clerk carried the words: 
"We voted for you last year. We feel sorry for you this year!" A headline above 
Fry's photograph read, "The Vietnamese Community Is Being Insulted." 
</P>
<P>
Fry could not be reached on Tuesday. But Dr. Daniel H. Ninburg, chairman of the 
county Human Relations Commission, released a statement that had been drafted 
on Fry's behalf by commission executive director Rusty Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize for my statements that have caused this outcry," the 
Fry statement read. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I did not intend to insult the right of all people to take pride in 
their ethnic, racial or national heritage. I did not intend to belittle the 
sacrifice made by our allies, the South Vietnamese, during the Vietnam War, nor 
did I mean that those who died in the war should not be honored."

WOMAN WITH GUN CHASES BURGLARS, SHOT BY OFFICER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood woman who had been chasing some burglars was shot by a policeman 
early Tuesday when she ignored the officer's orders and reached for a pistol in 
her waistband, according to Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the 35-year-old woman, her husband and son had armed themselves 
and dashed into the street to chase some people they had seen breaking into 
their car. 
</P>
<P>
The burglars escaped, but moments later police responding to a "shots-fired" 
call confronted the family at Fountain Avenue and Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Sagrero, struck in the abdomen by a single bullet fired from a 
policeman's pistol, was rushed to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank where 
she was in serious but stable condition. Detectives said she would not be 
charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Margie Reid gave this account of what happened: 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 4 a.m., Celia Sagrero; her husband, Luis, 44, and their son, 
Amador, 18, saw several people burglarizing their car that was parked in front 
of their home in the 1400 block of El Centro Avenue. The Sagreros each grabbed 
a pistol, dashed outside and chased after the fleeing suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Several shots were fired, although none apparently struck anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers responding to a call about the gunshots spotted Amador 
Sagrero strolling down the street about a block away at Fountain and Vine 
carrying a .22-caliber pistol. At the officers' command, the young man 
surrendered the pistol and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Lt. Edward Garcia, a 20-year veteran of the force, arrived to 
see Celia Sagrero walking toward her son, who lay handcuffed on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Garcia saw she had a handgun in her waistband and ordered her to raise her 
hands," Reid said. "She complied. But then she reached for her gun. The 
lieutenant fired one round from his 9-millimeter pistol." 
</P>
<P>
Reid said the officers promptly arrested the wounded woman, who was found to be 
carrying a loaded .22-caliber revolver. Other policemen said they found Luis 
Sagrero sitting in a nearby car. They said a .44-magnum revolver was found in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent records check revealed that the .44-magnum revolver had been 
stolen, and Amador Sagrero was booked on suspicion of receiving stolen 
property, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sagrero was released.

A judge rejected a motion to dismiss a felony indictment against Assemblyman 
John R. Lewis (R-Orange), accused of forging former President Ronald Reagan's 
name on endorsement letters mailed to thousands of voters in 1986. Defense 
attorneys, relying on a nearly 100-year-old state Supreme Court decision, 
maintained that Lewis could not be charged with forgery, because he did not 
intend to defraud anyone of money or property. They said the phony endorsements 
were, at most, an unfair ploy to influence voters. But Sacramento County 
Superior Court Judge James Morris ruled that the voters could have been 
defrauded of their "voting franchise right" and ordered Lewis to appear for 
arraignment on May 2.

The leader of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party said there will be no 
rehabilitation of Alexander Dubcek, who led the 1968 "Prague Spring" 
liberalization campaign that was crushed by Soviet tanks. "We don't intend any 
political rehabilitation or return of Alexander Dubcek to political activity," 
Czechoslovak leader Milos Jakes told reporters in Moscow after meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The return of Dubcek might be 
misunderstood and could "lead to instability," he said. The Czech Communist 
Party lags behind Hungary and Poland in adopting reforms modeled on Gorbachev's 
restructuring campaign, but Jakes said it is changing at its own pace.

A Cuban MIG-21 fighter jet on a training flight crashed into a house in eastern 
Cuba, killing its 22-year-old pilot, Cuba's national news agency AIN reported. 
One person on the ground, a 26-year-old man, was badly burned, and four others 
suffered minor injuries. The crash destroyed the house and set fire to two 
adjoining residences in the city of Holguin, the news agency said. The pilot of 
the Soviet-made plane was identified as Lt. Felix Senen Delgado Martinez. The 
cause of the accident was not known. Cuba's air force has about 250 combat 
aircraft. Holguin, capital of the province of the same name, is a city of about 
500,000 people, 490 miles east of Havana.

President Bush signed into law a $49.8-million package of non-military aid to 
sustain the Contras until Nicaragua holds elections next February. Bush 
reiterated his pledge to support a diplomatic solution in Nicaragua and 
repeated his call for the Soviet Union to advance the peace process by ending 
its military aid to the Sandinistas. At a Rose Garden ceremony before he signed 
the compromise legislation his Administration worked out with Congress, Bush 
said: "The success of the Central American peace process and the prospects of 
national reconciliation in Nicaragua depend on full and honest Sandinista 
compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy and freedom."

NASA rolled out a full-scale model of its next generation space shuttle. The 
115-foot mock-up of the planned Shuttle-C, an unmanned, cargo-carrying shuttle, 
was put together in a hanger at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, 
Ala., for about $500,000, officials said. The National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration hopes to get the first funds for a $1.5-billion Shuttle-C 
development program in its fiscal 1991 budget. As proposed by Marshall 
engineers, Shuttle-C would be a wingless version of the existing space 
shuttles. Shuttle-C would weigh less than half as much as the manned orbiters, 
but could carry payloads three times as heavy. Unlike its manned counterparts, 
Shuttle-C could not be reused.

A convict serving a life sentence for drug smuggling and the helicopter pilot 
who tried to spring him from prison but crashed were charged with conspiracy 
and attempted escape. Ben Kramer, a nationally known powerboat racer serving a 
life sentence for marijuana smuggling, and sea-urchin diver Charlie Stevens, 
both 34, were charged as they recuperated at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Stevens 
crashed his two-seater Bell helicopter Monday after it snagged on a 14-foot 
wire security fence around the Metropolitan Correctional Center during an 
attempt to take Kramer out of a recreation yard. Kramer suffered a compound 
fracture to his left ankle and was listed in satisfactory condition. Stevens, 
with two broken legs and injuries to the head, neck and back, was in good 
condition.

A Christian Science couple was found guilty in Sarasota, Fla., of third-degree 
murder and felony child abuse in the death of their 7-year-old daughter Amy, 
who died at home in 1986 of diabetes after they relied on prayer for her 
recovery instead of seeking medical care. The six-member jury deliberated for 
about three hours before finding William Hermanson, 42, and his wife, 
Christine, 38, guilty. The Hermansons used as their defense a 1975 Florida law 
that protects parents who withhold treatment from children if they are 
"legitimately practicing" religious beliefs. But the prosecution told jurors 
that Christian Science allows medical intervention when prayer has not worked.

Arthur Henry Burton Jr., a U.S. citizen deported by the Sandinista government 
after his private plane crash-landed in Nicaragua, was questioned and released 
by U.S. Customs Service officials when he arrived in Miami aboard a Costa Rican 
airliner. Managua had charged that Burton, 39, was on his way to Colombia to 
pick up cocaine when he crashed March 25. A Customs official said that because 
of the "possible drug involvement," Burton was interrogated when he entered the 
United States but was then "sent on his way."

LAB SHUTDOWN CAUSES BACKLOG IN PROCESSING PAP SMEAR TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state-imposed shutdown of Southern California's largest Pap smear 
laboratory has deluged other labs with new business, created delays in 
processing the tests and left a number of physicians with no place to send 
slides for diagnosis, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology Services Medical Group in Tarzana was closed by the state 
Department of Health Services last Friday for allegedly making too many 
misdiagnoses of Pap smears. The lab, which processed nearly 700,000 smears a 
year, allegedly had an error rate of 21%. 
</P>
<P>
"This shutdown has put a burden on the system," said Stanley Ordway, president 
of Physicians Reference Laboratory in Huntington Beach, which Tuesday was 
turning away requests from some former Central Pathology clients to handle Pap 
smears. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel like we could take on that work," Ordway added. "We can't 
overload our technologists here." 
</P>
<P>
Many labs said they could no longer guarantee the industry standard of issuing 
test results within 24 hours because of the backlog of smears. 
</P>
<P>
"The turnaround time on Pap smears is not going to be as quick because there is 
going to be a real logjam," said Dr. Roberta Nieberg, a professor of pathology 
at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Some labs also said patients may have to wait as long as two weeks before their 
Pap smear can be read. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state health officials stressed Tuesday that they plan to enforce an 
order issued Monday against Central Pathology. That order required the lab to 
contact hundreds of thousands of women whose Pap smears were diagnosed as 
normal over the last five years and offer to pay for new tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left Up to Firm 
</P>
<P>
Health department spokesman Norm Hartman said the state will leave it up to 
Central Pathology to determine how to pay the reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
"The California Department of Health Services is not going to become a 
clearinghouse for the exchange of funds," Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Central Pathology said it was unsure how to proceed. "The state has not 
provided us with any information, and we do not have the answer to that 
ourselves," said company spokesman Martin Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Central Diagnostic Laboratory -- which is affiliated with Central 
Pathology -- sent a letter to doctors saying it would continue to pick up their 
Pap smears but have other labs diagnose them. "We will be referring your Pap 
smears to another quality cytology laboratory," the letter said. "We assure you 
that service will not be interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic Lab, which is also based in Tarzana, said it was negotiating 
with a number of labs to take over its accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that no one laboratory can assume all of that volume of 
work," Cooper said. "So what Central Diagnostic is going to have to do is find 
a number of different laboratories to which it will refer its Pap smear work." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said none of the labs Central Diagnostic is talking to are owned by Dr. 
Allen Levy, who was the founder of Central Pathology. Levy, through a holding 
company, also owns Central Diagnostic. 
</P>
<P>
During the last several weeks, a number of physicians have stopped using both 
Central Diagnostic and Central Pathology and have been looking for other labs 
to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Angry 
</P>
<P>
Some obstetricians and gynecologists were angry Tuesday about being left with 
no place to send slides. "I don't know how to pick a good lab now," said Dr. 
Arthur Wisot, a Torrance physician. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Norm Hartman said the Health Services Department is preparing an 
advisory that will outline steps doctors can take to find reputable 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the problem of Central Pathology's shutdown is a severe shortage of 
cytotechnologists -- the people who sit with a microscope and study slides for 
signs of medical abnormalities including cervical cancer. The American Society 
of Clinical Pathologists recently reported that 13.6% of existing 
cytotechnologist jobs nationwide are vacant.

750 MAY BE LAID OFF AT LONG BEACH SHIPYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commander of the Long Beach Naval Shipyard has recommended layoffs at the 
sprawling Terminal Island facility that would pare the work force by about 750 
within three months, it was disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Pentagon, the latest in a series of reductions would leave 
the shipyard with about 3,900 workers -- well below a peak of more than 7,000 
five years ago, when the yard was busy renovating the battleship Missouri and 
repairing other ships. 
</P>
<P>
Once the second-largest employer in Long Beach, behind McDonnell Douglas Corp., 
the shipyard would fall to sixth place among local employers with the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rodriguez, head of the shipyard's joint labor unions, complained that the 
reduction would harm the Navy's readiness in event of a national emergency 
because the yard was designed to repair battle-damaged ships. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get down low enough (in employment), we will not be able to do the 
complex jobs we do," said Rodriguez, president of the yard's Metal Trades 
Council. "It will take away our flexibility and . . . ability to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of the Navy Everett Pyatt confirmed in a letter to Rep. 
Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) earlier this month that he is weighing whether 
to accept a recommendation by shipyard commander Capt. Larry D. Johnson to lay 
off up to 520 permanent employees. 
</P>
<P>
Shipyard labor officials say that more than 200 temporary workers would be 
dismissed as well. As of Tuesday, the yard employed 4,646 people, including 544 
part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
Pyatt has not said whether he will approve the cutbacks, but his letter noted 
that the shipyard has been bidding on ship overhauls based on a reduced work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"If the manning is not adjusted as proposed by the shipyard commander, these 
bids must be withdrawn. Such action would further reduce workload and manning 
requirements," Pyatt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory 60-day notices informing employees of layoffs could be issued April 
28 if Pyatt gives his approval, yard sources said. Already, the yard is 
undergoing a management reorganization and eliminating apprentice and training 
programs in anticipation of the reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of demoralizing when you're waiting for the big hammer to fall," 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Yard officials had expected a relatively stable workload this year. But a 
provision of a federal appropriations bill passed last year requires that all 
contracts to upgrade warships be put out for open competition among public and 
private yards. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new provision, officials canceled a plan to have the Long Beach 
facility begin renovation of the cruiser Halsey last month so that the job 
could be put up for bid. That development, in turn, created a workload lull 
that is expected to last until summer, when the carrier Ranger arrives for 
overhaul.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEMPORARY CURBS SET ON HILLSIDE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday imposed temporary restrictions on 
single-family home construction in an eight-mile stretch of the Santa Monica 
Mountains where city officials say building on narrow roads has created safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, proposed by Councilmen Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, are 
expected to severely limit home construction on the hillsides south of 
Mulholland Drive between the San Diego Freeway and Outpost Drive, covering an 
area from Bel-Air to the Hollywood Hills. They will be in place for a year 
while officials draft permanent controls for the area. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, which affect projects submitted to the Department of Building 
and Safety since Dec. 1, 1988, do not apply to renovations of existing homes. 
Projects are also exempt if they meet various setback, parking, fire safety and 
street access requirements, and if the owner agrees to join any future benefit 
assessment district set up to improve roads. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials say the restrictions are necessary because building on remote 
and unwieldy hillside lots has made it difficult for fire trucks and ambulances 
to reach some victims.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MIXED-USE COMPLEX WINS HEARTY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a $1-billion mini-city at the site of the old Pike 
Amusement Park won the enthusiastic backing Tuesday of the Long Beach City 
Council, which voted to amend the local coastal plan to clear the way for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The plans to construct an 11-building, mixed-use project that would eventually 
employ 8,000 people must still go before the state Coastal Commission and be 
reviewed in detail by Long Beach. The project, a venture of the Ratkovich Co. 
and Enterprise Development West, would be built over a 13-year period, with 
ground-breaking scheduled for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in the local coastal plan and downtown shoreline plan would enable 
developers to build at more than double the density now permitted, as well as 
to erect buildings as tall as 600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-acre complex would include offices, shops, residences and up to 500 
hotel rooms.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORDER HALTS NEW RECORD BY OSMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order 
against a record company belonging to former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, stopping it 
from releasing a "comeback" single recorded by singer Donny Osmond. 
</P>
<P>
Curb Records had said that it had exclusive rights to distribute Osmond's 
single and album, while Capitol Records asserted that it had the sole 
distribution rights. 
</P>
<P>
Both firms asked U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi to issue a temporary 
restraining order. Curb wanted to stop Capitol from releasing the Osmond album; 
Capitol asked that Curb be ordered not to release the hit single from the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi ruled in favor of Capitol, which said it had spent more than $1 
million to publicize and promote Osmond's album, his first in 10 years.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL MUTILATIONS UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in Covina are investigating the recent mutilation deaths of animals that 
may be the work of devil-worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we were surprised by this. It's all new to us, " Sgt. Chuck Rosales 
said. "We are a quiet, bedroom community." 
</P>
<P>
The first complaints of mutilated carcasses, accompanied by Satan-related 
graffiti, were received about seven weeks ago, Rosales said. Since then, about 
a dozen animals -- cats and rabbits -- have been found with eyes gouged out, 
legs cut off, and hearts and other organs removed. One cat was found crucified 
upside down under symbols written with the cat's blood. 
</P>
<P>
The animals -- none of whom appeared to be pets -- have been found at an 
abandoned elementary school on Cienega Avenue and near a storm drain in Wingate 
Park, in the 800 block of North Glendora Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagrams -- five-sided stars associated with devil worship -- and the number 
"666" -- used by devil worshipers to connote the Antichrist -- have been found 
near the carcasses, either burned into the ground or scrawled on walls. 
</P>
<P>
Police have questioned three high school students who admitted to being devil 
worshipers, but said they are not responsible for the mutilations, Rosales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem to be centered around teen-agers," the sergeant said.

DID VIEW SHAPE ROOS' BILL ON LAKES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos, who has allied himself with Los Angeles 
residents fighting a proposal to cover 10 open reservoirs and build filtration 
plants at five others, is eloquent on the subject of the city's artificial 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Roos (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill designed to block the city's plans 
because the reservoirs are "more than a part of the water system," he said. 
"This is the heartbeat of a community, where people chose to live because of 
that heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
He has firsthand experience to back him up. Roos is planning to build a 
2,700-square-foot home on an ivy-covered hillside with a commanding view of 
Silver Lake, where the water department may build a filtration plant on four to 
six acres along the shore. 
</P>
<P>
County land records show Roos bought the land in August of 1988 for $164,000. 
He has told neighbors he wants to build a Mediterranean-style house for his 
family there. Periodically, he visits the property and inspects the panorama. 
</P>
<P>
"You could think, 'Gee, that's a coincidence,' " said Sam White, who lives 
across the street from Roos' lot. "Or you could think he's trying to help the 
whole district." 
</P>
<P>
Roos said Tuesday, after the bill passed its first Assembly committee hearing, 
that he "thought long and hard" about introducing a measure that could benefit 
the value of his property. "I live in Silver Lake very much because of the way 
the lake is now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said that in January, about six weeks before he introduced the bill, he 
obtained a legislative counsel's opinion that he would not face a 
conflict-of-interest charge with such a bill because he would not have any 
greater advantage than other residents near reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in that community 20 years," said Roos, who lives in a condominium 
over a hill from the reservoir. "I haven't had a view of the lake. But the lake 
has been a part of my pulse. I'm not a Johnny-come-lately." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city Department of Water and Power say the covers and 
filtration plants are needed to keep trash, animal waste and carcinogens from 
the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
But the reservoir proposals have drawn fire from Pacific Palisades to Elysian 
Park. Homeowners' groups, including the Silver Lake Residents Assn., have 
formed a coalition to fight the plans. Residents who live near the reservoirs 
say that covers could ruin their views and attract vandals, while filtration 
plants could be ugly and noisy. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the water department has not considered alternative measures that 
might have less drastic impact on the nature of their neighborhoods. And they 
question the need for such measures, because water officials have said the 
city's water is safe to drink now, though it may not meet new state and federal 
standards expected to be issued later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Roos' bill would name all public open reservoirs a "public resource" and 
require that any alteration or addition "should preserve the recreational and 
the scenic and aesthetic values of the reservoir." 
</P>
<P>
The director of the state Department of Health Services would also be 
prohibited from ordering that any public reservoir be drained or covered 
"unless no other alternative . . . is technically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved Tuesday on a 7-2 vote by the Assembly Water, Parks and 
Wildlife Committee. The Ways and Means Committee also must consider the bill 
before it reaches the Assembly floor. Roos did not mention his property at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
No opponents testified at the hearing, though a city water department lobbyist 
said the department may raise concerns at later discussions of the bill. Ellen 
Stern Harris, executive director of the Fund for the Environment and an 
activist on water issues, spoke in support of the measure, saying, "We need not 
choose between clean water and a beautiful environment." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald McCoy, assistant chief engineer for the water system, said department 
representatives have met several times with Roos staffers on the reservoir 
issue. Roos also called a press conference last week at Silver Lake to discuss 
his bill, against a backdrop of residents wearing aqua-colored ribbons that 
they said stood for "blue water." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Roos' plans for a house overlooking Silver Lake, McCoy burst into 
laughter. "I didn't know that," he said. "I was not aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
One other state legislator, Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), has become 
involved in the issue. Polanco has delayed hearings on a bill he authored that 
would require the water department to compile a citywide environmental impact 
report, rather than individual reports on each reservoir. McCoy said department 
officials would like to do just that, but must first discuss it with the Board 
of Water and Power Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco's district includes Elysian Reservoir, which is in Elysian Park. The 
water department would like to install a metal roof over the reservoir there.

PADRES' PARENT DEDICATES SEASON TO A WOMAN WHO STOOD BY HIM

The old lady and the kid. That's what they were to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Polley was a retired legal secretary who had agreed to join the Padre 
front office as a general manager's assistant, sorting contracts, filing papers 
and, most of all, watching over young players. Mark Parent was a runny-nosed 
17-year-old baseball player who never should have left his high school coach, 
or his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1979; her first, his first. 
</P>
<P>
Remembers Polley: "He was the one who received about four perfumed letters 
every day from his girlfriend. After delivering all those, I'm glad she finally 
became his wife." 
</P>
<P>
Remembers Parent: "She was the one person in the front office you could talk 
to." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years passed, and it became obvious that the old lady and the kid 
were not that much different. They were both role players, little-known 
reserves. Neither was going to become a millionaire from this game. Neither was 
going to be famous. 
</P>
<P>
Polley learned the inner workings of the game and became as much an expert on 
front-office procedure as any general manager. But Jack McKeon became her 
general manager, and although he constantly tried to pass on the credit, he 
became the folk hero. She got lost in all that cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Parent was a solid catcher missing the required flash. Every year he showed up 
and played hard. But if the Padres ever noticed, they had a funny way of 
showing it, running off to Latin America to sign more catchers than they now 
know what to do with. 
</P>
<P>
So the old lady and the kid formed a bond. They never talked about it or wrote 
anything down. It was just there. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when Parent was fed up with minor league life and decided to quit, Polley 
talked him out of it. She then made a habit of sending along sweet notes every 
winter with his contract, assuring him that he was being paid fairly, assuring 
him he would one day make the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
He would see her every spring training. He would wave to her in the stands, 
stay late talking to her in the office, promise her that, yes, one day he would 
make it to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
And today, Mark Parent has made it. He is beginning his second major league 
season as one of baseball's better backup catchers. Soon his contracts will be 
done in big negotiations with big agents. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something missing. It's the old lady. Last week, the day after 
another season opened, Rhoda Polley, 65, resigned, because she is suffering 
from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
If you were there, you might remember Polley from opening day. She was the 
woman being helped to the pitcher's mound before the game by Parent, Garry 
Templeton and Tim Flannery. She's the woman you've never heard of who threw out 
the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parent would like you to hear about her. Hours after her resignation, he 
hit a home run against the San Francisco Giants. As he crossed the plate into 
the warm arms of teammates and loud cheers of fans, there was only one thing he 
could think of. Is Rhoda watching? 
</P>
<P>
"I was home, trying to watch on TV, but my sleeping pills got me, and I was 
sleeping," Polley said the next day. "But I still saw him. I don't need to be 
watching Mark to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Parent hopes she keeps on watching. The kid has dedicated his season to Polley. 
He figures she would do the same for him. That is, if she hadn't already done 
the same for him. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Polley is a baseball fan. She grew up in San Diego, and became so 
enamored that she and her husband bought a house five minutes from the ballpark 
so she could walk to games. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband died in 1974. She retired from her job as a legal secretary and 
became a baseball fanatic. She had no children, so she saw the Padres as her 
children. She attended every spring game, every home game. She became a fan 
fixture. Then one day in the spring of 1979, Bob Fontaine, then the general 
manager, plopped down next to her in the Yuma box seats. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he needed a secretary, somebody to help out," Polley remembers. "I 
asked him, when do I start?" 
</P>
<P>
She has since been through seven managers, three club presidents and two 
full-time general managers. Her job was, among other things, to mail the 
contracts and keep track of the incentive clauses in those contracts. She once 
worked out the language in Alan Wiggins' guaranteed contract so that it made so 
much sense, it was sent to the Players' Assn. as a model. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, and she played mother to the Padres' minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into a fight with a manager in double-A in 1982, and they wanted to 
suspend me, and then send me down, and I told them to stick it," Parent 
recalled. "I was on my way to quitting . . . and then Rhoda called. She told me 
I was better than that. She told me I was blowing my one chance. She wanted me 
to act like a man." 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Polley: "I gave him this speech, and all he said was, 'Yes ma'am.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Parent took the demotion to Class-A Salem. By the next year, he was back in 
double A. And from then on, they shared a trust. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a person in the front office I always believed," Parent said. "She 
treated me like I was no different than Dave Winfield. During spring training, 
she would holler at me from the stands, which was nice when you had nobody 
else. She was much better for me than I ever was for her." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, but he was like one of my sons," Polley said. "He treated me like I was 
special." 
</P>
<P>
That's why she fretted this winter when, after being diagnosed as having 
cancer, she could not reach Parent in the Dominican Republic, where he was 
playing winter ball. It wasn't until Parent returned to the United States in 
January and called her about spring training reservations -- and the annual 
players' pool tournament she sponsors in Yuma -- that he heard about her 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny, but she told me, and it was like I couldn't get her off the 
phone fast enough," Parent said. "She told me I was the last person she would 
tell, and it got all emotional . . . so I wanted her to hang up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had anybody around me sick like this. I'm not sure how to handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres showed how they handled it on opening day, when Polley threw out the 
ball at owner Joan Kroc's request. After an off-season spending spree that may 
put the Padres in contention, Kroc could have thrown that first pitch and 
probably still would be hearing the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"But they asked me instead, and I got so excited," Polley said. "Imagine, me, 
throwing out a first ball." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said: "It's the least we can do. Rhoda has constantly made my job 
easier. I was a rookie general manager, and she guided me through the hard 
times. I remember, and we all remember. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get lucky enough to make the playoffs or World Series, you bet your life 
she'll be right there with us. Even if I have to carry her there." 
</P>
<P>
Although she needed help reaching the mound opening night, it was Polley who 
carried the three players when, while still on the mound, they were surprised 
by the loud noise from surprise pregame cannon shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard this boom, and all of us jumped, but Rhoda," Parent said. "We all 
hung on to her." 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong," Polley said. "We hung on to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parent: "You have to understand, I really can't tell her I'm dedicating 
this season to her. I don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. "Maybe I can just show her. I show her, she'll know."

HEARTBREAK ON THE HILL; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH'S KNAUB LOSES GRIP, BUT FINISHES 3RD IN WHEELCHAIR RACE AT BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The comeback trail led him to Heartbreak Hill, a proving ground of the Boston 
Marathon that Jim Knaub, a two-time winner of the wheelchair division, knew all 
too well. 
</P>
<P>
Knaub retired from wheelchair racing after the 1985 race. He returned in 1987, 
but crashed on wet roads. He planned to race last year but couldn't because of 
a high fever and a related irritating skin problem. 
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, late in the 93rd Boston Marathon, the Long Beach resident was 
in the lead pack and feeling good about his chances. But when an inner-tube, 
fitted on the outside of the wheel rims to allow for a better grip, came loose 
on Heartbreak Hill, Knaub, 33, lost his traction. 
</P>
<P>
And, it turned out, a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
Knaub settled for his second third-place finish at Boston, his time of 1 hour 
38 minutes and 25 seconds trailing only Frenchman Philippe Couprie's 1:36.04 
and Canadian Andre Viger's 1:36.45. Still, Kaub left Tuesday with a great deal 
of satisfaction and a time about nine minutes better than when he won the race 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem I had -- bigger than any of the others -- was that there 
were no other Americans in the lead pack," said Knaub, who won in the 
wheelchair division of the Los Angeles Marathon March 5. "There were only two 
of us among the top 15 finishers. Everyone was speaking French, because most of 
the guys were from France or Canada. It's become a sport with a lot of team 
tactics, like bike racing, so that became a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous, maybe just a little anxious to get it over with. I wanted to 
test myself there. I won the L.A. Marathon, and that was a big win. But this 
was an international field. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased. The maturity I gained in racing, partly from when I retired, 
allows me to look at everything with a positive note. I don't get too down. I'm 
happy with the effort, and the chair worked well except for the hand grip." 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be a big exception. 
</P>
<P>
"If that (problems with the grip) didn't happen, I could have won the race," he 
said. "I was pretty much dominating. But that's Boston. There's luck involved 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Knaub expects to race Couprie and Viger again, maybe as soon as this weekend in 
a 52-mile race at Washington, D.C. A week after that, he'll be back home, 
competing in the Long Beach Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I will see them again," he said. "They know I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
After finally making it through Boston, a lot of people know.

CHARGERS WILL NOT OFFER CONTRACT TO LAUFENBERG FOR THE 1989 SEASON

Babe Laufenberg, the free-agent quarterback who started the first six games for 
the San Diego Chargers last season, will not be offered a contract for the 1989 
season, team spokesman Bill Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Laufenberg, 29, becomes a free agent again, a status he is familiar with after 
being released eight times by four teams since his 1983 National Football 
League entry as a sixth-round draft choice of the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed," Laufenberg said, "but I'm not bitter. In effect, they 
fired me. This is what I do for a living. But I didn't make the big plays last 
year. I would like to have had a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
Laufenberg emerged from a 1988 training camp competition against Mark Vlasic 
and Mark Malone as the Chargers' starting quarterback. Dan Fouts, San Diego's 
quarterback for 15 years, announced his retirement after the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year was the first in which Laufenberg threw a pass during a 
regular-season game. He completed 61 of 126 passes for 703 yards with four 
touchdowns and five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were 2-4 with Laufenberg starting. Malone finished the season as 
the starter for San Diego, 6-10 in 1988, after Vlasic suffered a severe knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was the league's lowest-rated quarterback for the second consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning, who succeeded the fired Al Saunders, has said he 
wants to improve the quarterback situation either through the draft or by 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has the eighth overall pick in Sunday's college draft.

IS KONTOS' SUCCESS A CATCH-22?; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS' NEW WING MAY BE FORCED TO FLY OFF TO ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If he is as productive offensively against the Calgary Flames as he was against 
the Edmonton Oilers, Chris Kontos of the Kings might just play himself right 
off the team. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos, 25, could be the player to be named in the trade that sent goaltender 
Mark Fitzpatrick and defenseman Wayne McBean to the New York Islanders and 
brought goaltender Kelly Hrudey to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about that," said Kontos, who signed with the Kings as a 
free agent about two weeks after they acquired Hrudey on Feb. 22. "In fact, I 
didn't even know about that. Any more good news?" 
</P>
<P>
A source in the Kings' organization said Tuesday that, if they are eliminated 
from the National Hockey League playoffs by the Flames, the Kings will be 
allowed to protect 12 of their players from being chosen by the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
They will be allowed to protect 11 if they beat the Flames, 10 if they reach 
the Stanley Cup final and nine if they win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bill Torrey of the Islanders, who was a guest of owner Bruce 
McNall of the Kings for two games during the Kings' division semifinal series 
against the Oilers, said he couldn't help but notice the young wing, who scored 
eight goals in the series, including an NHL-record six on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's caught everybody's eye," Torrey said from his office in 
Uniondale, N.Y. "Of course, playing with Wayne Gretzky doesn't hurt a guy's 
batting average. But he's made the most of his opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Kontos, who was released by the Kings last summer and played in Switzerland 
last winter, didn't rejoin the Kings until March 7, but he scored three goals 
in Game 2 against the Oilers, the first postseason hat trick by the Kings in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His second-period goal Tuesday night in the Kings' 4-3 overtime loss was his 
fifth in five games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just having fun helping a club I watched with envy from Switzerland," 
Kontos said. "What better place to play than on a team with Wayne Gretzky? 
Somebody must be looking out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Among those looking at Kontos is Torrey. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings might have won Game 1 Tuesday night if not for an unusual bounce that 
led to the game-tying goal by Gary Roberts of the Flames with 1 minute 36 
seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
A pass by the Flames' Dana Murzyn circled behind the Kings' net and hit a steel 
post, ricocheting out in front, where Roberts cut inside of defenseman Steve 
Duchesne of the Kings to chase it down. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne turned the wrong way, expecting the puck to circle all the way around 
to the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky enough to have the inside on (Duchesne)," Roberts said. "He kind 
of turned to the right and I turned to the left and it came back out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad bounce for them." 
</P>
<P>
And a lucky bounce for Roberts, who skated in and fired a shot that glanced off 
the hip of goaltender Kelly Hrudey and into the net, sending the game into 
overtime. A goal by Doug Gilmour at 7:47 of the extra period gave the Flames a 
4-3 victory and left the Kings shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned my head and the puck came behind me," Duchesne said. "It happened so 
quickly that I didn't have time to hook him or anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to Flames' games are hot in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ads have appeared in local newspapers offering the right to buy season 
tickets for $10,000 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
That would enable the buyer to avoid a waiting list for season subscriptions 
that includes more than 5,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
Clare Rhyasen, vice president of business and finance for the Flames, told the 
Toronto Star that, according to the club's legal interpretation of Alberta's 
Amusements Act, it is not illegal to sell the right to buy season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't selling the tickets, they're selling the rights," Rhyasen told 
the Star. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, tickets aren't available. 
</P>
<P>
From their first game in Calgary, a 5-5 tie against the Quebec Nordiques Oct. 
9, 1980, through a 5-5 tie against the Edmonton Oilers Nov. 5, 1987, the former 
Atlanta Flames sold out 323 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
But when capacity at the Olympic Saddledome was increased last year for the 
Winter Olympics, the Flames held 2,800 upper-level seats a game to be sold on a 
per-game basis, and the sellout string ended. 
</P>
<P>
The extra tickets are put on sale the day before each game. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Flames have sold out 27 of 45 home games this season, and their 
smallest crowd of the year was 17,784. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's game drew a capacity crowd.

NEWSWIRE: SCHRAMM TO HEAD NFL'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tex Schramm, the architect of "America's team," took on the job of 
transplanting the interest in the National Football League overseas when he 
resigned Tuesday as president of the Dallas Cowboys to head the experimental 
International Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The man who ran the Cowboys for all of their first 29 years turned in his 
resignation on the day NFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the 
franchise to Arkansas oilman Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Although it appeared to be an amicable parting -- "We're flying back to Dallas 
together," Schramm said -- there was no alternative because Jones has taken 
over control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wanted to make something work with Jerry after that happened," Schramm 
said. "But I had to be realistic. Nothing was going to be the same and I had to 
move on." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL hopes that the new league will popularize the sport around the world 
while serving as a feeder league.

The President's son and a former vice presidential candidate officially became 
part owners of major league baseball teams as club owners approved the sales of 
the Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger owner Eddie Chiles sold the team in March for $46 million to a group of 
Texas businessmen headed by George W. Bush, the eldest son of President Bush. 
Bill DeWitt Jr., whose father once owned the Cincinnati Reds, is among the 
minority owners. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Orioles were sold for $70 million to a partnership headed by 
New York businessman Eli S. Jacobs. The group includes team president Larry 
Lucchino and Sargent Shriver, 1972 Democratic candidate for vice president.

Wimbledon became the first $5-million tennis tournament with the announcement 
of a 23% increase in prize money. That boosted the purse to $5.3 million, an 
increase of $1 million, for this summer's event. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for a tennis tournament was last summer's $4.4 million at 
the U.S. Open. Wimbledon officials said they expect the Americans to top their 
amount when the prizes for the tournament in New York in September are 
announced next month.

With their prime season approaching, Alaska's sportfishing interests are 
concerned that potential customers will think the oil spill has wiped them out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole bunch of the state that hasn't been touched by this at all," 
said Nick Pierskalla, president of the Alaska Professional Sportsmen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Morry Israel, president of the Alaska Sportfishing Lodge Assn., said: "Only 5% 
(of the lodges) are in the affected area." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other 95% will remain safe, no matter what the whims of the winds 
and currents that shift the drift of the spill daily. They are located in the 
Iliamna Lake region to the west on waters flowing into Bristol Bay, which is 
buffered from the spill by the Alaska Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The perceived impact of the spill depends on the size of the picture. Zoom in 
on Prince William Sound, where the tanker Exxon Valdez dumped 10.1 million 
gallons of crude, and track the goo down the southeast side of the Kenai 
Peninsula and it's disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
But pull back to an overview of the largest state and the impact on 
sportsfishing seems less bleak -- although the peak of the crisis is still 
perhaps weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
The concern is for what may happen. If the oil, estimated to be 60 to 100 feet 
deep, slips between the Kenai and Afognak Island into the Cook Inlet or through 
the narrow Kupreanof Strait between Afognak and Kodiak Island into the Shelikof 
Strait, the outlook would be gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
"The south side of the Kenai is getting slimed," Israel said. "But we've been 
super-lucky that there hasn't been a south wind pushing this up into the Cook 
Inlet." 
</P>
<P>
So much for the good news. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to get worse," Israel said. "That thing is out there, moving every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
According to Pierskalla, considerable damage has already been done. 
</P>
<P>
"Those (salmon) spawning beds have got to be cleaned up," he said. "The main 
consideration is not how lousy the fishing is going to be this year but what's 
going to happen four years from now. The fry come out of the rivers, hang out 
in the ocean and return in four years. They're coming out now. 
</P>
<P>
"When the tide goes out, it leaves the oil on the spawning beds and at the 
entrance to the spawning beds. Salmon school up in the mouths, and when the 
tide comes in, it might come up 13 to 20 feet, backfill those creeks, and then 
the salmon go up. Once that oil's been deposited, they have to swim through it. 
That whole creek bed in some of these areas is going to be totally covered. 
That's where they're going to be laying eggs." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Berg, who operates the Alaskan Lodge at Soldotna on Cook Inlet, said: 
"We're set up where the current should push it away, but we've had a ton of 
calls -- half from people already booked wanting to know if it was still all 
right and half from people booked into resorts that might be affected. It's a 
devastating blow to the areas in its path. The bulk of the oil has gone to 
Kodiak." 
</P>
<P>
Some Alaskans already are looking to the future, Pierskalla said. "Time will 
heal this wound, but we need to revamp the management system. Alaska has to 
wake up to the fact that its long-term economic base is the renewable resource, 
and the best renewable resource it has, dollar for dollar, is tourism." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel said: "The whales are just starting to show up. If you think 
those three whales up in Barrow were a story last winter, wait until 200 whales 
hit Prince William Sound." 
</P>
<P>
Israel said information on current conditions for sportsmen is available by 
phoning (800) 352-2003. 
</P>
<P>
After a year's hiatus, Malibu Pier Sportfishing is back in business. 
</P>
<P>
Starting May 1, the Aquarius, a 58-foot sportfisher owned and operated by Jon 
Christensen, will run half-day trips seven days a week through at least March 
31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
A state Assembly committee Tuesday shelved a bill that would limit the use of 
controversial gillnets by commercial fishermen off the Southern California 
coast. The Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee agreed to hold a more extensive 
hearing on the issue in September or October. . . . The Long Beach Casting Club 
will conduct free weekly flycasting classes each Tuesday at 7 p.m., starting 
next week. For details, call (213) 433-9408 or (213) 598-7486.

WILLOW BEACH, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huge trout no longer have a huge following here, unless you count the people 
who gaze at the thousands of pictures on the walls of the Willow Beach Marina. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible not to notice the five-pounders, the 10-pounders, or even the 
21.3-pound rainbow trout mounted in a glass case on the wall behind the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Were all these fish caught here?" a first-time visitor, seemingly amazed at 
the display of photographed trout, asks a sales clerk. 
</P>
<P>
She nods, smiling to others who know as she does that this weekend fisherman is 
building his hopes on history. 
</P>
<P>
The fish that made the stretch of Colorado River immediately below Hoover Dam 
one of the country's best rainbow trout fisheries have long since disappeared. 
The 3,000 or so pictures on the Willow Beach "Wall of Fame" are mostly of fish 
caught before 1980, and scientists to this day can only theorize about what 
caused the decline. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this decade, however, bigger trout are showing more 
frequently, perhaps indicating that all hope is not lost for the embattled 
fishery. 
</P>
<P>
"Upriver, this year is the best it's been since the flood went over," says Bill 
Tennis, 75, a regular here for the last 40 years. He is referring to the 
high-water conditions in 1983, when Lake Mead flowed over the Hoover Dam 
spillway, sending a 450-foot-wide waterfall cascading down the dam's 726-foot 
concrete walls. "The moss is growing back and they're bringing in some pretty 
nice fish." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ard, 39, a Glendora resident who has come here almost every year since he 
was 7 years old, agrees, saying: "I've seen more four-, five- and six-pounders 
than there were a couple of years ago." 
</P>
<P>
A 10-pound rainbow was caught in December of 1987 to back their claims of the 
fishery's possible rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these fishermen are admittedly over-optimistic if they think that the 
trophy-sized rainbows that made this stretch of river famous will thrive again 
as they once did in the confines of Black Canyon, where jagged lava peaks and 
walls 1,000-feet high rise like moonscape from the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
There have simply been too many changes in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Duke Crowe, 72, arrived here just after World War II. He witnessed the taming 
of the mighty Colorado by a series of dams built to meet the needs of Los 
Angeles. "It was isolated back then, wonderful," Crowe recalls. "In those days, 
if you saw three boats in the area, it was a big deal. You'd go over and shake 
their hands and ask where they're from." 
</P>
<P>
The late Cliff Barnson, called by locals the greatest trout fisherman ever, was 
here before the completion of Hoover Dam in 1936, when, as Tennis puts it, "the 
river was a river." Barnson died in his sleep of heart failure two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, navigation by boat was hazardous and access by land was limited 
at best, according to Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
What trout there were -- Nevada fisheries personnel say there were none until 
they began stocking just before 1960 but Barnson, Tennis and Crowe, revealing 
wallet-sized photos of trout they caught in the late 1950s, say otherwise -- 
were mostly sub-three-pounders. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not the real big ones . . . no trophies, just native fish that were 
in the river," Tennis says. 
</P>
<P>
Labor demands grew, though, and towns such as Boulder City, Nev., Bullhead 
City, Ariz., and Parker, Ariz. sprang up to house the builders of dams and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Dam was erected in the late 1940s and Lake Mohave was created; the river 
above it backed up and access was improved. The rapids Crowe spoke of 
disappeared, giving way to deep channels and swelled shores. Ringbolt Rapid, an 
insignificant ripple between Willow Beach Resort and Hoover Dam, is now 
recognized as the southernmost rapid on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
"It's roaring in September," jokes owner Ron Opfer of the Willow Beach Resort. 
"On a scale of one to 10, it's a .0025." 
</P>
<P>
Farther downriver, Parker Dam was built and Lake Havasu was born. Recreational 
opportunities grew in the area and the crowds flocked to these reservoirs on 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers of fishermen increased rapidly in the late 1960s as word spread of 
a tremendous rainbow trout fishery at 600 feet above sea level in the middle of 
a desert, where temperatures have reached 127 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
No snow. Not even the scent of pine. Just plenty of rainbow trout, which grew 
abnormally fast in the nutrient-rich water that flowed out of Lake Mead at a 
cool and comfortable 52 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They would make you lift anchor and give chase," Crowe says of the spirited 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Janisch, Arizona fisheries chief, agrees. "We're talking monster trout," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Trout proliferation began in earnest when Arizona and Nevada began stocking 
programs, dumping fingerlings immediately below the dam. The fishery improved 
even faster after 1962, when the Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery, located a 
short distance upriver from the marina, took over that task. 
</P>
<P>
George Engelage of Whittier says that, during a four-month period in 1972, he 
caught 10 trout weighing 6 1/2 to 16 3/4 pounds. In 1974, the 11-mile stretch 
between Hoover Dam and Willow Beach yielded 286 rainbows from five to 15 3/4 
pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
The fabled Barnson used a homemade lure he called the Big T to reportedly catch 
more than 1,000 rainbows of more than five pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, former California inland fisheries chief, describes the 
stretch of river in 1974: "I don't know of a place on the continent that 
compares to it. Lakes and streams on the High Sierra, Alaska, Canada, Montana, 
Wyoming and Idaho produce giant rainbows, but not in this quantity." 
</P>
<P>
The fishery peaked in 1976, when 476 rainbows of at least five pounds were 
caught. Only 244 were caught in 1977; 225 in '78; 186 in '79 and 92 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen became concerned as the fish became increasingly scarce. Biologists 
set forth to determine what was transforming a superb fishery into one of the 
"put-and-take" variety, as Janisch calls it today. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery stocks the river below the dam each year with 1,700,000 fish. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen blame the decline on the overflow of the dam in 1983, which 
introduced striped bass into the system. Biologists discount that theory, 
however, saying that striper predation in the river is minimal, adding that the 
water that flows into the river from Lake Mead is too cold for striped bass, 
most of which moved downriver to warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the stripers have established a population and many of today's 
striper fishermen are former trout fishermen. Tennis, himself, boasts of having 
caught a 29 1/2-pound striper. His wife, Kay, caught one weighing 22 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas fishermen have their theories on the demise of "trout heaven," all 
biologists have to go on is speculation here and an educated guess there. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has a lick of data on this," says Larry Paulson, director of Lake Mead 
research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. "Everybody's speculating. But 
I've said all along that the reason they lost the trout fishery down below 
Willow Beach and into Lake Mohave was the cutback of phosphorous loading from 
Las Vegas Wash." 
</P>
<P>
Phosphorous produces the algae that feeds plankton, which in turn feeds shad -- 
introduced into the Colorado from Tennessee in 1955 -- which makes for a 
healthy trout fishery, according to Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the mid- to late 1970s, phosphorous flowed unimpeded into the lower 
end of Lake Mead and consequentially throughout the system (below it). Then in 
1981, the Advance Wastewater (tertiary) Treatment Plant began to take the 
phosphorous out." 
</P>
<P>
Because the flow rate has increased considerably since 1981, the amount of 
phosphates entering Lake Mead has also increased, suggesting a possible reason 
for the increased moss growth below the dam and a somewhat improved fishery. 
</P>
<P>
Janisch, meanwhile, claims that the building of dams and reservoirs upstream 
from Lake Mead serve as "nutrient traps" and that unless his department is able 
to supplement nitrates and phosphates, which he says are necessary to produce 
the aquatic insects needed by trout to survive, the fishery will never improve. 
</P>
<P>
But as part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, the Willow Beach area 
falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Park Service, which Janisch says won't 
allow such a program because of "concerns about altering the environment for 
downstream users. 
</P>
<P>
"When Lake Mead was built in the 1930s, the system above it was wide open and 
every time you'd get spring rains and floods you would have large volumes of 
nutrients coming out of Lake Mead, which would rejuvenate the fishery, provide 
all the phosphates and nitrates, and the same would be true at Willow Beach," 
he says. "Water would pass on through the dam and you would have a relatively 
productive system." 
</P>
<P>
The Glen Canyon Dam (built 286 miles above Lake Mead in 1966), is the primary 
culprit, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, people such as Ard will still come here to fish the crystal 
waters, to tour beautiful Black Canyon and gaze at the desert bighorn sheep and 
coyotes on the hillsides, and to hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Trout fishing is most relaxing, and when I come here I just want to relax," he 
says. "It's still good fishing. The size is just not there." 
</P>
<P>
Not yet, anyway.

THREAT OF SNOW COSTS ABBOTT A START

<P>
Be it Angel run production or the weather, rookie pitcher Jim Abbott continues 
to be undermined by the things he can't control. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Abbott's third major league start was put on hold when the threat of 
snow forced the postponement of the game against the Chicago White Sox at 
Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who had been scheduled to pitch against Chicago's Bill Long, will skip 
a turn, meaning his next start should be next Monday night at Anaheim Stadium 
against the Baltimore Orioles. Rather than push his entire rotation back a day, 
Angel Manager Doug Rader decided to bump Abbott, 0-2, and keep No. 1 starter 
Mike Witt, 1-2, on schedule to pitch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Witt will now oppose Long, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
With the Angel pitching staff on a surprising roll -- two consecutive shutouts 
and a 2.66 team earned-run average -- Rader was reluctant to tamper with the 
alignment of his top four starters. And with Abbott still searching for his 
first run's worth of support -- he has been on the wrong ends of 7-0 and 5-0 
scores -- the cold climes of Chicago are not exactly conducive to major 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Abbott will wait for warmer temperatures -- and the often accommodating 
Orioles -- to bid for his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's game has been rescheduled for Thursday, Sept. 14, the next time the 
Angels visit Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield, sidelined with a strained right chest muscle, was 
re-examined Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, who reported that Schofield had made 
"some improvement, but was still not ready." 
</P>
<P>
According to Yocum, Schofield continues to feel discomfort when extending his 
right arm. 
</P>
<P>
"He still needs more time," Yocum said. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield hasn't played since last Tuesday.

CONNER AND STARS &amp; STRIPES ENTERED IN ENSENADA RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Conner will sail one of the controversial Stars &amp; Stripes catamarans 
in the 42nd Newport-Ensenada race starting Friday, April 28, and this time 
nobody objects. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Stern, secretary-treasurer of the Ocean Racing Catamaran Assn., said 
Tuesday that the organization had approved the conventional, "soft-sail" rig 
that was the backup boat to the airfoil-wing craft Conner used to trounce New 
Zealand's larger monohull in a two-race defense of the America's Cup at San 
Diego last September. 
</P>
<P>
The winning boat has since been disqualified by the New York Supreme Court and 
the Cup awarded to the Mercury Bay Boating Club of New Zealand in the 
resolution of a protest by syndicate chief Michael Fay, although the San Diego 
Yacht Club is pursuing an appeal of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at noon in a fleet of 27 multihulls, Conner and a crew of eight will 
be racing the setting sun toward the Ensenada record of 10 hours 31 minutes 2 
seconds set by Bob Hanel's Double Bullet in 1983. Stern thinks Stars &amp; 
Stripes could finish the 125-mile race before sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"If she gets a steady 12-knot wind, she could be there in 7 1/2 hours," Stern 
said. "It's a fantastic boat. When I sailed on it recently, we were doing 20 
knots in a nine-knot breeze." 
</P>
<P>
Stars &amp; Stripes is about the same size -- 60 feet -- as Rudy Choy's Aikane 
X-5, which has won the last two Ensenada events, but is lighter and carries 
more sail. She has been assigned a Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) 
rating of minus-172 to Aikane's minus-58, meaning she must give 114 seconds a 
mile to Aikane, or 3.96 hours over the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who has sailed in a record 27 consecutive Ensenada races, the last 
several aboard his own Imi Loa catamaran, said he thinks Stars &amp; Stripes 
still could be the overall winner, as well as first to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Her rating assumes her weather hull will be out of the water 50% of the time," 
Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
That would be much more than it was when Conner sailed the sister boat 
ultra-conservatively against New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Trenkle, crew member and vice president of marine operations for Dennis 
Conner Sports Inc., said: "It's a matter of keeping the speed up when the wind 
gets light (in late afternoon off San Diego). They predicted us (for the 
handicap) in 10 knots of wind, but we're not going to get 10 knots all the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Also aboard will be Tom Whidden, Conner's tactician for the last four Cup 
campaigns, and Tony Wilson, the president of Hobie Cat, which is sponsoring the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Trenkle said the boat won the last tuneup race against the airfoil rig before 
the September event, but Conner chose to sail the airfoil because it performed 
better in light air.

BUCHANAN ENTERS STATE TREASURER CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ending weeks of speculation, former U.S. Treasurer Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan of 
Irvine barnstormed California on Tuesday to announce her candidacy for the 
Republican nomination for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, 40, flew to Sacramento, Fresno, Burbank and San Diego to promote her 
challenge of Treasurer Thomas Hayes, a Republican. Hayes, 43, was appointed to 
his post by Gov. George Deukmejian last year after the death of Jesse M. Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, calling herself "the underdog" to the governor's candidate, 
nevertheless dismissed suggestions that she was defying Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not running against George Deukmejian," Buchanan said at the sparsely 
attended press conference in Fresno. "If he (Deukmejian) wants to run for 
treasurer, I'll be glad to step out," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is expected to set in motion a costly internecine battle that 
Deukmejian and other Republican leaders had hoped to avoid. Many GOP insiders 
were unhappy that Deukmejian had not chosen someone with stronger party 
credentials to succeed Unruh in the only constitutional office that has fallen 
vacant during Deukmejian's term in office. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, the nonpartisan state auditor general for 10 years, had purposefully 
stayed clear of party politics during his tenure. His job required him to make 
recommendations to the Legislature and governor regarding state government 
operations. He registered as a Republican when he was appointed state 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Credentials 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Buchanan avoided attacking Hayes' record but sharply 
questioned his party credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for conservatives to mount a campaign on behalf of Tom 
Hayes. He has never lifted a finger for the (conservative) movement," Buchanan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the GOP primary will likely face Kathleen Brown, the leading 
Democratic candidate, in the 1990 general election. Brown is the sister of 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown Sr. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I can beat Kathleen Brown. I can keep this office for Republicans," 
Buchanan said in Sacramento. Buchanan herself is the sister of a political 
figure with his own fame in GOP circles, Washington commentator Patrick 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
"A run of Jerry Brown's sister against Pat Buchanan's will bring national 
attention and national money," Bay Buchanan said Tuesday, estimating that she 
will need up to $1.5 million for the primary alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A First for Women 
</P>
<P>
Should Buchanan and Kathleen Brown both win their party's nominations, it will 
be the first time in California history that two women have faced each other in 
a general election for a state constitutional office. Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu and former state Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest -- who coincidentally was 
also a U.S. treasurer before she ran for the state post -- are the only two 
women to have been elected to statewide office, according to Caren Daniels 
Meade of the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan's entry into the race has split Republicans in her home turf of Orange 
County, with several Assembly members siding with Hayes, including Orange 
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, while Orange County Republican Party 
Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes is backing Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
Several county Republicans said they know and like Buchanan but do not want to 
see the party's resources depleted when there is a qualified Republican 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those tough decisions when you have to pick between two people, 
both of whom you like," said Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach), 
who has decided to support Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said he was "extremely disappointed" 
at Deukmejian for failing to select either a politician or "someone who was 
very active in the Republican Party." But now that the governor had used his 
"political chips" on the appointment, Ferguson said he thought it best for 
Republicans to get behind Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embarrassment for Governor 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Hayes) lost now, it would be a terrible embarrassment to the governor," 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the county's legislative delegation, including Assembly Minority 
Leader Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove), are prepared to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
But Buchanan's candidacy has sparked unbridled enthusiasm among another sector 
of the county's conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider Bay Buchanan the most intelligent woman I have ever met in 
politics," said Fuentes, adding that he will support Buchanan. "I esteem her 
very highly." 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is known as a hard-driving, politically ambitious Republican who has 
earned her way into party politics on the national, state and local levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Bay has good campaign instincts because she is a fighter," said Eileen 
Padberg, a GOP political consultant. "She's aggressive and she's intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is expected to be able to raise money both statewide and nationally 
for her campaign because of her former position as U.S. treasurer and her ties 
to the Reagan and Bush administrations. At 30, she was named in 1979 as 
national treasurer of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. In 1986, she 
managed the U.S. Senate campaign of Los Angeles commentator Bruce Herschensohn, 
a fellow conservative who came in second for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ability to Raise Money' 
</P>
<P>
"She has a great ability to raise money also, and that's the name of the game," 
Buchanan's business partner, Jackie Campbell, said. "That will tell the tale." 
</P>
<P>
While a few local Republicans muttered privately that they thought of Buchanan 
as a hired hand for GOP causes who had done little in the way of actual 
volunteer work, Fuentes praised Buchanan as an "in-the-trenches, hands-on, 
volunteer and professional leader of campaigns and conservative causes." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, who has been known to scold Republicans who have jumped into primaries 
where there is a GOP incumbent, or even a favorite of party leaders, defended 
Buchanan's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sharp difference here in that the appointed incumbent . . . never 
has been the nominee of the party," Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
John Cronin, a member of the Lincoln Club, a prestigious Orange County GOP 
support group, also had high praise for Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say Bay is someone who's paid her dues inside the party," Cronin said. "I 
think she'd be a dynamic candidate." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he also thought she would have a better chance of defeating 
another woman in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Even her recently divorced husband, William R. Jackson, had nothing but 
positive things to say about her qualifications for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very, very, very hard-working," Jackson said. "She is also very, very, 
very good with numbers. And she is also very, very, very bright." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lists His Accomplishments 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who has never run for elective office, has said that because he was not 
affiliated with either party, legislators reviewed his recommendations to them 
on the merits and without concern for politics. He said that as a result, he 
was able to gain approval for programs that saved the state more than $400 
million over his 10 years in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has been traveling the state meeting local Republicans in an effort to 
bolster his candidacy. His itinerary has included six trips to Orange County in 
recent months, speaking to members of the Lincoln Club and other groups and 
meeting privately with potential supporters. 
</P>
<P>
On April 27, Hayes and Deukmejian will appear jointly at a private, 
$1,000-per-person luncheon in Newport Beach being organized by Orange County 
developer Kathryn Thompson. Among those who are expected to attend are some of 
the county's top developers, including Don Koll, George Argyros and William 
Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan has hired Washington consultant Roger Stone and pollster Lance 
Tarrance for her effort. She pledged Tuesday to refuse donations from anyone 
who does any business with the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has hired as his campaign manager Brian Lungren, brother of former Rep. 
Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach), whom Deukmejian first chose as Unruh's 
replacement but who failed to win legislative confirmation. Several of the 
governor's closest supporters, including his former chief of staff, lawyer 
Steve Merksamer, will play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Wise Move 
</P>
<P>
Also, in an unexpected stroke of political savvy, Hayes convinced B.T. Collins, 
a Republican who once was chief of staff to the younger Gov. Brown, to be his 
chief of staff. Collins is revered on both sides of the political fence. 
</P>
<P>
"His support of Hayes makes a very dramatic difference in Hayes and makes up to 
a large extent for his lack of political experience," Assemblyman Ferguson 
said. "B.T. has been twisting arms throughout the state. . . . He has more than 
enough political acumen to make sure that Hayes meets the right people as he 
goes around the state." 
</P>

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: ART STUDENT BOLDLY BUILDS WHERE NO MAN HAS BUILT 
BEFORE -- 'FOR THE KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like many outer-space fanciers, Steven De Lacy, 22, is a dedicated fan of "Star 
Trek." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the others, De Lacy has his own mock spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a little time on my hands last summer, so I thought I would spend a 
weekend making a mock spaceship," said De Lacy, a senior majoring in art at Cal 
State Fullerton. "One thing led to another, and 6 months later it was finally 
done. I guess I got carried away." 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship's home is in the hall at the Newport Beach child care center at 
Christ Church by the Sea United Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be fun for the kids, and although it really doesn't look 
like the Enterprise, the kids think it is," said De Lacy, who lives in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Newport Harbor High School, De Lacy works as an associate teacher 
at the center as well as keeper of the spaceship command center, which features 
flashing lights and computers and nine control stations. 
</P>
<P>
He is known as "Mr. Steve" around the day care center. "The kids don't let me 
be the captain," De Lacy moaned. "They all want to be Captain Kirk, even though 
their favorite is Mr. Spock. I stay in the background." 
</P>
<P>
De Lacy said the spaceship, framed by discarded voting booths, cost $200 to 
build. The children at the center donated their toy computers, which can speak 
words and equations, to be part of the spaceship console. 
</P>
<P>
The multicolored flashing lights are donated Christmas tree lighting 
decorations, and a sound-effects record adds drama to space excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Children sitting in any of the nine control stations can watch an hourlong 
video of "Star Trek" episodes and "2001: A Space Odyssey." They are shown on a 
monitor facing the bridge of the spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
De Lacy admitted that he is caught up in the fantasy of "Star Trek." "I'm a fan 
of the program and never missed an episode." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Shriner, who directs the center, said the spaceship helps to stimulate 
children's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our job is to let children be children and use their imagination, and 
this kind of prop helps them do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
De Lacy has been working at the center for 4 years. He hopes to have a career 
dealing with children someday, perhaps writing or illustrating children's 
books, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how this will all fit into my future, but I know I want to work 
with children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Conna Conway just marked her 50th year as a nun, the last 15 at 
Immaculate Heart of Mary Church's convent in Santa Ana. She celebrated by 
renewing the vows she originally took. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all her accomplishments during the half-century as a nun, "I feel the 
proudest of the last 4 years," said Sister Conna, who created a computer 
program for her kindergarten-through- 
</P>
<P>
eighth-grade students at the church school. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with one computer, but I knew we would be getting more, so I got 
some old typewriter to teach the students how to work the keyboard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With some grants and generous donors, the school now has 19 computers. Although 
surrounded by the machines, "I really don't like to work the computers because 
there's so much to learn and I'll never learn enough," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Conna, the eldest of 12 children, said it is physically demanding trying 
to keep up with her active young charges, but she has her own method: "I work 
out a half-hour each morning with a Jane Fonda exercise tape," she said. 
</P>
<P>

Meyer has been selected to receive the American Jewish Committee Orange County 
chapter National Human Relations Award. He is being recognized for his work 
with the City of Hope and his fund-raising efforts. He is also a trustee of the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum and is board president of the Jewish Federation 
Community Foundation. He will be honored May 11 at a dinner in the Irvine

TRINITY'S CROUCH ATTENDS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, was among 16 evangelical leaders who met with President Bush on 
Tuesday. The religious leaders requested the meeting because of what one called 
a "crisis of confidence" following Bush's statements last month indicating he 
opposes tuition tax credits for parents of private school students. Bush 
assured them he still favors the tax credits, adding, however, that because of 
budget restraints he is unable to push for them now, the White House said. In 
addition to tax credits, the evangelicals and Bush also discussed their mutual 
opposition to abortion.

ANAHEIM TO REQUIRE SPRINKLERS IN ALL NEW HOMES, BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sharply divided Anaheim City Council voted Tuesday night to adopt one of the 
most sweeping fire ordinances in the nation, requiring sprinkler systems in all 
new homes, apartments and commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The only other city with such a stringent ordinance is Scottsdale, Ariz., 
Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman said. Bowman added that San Clemente and a 
handful of other California cities have sprinkler laws, but they are not as 
strict. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased and I couldn't be happier," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's chapter of the Building Industry Assn. opposed the measure for 
reasons of cost, liability and lack of consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed," said John Withers, BIA director of government affairs. 
"We don't think the council had full information." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance passed on a 3-2 vote, with opposing councilmen Thomas Daly and 
William D. Ehrle citing costs as their major concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department estimates the cost of sprinklers for the average new home 
at $2,000. Sprinklers for a 20,000-square-foot commercial building are 
estimated at up to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Young families are saving every penny to buy their own home," Daly said. "'In 
the entire United States, there is no more expensive place to buy a house than 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Irv Pickler, who voted with Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilwoman 
Miriam Kaywood to pass the law, said sprinklers save lives. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a value on human life," Pickler said. "That to me is more 
important than anything." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which becomes law in 30 days, requires sprinkler systems for all 
new commercial buildings, homes and apartments. Current city law requires them 
only in commercial buildings greater than 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will have little impact on new apartments in the city. More than 
80% of the city's apartment complexes already have automatic sprinklers, fire 
officials said, because city ordinances require builders to install the 
equipment in apartments where fire trucks will have difficulty reaching the 
buildings through narrow street entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of three residential projects on sprawling ranches in the East 
Anaheim Hills, where about 5,500 homes and condominiums are scheduled to go up 
over the next several years, apparently will not have to install sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
The developers -- Woodcrest Development, Presley of Southern California and the 
Baldwin Building Co. -- had negotiated earlier agreements with the city 
exempting their projects from any new sprinkler requirements in return for 
providing other fire safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the city can impose ordinances relating to public health and safety. 
But Fire Chief Bowman said after Tuesday's vote that the city would not require 
the sprinklers in the developments. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn R. Elfend, a representative of the developers, had estimated the cost 
of installing sprinklers at $18 million. Anaheim Fire Marshall Michael Doty 
dismissed that figure as "shooting too high." 
</P>
<P>
Elfend said after the vote that he had no comment, since he believed the new 
ordinance would not apply to the ranch developments.

COUNTY DENIES NEGLIGENCE IN TODDLERS' POOL TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hit with a $10-million negligence claim, county officials on Tuesday defended 
their oversight of day-care centers and asserted they were not at fault in a 
March 30 pool accident in North Tustin that left one toddler dead and two 
others with severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We followed the law," said Dianne Edwards, chief of day-care licensing for the 
county's Social Services Agency. "The responsibility lies with the care 
providers and with the parents whose children were placed there, not with the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
While under the care of Orvel and Diana Brooks at their North Tustin home, 
three children, the oldest 22 months, fell into the family pool. One child 
later died and two others suffered serious injuries. Unlicensed as day-care 
providers, the Brooks' had twice been ordered by the county to close their 
operation because of inadequate fencing and debris at their home. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed Friday with the county, which will likely lead to a 
lawsuit, Timothy and Sandra Polsfoot, the parents of a girl left comatose in 
the tragedy, accused the county of doing nothing to prevent the accident and of 
failing to follow up on its orders to the Brooks to shut down their child-car 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Polsfoots also filed a lawsuit this week in Orange County Superior Court 
seeking unspecified damages against the Brooks. The Brooks declined to comment, 
according to a family friend who answered the telephone Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the Polsfoots acted on their legal claims, they received a medical 
report Tuesday indicating "next to no hope" that their 19-month-old daughter 
will ever regain consciousness, their lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enormous Medical Bills' 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors are just unable to say that (Melissa Polsfoot) is ever going to 
come out of it," said Santa Ana attorney Harold Horwitz. "She may reach her 
life expectancy, but she'll probably be in a coma, and the medical bills will 
be enormous." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Polsfoots are seeking $5 million in medical expenses from the 
county, and an additional $5 million in general damages. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz said county officials "should have shut the place down or taken some 
affirmative action rather than just sitting on their duffs and saying that it's 
no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said he expects the county to reject the Polsfoots' claim, which 
would then lead to the filing of a lawsuit in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County's Actions Defended 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, the county day-care administrator, defended the county's actions in 
not closing the Brooks' service after issuing cease-and-desist orders. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a legal and time-consuming process and it doesn't ensure that the 
providers stop giving care," she said. "If someone is trying to circumvent the 
system . . . it is literally impossible -- given state enforcement laws and our 
current staffing -- to close these people down." 
</P>
<P>
The second survivor of the pool accident, 22-month-old Jonathan Weston of North 
Tustin, remained in stable condition Tuesday at United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
The child who died was Arthur Griese, 14 months.

PLAN PRESENTED TO RECRUIT, RETAIN MINORITIES AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latino students, faculty and staff at UC Irvine on Tuesday presented a 43-point 
plan for recruiting and retaining under-represented minorities at the 
university and vowed to work with administration officials to diversify the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which stressed cooperation, calls for better communication between 
university officials and Latino organizations to identify prominent minority 
candidates for jobs, add a Chicano Studies major to the curriculum, and 
increase grant and fellowship help for Latino graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is not idealism anymore. . . . It's not 'Chicano Power,' " 
said Gerardo Mouet, president of the La Raza Assn., a Latino organization 
established in 1976. "It's practical and good for everyone because of the 
demographic realities of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-page report also suggests ways to "personalize" recruitment and 
competition for qualified minority high school students. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important part of this effort is faculty involvement," Mouet said. 
"For example, if we have a black high school senior with a very good 
grade-point average who has applied for mechanical engineering at UCI, we hook 
him up with a professor in the area he's interested in. If one of our top 
professors calls this young man and says, 'I would be interested in seeing you 
work in my lab,' we've got that kid."

Another Latino student organization, MECHa, joined in a news conference to 
present the report Tuesday. MECHa co-chair Luis Chavez, who also took part in a 
minority student protest last week at UCI, said La Raza's report is more likely 
to prompt action by UCI administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time, it was a protest," Chavez said Tuesday. "Now, we're asking to be 
incorporated into the process." 
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations by La Raza included: 
</P>
<P>
*Establishment of an endowed Latino chair that would go to a different faculty 
member and a different college or department within the university each year. 
</P>
<P>
*Creation of a UCI Library special collection in Chicano-Latino studies. 
</P>
<P>
*Establishing goals for recruitment of Chicano-Latino doctoral students by 
every academic department. 
</P>
<P>
*A requirement that corporations invited to build facilities in UCI's planned 
research park should be required to pass an affirmative action test in their 
hiring policies. 
</P>
<P>
*Establishing mentor programs linking graduate students with freshmen and 
sophomore minority students in each academic department.

JUDGE UPHOLDS CHARGE AGAINST ASSEMBLYMAN

<P>
A Superior Court judge on Tuesday rejected a motion to dismiss a forgery 
indictment against Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), who is accused of 
forging former President Ronald Reagan's name on endorsement letters mailed to 
thousands of voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, relying on a nearly 100-year-old state Supreme Court 
decision, maintained that Lewis could not be charged with forgery because he 
did not intend to defraud anyone of money or property. They said phony 
endorsements were at most an unfair ploy to influence the voters. 
</P>
<P>
But Sacramento County Superior Court Judge James Morris ruled that the voters 
could have been defrauded of their right to fair elections, and ordered Lewis 
to appear for arraignment May 2. 
</P>
<P>
The law, Morris said, "is not limited to issues of the defrauding of a property 
right, but does include a defrauding of an intangible, non-property right." 
Morris also referred to that right as the "voting franchise right." 
</P>
<P>
As many as 480,000 of the letters were mailed to voters in six Assembly races 
in 1986, even though the White House had denied permission for Reagan's name to 
be used on the letters, according to a transcript of the grand jury proceeding 
that resulted in Lewis' indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, as chairman of the Assembly GOP elections committee, gave the order to 
Republican staff members to send the campaign letters without White House 
authorization, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Blackmon, Lewis' attorney, said he intends to appeal Tuesday's decision. 
Blackmon first will ask the state Court of Appeal to stay further proceedings 
in the case, which could delay the matter for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon based his argument on the California Supreme Court decision in People 
vs. Wong Sam, an 1897 case involving a U.S. Customs official's action denying 
landing rights to a Chinese immigrant who arrived in San Francisco aboard a 
steamship. 
</P>
<P>
The customs official acted after receiving a letter bearing the phony signature 
of a Chinese interpreter for a Los Angeles court. The letter, actually written 
by Wong Sam, argued that the immigrant should not be admitted to the country 
because the man had run a house of prostitution and kept a "concubine" in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sam was prosecuted for forgery, but the charges were dropped because the 
letter, the Supreme Court ruled, "could not have the effect to defraud." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Blackmon contends, the phony presidential endorsement letters 
allegedly prepared by Lewis for the six Assembly candidates should not be 
considered an attempt to defraud. Instead, he said, the letters should be seen 
as an effort "to influence the voters in a certain way, presumably against the 
Democratic candidates in those campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
"In this indictment, the prosecution attempts to transform the ancient common 
law offense of forgery into an 'anti-corruption' tool, requiring an unwarranted 
expansion of traditional notions of fraud," Blackmon wrote in a brief submitted 
to the court last week. 
</P>
<P>
But W. Scott Thorpe, a supervising deputy attorney general who is prosecuting 
the Lewis case, argued that fraud could occur even without the loss of money or 
property. 
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the voters were "defrauded of their right to exercise their 
vote with full knowledge of whether in fact the President had signed these 
letters." Obviously, when the President of the United States endorses someone 
and sends a letter, that can have an impact on an election."

REDMAN WINS HER WALK ON WILD SIDE FOR VILLA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Villa Park High School pitcher Christina Redman was good, she was very 
good. But when she was bad, she was wild. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an erratic pitching performance Tuesday, Redman and Villa Park survived 
a two-run seventh inning by Canyon to score a 3-2 victory in a Century League 
softball game at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Redman missed all of last season's league play because of shin splints and 
stress fractures in her legs. 
</P>
<P>
She came into the game having pitched 19 consecutive innings without giving up 
a hit. But when Dalynne Large's single ended the streak with two outs in the 
third and Villa Park (10-10, 3-0) leading, 1-0, Redman seemed shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Large advanced to second on a wild pitch and Tina French took first on a passed 
ball on a third strike. Redman then walked cleanup hitter Chanele Chambrone on 
four pitches to load the bases, but Jill Player popped to third to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park's Michele D'Amato scored the only run of the inning on Steph Will's 
single to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park scored two runs in the sixth. Wills singled and Canyon pitcher 
Kristin Heizer walked Redman and Robyn Kerfoot to load the bases. Redman then 
scored on a fielder's choice and Munique Hernandez singled in Kerfoot from 
second before Heizer retired the side. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 3-0, in the bottom of the seventh, Redman (7-5) ran into trouble 
again, throwing three wild pitches and walking four batters. 
</P>
<P>
After three walks, Large doubled for her third hit to score Del Mazzio. French 
then singled to score Kyriazis. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (11-8, 2-1), ranked No. 6 in the Southern Section 4-A, had the tying run 
on third and the winning run on first with power hitter Chambrone at bat. 
Redman unintentionally walked her but the Comanches left all three runners 
stranded, flying out for the last two outs of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the Angelus League: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 4, Rosary 2 (10 innings) -- Mater Dei pitcher Amy Moeller doubled in 
the go-ahead run in the top of the 10th inning, then scored on a single by 
Theresa Conway. Moeller allowed five hits for the complete-game victory. Mater 
Dei is 11-4-2, 1-1-1, Jennifer Salazar had four strikeouts for Rosary (8-7, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 4, Los Alamitos 2 -- Keri Lucas hit a two-run homer for El Dorado 
(12-4, 2-1) at Los Alamitos.

four for visiting Esperanza (5-9, 1-2). Shelby Selton had two hits, knocked in 
a run, scored a run and stole a base. Tymerie Busser walked twice, scored three 
times and drove in a run for Esperanza.

Sunny Hills 7, Sonora 5 -- Freshman reliever Stacy Thurber entered in the third 
inning and pitched five innings of no-hit ball for the victory. Host Sunny 
Hills (12-5, 2-1) scored five runs in the first inning.

.350 as a freshman, has quit the Trabuco Hills softball team. Bickert, who was

THOBE'S BEST OUTING OF THE SEASON LEADS EDISON PAST MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
J.J. Thobe pitched a four-hitter and hit three singles to lead Edison High 
School to a 3-2 victory over Marina in a Sunset League baseball game Tuesday at 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Both runs off Thobe (3-2) were unearned and came in the fifth inning when 
Edison committed three errors. An inning earlier, Thobe lost a no-hit bid when 
Marina's Robin Lindsey smashed a liner off the glove of Edison third baseman 
Jeff Daniel. Thobe had retired 11 consecutive batters to open the game. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (7-8-1, 4-4) scored in the third, fourth and fifth innings with Thobe 
scoring one run and driving in another. 
</P>
<P>
Edison lost two one-run games last week and appeared too far behind Fountain 
Valley (12-4, 7-1) to contend for the league title. But Thobe's performance 
against a good hitting team gave Edison Coach Paul Harrell hope. 
</P>
<P>
"That was shades of last year when J.J. dominated people in this league," 
Harrell said. "We sure needed it. That's the best he's pitched this season." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Osborne's single to center scored both of Marina's runs in the fifth, but 
Thobe retired six of the next seven batters he faced and struck out three of 
the last five batters he faced to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 8, Ocean View 7 -- Jason Brissey hit a two-run homer in the 
bottom of the seventh to give the Oilers (7-11, 3-5) the victory at Huntington 
Beach. Ocean View scored five runs in the first inning. Gary Christopherson had 
a two-run double and Mike Burns a two-run single for the Seahawks (4-4 in 
league play). Brian Wright had a bases-loaded triple in the second inning for 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 4, Fountain Valley 2 -- Jim Slagle had three hits, including a solo 
home run, and two RBIs for the Lions (12-6-1, 4-4) at Westminster. Brett Grebe 
(5-2) allowed eight hits and struck out eight for the victory. Mark Dodd had a 
solo home run for Fountain Valley (6-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
In the Academy League: 
</P>
<P>
Liberty Christian 23, Newport Christian 0 (5 innings) -- Chris Buckels pitched 
a two-hitter and struck out eight for visiting Liberty Christian. He batted in 
three runs with a single, a double and a two-run homer. Buckels has struck out 
67 batters in 32 innings. John O'Conner had four hits and four RBIs, and 
Richard Beyikian added three RBIs on three hits for Liberty Christian (13-2, 
3-0). Newport Christian is 1-5, 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the Century League: 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 17, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Host Foothill had 18 hits in breezing past

a double for Villa Park. Jason Wakefield had two hits for El Modena (6-2 in 
league play). 
</P>
<P>
Brethren 10, Capistrano Valley Christian 3 -- Chris Beck had three hits, 
including a home run, and scored three runs for Brethren (5-10, 2-5). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 12, Ontario Christian 3 -- Host Santa Margarita (6-8, 3-4) got 
a balanced attack from Jeff Bradley, who had a triple and four runs batted in,

IRISH FIRM PLACES RECORD $17-BILLION ORDER FOR JETLINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Irish aircraft leasing firm on Tuesday announced a $17-billion order for up 
to 308 commercial jetliners from three manufacturers, by far the largest such 
single-day purchase ever and another boost for McDonnell Douglas' commercial 
aircraft division in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
GPA Group Ltd., one of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies, said its 
order includes a $3.1-billion request for up to 72 aircraft from McDonnell 
Douglas. That deal will fill out gaps in McDonnell Douglas' already busy 
production lines in Long Beach, although it will not increase employment, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, which nearly shut down commercial jetliner production in the 
early 1980s due to sagging orders and financial losses, now has enough orders 
to fill out its production line well into the mid-1990s, thanks to this and 
other recent large orders, spokeswoman Elayne P. Bendel said. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in GPA's huge order, which the company first hinted at last week, 
was $9.4 billion for up to 182 aircraft from Boeing Co. in Seattle and a 
$4.3-billion request for up to 54 planes from Airbus Industrie, a European 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The deal -- which one analyst said represents a half-year's worth of production 
in the world jetliner industry -- is the latest in an unprecedented series of 
orders in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
These orders, spurred by projections of strong growth in worldwide demand for 
airline travel into the 1990s, have filled out production schedules for major 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
But they have also fueled production problems and delays which could lead to 
higher costs, financial losses and customer discontent with late deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a surprisingly strong airliner market we're witnessing, and this is 
just one more manifestation of that," said Paul H. Nisbet, aerospace analyst at 
Prudential Bache Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for a single purchase was Delta Air Lines' $10.5-billion 
order last September for 225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas jetliners. American 
Airlines and International Lease Finance Co. in Beverly Hills also have placed 
giant multibillion-dollar orders in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also is the latest sign of the growing prominence of leasing as a 
cheaper and more flexible way for airlines to obtain planes. 
</P>
<P>
Leasing enables airlines to adjust more quickly to changing passenger demand, 
avoiding the risk of committing large amounts of capital for purchases. Some 
smaller airlines cannot afford the high up-front costs of owning their own 
planes. Leasing also brings more capital to the aircraft market, since 
institutions and individuals can invest in aircraft deals through leasing 
limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the growing leasing trend has pushed up prices of new and 
used jetliners and could leave some carriers unable to get aircraft on their 
own for years. Leasing firms now account for more than 20% of the world's 
commercial jetliner orders, with GPA and International Lease Finance considered 
the largest players. 
</P>
<P>
GPA, formerly known as Guinness Peat Aviation, is based at Shannon Airport in 
Ireland and is privately owned by company founder T.A. Ryan and several 
companies, including Air Canada, the Irish airline Aer Lingus, Prudential 
Insurance and Mitsubishi Trust Bank of Japan. It already owns one of the 
world's largest aircraft fleets, including 172 planes operating with 64 
carriers in 32 countries, with another 350 jetliners on order. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its latest deal, GPA said it will buy 92 Boeing 737 narrow-body 
twinjets, 50 Boeing 757 narrow-body twinjets, and 40 Boeing 767 wide-body 
twinjets. It also ordered 30 short-to-medium range Airbus A320s, 10 
medium-to-long-range Airbus A330s and two long-range A340s, while taking 
options on another 10 A330s and two A340s. Orders also were placed with several 
major jet engine manufacturers, including Pratt &amp; Whitney and General 
Electric in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This significant commitment means that we expect to purchase about 10% of all 
of the commercial jet aircraft delivered through the mid-1990s," Chairman and 
Chief Executive Ryan told reporters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
While McDonnell Douglas got the smallest piece of the order relative to 
archrivals Boeing and Airbus, the allocation of the orders to each manufacturer 
represents their approximate relative worldwide market shares, analyst Nisbet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The order also is another boost for Douglas' fledgling MD-11, an updated 
version of its DC-10 trijet. Included in the transaction were firm orders for 
eight MD-11s, bringing the order backlog for that model to 284, including 91 
firm orders. 
</P>
<P>
GPA also placed firm orders for 34 MD-83 twinjets, with options for another 30. 
That brings the total backlog for all versions of the MD-80 series to 1,499, 
with nearly 1,000 firm. 
</P>
<P>
However, spokeswoman Bendel said, the order will not increase employment, which 
now totals more than 25,000 in Douglas' commercial operations and about 40,000 
for all Douglas operations, including military programs. That division-wide 
figure is up from 27,400 a year ago and 14,000 five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the order will fill in gaps in aircraft delivery positions and assure 
the company of maintaining its current full production rate of 2 1/2 aircraft 
per week, Bendel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The order has been anticipated in our current production rate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the swelling order book has not come without its problems. The MD-11 is 
about three months behind in flight testing, while deliveries for MD-80s are as 
long as a month behind schedule. Similar delivery delays are plaguing long-time 
industry leader Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is running flat out and everybody is having delivery delays," 
said Wolfgang H. Demisch, aerospace analyst at UBS Securities in New York. The 
result, he said, could be higher costs and other woes. "I'm sure it (higher 
costs) will haunt everybody," Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Hood Jr., who will take over as Douglas' new president next month, 
acknowledged such problems in a recent interview when he said that the division 
is beset by inadequate quality on production lines, antiquated management 
systems, high costs, disorderly procedures, a messy factory and looming future 
losses if conditions don't improve.

DREXEL'S RETAIL BROKERAGE OPERATIONS PUT UP FOR SALE 
</P>

Moving swiftly to reorganize in the wake of its recent legal problems, Drexel 
Burnham Lambert said it will sell its retail brokerage operations and focus 
exclusively on its core businesses, including "junk bonds," general investment 
banking services and bond and stock trading for institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was discussed in a weekend meeting of Drexel's board of directors 
and disclosed for the first time Tuesday when Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's 
chief executive, went on Drexel's public address system. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said the firm wants to sell the entire retail brokerage to a single 
securities firm with a larger retail operation. In a written statement, Drexel 
said it hoped to conclude a deal by next week. The firm said it hasn't reached 
agreement yet with any potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The retail unit, which mainly serves individual investors and employs 1,100 
brokers in 42 offices around the country and in Puerto Rico, accounts for only 
about 10% of the firm's revenue. One source at the firm said the retail 
operations recently haven't made a profit. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell the retail business wasn't unanimous, and sources said 
more than one member of Drexel's board voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also said it plans to "curtail" its activities in municipal 
securities, over-the-counter stocks and market-making and research in foreign 
stocks. A spokesman said it hadn't been decided yet whether these units would 
be closed or just reduced in size. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of plans to sell the retail unit infuriated many of Drexel's 
brokers, some of whom said in off-the-record interviews that they felt betrayed 
by the firm. A broker in one of the firm's West Coast offices said Drexel in 
recent months had repeatedly reassured brokers that it was committed to 
maintaining the retail business despite the firm's problems. The broker, who 
asked not to be identified, said that on Tuesday "Fred Joseph came over the 
(intercom) system and knocked brokers over the head, unconscious." He added 
that, as a result, "There are a tremendous number of very disgruntled people 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's retail brokers have long been overshadowed by the firm's main 
money-making operation, the high-yield junk bond trading and underwriting based 
at the firm's Beverly Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
It was also disclosed Tuesday that Drexel's board decided for a second time in 
the past two years to scrap plans to move its headquarters. The firm announced 
that, because it will have fewer employees as a result of the sale of the 
retail operation, it is abandoning plans to build a new building in lower 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Above-Average Revenue 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors Tuesday that several potential buyers were interested in the 
retail operation, including Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co., among others. But Merrill Lynch declined to comment, and a 
Smith Barney spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Drexel retail unit may not have been profitable, its brokers 
specialized in dealing with wealthier customers and are said to have produced 
gross commission revenue per broker of over $300,000, well above the industry 
average. Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said this makes the unit 
attractive to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The unit is believed to have been unprofitable because of the relatively small 
number of brokers compared to the operation's overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the decision to sell, Drexel cited both the adverse publicity 
that the firm has received and the weakness that all Wall Street firms 
currently are suffering in their retail business. Because of these factors, 
Drexel said the growth prospects for its retail unit weren't good. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has announced plans to plead guilty to six federal felony counts and pay 
$650 million in penalties in connection with allegations of securities fraud 
and insider trading. The firm also reached a settlement last week of civil 
charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement with the 
SEC subjects Drexel to the most stringent outside supervision ever imposed on a 
major securities firm. In addition, Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's 
junk bond department, recently was indicted on racketeering and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, said 
the publicity about Drexel's legal problems probably has made it difficult for 
Drexel brokers to attract new customers and keep existing accounts. In 
addition, he said, "It could be a stigma over the next few years with the 
Milken trial going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Depressed State' of Industry 
</P>
<P>
A broker at another of Drexel's West Coast offices confirmed that the constant 
press reports about the firm's legal problems worried customers and made it 
especially difficult to attract new customers. Brokers also speculated that 
selling the unit may greatly reduce the legal problems Drexel is expected to 
have with state regulatory authorities. Many state government securities 
regulators are expected to take action against the firm, with charges similar 
to the federal ones. 
</P>
<P>
But in its statement, Drexel emphasized the industrywide softness of retail 
stock and bond trading as the main reason for its decision. Stock trading by 
individuals has fallen off sharply since the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, given the depressed state of the securities industry, the anticipated 
lack of participation by individual investors and the mounting competition that 
can be expected as commercial banks become more active due to the recent easing 
of restrictions on their securities activities, the plan is a necessary step to 
ensure our firm's future vitality," Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said by concentrating on its core businesses, "Drexel will be able to 
maintain its role as the major factor in the underwriting of securities of 
industrial companies." The firm also said it expects its financial condition to 
remain one of the strongest in the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel confirmed that it plans to continue its present operations in 
mortgage-backed securities, arbitrage, commodities and as a dealer of 
government securities.

U.S. INDUSTRY DOES A POOR JOB OF PROTECTING PRIVACY, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

More than a decade after a presidential commission urged American business to 
take more care in using the private data it collects about employees and 
customers, industry has done far too little to protect privacy, according to a 
study released Tuesday by the commission's former chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Outdated, inaccurate records are being used to make critical decisions about 
hiring and promotions, said University of Illinois professor David F. Linowes, 
the study's author. A growing number of investigative agencies are buying, 
packaging and reselling data about individuals with few controls on the 
information's use or accuracy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's largest employers, 42% gather data about workers without 
telling them, Linowes' study found, and 57% hire private investigators to probe 
employees' or job applicants' backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of Fortune 500 companies found that 38% still have no policy on 
releasing employee records to government agencies, and 57% do not tell 
employees what records about them are maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"People would be surprised at how easy it is for others to obtain information 
about them they believe is confidential," said Linowes, who was chairman of the 
U.S. Privacy Protection Commission during the terms of Presidents Gerald R. 
Ford and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the commission concluded that private industry could be relied on to 
voluntarily adopt "fair information practices" that minimized intrusions into 
individual privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview and at a Washington news conference announcing results of 
the survey, Linowes said industry's response had been "a little too slow to be 
meaningful." He urged Congress to declare it national policy that individual 
privacy be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans are not aware of the tremendous impact that the accumulation of 
information by many institutions . . . is having on decisions being made about 
them without their knowledge," said Linowes, a professor of political economy 
and public policy who also was chairman of presidential commissions on 
privatization, national energy resources and federal coal leasing during the 
Ronald Reagan Administration. "This information is never destroyed, and it's 
obtainable instantaneously." 
</P>
<P>
On the commission's recommendation -- and in the wake of post-Watergate 
suspicion of government's and industry's ability to intrude on personal privacy 
-- several laws were passed a decade ago, including a federal law protecting 
consumer credit data. Just last year, Congress adopted one of the commission's 
key proposals: a near-total ban on the use of lie detectors in employment 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, state and federal privacy laws, Linowes said, remain a 
"patch-quilt." Moreover, privacy experts say advances in computer and 
telecommunications technology have made possible data collection and analysis 
that was unimaginable when the commission was at work 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Needed 
</P>
<P>
"Today we're seeing enormous advances in information technology and few 
safeguards to see that privacy rights are upheld," said Harley Shaiken, 
professor of work and technology at UC San Diego. "What's being proposed here 
is applying the standards of the Bill of Rights to the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, according to Linowes, is legislation that gives individuals 
access to -- and the right to correct the information in -- records about them, 
requires information collectors to gather no more data than they need and 
allows people to sue if confidential information about them is misused. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's no policy, the file clerk, the computer technician, anybody who 
is dealing with that information decides for themselves what to release," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Linowes and other privacy experts said industry, for the most part, could be 
expected to oppose further controls on the use of personal information, citing 
the costs and claiming a right to use as it wishes any data it owns or 
collects. 
</P>
<P>
But Linowes' survey, based on responses from 126 of the Fortune 500 companies, 
found that large corporations have taken some steps to better guarantee the 
privacy of data collected from employees. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to responses to a similar survey in 1979, more companies periodically 
evaluate their record-keeping systems, inform employees of their information 
disclosure practices, give employees access to their personnel records and 
forward corrections of errors in those records to anyone given false 
information in the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Concern 
</P>
<P>
Still, many companies continue to routinely release information to lenders, 
landlords and charities, and most fail to inform employees what kind of data is 
kept about them or how it is used. Concern about AIDS, drug abuse and smoking, 
Linowes said, seems to explain a big increase in the number of companies that 
use medical records in making employment-related decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The results of employers' data collection can haunt workers, Linowes said. 
</P>
<P>
He told of a woman in Chicago who hired a lawyer to find out why she was passed 
over for a number of government jobs. It turned out, Linowes said, that the 
potential government employer had obtained her grade school records from a 
computer database and found this angry notation by her third-grade teacher: 
"Mother is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Linowes said: "The appointing officer reasoned that if the mother was insane, 
there was a good chance she was, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRINCIPLES OF A 'FAIR INFORMATION' POLICY 
</P>
<P>
1. Minimize intrusiveness. Don't collect more data than is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
2. Maximize fairness. Let the subject know what information is being collected 
and why. 
</P>
<P>
3. Establish an enforceable expectation of privacy. Provide recourse if privacy 
is violated. 
</P>

PROGRESS ON PRIVACY? 
</P>
<P>
Fortune 500 companies were asked in 1979 and again this year about their 
practices for protecting the privacy of data collected from or about employees.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CONTROL DATA'S FAILURE WASN'T TECHNOLOGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Money talked on Monday when Control Data withdrew from competition in 
supercomputers. It couldn't continue financing a money-losing but 
technologically advanced operation, said its Chairman Robert Price. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout is a bad sign, but not for the reasons you may think. It's not that 
the United States -- the country that worries about its schools turning out 
enough engineers -- is falling behind in technology. In fact, there is little 
doubt that the U.S. industry leads in supercomputer technology. 
</P>
<P>
It was U.S. financial markets that failed Control Data. The real story is that 
the nation that turns out more business school graduates than any other is 
threatened competitively because it cannot figure out how to finance a business 
over the long pull, how to stay the course when the going gets rough. 
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers, machines that can perform billions of mathematical calculations 
per second, are important. They are used today to design airplane wings, 
simulate weapons systems, find oil deposits or decipher photographs from outer 
space. In the next decade, as their powers increase, so will their value and 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threw Towel In 
</P>
<P>
Yet sadly, Control Data, the Minneapolis company that first developed such 
computers in the early 1970s, threw in the towel even though it turns out one 
of the world's most powerful supercomputers. Its ETA Systems computer had 
technical flaws and needed software. But Control Data has sold 34 ETAs 
worldwide -- in a global market that has seen only 409 supercomputers sold to 
date. It had possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
And with time Control Data might have rejiggered its machine, developed the 
software. But nobody would take a chance on it. Banks wouldn't extend its 
credit lines, and the stock market seemed happy to accept its decision to close 
the business and restructure; the speculators said the company was "creating 
shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
Control Data's departure leaves U.S. industry with two prominent supercomputer 
players: Cray Research -- the global leader with more than 200 machines sold -- 
and giant IBM, which has declared its intention to enter the field and is 
backing entrepreneur Steve Chen's company, Supercomputer Systems Inc. A variety 
of supercomputer start-ups round out the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, meanwhile, has three major entrants in the supercomputer olympics: 
Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. The Japanese companies are not making any money in 
the business, but they are persevering. NEC, for example, in a joint venture 
with America's Honeywell, has just brought out a powerful new supercomputer. It 
has no orders but it is patient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Strengths 
</P>
<P>
What are the U.S. strengths? Technical brilliance and venturesome 
entrepreneurs, who are advancing the state of the art. Both Cray Research and 
Supercomputer Systems are going beyond one big machine to parallel processing, 
which breaks down massive problems, gets many parts of answers quickly and puts 
them back together -- as you might do in developing a satellite photograph. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. industry also is bringing new power to supercomputing with an effort 
by Intel Corp., the semiconductor company, to put together 2,000 chips, of 1 
million transistors each, to produce the most powerful computers yet made. 
Intel is working under a contract from the Defense Department on that advanced 
development. 
</P>
<P>
But most U.S. financing is entrepreneurial. Cray Research, now grown to $800 
million in revenue, was founded by Seymour Cray, 62, who left Control Data in 
1972 to form his own firm -- with backing from Control Data. Two years ago, 
Steve Chen left Cray to form Supercomputer Systems, and attracted backing from 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are springing up: Thinking Machines of Cambridge, Mass., and 
Kendall Square Research of Boston, Tera Corp. of Seattle and companies named 
Mips and Convex, Masspar and Alliant, Solbourne Computer and Key Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Which is exciting, but the staying power of small firms is suspect. Gary Smaby, 
a supercomputer specialist for Needham &amp; Co., an investment bank that backs 
start-up companies, believes the next decade will demand larger firms with the 
resources for a high-stakes game -- Control Data, after all, lost $100 million 
in supercomputers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Without patient financing, home-grown technology may leave home. Two promising 
newcomers in supercomputers are already owned or backed by Japanese companies: 
Key Computer Labs, of Fremont, Calif., was recently bought by Amdahl Corp., of 
which Fujitsu owns 45%, and Solbourne Computer of Longmont, Colo., is backed by 
Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital is a competitive threat," says Intel's President Andrew Grove, who 
sees Japanese financing being offered to start-up companies up and down Silicon 
Valley. But does it matter who finances technology? Yes, says Grove "because 
control of technology leads to jobs and development for your people and 
leadership for your country." 
</P>
<P>
True enough, but unless U.S. financial markets recognize there are values other 
than shareholder values, that leadership will fade.

PANEL PROBES PENTAGON'S OFFICE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigative panel of the House Armed Services Committee has begun a probe 
into administrative problems at the Pentagon's main business office in Southern 
California, which has been late in paying its bills to thousands of defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
A House staff member investigating the agency, known as the Defense Contract 
Administration Service, said the subcommittee on investigations is collecting 
information from small- and medium-sized defense contractors about their 
problems with late payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Contract Administration Service, a federal agency responsible for 
paying out about $50 billion annually, has experienced a virtual administrative 
crisis at its Los Angeles office, which is responsible for paying defense 
contractors in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. John Serur, commander of the regional office, said in an interview 
several weeks ago that the extent of the late payments has been substantially 
reduced since December. Delinquent invoices were cut from 12,000 in December to 
3,330 at the end of March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many defense contractors contacted by The Times say they have not seen any 
improvement, and that some bills remain unpaid for months. The complaints have 
been growing for more than a year and have triggered protests by both the 
Aerospace Industries Assn. and the California Assn. of Certified Public 
Accountants. 
</P>
<P>
Serur said the longstanding problems with delinquent payments should be solved 
for good by a new defense finance center in Columbus, Ohio, which will take 
responsibility from the regional centers and will pay all defense contractors 
across the nation. The center is scheduled to begin operations next month. 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Serur mailed letters to the chief executives of defense 
contractors in the West, acknowledging that DCAS "has been experiencing 
difficulty in meeting its payment obligations in a timely manner." In one of 
the letters, which a contractor provided to The Times, Serur offered to meet to 
"discuss the current payment situation" and to preview operations in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly heartwarming to know the general is concerned about our 
payment problems after all this time," one defense firm's chief executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite DCAS reassurances that the problems are being solved, members of the 
Armed Services Committee's staff remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing an investigation," a subcommittee staff member said. "We think it 
is an important area. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that when they start the move from Los Angeles to Columbus this 
summer, things could get much worse," he added. "That's what we are hearing 
from some contractors."

Craig Takeover Considered: Yucaipa Capital Partners, a Claremont-based limited 
partnership, has said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it 
may seek control of Craig Corp. Yucaipa said in the document that it may add to 
its 9.3% stake in Craig or sell all or part of that stock. The SEC statement 
also said Yucaipa may discuss possible corporate restructuring options with 
Craig. Executives at Los Angeles-based Craig, which owns 50% of the Stater 
Bros. supermarket company, had no immediate comment. Yucaipa filed the 
statement Friday. Craig stock closed at $38.50, up 50 cents Tuesday.

<P>
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. has become the first of the nation's major banks to 
eliminate its troubled loans to less developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based banking company's announcement came Tuesday in its 
earnings report for the first quarter, which showed an 18% increase in profits 
over the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Four other big banks reported strong first-quarter profits Tuesday, with New 
York-based Citicorp leading the way by posting a profit of $529 million, a gain 
of 48% over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, New York's Bankers Trust said its profit for the quarter was up 
30%, and two banks on the mend, Continental in Chicago and Mellon in 
Pittsburgh, posted good performances. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo began whittling down its LDC loan exposure last year by a 
combination of selling off loans at a discount and writing off others as 
losses. The bank said Tuesday that it eliminated the last $245 million in 
medium-term and long-term LDC debt during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of selling loans and writing them off was high -- $196.5 million was 
charged against loan-loss reserves in the first quarter. But the only loans to 
developing countries now on the bank's books are short-term debt that is 
considered much safer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focusing on State 
</P>
<P>
While some other major banks, including Los Angeles-based Security Pacific and 
First Interstate, have been paring down their LDC debt substantially, Wells 
Fargo is the first to get rid of it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The move is an integral part of the effort at Wells Fargo to withdraw from the 
international arena to concentrate on California. Because it will give the 
company a cleaner balance sheet, it is also expected to make the its stock more 
attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, the nation's 10th-largest banking company, was able to improve its 
profit for the quarter despite the big charge-offs for erasing the LDC loans. 
</P>
<P>
A big jump in net interest income as a result of a higher net interest spread 
-- the difference between rates on interest earned on loans and those on 
interest paid on deposits -- helped Wells Fargo post a profit of $141.5 million 
in the period. That compared to $120.4 million in the first quarter of 1988 and 
to $136 million in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's return on assets and return on equity, two key measures of 
performance, also improved compared to the same quarter in 1988. The ROA rose 
to 1.23% from 1.10% and ROE was up to 24.52% from 24.18% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of the LDC loans enabled the bank to cut its total non-performing 
loans substantially from a year ago despite an increase in troubled loans for 
real estate construction. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said real estate construction loans listed as 90 days or more past due 
rose to $235 million in the first quarter from $91.7 million in the same 
quarter of 1988 and $173.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division Up Sharply 
</P>
<P>
But Dan B. Williams, an industry analyst in the San Francisco office of Sutro 
&amp; Co., a regional brokerage, said the percentage of non-performing loans in 
the bank's total portfolio is "not enough to keep you awake at night." 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking company, said the strong performance of 
its individual bank division helped boost profits for the first quarter to $529 
million, by far the highest among U.S. banks. The division, which includes the 
company's consumer and credit card operations, posted a 28% increase in income. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp's earnings included a one-time gain of $77 million in the sale of its 
building in Tokyo. The bank is moving its expanding Japanese operations to a 
new center in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
ROA at Citicorp was 1.01% for the quarter, up from 0.70% a year earlier, and 
ROE rose to 24.2% from 22.75%. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Wells Fargo, however, Citicorp retains a heavy burden of LDC debt. The 
bank said its outstanding loans to developing countries were $9.3 billion at 
the end of the quarter, down from $9.5 billion at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust, the nation's ninth-largest banking company, said first-quarter 
profit of $164.3 million was up primarily as a result of increased non-interest 
revenue from its trading activities and fees from trust and custodial accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 14th-largest banking company, Continental Bank, continued to show 
a strong performance. Earnings for the quarter were a record $76 million, up 
10% over the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has scaled down to concentrate on commercial banking, said 
expenses for staff and other costs declined over the past 12 months, chiefly as 
a result of the elimination of nearly 1,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
At Mellon Bank, profit was $53 million for the quarter, compared to $25 million 
in the first quarter of 1988 and $48 million in the last quarter of 1988. In 
addition, the bank reported a one-time gain of $24 million from its capital 
refinancing program. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same quarter of last year, the 16th-largest bank reported 
increases in net interest income and service fees and decreases in operating 
expenses and provisions for loan losses.

San Diego Gas &amp; Electric shareholders on Tuesday endorsed a $2.4-billion 
stock swap merger that would blend the San Diego utility into Southern 
California Edison and create the nation's largest gas and electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
Exact vote totals will not available until today. 
</P>

Shareholders of SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, are expected 
to approve the proposed merger during a Thursday meeting. The merger also must 
be approved by various regulatory agencies, including the state Public 
Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Investors are showing rekindled interest in biotechnology companies for the 
first time in two years, as new drugs produced by genetic engineering head 
toward the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, people had given up on the technology and the industry," said 
Jeffrey Casdin, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. specializing in 
biotechnology. "Now both are reviving as the products become more real." 
</P>
<P>
"Biotech stocks are hot," added one trader, citing the group's long-standing 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Casdin's index of 64 publicly held biotechnology stocks 
rose 12.3%, compared to a rise of 6.2% for Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 
companies and a 6.6% gain in the NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts measure the biotechnology industry in different ways, all 
reported that their estimates had risen significantly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Products' 
</P>
<P>
Stocks of the top 10 biotechnology companies jumped 22% in the first quarter, 
according to PaineWebber Group's Linda Miller, while Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.'s 
Jeffrey Swarz said an index of 18 leading biotech groups climbed 14% during 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a progression," Swarz said. "Biotechnology is moving from 
entrepreneurial firms to companies with real products and finally to small, 
niche drug companies." 
</P>
<P>
Swarz predicted that about 12 biotech companies will survive and thrive in the 
field, a development expected in the next year to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she recommended shares of Amgen Inc., Biogen Inc., Centocor Inc. 
and Genzyme Corp. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 U.S. biotech companies are struggling to apply sophisticated 
genetic engineering technologies that could apply to fields ranging from cancer 
treatment to waste management. So far, the biotech rebound has focused mainly 
on the industry's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only large institutions have invested in the revival of biotechnology 
stocks. But analysts said the small investor is destined to follow suit later 
this year.

LINCOLN PARENT SUES TO REVERSE THRIFT'S SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Continental Corp., making good on its promise to fight the federal 
seizure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., has filed suit in U.S. District 
Court in Phoenix to overturn the seizure last Friday of the Irvine-based 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, meanwhile, intends to ask a bankruptcy court 
today to transfer control of certain Lincoln assets to federal regulators, 
contending that American Continental filed for protection from creditors last 
Thursday to try to keep those assets out of the government's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, one the of state's biggest thrifts with $5.4 billion in assets, was 
seized by the bank board as part of the S&amp;L rescue program instituted by 
President Bush. While Lincoln still is owned by American Continental, it is 
being run by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to overturn the seizure, the suit filed by American Continental 
seeks $150 million in damages from the bank board; its insurance arm, the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., and its regional regulatory branch, 
the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said Tuesday he was aware 
of the suit but had not reviewed it and could not comment on its allegations. 
The suit was filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compelling Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Wall said, however, that the bank board had compelling and legally proper 
reasons for taking control of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Government regulators maintain that Lincoln was being mismanaged and that its 
assets were being used to benefit American Continental at the expense of the 
S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"We said at the outset that we expect this to be a very litigious matter," said 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
He said the seizure of Lincoln was hastened by American Continental's decision 
to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code on behalf of itself and 11 Lincoln subsidiaries. The bankruptcy case does 
not include the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the bankruptcy filing is the suspension of monthly interest 
payments to some 23,000 investors who bought $200 million worth of American 
Continental bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bonds were sold through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branch 
offices and were marketed as alternatives to certificates of deposit that paid 
lower interest rates but were protected by federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bankruptcy rules, bondholders are considered unsecured creditors and 
cannot receive any payments of principal or interest until a plan of 
reorganization is worked out. One bankruptcy law specialist said that could 
take a year or more in a case as complex as American Continental's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond-Holder Action 
</P>
<P>
One bond purchaser, Fountain Valley dentist Don Mikami, said Tuesday that 
bondholders are trying to determine what recourse they have. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is organizing," said Mikami, who owns $25,000 in American 
Continental subordinated debentures. "We're collecting as many names as 
possible at this time and getting a data base of investors" for a possible 
future legal action. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, American Continental maintains that regulators had no right to 
assume control of Lincoln because the S&amp;L was solvent when it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that the bank board and its officials have waged a 
three-year campaign to destroy Lincoln "in retaliation for Lincoln's opposition 
to limitations on the types of investments in which savings and loans may 
engage." 
</P>
<P>
American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr., in a 20-minute speech 
Monday, claimed that the seizure of Lincoln threatened the stability of 
American Continental -- one of the Arizona's largest employers -- and thus was 
a blow against that state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also charged that the bank board has been attempting to destroy his 
reputation and the ability of his companies to do business by systematically 
leaking confidential information from government audits of Lincoln to the press 
and by "toying with the files, by trumped up charges . . . distortions and 
outright lies." 
</P>
<P>
Keating is a fiery and politically well-connected Phoenix developer who has 
been outspokenly critical of the bank board and its regulation of S&amp;L 
investing policies.

NWA STOCK TAKES BIG LEAP AS DAVIS PRESSES TAKEOVER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NWA's shares soared Tuesday as Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis said he has 
lined up more than $3 billion to fund his takeover offer for the company, the 
embattled owner of Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whose $90-a-share offer has been rejected by NWA, also indicated that he 
would slow down the airline's growth if he acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Davis' financing is more than he needs to cover 
his bid for the airline. Louis A. Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery 
Scott, a Philadelphia investment firm, said Davis now has enough money to pay 
up to $110 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems prepared to go higher," Marckesano said. "The market seems to say 
either he or someone else will go higher." NWA's shares climbed $7.125 in 
trading Tuesday, closing at $97.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of NWA, which is based in Eagan, Minn., made no comment on Davis' 
financing plans. The company had previously rejected his $2.62-billion bid as 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines, which has more flights to Japan and other countries in the 
North Pacific region than any other U.S. airline, had recently attracted 
another suitor, a shareholder group led by Los Angeles financier, Alfred 
Checchi. Reacting to the takeover bids, NWA's board said Monday that it would 
consider all offers for the company, along with other alternatives designed to 
"enhance shareholder value," such as buying back shares at a premium, or paying 
shareholders a special dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who plans a proxy fight in an effort to unseat NWA's board, has not yet 
met with NWA officials, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he expects to borrow $2.4 billion from a consortium of banks led by 
Citibank and to raise another $600 million by selling high-yield "junk" bonds 
through Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, a New York investment firm. 
Davis said he would also spend $300 million of his own money to help pay for 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Davis said Citibank would provide a $250-million revolving credit 
line for working capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is a very strong financing package," Davis said in a 
statement. "With this financing package, no sales of any strategic assets will 
be required to meet the company's financial obligations. In fact, we would 
expect -- and could comfortably finance -- the expansion of NWA's passenger 
capacity by over 30% over the next six years." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Davis said that it was possible that he would sell 
"non-strategic" assets, such as NWA's Japanese real estate, which has been 
valued by analysts at $300 million, if he succeeds in buying the company. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' plan would more than triple NWA's debt to about $3.6 billion, making it 
hard for the airline to navigate safely through an economic downturn, analysts 
said.

A Santa Ana judge turned down a request by Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes Inc. 
to dismiss an attempt by creditors to put the company into involuntary 
bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana rejected the request because 
of significant changes in the list of those who claim to be creditors of the 
company, Heidi's attorney Martin Foley said. Foley said he plans to file a 
revised motion to dismiss the creditors' attempt, and that a hearing on the 
request is scheduled next month. Also on Tuesday, a group of Heidi's 
franchisees said it filed a petition with the Bankruptcy Court to force two of 
Heidi's subsidiaries into Chapter 7 bankruptcy, said Jim Teledano, an attorney 
for the group. Under a Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy, the company stops 
doing business and its assets are liquidated. Heidi's, a Laguna Hills-based 
firm that operated as an independent, publicly traded company at the time of 
the original filing, is now owned by Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc., which 
purchased a majority interest in Heidi's in late February.

"It's a matter of fact, but employers don't know what they can do," said Sally 
LeSage, a spokeswoman for James. Among the scheduled topics are accident 
prevention and health promotion.

Trimedyne Inc., a Santa Ana maker of laser catheters, has introduced a 
portable, air-cooled system that chills laser machines used in treating heart 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its system, which cools the machines that produce the energy 
used by lasers, is the only air-cooled system to be approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration for cardiovascular use. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne President Howard K. Cooper said the air-cooled technology makes the 
company's system more compact than traditional water-cooled systems, which also 
require plumbing accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the system was developed with MBB of West Germany, which is also 
manufacturing the product.

COMFORT, PRESTIGE ADD TO PRICE TAGS ON HOUSES AS MARKET GOES UPSCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK

<P>
Inflation isn't the only reason for the big price tags on new houses in recent 
years. Comfort and prestige on a luxurious scale probably count as much, 
judging from a Census Bureau report. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the report shows that much of the new-home construction market has 
gone upscale to a surprising extent at the very time, oddly, that pressure is 
growing for more affordable housing for young families. 
</P>
<P>
The situation poses a dilemma for housing markets: How can existing owners 
continue to move up to more expensive housing if first-time buyers cannot 
afford to buy the houses the more affluent owners are leaving? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the demand for luxurious accommodations comes from existing owners who, 
benefiting from rising market values in the past few years, have amassed 
mountains of equity that can be applied to fulfilling their housing dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, some housing people predict, the trend to more expensive housing 
could automatically abort because of weakness in the lower end of the market, 
leaving a dearth of the move-up buyers with sufficient equity. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report shows that in 1988 the median size of new homes was 
1,815 square feet, compared with 1,605 square feet in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
More revealing are the amenities: 42% with more than two baths, compared with 
just 28% in 1984; 26% with four bedrooms or more versus 18% in 1984, and 75% 
with central air, versus 71%. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion with more than one fireplace also rose, to 65% from 59%, as did 
the proportion with garages able to accommodate more than two cars, 65% against 
55%. 
</P>
<P>
A separate survey of homeowner preferences by the National Assn. of Home 
Builders confirms that consumers seeking another home look for more room and 
more amenities and that they won't accept stripped-down houses. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, basic houses were viewed by government and industry officials as a 
practical means of providing shelter at relatively low prices, while providing 
the owner the option of adding space when finances permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the figures, a Home Builder economist attributes at least part of the 
luxury phenomenon to demographics, especially an aging of the population and 
income trends, or "a greater inequality in the distribution of income." 
</P>
<P>
A more economical approach to housing, and perhaps more in balance with an 
aging population, could be detected in figures for multifamily housing, which 
includes many rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures, from the same Census Bureau report, show the median size of new 
units in 1988 was 935 square feet compared to 871 square feet in 1984. Units 
with two baths or more rose to 41% from 35%. 
</P>
<P>
However, economic or demographic pressure was revealed in some of the other 
multifamily figures: 
</P>
<P>
The percentage with two bedrooms rose only one percentage point, from 54% to 
55%, between 1984 and 1988. Units with three or more bedrooms dropped to 8% 
from 9%.

BOARD GROUP TO SEEK CONTROL OF OAK INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group that includes former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman 
Roderick M. Hills, former U.S. Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and San 
Diego Economic Development Corp. Chairman George W. Leiszhas begun a proxy 
fight aimed at unseating five of San Diego-based Oak Industries' eight board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident group will sponsor a board majority that would be "independent" 
of current Oak Chairman E. L. McNeely, according to a prepared release issued 
Tuesday by Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, nominated to Oak's board by McNeely in 1985, voiced "frustration" with 
the company's inability to report consistent operating profits and said it left 
him with "no alternative" except to challenge McNeely for control of the 
company. McNeely was out of town and unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oak, a high-flying media conglomerate during the late 1970s, fell upon hard 
times in the early 1980s and reported $300 million in net losses between 1981 
and 1987. Since becoming chairman in 1984, McNeely has been trying to 
orchestrate a turnaround at the troubled company, which now basically is an 
electronic-components maker. 
</P>
<P>
Hills initiated the proxy fight because "Oak keeps on raising cash and losing 
it through operations," according to a source associated with the dissident 
group. "For the first time in some time, Oak Industries shareholders will have 
a real choice, will have something to say" about Oak's stock, which has traded 
at about $1 for more than a year.

NBC IS NO. 1 FOR SEASON, BUT BIG 3 LOSING VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was good news and bad news for the major TV networks Tuesday. Most of the 
good was for NBC, which chalked up its fourth consecutive prime-time victory in 
the so-called "official" season that ended Sunday. It finished first in all 30 
weeks and beat second-place ABC by a 24% margin, the largest since CBS' victory 
over NBC in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news was for all three networks. In a strike-crippled season, their 
combined share of the prime-time audience was the lowest in history -- 
averaging 68%, or about 3% below last season. 
</P>
<P>
Network officials attributed the drop both to last year's 22-week writers' 
strike, which delayed production of new and returning series, and the 
continuing inroads of cable, now in 54.8% of the nation's TV households. 
</P>
<P>
But they sought to project a "the-worst-is-over" outlook in discussing two 
separate sets of ratings for the just-completed season. CBS was the most 
optimistic, even though that once-dominant network was third in the ratings for 
the second straight season, by a narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
CBS research vice president David Poltrack forecast heavy promotion next fall 
to lure back viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to bang the drums loudly, probably a little bit more 
loudly than we have in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the final returns for this season, released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co., 
NBC calculated a traditional 30-week season. Least affected by the strike 
because it had the Summer Olympics and World Series telecasts, it said it 
averaged a 16 rating, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.6. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' and ABC's ratings were for what they considered a strike-shortened, 
25-week season that didn't start until Oct. 24, when more than 50% of all 
network programming was first-run, as it would be in a normal season. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome wasn't much different. CBS estimates gave NBC a 15.7 rating, ABC a 
12.9 and CBS a 12.7. Each ratings point represents 904,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
NBC research vice president Gerald Jaffe said he didn't want to gloat over 
NBC's victory, "but this season was truly historic. We really did dominate." 
</P>
<P>
The domination, which showed 13 NBC shows among the nation's 20 favorites, was 
led by "The Cosby Show," the top-rated series for the fourth consecutive 
season. No other network has finished first in all 30 weeks of the season since 
CBS did it in 1963-64; overall, NBC has now won or tied for first for 43 weeks 
in a row and is four weeks away from the all-time record. 
</P>
<P>
Poltrack called the season "atypical" in that new shows didn't get a normal 
start-of-season audience sampling, and "viewers were frustrated" by the way the 
season trickled in. 
</P>
<P>
Some went to cable. But a big beneficiary was the Fox Broadcasting lineup, 
which he said was up 49% in ratings over last season, much of that due to Fox's 
"Married . . . With Children" and "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden success of "Married" no doubt was "much to the chagrin of Terry 
Rakulta," Poltrack joked, referring to the Michigan housewife whose 
headline-making gripes about its ribald content prompted one sponsor to 
withdraw its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
But both he and ABC research vice president Alan Wurtzel agreed that viewers 
started returning to the networks this year, sampling the new wares. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that, over the past four or five weeks, the three-network 
ratings and shares have in fact really stabilized, and are very similar to what 
they were a year ago," Wurtzel said in an interview. "I kind of feel it took 
all this time for everybody to kind of get back on track." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, whose "Lonesome Dove" was the season's highest-rated miniseries, started 
its march back from a dismal third-place fall standing, rebounding with new 
programming in the first quarter of this year to second place in the ratings, 
Poltrack said. 
</P>
<P>
That bodes well for next season, he added, provided CBS can correct a 
"significant weakness" -- its long-standing inability to win ratings in the 8-9 
p.m. time period. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of CBS' 29 pilots now being considered are designed to work in 
that time period, he said, and if those chosen for series succeed there, "the 
domino effect of it will be dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Poltrack also predicted big things for CBS' much-publicized "Murphy Brown," 
even though that rookie sitcom was 32nd in the Nielsens for regularly scheduled 
series this season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS thinks that "Brown" is "going to be around a long time and it's going to 
build an audience," he said, noting that two other long-running hits -- NBC's 
"Cheers" and CBS' "MASH" -- started slowly. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Jaffe, in discussing the continuing impact of cable, said that most of 
the 3% drop in audience occurred early in the season, and was due to viewers 
shifting to basic cable. 
</P>
<P>
He also said viewing alternatives in cable have dramatically increased: The 
average household had only 17 cable channels a few years ago, but now has 25. 
The newest is NBC's CNBC business-news service. 
</P>
<P>
But Jaffe and his rival-network counterparts, noting that no strike looms to 
stall next season, all said they thought the decline in the three networks' 
share of audience would be the same or less then as the just-finished season. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's Wurtzel forecast what he called "a modest erosion" of 2% or 3% in network 
shares of audience next season, Poltrack reckoned it would be only one share 
point, and Jaffe was even more optimistic, saying the decline would be 
"minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
About nine years ago, the three-network share of audience peaked at an 
estimated 90%. It has been steadily dropping -- the biggest drop, 9%, occurring 
at the start of the 1987-88 season. The networks blamed half of that on the new 
people-meter ratings system that has become the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they say cable penetration is starting to "plateau," as Wurtzel put it. 
Poltrack said he anticipates that the networks' ratings decline will stabilize 
in 1995, when the Big Three will average between 63% and 65% of the national 
viewing audience.

HALL CHORALE TO MERGE INTO MASTER CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 33 years of artistic eminence and financial struggle, the Pasadena-based 
William Hall Chorale will be dissolved at the end of the current season, to be 
absorbed into the Master Chorale of Orange County in Costa Mesa, officials of 
the two groups announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
William Hall, who is music director of both organizations, has taught at 
Chapman College in Orange since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Pending Master Chorale board approval, Hall will receive a 5-year contract with 
the group, the first time the organization has departed from its normal policy 
of year-to-year contracts. He became its music director in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, the Master Chorale, which will retain its name and 
remain in Costa Mesa, will have a combined membership of about 150 singers, 
Hall said. The Hall Chorale now has 90 to 100 singers; the Master Chorale's 
roster lists 115. Auditions for the merged chorale will be held in the summer. 
Annual auditions are customary for both organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new group will make its debut Oct. 27 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall Chorale will have its final concert on April 30 when Hall conducts 
Bach's St. Matthew Passion at the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Tuesday that the dissolution of his Pasadena chorale was "a difficult 
thing" but added that the "potential (in Orange County) is staggering. There is 
much more for us here." 
</P>
<P>
"This seemed a natural outgrowth," he suggested, "since we're combining the two 
groups anyway for (Britten's) War Requiem" on May 21 at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the new organization will offer concerts at UCLA's Royce Hall and the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, and will appear with the Inland Empire Symphony, in 
addition to its subscription season at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. After the Oct. 27 debut, dates at the Center will be Dec. 8 or 9, Feb 9 
and April 27. 
</P>
<P>
Hall plans to develop a group of approximately 35 to 40 singers for community 
outreach programs and contracted services. The Master Chorale's pops ensemble, 
the Californians, will remain active, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 budget for the newly constituted chorale will be approximately 
$450,000, an increase over the current Master Chorale budget of $330,000, 
according to board chairman John Rhynerson. 
</P>
<P>
Hall stepped in to lead the Master Chorale in December, 1987, after the 
organization's music director, Maurice Allard, resigned unexpectedly in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment as music director the following March came amid discussions to 
merge with the Master Chorale and the Pacific Chorale, the other major choral 
group in Orange County. The Pacific is conducted by John Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for consolidation given by board members of both organizations included 
intense competition, not only for corporate dollars but for performance dates 
at the Orange County Center. It further was suggested that combining audiences 
would make it easier to fill the 3,000-seat facility. 
</P>
<P>
In September, however, 10 months of negotiations fell apart over the question 
of who would lead the combined group. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale of Orange County was founded in 1956 as the Anaheim 
Choraleers, a small community group. Allard took over in 1978 when the 
organization had grown to include 120 members and shifted toward classical 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall chorale has earned a solid musical reputation and a high place among 
American choral organizations, having toured Europe and Asia as well as the 
United States. But the chorale has faced fiscal challenges and difficulties in 
finding suitable performance spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Tuesday that his organization had experienced "waning sales in 
subscriptions and greater reliance on single ticket sales." He recalled that in 
1986, he had proposed merging his chorale with the Los Angeles Master Chorale, 
but that group chose to move in another direction and subsequently hired John 
Currie as music director. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, by contrast, according to Hall, looks like "the land of milk and 
honey."

ABC again had the top-rated show of the week in "Roseanne" but still came in 
third overall because of some low-rated weekend programming, figures from the 
A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Tuesday. NBC finished first for the 43rd week in a row, 
although there was nothing to cheer in the premieres of two new series, "Dream 
Street" (No. 42) and "The Jim Henson Hour" (No. 71). The latter shared the 
bottom rungs of the Nielsen ladder with such ABC offerings as "Moonlighting," 
"Great Circuses of the World" and "Men." The full list of ratings is on Page 8. 
</P>
<P>
* NBC doesn't have a "Lonesome Dove" on its hands in "Around the World in 80 
Days." The premiere of the three-part miniseries Sunday night finished third in 
its time period behind ABC's TV movie "A Deadly Silence" and CBS' TV movie 
"Love and Betrayal."

JANE BLOOM: A LIVE WIRE IN ELECTRONIC JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For me, the process of change and development is grasping a part of what it 
means to be a musician and improviser in 1989," soprano saxophonist Jane Ira 
Bloom said by phone from her New York City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an improviser encompasses embracing what are the important influences of 
your times and reflecting and reacting to it. I suppose the live electronics 
are part of my statement about what it means to be improvising today." 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, who is appearing with her trio tonight and Thursday at the Catalina Bar 
and Grill in Hollywood, first attracted widespread attention as an improviser 
and composer in jazz circles with her 1983 album "Mighty Lights." But when she 
resurfaced two years ago with the "Modern Drama" album for Columbia, Bloom was 
employing a personally designed effects system that electronically altered the 
tone of the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The advent of electronics often signals that a jazz artist has resorted to 
stale fusion formulas, but Bloom has used electronics in a genuinely 
improvisatory way where the effects remain subservient to her musical 
objectives. "Modern Drama" included pieces Bloom composed around specific 
"electronic structures," but her current Columbia album, "Slalom," downplayed 
the electronics except when they suited the improvisational demands of her 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Those effects -- which can make a single note sound like a broad smear rather 
than a sharply defined point -- are controlled by foot pedals on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing about the setup is that it's spontaneous," said Bloom, 34. "I 
have the ability to trigger the sounds on and off just as quickly as my ideas 
can happen; I try to make that flow from my acoustic sound and my electronic 
thoughts be seamless. 
</P>
<P>
"The saxophone is still at the core of what is impelling the electronics. I've 
spent so much time and energy creating a sound on the instrument that having 
some balance between it and the electronics -- knowing that the breath, 
phrasing and timbre of the saxophone is behind what I'm doing -- is still 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
A Boston native, Bloom began playing alto saxophone before gravitating toward 
the soprano. Sonny Rollins, Eric Dolphy, Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman 
were early influences and her hometown teacher Joe Viola a major inspiration 
but Bloom's formative musical experience came when she attended Yale University 
from 1972 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Her contemporaries there included the critically acclaimed pianist-composer 
Anthony Davis and trumpeter-theorist Leo Smith. Bloom credited the latter with 
motivating her to release the two self-produced albums on her own Outline label 
that launched her recording career in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to document your music, you learned how to do it yourself," said 
Bloom. "Leo Smith had been doing it for years when the recording industry 
wasn't interested in new jazz or young improvisers. In retrospect, we had to be 
as creative about how to get the music out and where to perform it as we did 
about the music itself." 
</P>
<P>
Bloom's albums, along with a stint with vibes player David Friedman, drew some 
attention but her breakthrough was "Mighty Lights." At the time, Bloom was also 
working with an electronics specialist in a contemporary new music vein. Those 
experiments spurred her to investigate techniques and technology that could 
create what she described as a "Doppler-like effect" with her instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Her attempt to make the way sound changes when it moves a part of her 
instrumental vocabulary is an extension of Bloom's fascination with motion and 
velocity. Some compositions have been inspired by athletes ranging from ice 
dancing champions Torvill and Dean to drag racer Shirley Muldowney and NFL 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom has composed pieces for the Pilobolus Dance Theatre and other dance 
companies, the Yale Repertory Theater and has been awarded a 
composition-performance grant by the National Endowment for the Arts. She was 
also the first musician commissioned to be a member of the NASA art program and 
is working on a suite of compositions after viewing the launch and landing of 
the shuttle Discovery last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her chief allegiance remains to the world of jazz improvisers, despite the lack 
of live performance opportunities for herself and others attempting to break 
new ground rather than wring new variations out of traditional jazz models. But 
Bloom indicated her large-scale ambitions might extend beyond just writing for 
a sizable ensemble to encompass more of a multimedia performance approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to present the improvisational music I do in a more theatrical 
context," said Bloom. "I have a bent toward performance art and through my 
husband (actor Joe Grifasi) have (seen) the potential and power of the 
theatrical craft. I like the combining of all those disciplines -- and film and 
video as well -- so I guess I have an artistic scheme that could embrace things 
that go beyond the musical world."

OPERA PACIFIC CHIEF QUITS TO GIVE FAMILY MORE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Weil, managing director of Opera Pacific, will resign effective May 31 
to spend more time with his family, company officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Weil also wants to devote more time to arts-advocacy efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A national search will be conducted for Weil's successor, according to company 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really time for me to spend time with my family," Weil said. "We just had 
a new baby girl in February, the week that (Opera Pacific's) 'Norma' opened. We 
also have a 2-year-old boy. They're both young, and they don't know me. . . . 
I'm sort of a family person at heart. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also very concerned about the environment that is changing for the arts, 
both in the state and locally. We need some new thinking and new directions in 
public support of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Weil said that he has enough money saved to take the summer off and that he 
will look for a new job in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint as executive director of the San Francisco-based Philharmonia 
Baroque Orchestra, Weil joined Opera Pacific in December, 1986, as the 
company's first managing director. His duties were to oversee and coordinate 
marketing, development, financial planning and volunteer activities. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 2 years, he was also a member of the board of directors of the 
California Confederation of the Arts and, in 1987, was a member of the music 
panel of the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Weil was among a group of county arts representatives who 
went to Sacramento as part of the annual Arts Day sponsored by the 
confederation to lobby key legislators about Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 
$3-million cut in the council's budget for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Weil said he intends to remain in Orange County. CHRIS PASLES

PACIFIC SYMPHONY FINALLY REPLACES CANCELED BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 2 months after it canceled a performance of Verdi's Requiem, and just 
1 week before show time, the Pacific Symphony has announced a replacement 
program in which soprano Aprile Millo will sing Verdi arias and the orchestra 
will offer Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
For the April 26-27 concerts, outgoing music director Keith Clark will lead 
Millo and the orchestra in such Verdi excerpts as the Overture to "Luisa 
Miller"; "Tacea la notte placida" from "Il Trovatore"; Ballabile, the Willow 
Song and "Ave Maria" from "Otello," Prelude to Act III of "La Traviata"; and 
"Pace, pace, mio dio!" from "La Forza del Destino." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruckner symphony will provide the second half of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Verdi Requiem, which would have enlisted soloists Millo and Dolora Zajick, 
plus the Pacific Chorale, was cut in February as a budget-balancing move that 
saved about $75,000, according to the orchestra's executive direcor, Louis G. 
Spisto. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Requiem will be rescheduled for the 1990-91 season. There is 
no confirmed date for an alternate appearance by mezzo-soprano Zajick, although 
officials have said that she will return during the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra leaders said the long delay in settling on the substitute program 
stemmed from difficulties in coordinating repertory between soloist and 
orchestra. RANDY LEWIS

BLAST KILLS 47 ON BATTLESHIP IOWA;

EXPLOSION IN GUN TURRET ROCKS VESSEL NEAR PUERTO RICO

A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on 
maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an 
undetermined number, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted 
from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more 
than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-inch guns are the biggest in the Navy arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
"We assume it was a powder bag," Howard said in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Another spokesman said at least 47 crewmen were killed in the explosion that 
ripped through the turret when one of the giant guns was being fired during a 
training exercise about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Danger of Sinking 
</P>
<P>
The crew extinguished the fire that broke out. The spokesman said he had no 
word on the number of injured. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Coral Sea steamed to the scene, sending out helicopters to 
land supplies and medical crews on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa headed toward Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico. It was in no 
danger of sinking. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost fine young lives," President Bush said during a photo session with 
congressional leaders at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness," Bush said. He said he 
wanted to "express my regrets, especially to the families" of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Date From 1943 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. William 
Crowe were informed of the incident while attending a NATO defense ministers 
meeting in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa's 16-inch guns are in three turrets. The explosion took place in the 
No. 2 turret. 
</P>
<P>
The guns are originals dating from the ship's first commissioning at the height 
of World War II in 1943 as a sister ship of the Missouri, aboard which the 
Japanese signed the war-ending surrender document. 
</P>
<P>
The powder bags are stored below decks in heavily armored magazines. Defense 
officials traveling with Cheney said seawater was pumped into the magazine 
where the fire and explosion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the ship's nine guns requires a crew of 60 to 70 to operate it, with 20 
to 30 people in the turret and the others below, sending up shells and powder 
bags. The powder bags are loaded behind the shells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Often Refurbished 
</P>
<P>
"It's rather labor-intensive," a Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa itself has been refurbished many times since it was commissioned and 
was most recently put back into service in December, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was deployed in the Persian Gulf region between September, 1987, and 
February, 1988, as a symbol of America's ability to strike deep into Iran. It 
also saw service in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, 58,000 tons fully loaded, sails out of Norfolk, Va., and carries a 
crew of about 1,600.

LUCILLE BALL ALERT, LOOKING WELL AFTER HEART SURGERY, HUSBAND SAYS

Lucille Ball's "Irish eyes are smiling," husband Gary Morton said after the 
comedian awakened today at 9:45 a.m., about 14 hours after surgeons finished an 
emergency heart operation. She was alert and looked well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons said they were optimistic that Ball will recover fully from surgery in 
which her aorta and aortic valve were replaced with organ tissue donated from a 
27-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, 77, who reigned for decades as Lucy, the zany, rubber-mouthed queen of 
comedy, had her heart stopped for two hours during Tuesday's procedure at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which kept her in the operating room for about 
seven hours.

MASS KILLER SALCIDO SEIZED AT A ROADBLOCK IN MEXICO;

<P>
California winery worker Ramon Salcido, wanted in a bloody rampage that left 
seven people dead, including his wife and two of his baby daughters, was 
arrested today at a roadblock in northwestern Mexico, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was arrested before dawn this morning in a surprise roadblock set up by 
agents fighting the illicit drug trade," said Vicente Mendoza, a spokesman for 
the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was picked up just outside Guasave, a village near Los Mochis, his 
hometown in Sinaloa state about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City, Mendoza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said Salcido, a Mexican national, will be flown to Mexico City later 
today for an extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been arrested at the request of U.S. authorities who have asked for his 
extradition. We are bringing him to Mexico City," Mendoza said, adding that 
Salcido is in the custody of the Federal Judicial Police, a branch of the 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was the object of one of the biggest manhunts in California history. 
The FBI joined the search on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested the same day that services were being held in the Sonoma County 
wine country town of Glen Ellen, Calif., for some of the six members of 
Salcido's family who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people attended a memorial service Tuesday for another of the 
victims, Tracy Toovey. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, 28, was a forklift operator who worked with Toovey at the Grand Cru 
winery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cocaine-Fueled Night 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's wife, mother-in-law, two young sisters-in-law and Toovey were 
butchered, shot to death or both on April 15. The next day, three of Salcido's 
daughters were found with their throats cut, two of them dead. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, 3-year-old Carmina, is recovering in Petaluma Valley Hospital. 
She told investigators that her father cut her and her sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's friends told the San Francisco Examiner that he had a frenzied, 
cocaine-fueled night of drinking and dancing before the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"He party, party, party all the time -- run around all night," the newspaper 
quoted one unidentified person as saying. "He drink everything -- beer, wine, 
tequila." 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said his detectives are not sure what 
touched off Salcido. It was known that earlier Salcido had been served with a 
court order demanding payment of more than $5,000 in past-due child support 
payments for a child by another woman, and friends said this had upset him. 
</P>
<P>
It was also known that he was having troubles with his slain second wife, 
Angela, who reportedly wanted an annulment. And acquaintances said he was very 
jealous of her. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's mother, Valentino Bojorquez Armendariz, told The Times on Tuesday 
that her son called her last Friday and told her, "Mama, this is last time you 
will hear my voice." 
</P>
<P>
Bojorquez said her eldest son was sobbing in the brief phone call to her home 
in Los Mochis. She said her memory of the conversation wasn't clear, but she 
remembered that Salcido said, "I have problems and I'm going to kill myself," 
or "I have problems and they're going to kill me." 
</P>
<P>
He then hung up, and Bojorquez said she had not heard from him since.

Large numbers of U.S. diplomats canceled seats on Pan Am flights in the weeks 
before the bombing of Flight 103, according to a U.S. congressional panel that 
saw internal Pan Am documents, a British newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Independent, a respected daily, said documents sent to a House panel 
probing the Dec. 21 bombing show that Christmas holiday traffic for U.S. 
embassies had been heavily rebooked prior to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that relatives of those who died in the bombing have been 
angry that warnings of a possible bombing of a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to 
the United States were not made public.

Queen Elizabeth II is the most popular member of Britain's royal family, 
closely followed by her mother, according to a survey published today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are constantly told that it is Britain's younger royals who are the most 
popular. But we find the Queen and Queen Mother are far and away the best 
loved, with over 36% of the total vote," said Michele Brown, curator of the 
Royal Britain exhibition, which polled 6,500 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
After the queen and the Queen Mother came Princess Anne, the queen's daughter. 
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, was fourth and his wife, Diana, was fifth.

BUSH PLANNING $10-BILLION CUT IN ARMS: CHENEY

President Bush will announce a $10-billion cut in the U.S. military budget next 
week despite a promise to keep the Pentagon in step with inflation, Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney said today. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, said Bush had agreed with 
congressional leaders to chop $10 billion from the 1990 defense budget proposed 
by President Ronald Reagan before he left office in January. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that that would be a 0.9% real reduction from current levels. 
Bush earlier had planned to cut only $6.3 billion from the $315.2-billion 
Reagan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon "probably did better this year by the compromise up front" rather 
than getting into a long battle with Congress later in the year, Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fifth in a Row 
</P>
<P>
While the cut would be the fifth real reduction in a row for U.S. military 
spending, Cheney said it is not as severe as earlier reductions. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to specify where cuts will be made, saying he expects Bush to make 
the announcement next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Defense Department officials have said that Cheney intends to cancel the 
Marine Corps' new V-22 tilt-rotor troop transport aircraft, delay the Army's 
LHX light helicopter program and transfer at least 24 Navy frigates to the 
reserve force. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said Bush will also announce his spending proposal for the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile defense program and for mobilizing U.S. land-based strategic 
nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he does not know whether Bush will opt for mounting 10-warhead MX 
missiles on rail cars or for development of a new Midgetman single-warhead 
missile -- or a mix of the two.

Quoting Bible verse and choking with emotion, Oliver L. North's lawyer said 
today that the Ronald Reagan Administration, trying to keep the Nicaraguan 
Contras alive and rescue U.S. hostages in Lebanon, united in the cry, "Let 
Ollie do it!" 
</P>
<P>
"Ollie North doesn't want to be a hero," Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said in 
closing arguments at the former National Security Council aide's trial. "He 
just wants to go home." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a big octopus," Sullivan said. "The President, McFarlane, 
Poindexter, Casey . . . they are all reaching out to get Ollie North to run 
something. . . . They are all reaching out to get him." 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. McFarlane and John W. Poindexter were national security advisers to 
President Reagan, and the late William J. Casey was CIA director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Has Been a Hostage' 
</P>
<P>
In a quavering voice and appearing near tears, Sullivan read the Bible verse 
that says: "Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his life for 
another." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of man Ollie North is," said Sullivan. "Now he cries out. In a 
sense he has been a hostage. I ask you on the evidence to set him free." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sullivan said it was "natural instinct" for North to destroy documents 
because he was engaged in some of the government's most secret operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reasonable thing to do," Sullivan said of North's decision to destroy 
records as he prepared to leave the National Security Council staff in 
November, 1986. "The act of destroying documents" would be the "natural 
instinct of anybody running a covert operation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Secret Operations' 
</P>
<P>
"Col. North had charge of running some of the most secret operations" in the 
government, Sullivan said as North's Iran-Contra trial approached its end. 
</P>
<P>
The former NSC aide is accused of altering, destroying, concealing and removing 
documents as the Iran-Contra scandal emerged publicly in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
North testified that among the documents he destroyed were memos reflecting the 
diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to Iran to the Contra rebels in 
Nicaragua. One memo reflecting a planned diversion that North neglected to 
shred was found in his files on Nov. 22, 1986, by an aide to then-Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
North is accused of preparing documents stating that no one in the U.S. 
government knew until January, 1986, that Hawk missiles were aboard an aircraft 
to Iran on a November, 1985, flight assisted by the CIA.

A Stanford University medical ethics committee, following the lead of a 
National Institutes of Health panel, said today that aborted human fetuses 
should be used in medical research under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The use of fetal tissue from elective abortions has touched off a highly 
emotional and controversial debate, and in March the government imposed a 
moratorium on the use of federal funds for transplant research using such 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
A government ruling on the issue "will provide an early signal of President 
Bush's willingness to let the politics of abortion dictate the course of the 
research that is done by government scientists and funded with federal money," 
said researchers George Annas and Sherman Elias, writing in the April 20 New 
England Journal of Medicine.

Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens said today he will hold his newly acquired 
stake in a Tokyo-based automotive parts producer as a long-term investment and 
has no plans to "greenmail" the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not trying to sell our shares back to the company or friends of the 
company," Pickens said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
News that the Texas financier had bought a 20.2% holding in Koito Manufacturing 
Co., which sells most of its production to Toyota Motor Corp., sent shock waves 
through the Japanese financial community, where hostile takeovers are a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens said that he believes that Koito is well managed and that he is 
considering purchasing more of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Picken's assurances came amid growing concern in Japan's financial community 
that the Texas investor would attempt to force Koito or other companies 
interested in defending it to buy back his shares at prices higher than those 
he paid -- a strategy called greenmail.

Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a little more mileage out of the rally 
that has carried the market to its highest levels since the crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.51 to 2,386.91, bringing its 
gain over the past four sessions to 90.91 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outpaced declines by a modest margin on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 191.51 million shares, compared to 208.65 million in 
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .57 to 171.70. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from spreading hopes 
that inflationary pressures might be easing and that interest rates are turning 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for investors. For one 
thing, some observers suggest, they could lead to heightened concern about the 
possibility of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said, however, that any such fears were countered today by strong 
earnings reports from several prominent companies. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph stock rose on its report of its 20.6% 
increase in first-quarter earnings, as did stock in Philip Morris, which also 
posted a strong first-quarter earnings gain. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, among the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market, rose when 
the company reported that earnings for the fiscal quarter ended March 31 were 
73 cents a share, up from 67 cents in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson ordered that federal observers be placed on 29 American tuna boats to 
make sure that the dolphins were protected. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mostly lower in early trading today, as the market took back 
some of Tuesday's strong gains amid sharply rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue was down about 7/32 point, or about 
$2 for every $1,000 in face amount before noon in New York. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 8.95 from 8.93 late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower today after a surge in bond prices on Tuesday after two 
economic reports that provided further evidence that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market pulled back slightly this morning, partly on 
profit-taking and amid surging crude oil prices stemming from an oil and gas 
explosion in the North Sea.

Foot-dragging by Japan in the opening of its microchip market to foreigners 
will probably lead to a tougher U.S. trade stance, the president of the U.S. 
Semiconductor Industry Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry "is moving more slowly than it 
should," Andrew Procassini told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan will probably be named a "priority" nation, requiring new 
negotiations and possible sanctions in accord with Section 301 of the U.S. 
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills is expected to include Japan's 
semiconductor market when she unveils a list of alleged unfair trade practices 
on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
She will have 30 days from then to decide whether to name Japan a "priority" 
nation, a move that would oblige her to open special negotiations that could 
lead to retaliatory sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The United States already imposes 100% tariffs on $165 million worth of 
Japanese exports in retaliation for alleged failure to honor a pledge under a 
1986 microchip pact to give foreign makers greater market access.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., coming off the first annual loss in its 
history on the strength of a boom in the long-distance telephone market, today 
said its profits jumped 20.6% to $594 million in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based AT&amp;T earned 55 cents a share in the first quarter, compared 
to $492 million, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues rose to $8.66 
billion from $8.39 billion, buoyed by robust long-distance and product sales. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected earnings growth from 15% to 20%. By contrast, rival MCI 
Communications Corp. reported Tuesday that its profits jumped 132% to $135 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street greeted the news with enthusiasm. Shares of AT&amp;T rose 25 cents 
to $33.375 as the New York Stock Exchange's second most-active issue this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's long-distance operations are being fueled by aggressive advertising 
and sales promotions, an expanded sales force and increased regulatory 
flexibility, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Such flexibility may help the telephone giant's balance sheets later in the 
year.

TRUMP QUOTED AS CALLING LEONA HELMSLEY 'DISGRACE'

<P>
Donald Trump, the billionaire developer who's been called a few names himself, 
has called real estate executive Leona (The Queen) Helmsley "a disgrace" and a 
destroyer of her husband's reputation, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post quoted an anonymous source close to Trump as saying the 
impetus for the attack was a dispute about a Helmsley-owned piece of property 
in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Trump wrote Leona Helmsley on April 5: 
</P>
<P>
"When God created Leona, the world received no favors. Without the veil of 
Harry Helmsley, you would be a nonentity. You would not be able to randomly 
fire and abuse people in order to make yourself happy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last number of years I have watched as you have virtually destroyed 
my friend, and a once-great and respected man, Harry Helmsley." 
</P>
<P>
Leona Helmsley, who styles herself "The Queen" in ads for Helmsley hotels, and 
her husband, Harry, are awaiting trial on tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
She cited the pending criminal case in declining to comment on Trump's letter, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
It said Trump would not elaborate on his attack, other than to add: "She's a 
disgrace to the industry and a disgrace to humanity in general." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that its source said Leona Helmsley has refused to 
transfer to Trump the lease on a small parcel amid other property in Atlantic 
City recently bought by Trump.

breaking five ribs and his collarbone, officials said.

When asked about Steinbrenner's reaction to the fall, King replied, "He wanted 
to know what I was doing in a tree house."

Steve Carlton, a four-time Cy Young Award winner who is second on baseball's 
all-time strikeout list, today announced he is finished as a player after 
repeated comeback attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old left-hander, who was released a year ago by Minnesota after 
allowing 18 earned runs in 10 innings, had surgery for removal of eight chips 
from his left shoulder last September. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm hasn't rehabilitated the way I had hoped," Carlton said in a statement 
issued by the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he recorded 241 of his 329 
career wins. "I'm still experiencing some pain and I've decided I no longer 
would be active as a player."
