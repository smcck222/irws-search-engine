A crudely painted sign on a wall points the way. "SPID," it says, indicating 
the direction past the rusting metal turnstile along a dirt path to a rundown 
clinic in central Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Three patients sit inside. Misha, who is his 30s and appears healthy, is 
looking at a television set balanced precariously on a stool. In another room, 
Valerie, a blonde prostitute, is bedridden, barely able to speak. On the next 
cot sits Ira, a lively redhead who contracted "the disease" from a lover from 
Sierra Leone six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All are suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I read about SPID just last year," Ira says, using the Russian acronym for 
AIDS. "I got frightened, so I decided to come have a test. It would have been 
much better if we had known more about this earlier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treatment Effort Started 
</P>
<P>
After years of officially dismissing AIDS as a disease of the corrupted West, 
the Soviet Union is now acknowledging its presence here and, with a palpable 
sense of urgency, has begun a massive education and treatment effort to try to 
make up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet health minister has likened the AIDS threat to that posed by nuclear 
weapons. Film makers are producing graphic and horrifying educational 
documentaries that break previous taboos in showing how the disease can be 
transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a striking admission of the problem, health officials in Leningrad 
opened a clinic just this month to conduct AIDS tests and provide physical and 
psychological treatment for AIDS patients. Clinic doctors, in their first 
interview with a Western journalist, said the hospital was needed because the 
number of AIDS cases in the country is vastly underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift Stirs Apprehension 
</P>
<P>
The decision to acknowledge the existence of AIDS, or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, in the Soviet Union has awakened a deep apprehension and 
even alarm among some in a population indoctrinated to believe the disease was 
a horror of capitalism that would pass them by. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, hundreds wait in line each day for the anonymous blood tests 
offered at the new clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic doctors are walking a narrow line, trying to encourage awareness 
while at the same time seeking to control panic. 
</P>
<P>
At times, panic seems to be winning. 
</P>
<P>
One frightened woman who visited the clinic confessed that she no longer takes 
the subway, where she believes the virus can travel like wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, a man rushed in one day, insisting on being tested because 
he was convinced he had contracted the disease during a fistfight that drew 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is a hard-core group of about 50 people who return repeatedly 
for blood tests to make sure they have not, somehow, caught this foreign and 
fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a long time speaking to them," said Dr. Alexander Kolmakov, director 
of the clinic. "We explain the ways of transmission and tell them they don't 
need to come every week. But they don't listen." 
</P>
<P>
"There is an epidemic of fear about the disease," Soviet AIDS expert Vadim 
Pokrovsky told the daily newspaper Country Life this week. "Hundreds and 
thousands of terrified people come to us saying they have diagnosed themselves 
as suffering from AIDS. Some stop visiting saunas and swimming pools and are 
afraid of foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
Assembling a team of doctors for the clinic was even a bit of a problem, 
because information about AIDS had been so suppressed that even some educated 
Soviets thought the disease could be transmitted through a sweaty handshake. 
</P>
<P>
"Some doctors refused to work with us, and almost everyone had a natural fear. 
But we have worked to overcome it," said Dr. Aza Rachmanov, who is responsible 
for supervising the physical and psychological care of the three patients 
currently in the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Dose of Fear 
</P>
<P>
The Leningrad doctors strongly believe a healthy dose of fear, if properly 
channeled into an awareness of dangers of the disease, is preferable to the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not afraid of panic -- no, on the contrary, we are afraid of a lack of 
concern, of sloppiness in trying to prevent spread of the disease," Rachmanov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of Soviet medical concern over the disease might at first appear 
perplexing. Three Soviet citizens and three foreigners have died here from 
AIDS, according to official reports. A total of 192 Soviet citizens and 378 
foreigners have been officially diagnosed here as carriers of the human 
immunodeficiency virus; the foreigners have all been deported. 
</P>
<P>
This compares to about 142,000 people who have contracted the deadly disease 
worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The global figures are 
believed to be much lower than reality, however, because many countries 
under-report or fail to report cases. In the United States, about 90,990 AIDS 
cases have been reported since the virus, which breaks down the body's immune 
system, was identified in June, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But for many years it took courage to report an AIDS case here because of the 
belief that it was politically unwise. Consequently, many doctors who 
discovered an AIDS case apparently kept the diagnosis locked in their files. In 
addition, many AIDS patients, told they were suffering from other diseases, 
unwittingly transferred the virus to others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Times More Victims 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 100 times as many Soviets may have the disease as is officially 
acknowledged, doctors privately conceded in recent interviews at the Leningrad 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Soviet citizens carrying the virus are either homosexual men or 
prostitutes, according to Soviet specialists. So far, none are drug users, the 
specialists say, but a number of AIDS sufferers have contracted the virus from 
medical use of unsterilized needles. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, according to a recent report in the Communist Party newspaper 
Pravda, some medical experts believe the country could have an astonishing 15 
million carriers of the disease -- a figure that, if accurate, would be 10 
times the number estimated in the United States. About 200,000 people would 
have full-blown AIDS or already have died of the disease, according to the 
report, which has been seriously questioned by a number of authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago, some noted epidemiologists reported with certainty that this 
new 20th Century plague would pass us by," the government daily Izvestia 
commented recently. "But the rapidly increasing number of Soviet cases shows 
AIDS is not somewhere 'over there, in their country.' It is here, among our 
population." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, Pokrovsky, who now refers to the "epidemic of fear," said 
AIDS was not a serious problem for the Soviet Union because "the moral stands 
in our society are higher than, for example, in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
That same year, official Soviet news media, in what the State Department called 
a disinformation campaign, were claiming that the CIA had genetically 
engineered AIDS while experimenting with biological weapons at a laboratory in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet doctors now sharply repudiate those earlier official views. 
</P>
<P>
"You write for a newspaper in Los Angeles? Then it is very important that you 
tell your readers something," said Dr. Andrei P. Kozlov, director of the AIDS 
clinic laboratory, leaning close to make his point. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet scientists never supported the idea that this virus was created in the 
United States," Kozlov said. "It is necessary for the Americans to know we were 
not responsible for this stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Kozlov was the first doctor to publicly identify an AIDS case in the Soviet 
Union, two years ago, and the first to list AIDS as a cause of the death of a 
Soviet citizen, just six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt Leningrad really had the first AIDS death. We were just brave enough 
to declare it," Kozlov said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kozlov's lab, part of the clinic located in Leningrad's Hospital No. 30, 
performs up to 1,500 anonymous blood tests daily. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the lab, the clinic consists of a wing in the hospital set aside for 
AIDS patients. The facility appears sparse by American standards, with few 
furnishings and no attempt at cheer. But compared to dirty hospitals ridden 
with roaches and mice that have been described in the official Soviet media, 
the clinic is a gigantic step forward for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The team of doctors includes a dentist to treat AIDS patients and a 
pediatrician, because one of the city's AIDS patients is a child. The doctors 
do their best to counsel the patients, but a psychiatrist is not included on 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the best of intentions, however, the Soviet Union still has some 
basic problems in trying to combat spread of the disease -- severe shortages of 
both condoms and disposable needles. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets growing ever more concerned about AIDS have written to newspapers 
complaining about the lack of condoms. The Health Ministry newspaper Medical 
Gazette recently reported that some desperate couples had turned to using 
children's balloons. 
</P>
<P>
As for syringes, Alexander I. Kondrusev, a deputy health minister, told 
reporters at a recent briefing that the country produced just 30 million 
disposable syringes last year, while health workers dispensed 3 billion 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
The need for disposable syringes was dramatically illustrated by a case earlier 
this year in Elista, near the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
At a city maternity hospital, 49 people, most of them children, contracted 
AIDS, apparently because of ignorant reuse of an unsterilized needle. The case 
horrified many and apparently gave fresh impetus to plans to open the Leningrad 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be taught here in the Soviet Union that since we were decent 
people, we could not get AIDS," Kolmakov said. "Now we know the truth -- anyone 
can get the disease, Communist or capitalist, Soviet or American."

THOUSANDS JOIN BEIJING MARCH FOR DEMOCRACY

<P>
Tens of thousands of students demonstrated in central Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square today in a dramatic public rejection by China's elite youth of Communist 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators finally dispersed peacefully after an intense confrontation 
with authorities early this afternoon, when about 15,000 students, surrounded 
by a sympathetic crowd of another 15,000 onlookers, stood before the Great Hall 
of the People screaming slogans for democracy and demanding that Premier Li 
Peng come out to hear their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The front line of protesters became unruly at about 1 o'clock and pressed into 
a line of about 4,000 police separating them from the government hall, where 
the country's top leaders had just conducted a memorial service for former 
party head Hu Yaobang. The police responded with a counterthrust, sending 
thousands of students scrambling back for safety. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, student leaders decided to withdraw from the square. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday evening, at least 20,000 to 30,000 students -- some estimates ran 
as high as 80,000 -- had marched to the square in a miles-long procession from 
university campuses in northwestern Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The marching column of students, chanting, "Long live democracy," were greeted 
upon their post-midnight arrival by another crowd of about 30,000 cheering 
supporters already at the square or lining the street approaching it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, there had been even more people in the area, perhaps as many as 
100,000. But as much as half of that crowd was composed of bystanders and the 
curious, although they seemed sympathetic to the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The brief clash this afternoon came moments after three student representatives 
had spent 15 minutes kneeling on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, 
with one of them raising above his head a yard-wide rolled scroll petition 
listing student demands. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the crowd said the demands included better pay for intellectuals, 
greater attention to development of science, press freedom, repudiation of 
anti-liberal political campaigns, public release of the salaries and wealth of 
high officials, and accurate reporting in the official media about their own 
protest movement. They also demanded that Hu -- who was dismissed two years ago 
from his post as Communist Party general secretary for failing to put down 
student protests -- be re-evaluated and credited with contributions to 
democratic reform in China. 
</P>
<P>
A student explained that the style of presenting the petition carried strong 
symbolic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how petitions were presented to emperors," he said. "What era is this? 
We still have to use this method! It means we have no freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Friday, protesters repeatedly sang China's national anthem and the 
revolutionary socialist hymn, "The Internationale," both of which call for 
revolutionary action in strong language. 
</P>
<P>
The students also carried banners calling for freedom of the press and 
demanding that civil liberties enshrined in China's constitution be granted in 
practice. Banners and chants criticized the police for allegedly using force in 
breaking up a demonstration early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organizers Keep Order 
</P>
<P>
It took more than two hours after the midnight arrival of the head of the 
procession for the entire column to file into the square, where student 
organizers kept order among the crowd and directed a sit-down demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Students marched in university groups, and it appeared that at least two dozen 
schools, including a few from other cities, were represented. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who drove through streets near the square saw dozens of army and 
police trucks bring at least 2,000 troops or police to the area before dawn. A 
thin line of soldiers stood guard before the Great Hall of the People on the 
west side of the square, but the security forces took no immediate action 
against the students. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hours before dawn, however, many expected the police to try to 
clear the square. 
</P>
<P>
This was partly because during the predawn hours Wednesday and Thursday, police 
forcibly cleared thousands of protesters from a major thoroughfare in central 
Beijing near Zhongnanhai, a compound that houses the headquarters of the 
Communist Party and government. At least a few students were roughed up by 
police in the second of these incidents, and many banners complained about 
this. 
</P>
<P>
Hu, who died of a heart attack April 15 at the age of 73, was widely viewed as 
the most liberal of China's leaders. As such, he enjoyed great popularity among 
intellectuals. The demonstrations of the past week have nominally been in his 
honor, but it was clear that for many students his death was an excuse to 
justify pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
During the night, students sat or stood in groups, discussing political issues 
or singing. A series of speakers climbed onto the Monument to the People's 
Heroes, bedecked with wreaths and a photo of Hu. Among them was Ren Wanding, an 
activist in the 1978 "Democracy Wall" movement who served prison time as 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"People are praying for the awakening of a legal system," Ren said. "This is a 
historical necessity. Democracy Wall lives again!" 
</P>
<P>
In 1978 and early 1979, authorities allowed a brick wall several blocks west of 
Tian An Men to be plastered with political writings and wall posters. This 
unaccustomed freedom of expression, not long after the repressive era of the 
Cultural Revolution, drew daily crowds of readers and became known as the 
Democracy Wall. In a later crackdown by authorities, the writings were banned. 
</P>
<P>
Some dissidents Friday voiced rare public criticism of China's paramount 
leader, Deng Xiaoping, who has masterminded a decade of generally successful 
economic reforms but who has refused to allow major political liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leader is old," one speaker told the crowd. "Maybe he is crazy. Many 
people hope he will die." 
</P>
<P>
One of the hundreds of student organizers in the square said in a brief 
interview that one purpose of the demonstration is to push Deng from power.

MEDICAL FIELD DEFENDS USE OF ANIMALS IN LAB 
</P>

<P>
Facing growing protests over the use of animals in biomedical research, a group 
of medical school deans, research scientists, patient advocacy groups and two 
Cabinet officers banded together for the first time Friday to defend the 
controversial practice. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of a weeklong series of animal rights protests, Health and Human 
Resources Secretary Louis W. Sullivan and National Drug Policy Director William 
J. Bennett lent their official support to beleaguered medical researchers 
facing physical and verbal attacks, cuts in funding and increased costs for 
security and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crucial' for Research 
</P>
<P>
In statements released at a press conference here, Sullivan said that the use 
of laboratory animals was "crucial" for research on life-threatening illnesses, 
including AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Bennett called such research an 
"indispensable part of our work against drug addiction." 
</P>
<P>
The high-powered offensive by the government and medical establishment, 
including the American Medical Assn., indicated the growing influence of more 
than 200 so-called "animal rights" groups, which oppose, sometimes violently, 
the traditional use of rats, dogs, monkeys and other animals for biomedical 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress gets more letters on animal rights than on any other issue," said Dr. 
Frederick K. Goodwin, administrator of the U.S. Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental 
Health Administration, who defended the use of lab animals. 
</P>
<P>
Animal rights groups have scheduled 300 demonstrations and rallies next week at 
universities, private research centers and government institutions in New York, 
Washington, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Sacramento and other cities to mark 
"Animal Liberation Week" and the 10th anniversary of their movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to end the war on animals in laboratories nationwide," said Ginger 
Redmon, a spokeswoman for In Defense of Animals, one of the coordinating 
groups. The groups also generally oppose wearing furs, raising animals in 
"factory farms," killing strays and what they call the "exploitation" of 
animals in other forms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A War of Sorts 
</P>
<P>
Movement radicals have launched their own war of sorts. Boasting of their 70th 
"action" for animal rights, an underground group called the Animal Liberation 
Front claimed responsibility for two arson fires earlier this month that caused 
more than $150,000 damage at a University of Arizona lab in Tucson. Officials 
said the group also took 1,200 animals, including 30 mice infected with a 
disease potentially fatal to humans. 
</P>
<P>
In Norwalk, Conn., a former schoolteacher awaits trial on charges of attempted 
murder for allegedly trying to bomb a company that uses dogs for surgical 
training. Other activists destroyed a $3.5-million animal diagnostic lab at UC 
Davis in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Regina Gavin, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania-based Trans-Species Unlimited, 
one of the most active animal rights groups, said in a phone interview that her 
organization does not support such violence. "But we understand the motivation 
behind it," she said. "Frankly, I don't shed a tear when I hear a lab has been 
broken into." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Peril to Mankind 
</P>
<P>
Scientists credit research on animals for developing vaccines against polio and 
measles, treatment against leukemia and lymphoma and new procedures in 
everything from cataracts to heart surgery. But Gavin said such research was 
"dangerous to mankind." 
</P>
<P>
"It is dangerous to extrapolate data from animals to human beings," she said. 
Before animals were used for research, she added, "centuries ago, we were going 
along at a good rate. When we began to test animals, we may have set things 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Her group will lead a protest Saturday in lower Manhattan against New York 
University associate professor Ronald W. Wood, a psychologist who uses rats and 
eight long-tailed macaques to study the toxicity and other effects of inhaling 
crack cocaine. He also uses the animals to study the effects of toluene, an 
addictive compound found in glue, paint thinner, solvents and other common 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin called the research a "total waste of taxpayers' money as well as 
ethically wrong." But at the press conference at the NYU School of Medicine, 
Dr. Wood won warm tributes from a panel of federal officials, a representative 
of the American Medical Assn. and an association of 14 New York medical 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Called Baseless 
</P>
<P>
"We will not sacrifice Dr. Wood's work, or the work of any other scientist that 
has passed our rigorous review process, to the baseless demands of any animal 
rights group," said Charles R. Schuster, director of the National Institute of 
Drug Abuse. He accused Trans-Species of using "misinformation, distortion and 
outright fabrication" in its campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He and other officials said they are publicly supporting Wood because Cornell 
University capitulated to protests by Trans-Species last year by forcing a 
prominent pharmacologist, Michiko Okamoto, to return a three-year federal grant 
of $530,000 for drug-addiction experiments on cats. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists said that scientists are now forced to spend 30% of their research 
money to improve security and meet new federal regulations on the care and 
treatment of lab animals. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, young scientists and doctors are turning away from needed medical 
research "in response to pressure and propaganda from animal activists," said 
Dr. Russell H. Patterson Jr., head of the AMA's council on ethical and judicial 
affairs. He accused the activists of "infiltrating our schools and influencing 
our children" to further their goals. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to counter the use of heart-rending photos and stories by animal rights 
groups, the panel presented a 12-year-old girl from Berwyn, Pa., wearing braces 
and a pink dress, whose life apparently was saved by animal research. 
</P>
<P>
In a calm voice, Virginia Black said that her daughter, Barbara, was born with 
fluid on the brain and endured years of pain, vomiting and seizures despite 
more than a dozen operations. "Our other daughter would ask, 'Mommy, is Barbara 
going to die?' " Mrs. Black said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the family finally met Dr. Fred Epstein, a New York neurosurgeon who 
was using cats to study pressure on the brain. After he performed surgery to 
expand Barbara's cranial cavity, she now enjoys a normal life as a 6th grader, 
riding her bike and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that I have saved children who would not have survived were 
it not for animal studies," Dr. Epstein said.

LITTLE HELP FOR SOUTHLAND SEEN IN U.S. HOUSING BILLS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of neglect, Congress this year is taking up the plight of young 
families looking for affordable homes to buy. But in Los Angeles and especially 
in Orange County, where the median home resale price is now more than $237,000, 
would-be buyers had better not start packing the family china. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a spit in the bucket, what they're talking about in 
Washington," said Southern California home builder Nathan Shappell. "Out here, 
it's too little, too late." 
</P>
<P>
From Washington's point of view, the ideas under consideration are sweeping. 
One bill would create a $4-billion fund to subsidize mortgages for first-time 
buyers. Another would allow families to tap their individual retirement 
accounts for down payments. A third proposal would increase the size of a 
mortgage that could be insured by federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of new legislation signals a determination by Congress to get back 
into the housing business after eight years of relative inactivity under the 
Administration of Ronald Reagan. Many lawmakers believe there is a very good 
chance that major housing relief will be enacted this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Young families increasingly find their dreams of home ownership fading beyond 
reach," said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who with 25 other sponsors has 
introduced an ambitious $15-billion package to spur production of affordable 
housing. "The goal is to provide more housing within the financial reach of the 
average-income American, and to ensure that the needs of low-income families 
are also met." 
</P>
<P>
However, like many plans Congress devises to address widespread social 
problems, these proposals are tailored to help the greatest number of needy 
people nationwide, rather than the most extreme cases in specific geographical 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Southern California, its housing predicament is extreme. A 
cross-section of experts said that Cranston's bill and the other proposals 
would help no more than a handful of residents buy homes in the area's 
overheated real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
They cite a spiraling cost of land unmatched in virtually any other area of the 
country, rising interest rates and the inability of many families to come up 
with the huge down payments needed for even modest accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Financial Burdens 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that are problems related to the control of growth, population increases 
and the difficulty of placing jobs and affordable homes near each other. Given 
these trends, many young Southern California families will continue to face the 
prospect of being long-term renters or, if they can buy, assuming heavy 
financial burdens for only minimal quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Housing analysts have reserved judgment, however, on the other sections of 
Cranston's proposal, which would provide $3.1 billion to local governments for 
construction of affordable rental units and increase subsidies to build 
low-cost public housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress may get a lot of mileage out of these new housing bills, and they 
might have a strong impact in places like the Midwest, where homes are not so 
expensive," said Matt Disston, an Orange County real estate economist. "But out 
here, the (home ownership) problem may just be too great for any effective 
federal solution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politically Impossible 
</P>
<P>
Were lawmakers to offer the kind of extensive relief Southern California needs, 
officials say, it would probably be prohibitively expensive and politically 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"With limited funds, you have to ask where the housing dollars will go," said 
Bob Erlenbush, a Los Angeles-area housing activist. "Should somebody who wants 
a $200,000 home get federal aid? In this area, that kind of assistance could 
cost a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
And even that might not be enough. More than any other area, except perhaps New 
York's Manhattan, Southern California seems to provide the starkest 
illustration of the housing crunch facing first-time buyers. Fueled by a 
vibrant economy and a seemingly insatiable demand for single-family homes, the 
real estate market has gone haywire. 
</P>
<P>
Small, two-bedroom homes that would sell for less than $100,000 in most other 
parts of the country are priced at $350,000 or more in West Los Angeles. In 
Orange County, homes that cost $30,000 less than 15 years ago are now fetching 
$400,000. The median price for new homes and condominiums there last month was 
$225,000 and for resold units it was more than $237,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the income of Southern Californians has not been rising at 
even close to that pace. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of people who can afford to buy their first home has 
been declining steadily in recent years, according to several surveys. A recent 
study by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a national accounting firm, indicated 
that only 37% of U.S. households can qualify for loans to buy homes. Of the 32 
markets surveyed, the two areas with the lowest number of people able to buy a 
home were Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As the cost of shelter rises, couples who once planned on acquiring housing are 
facing difficult choices. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of a home in Los Angeles is depressing, because unless you're 
extremely affluent or you already own a house, your chances of buying a home 
are slim," said Paula Kruger, 25, who is a marketing specialist with the UCLA 
Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's even difficult to find an affordable apartment in the West Los Angeles 
area," she added. "I grew up around here, but I've been priced out of my own 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thinking of Moving 
</P>
<P>
Kruger, a college graduate who earns $25,000 yearly, now lives at home with her 
parents while she and her boyfriend save money for an apartment or home. The 
couple are thinking about moving to another state, such as North Carolina, 
where the average price of a new home is about $73,000. 
</P>
<P>
For all those who think about leaving California, however, thousands more are 
arriving each week, squeezing the housing supply further and forcing up prices 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
Migration reached a post-World War II high last year, with more than 370,000 
people moving to the state. The vast majority of these new arrivals come to 
take advantage of the better jobs California's economy offers. But many are 
stunned by what they must pay for housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great many families that relocate here from oil-depressed areas, 
like Houston and Dallas, and they're in for a rude awakening when they get 
here," said Disston. "They land a better-paying job, but then they find that, 
after they've sold their other homes, they can't even afford a down payment." 
</P>
<P>
It is for such families -- and people like Kruger -- that many of the current 
congressional housing initiatives were intended. 
</P>
<P>
In one proposal, authored by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the government 
would create a $4-billion national trust fund to help first-time home buyers. 
These funds would subsidize mortgages and help lower interest rates, now at 10% 
to 11%, to no more than 6% for the life of a loan. However, they could not be 
used for mortgages that exceeded $104,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice idea for other parts of the country, but it doesn't mean 
anything for the heavy growth areas of Los Angeles and Orange County," said Dan 
Garcia, an attorney and former president of the Los Angeles City Planning 
Commission. "I can't think of much housing to which this might apply, because 
the cost is so high here." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia noted that housing costs are lower in outlying communities such as 
Riverside and San Bernardino. But he said those affordable places "might as 
well be in Outer Mongolia, because they're miles away from where the majority 
of jobs are in this area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face Long Commutes 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of placing jobs and affordable housing in the same area is one 
of the most vexing problems facing Southern California. While developers can 
build lower-cost homes in a community 70 miles from Los Angeles or Orange 
County, new owners face lengthy commutes on badly congested freeways to reach 
their jobs, further aggravating the area's already severe transportation 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a solution, you could be jeopardizing the long-term viability of the 
whole area," said Nelson Rising, a Santa Monica-based developer and member of a 
Los Angeles task force on affordable housing. "Out here, the problem is the 
high cost of land and the demand for shelter. I don't know what the federal 
government can do to solve that problem." 
</P>
<P>
One solution, proposed in Cranston's bill, would make it easier for first-time 
buyers to come up with down payments. People who had not purchased a home in 
the previous three years could use $10,000 of the money in an IRA or 401k 
account for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to be said for this approach, because anything that helps a 
young family get over the margin and into a home is valuable," said Michael 
Meyer, managing partner of the Orange County office of Leventhal &amp; Co. "The 
down payment is often the most crucial barrier of all, and I can't think of a 
better investment for this kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
However, some experts question how much difference this would make in Southern 
California, where 15% and 20% down payments are common on homes and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say someone manages to save $10,000 in an IRA account," said Shappell. 
"In the time they've saved the money, the price of a house will have gone up 
more in cost than $10,000. They've fallen behind, because the market is simply 
out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that first-time buyers are shut out of the market by high down 
payments, Cranston's bill goes one step further: It would greatly expand the 
size of mortgages that are insured by the government under the Federal Home 
Administration program. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, FHA covers mortgages up to $101,000 nationally. Under the program, 
the government helps eligible buyers acquire homes with low down payments by 
fully insuring the mortgages provided by banks and other lenders. In the event 
of a default, the government is eligible for the balance of the unpaid loan. 
</P>
<P>
The FHA program enabled hundreds of thousands of Americans to acquire their 
first homes after World War II, often for down payments as low as $100. But 
Cranston said the program needs to be updated, to reflect the higher cost of 
housing in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
Under his bill, FHA could cover mortgages up to 95% of a state's median home 
sales price. Last year, the average California resale price was about $150,000. 
But, in a key provision, the secretary of housing and urban development could 
approve even higher mortgage ceilings for regions such as Southern California, 
where housing prices are greater than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3% Down Payments 
</P>
<P>
Also, the revamped FHA program would reduce down payments to 3% of the full 
amount of the mortgage for first-time home buyers who complete what sponsors 
call "an approved financial counseling program." 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely a move in the right direction," said Peter Morrison, who 
directs the RAND Corp.'s Population Research Center in Santa Monica. "The 
problems out here are in the high-priced areas, and that's what this would 
target." 
</P>
<P>
But even with these inducements, supporters of the Cranston bill concede that 
many first-time home buyers will have a hard time breaking into the Southern 
California market. 
</P>
<P>
Three percent of a six-figure price is still a hefty sum. And the monthly house 
payments on the remaining amount -- up to 97% of the home's cost -- could be 
huge. 
</P>
<P>
With the gap between housing prices and what many families can afford to pay 
widening every year, no amount of tinkering with down payment provisions may 
ease the problem for many people, conceded Gary Squier, Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley's housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"To get people into the Los Angeles ownership market is going to cost money, 
because here the gap is so enormous," he noted. "Only 17% of Los Angeles-area 
households can afford to buy the average-priced home. The rising cost of 
housing makes it very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Squier explained that a family earning the county median of $35,000 a year 
could, under normal circumstances, qualify for a $130,000 mortgage. However, 
the median Los Angeles house price in the latest reporting period was $198,655, 
according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap is $30,000 to $35,000," Squier said. "Where is that going to come 
from? I don't know if the federal government can afford to subsidize homes at 
$30,000 a pop." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aiding $90,000 Families 
</P>
<P>
Still others question the wisdom of providing FHA assistance to middle-income 
buyers. If the mortgage ceiling in Los Angeles or Orange County rose to include 
$200,000 homes, for example, the government might be subsidizing families that 
earn $90,000 a year, according to Steven Doehler, vice president of the 
Mortgage Insurance Companies of America. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be significantly increasing the pool of buyers and it will become more 
of a seller's market," he said. "That will increase prices up and down the 
board. It makes things even harder for the guy earning $40,000. He's pushed 
even farther away from home ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Given these barriers, what can the federal government do to help first-time 
buyers in Southern California? Many experts say that Congress should try to cut 
the costs of home ownership, but only in concert with state and local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Housing Needed 
</P>
<P>
Rising said, for example, that it makes little sense to provide increased funds 
for home buyers if there is not a simultaneous push to increase the supply of 
affordable single-family homes and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"By simply putting more money in people's pockets, you'll be increasing demand 
and driving up prices even more," he noted. "We just don't have enough housing 
to meet the demand." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some say the federal government should condition the availability of 
funds on regional efforts to increase the housing supply, especially in 
low-density areas. But others say that building more homes in crowded areas is 
not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California "may have to come to terms with some unpleasant realities, 
that it can't keep growing forever," said one member of the Los Angeles City 
Council, who asked not to be identified. It may be necessary for other areas to 
experience additional growth, instead of densely populated areas such as Los 
Angeles and Orange County, the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, no short-term solutions are on the horizon, at least in the 
federal government. And Southern Californians may have to accept the unpleasant 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"We're becoming a nation of housing haves and have-nots," said H. James Brown, 
who directs the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. "Increasingly, the 
whole issue of whether you've made it in this society seems to focus on 
housing. And home ownership is slipping away from thousands of people each 
year."

ARABS, JEWS FIRED UP OVER SACRED SITES;

<TEXT>
<P>
The question of access to a major site holy to both Islam and Judaism following 
Arab disturbances there has awakened the potentially explosive question of who 
has the rightful claim to it. 
</P>
<P>
To Muslims, the area is known as the Haram al Sharif, the Sacred Enclosure, 
home to Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock -- shrines so holy to Muslims 
that to die in their defense would earn a believer a direct trip to Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
To Jews, it is the Temple Mount, site of the last Jewish Temple destroyed by 
the Romans more than 1,900 years ago. When Jewish worshipers pray at the 
adjacent Western Wall, they are expressing devotion to the Temple Mount: The 
Wall, all that remains of the temple, is a remnant of a retaining structure at 
the base of the Temple Mount plateau, located in Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restricted Access 
</P>
<P>
Since a riot at the Al Aqsa mosque on April 7, Israeli police have restricted 
access of youths and Muslims from outside Jerusalem. Police say the measures 
have been taken only in response to the unrest and are not designed to restrict 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, police blocked roads from the West Bank into Jerusalem and turned 
away hundreds of young men traveling to the city. Palestinians who tried to 
enter the Old City were also turned away if they were either from the West Bank 
or Gaza Strip or were in their 20s or early 30s. About 7,000 worshiped at the 
Al Aqsa mosque. No trouble occurred, although Jewish protesters carrying 
sub-machine guns demonstrated at the Western Wall to assert their right as Jews 
to what they consider their land. 
</P>
<P>
Despite police assurances, Muslim caretakers of the Haram al Sharif suspect 
that Israeli authorities are plotting a takeover of the coveted plateau on the 
Old City's south side. 
</P>
<P>
"Never, never have there been such restrictions," said Sheik Mohammed Jamal, 
who leads prayer services at the mosque and who is a primary caretaker of the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Jamal defended Arab demonstrations within the compound as the right of 
Muslims "in their home to say what they please." 
</P>
<P>
"If the Israelis tried to take even one centimeter of this place from us, I 
would be the first to die to protect it," he advised, raising his hand as if 
taking an oath. 
</P>
<P>
Some religious Jews counter that it is they, not the Muslims, who have a 
complaint. Jewish worshipers are barred from the site in a policy dating back 
to 1967, when Israel captured East Jerusalem and the Old City from Jordan in 
the Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders thought it would be too upsetting to let Jews pray there," 
recalled Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who was then the chief rabbi of the army and has 
served as a chief rabbi of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"So what did we liberate? This is a Jewish state, and yet they have turned over 
the holy of holies to the Arabs!" he exclaimed. "Unbelievable!" 
</P>
<P>
Goren is trying to organize a prayer session on the Temple Mount, but it is far 
from clear whether his followers would risk it -- or the government tolerate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil three Fridays ago and the emotions subsequently released show why. 
Following prayer services marking the beginning of Ramadan, a holy month of 
fasting, Muslim worshipers unfurled Palestinian flags. 
</P>
<P>
Police intervened and rocks flew, followed by bullets and tear gas. Some of the 
rocks were hurled at Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall below, injuring 
three and scattering the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis protested angrily that their prayer site had been made unsafe by the 
potential for protests above. Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, a Cabinet minister, warned 
that "no dirty Arab will stop us from moving about freely and safely in our own 
land." He later apologized for the intemperate reference to Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Emotions on Both Sides 
</P>
<P>
Such raw outpourings of emotion come from the strong bond between religion and 
nationality that exists in the Middle East, observers say. For Jews, the Muslim 
dominance of the Temple Mount recalls ancient defeats and exile. 
</P>
<P>
"On one level, it's humiliating for Jews to see the triumphalism symbolized by 
the mosque standing on what one considers his own," said David Hartman, an 
Orthodox rabbi and head of the Shalom Hartman Institute, which is dedicated to 
religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "we have to get away from the scarcity principle, and get away 
from the idea that there is limited geography for our religions." 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Jamal carried the idea of Islamic dominance a step further. Brushing 
aside notions that the police could actually keep Muslims from praying, or even 
protesting, by barring them from the mosque, he said, "To us, all of Jerusalem 
is a mosque." 
</P>
<P>
Haram al Sharif is the place where Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed 
ascended to heaven on his horse. The natural stone platform from where he 
ascended is encased in the gold-topped Dome of the Rock, one of the primary 
places of Muslim pilgrimage. Many Jews believe that Al Aqsa mosque was built 
over the altar of the Jewish Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim suspicions of a Jewish plot to take over the park-like complex have been 
fed in recent years by an increase in Jewish demands for access to the mount 
and by efforts of Jewish extremists to blow up the Dome of the Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Even archeological digs are viewed with extreme skepticism. Israeli researchers 
once opened a tunnel beneath the compound, but Muslims sealed it up for fear 
that the Jews were trying to conquer the place from below. 
</P>
<P>
The imam is, in any case, sure that Allah will eventually take care of the 
question himself. "Allah will clean the land," Jamal vowed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Gate to Heaven' 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Goren is equally confident that God is on his side. "To us, the Temple 
Mount is the gate to Heaven," he said. "Why else have we come here other than 
to return to the Temple Mount?" 
</P>
<P>
While Goren claims to be willing to settle for access only to a remote part of 
the large compound and pray under open skies, Arabs are likely to suspect 
ulterior motives. In the recent past, apparently small steps to establish a 
Jewish presence in predominantly Arab places have resulted in Jewish expansion 
and deep Arab resentment. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 years ago, a group led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger set up residence on 
property near the West Bank city of Hebron, a center of Muslim fundamentalism 
that is also the site of the tomb of Abraham, the patriarch revered by Jews and 
Muslims alike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spawned Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Levinger's brash act became the seed for the settlement of Kiryat Arba and 
another step in support of the biblical claim to the West Bank that is now a 
part of official government policy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a small minority of Israelis who believe that the solution to the 
question of access to the Temple Mount is the expulsion of the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, who is the owner and who is the guest? You can make a 
compromise on anything but religion," mused Rabbi Nachman Kahane, who runs an 
institute dedicated to the revival of the temple in place of the Muslim 
shrines. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the temple will be established on the Temple Mount in my 
lifetime. The only question is: How long will I live?" he said, half in jest. 
"Changing the 'mosque' to 'Moscowitz' is not that easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother of Militant 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, brother of Rabbi Meir Kahane, a militant right-wing nationalist, has 
set up a small synagogue in the midst of an Arab neighborhood in the Old City, 
just down the street from Sheik Jamal's office near Al Aqsa. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane moved into an old synagogue that had been occupied by two Arab families 
for many years after Jews fled the neighborhood following clashes 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The return to the synagogue seven years ago coincided with efforts of 
right-wing Israelis to expand the presence of Jews in the Old City, which for 
several decades has been dominated by Muslim Arabs. Ariel Sharon, current 
industry minister and a controversial former defense minister, owns a house on 
the same street as the synagogue. Arab attackers have on several occasions 
hurled firebombs at Sharon's home; they consider the new tenants the vanguard 
of an effort to outflank Arabs on the approach to the mosque complex. 
</P>
<P>
At his synagogue, Kahane keeps computerized lists of potential volunteers to 
eventually serve as priests at the temple according to the ancient tradition. 
For them, he offers a course in Advanced Sacrificial Studies. 
</P>
<P>
In a museum in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, Kahane also maintains 
replicas of vessels once used during temple rituals. A videotape explains that 
"it is only a matter of time before the goal is achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Safe Jewish access to the Western Wall is not enough, Kahane added, because the 
wall is but the remains of the temple destroyed by the Romans in AD 70. "The 
Western Wall is a symbol of destruction," he explained. "The temple was the 
center of our national life." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, a native of Brooklyn, believes that the founding of Israel 40 years ago 
was not just one of a series of national movements that sprang up in the wake 
of World War II or a secular means of finding a refuge for persecuted Jews, but 
rather a millennial moment in Jewish sacred history. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no mere political event. It was a great religious event," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Frustration 
</P>
<P>
That Israel has not cleared the Temple Mount of the Muslim shrines is a source 
of frustration to Kahane, although understandable to him in practical terms. 
"We are not ready to take on 800 million Muslims," he said. "We have to be 
careful. Our dream is like a small bird. If we hold onto it too tightly, it 
will suffocate. If too loosely, it will fly away." 
</P>
<P>
In the same breath, Kahane says that a way must be found for Muslim and Jew to 
live together. "My best boyhood friend in Brooklyn was an Italian," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While insisting that he has no trouble with Arabs in his neighborhood, he 
nonetheless carries a pistol on his belt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE FAITS COLLIDE -- The Temple Mount, located within the walled Old City of 
Jerusalem, contains sites holy to both Judaism and Islam. The Muslims, who call 
the place Haram al Sharif, worship at Al Aqsa mosque and revere the Dome of the 
Rock as the site from where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to Heaven. To the 
Jews, the Western Wall -- all that remains of the Second Temple -- is their 
holiest place. Elsewhere in the Old City are locations such as the Church of 
the Holy Sepulchre, which make Jerusalem also central to the Christian faith.

Americans in the Philippines were advised Friday to take extra safety 
precautions after suspected Communist guerrillas assassinated a top U.S. 
military adviser in a Manila suburb.

Rowe, 51, a native of McAllen, Tex., was a decorated Vietnam War hero who was 
held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong as a prisoner of war until he 
escaped in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe was chief of the army division at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group 
headquarters in the Manila suburb of Quezon City. The unit provides training 
and logistical support to the Philippine military, which is fighting a 20-year 
Communist insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Claim of Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but Defense Secretary Fidel V. 
Ramos said Philippine officials believe the killers were Communist rebels. He 
noted that the rebels had threatened to attack U.S. targets unless the United 
States closed its bases here and stopped aiding President Corazon Aquino's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said in a statement that he was uncertain about 
the rebels' involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"But should anyone think that killing this brave officer will alter in any way 
(the) U.S. policy of support for Philippine democracy, they are wrong," he 
said. " . . . This act will only strengthen American resolve to stand with the 
government and people of the Philippines led by President Aquino. We will not 
be deterred by terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the killing "a 
cowardly and heinous act. 
</P>
<P>
"Col. Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino people in their efforts 
to defend democracy," Fitzwater said.

The government said Friday that South African forces will be confined to their 
bases in northern Namibia for 60 hours next week so black nationalist 
guerrillas can withdraw to Angola without confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said the security forces will remain at 
their bases from 6 p.m., April 26, until 6 a.m., April 29. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa plans to obtain cassette recordings from Angolan officials in 
which commanders of the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) 
guerrillas order their troops to withdraw, said Defense Minister Magnus Malan. 
The recordings will be broadcast by radio and from loudspeakers on aircraft, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Malan nor Botha said what South Africa would do if insurgents remain in 
Namibia after April 29. Malan said South Africa's response would depend in part 
on whether it suspected that SWAPO had established arms caches in Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan for Independence 
</P>
<P>
South Africa says 1,600 guerrillas crossed from Angola into Namibia beginning 
April 1 in violation of a peace accord that required them to remain at their 
bases in Angola until mid-May. The accord is linked to a U.N. plan to bring 
independence to the territory by April, 1990 after 74 years of South African 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial officials say 289 guerrillas and 27 security forces members have 
been killed in fighting since April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fighting occurred during the first week of April, although three 
insurgents were reported killed Thursday. The bodies of six guerrillas killed 
earlier were found Friday, according to Police Commissioner Dolf Gouws, who 
ordered new searches of all battle sites. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial police said Friday that about 520 guerrillas remained in Namibia, 
indicating that close to 800 guerrillas have withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. forces in northern Namibia have established assembly points where 
guerrillas can report and obtain safe passage to Angola. Only a handful of 
insurgents have reported to the checkpoints, with the others withdrawing on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. troops are acting as a peacekeeping force during the one-year plan to 
conduct free elections leading to Namibia's first independent, black 
majority-ruled government. The plan called for the orderly, unarmed return of 
guerrillas in mid-May from bases in Angola and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO has been fighting for independence since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Botha said the decision to confine South African forces to base was made after 
a meeting Thursday involving officials from South Africa, Angola and Cuba, 
signatories of a regional peace accord last December. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Cuba agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola, where 
they have helped the Marxist government in a war against South African-backed 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three countries agreed that all SWAPO forces should 
return to bases at least 100 miles inside Angola, Botha said. 
</P>
<P>
The three countries are scheduled to meet again next week in Cape Town, along 
with U.S. and Soviet observers.

Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn's banned chronicle of dictator Josef Stalin's labor 
camps, "The Gulag Archipelago," will be published this year by a literary 
journal, a secretary at the magazine said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Selected chapters from the lengthy book will appear before year's end in the 
magazine Novy Mir, the secretary, Valentina Ivanovna, said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
She refused to say who in the Soviet leadership had approved publication of the 
gripping tale of repression under Stalin. Kremlin officials have said such 
works still are off limits. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against the publication of a number of works by Solzhenitsyn, and in the 
first place, such works as 'Lenin in Zurich' and 'The Gulag Archipelago,' " 
Communist Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told reporters in November. 
</P>
<P>
Exposing Soviets to such books would undermine society, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Washington Post on Friday quoted Novy Mir's chief editor, Sergei P. 
Zalygin, as saying that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported publication of 
Solzhenitsyn's works, none of which have appeared in the official press here. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulag is a trilogy that maintains massive political repression began in the 
Soviet Union under founder V.I. Lenin.

Prosecutors from Moscow will head a criminal investigation of a clash between 
nationalist demonstrators and troops in Tbilisi, capital of the Soviet republic 
of Georgia, on April 9 in which 20 civilians died, Tass said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made in a report of a meeting of the Politburo, followed 
accusations that Soviet authorities attempted a cover-up of the incident, 
particularly over the alleged use by troops of poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
"Bodies of the Prosecutor's Office of the Soviet Union will be in charge of 
investigating the criminal case which has been instituted over the events in 
Tbilisi," the official Soviet news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
This was "to ensure the objectivity and thoroughness of the investigation in 
accordance with the law and to provide information systematically to the 
population," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the Politburo, at its regular meeting on Thursday, also urged the 
Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party to investigate the causes of 
the events the clash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.N. Investigation Sought 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, Soviet dissident Eduard Gudava asked President Bush 
to request a U.N. investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gudava, founder of the Helsinki Watch group in Georgia, said that far more were 
killed and wounded by Soviet troops during the demonstration than the 20 dead 
and more than 200 injured reported by the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has not commented on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Official accounts have maintained that troops sent in to break up an all-night 
vigil by thousands of people in front of the government building in Tbilisi 
used maximum restraint and only responded when under attack. 
</P>
<P>
However, Soviet newspapers have charged that troops used poison gas against the 
demonstrators, and a clandestine video film of the events, shown to journalists 
in Moscow on Friday, appeared to show troops attacking without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were killed when the troops, supported by tanks, moved in and 
another four people subsequently died of their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television said 92 patients are still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Georgian film maker Eldar Shengelaya told journalists at the showing of the 
video that he believed Moscow must have given the go-ahead to send in the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision must have come from higher up, although it's not clear where it 
came from," he said. "Members of the (national party's) Central Committee 
cannot but have known about it." 
</P>
<P>
Shengelaya and other speakers at the meeting accused the authorities of 
attempting a massive cover-up of the Tbilisi incident.

REFORMS FAIL TO PRODUCE ECONOMIC GAINS, SENIOR SOVIET OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four years of reforms have failed to bring the dramatic economic improvements 
that the Soviet Union had hoped for, a top Soviet official said Friday, and the 
Communist Party leadership now believes that even bolder changes are urgently 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, the party's secretary for ideology and a member of its 
ruling Politburo, acknowledged in a major review of the country's political and 
economic situation that "until now, no tangible results in meeting the everyday 
needs of the people have been achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Public impatience and disillusionment with the party and with the reform 
process, known as perestroika, were growing, Medvedev said, and this posed a 
threat to the country's political and social stability. 
</P>
<P>
"The people demand that the party should be guiding them more boldly, more 
decisively and more successfully," Medvedev said. 
</P>
<P>
"Great expectations have been aroused, but the situation, due to a combination 
of a number of unfavorable factors, has become more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev's frank review of the political, economic and social situation, 
delivered on behalf of the party leadership on the anniversary of the birth of 
V.I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, reflected both the critical 
self-appraisal now under way within the party and government and the sharper 
struggle to shape future policies. 
</P>
<P>
With the victories of hundreds of ardent reformers, the parliamentary elections 
last month had been "a strong referendum in favor of perestroika," Medvedev 
said, but the defeat of hundreds of party officials across the country was, at 
the same time, "an acute criticism of various aspects of life, serious concern 
regarding the forms and the pace of perestroika and its material and social 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Figures released Friday by the Soviet State Statistics Committee showed that 
wages grew more than twice as fast as productivity in the first quarter of this 
year, further aggravating unsatisfied demand for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai G. Belov, the committee's first deputy chairman, told a press 
conference that the growth in industrial production had slowed, exports had 
declined, imports increased and the overall growth in national income remained 
unchanged at 4% a year. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the rates of growth of the country's gross national product, its 
national income and industrial production were all below the planned targets, 
which themselves were the minimums needed to bring the economy back into 
balance. And, despite recent corrective measures, the basic situation remains 
unchanged, Belov added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Readiness for Decisive Action 
</P>
<P>
With President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sitting behind him in the Palace of 
Congresses in the Kremlin, Medvedev made clear the readiness of the Soviet 
leadership -- at least the majority of the 12 voting Politburo members -- to 
take decisive action on a series of controversial issues, including price 
reform, cutbacks in new construction, further reduction of the bureaucracy, 
expansion of foreign trade, "large but reasonable cuts" in defense spending and 
the introduction of market forces into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The speed and scope of reform is clearly lagging behind the demands of 
(economic and social) development," he said. "Many enterprises, ministries and 
organizations continue to work in the old style. . . . It is clear that we 
cannot go on without further efforts to dismantle this 'braking mechanism.' " 
</P>
<P>
Without going into details, Medvedev suggested that the leadership will seek 
approval from the party's policy-making Central Committee, perhaps at a meeting 
scheduled for Tuesday, for a series of major economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
These would include a redefinition of what constitutes property and ownership 
rights -- a fundamental change for Soviet socialism to allow private enterprise 
-- and the "vigorous use" of market forces within what will remain a planned 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
A central element of these plans, Medvedev said, would make the individual 
"master," whether of the land he farms or the shop he runs or the factory where 
he works, in order to link increased production and efficiency to pay, bonuses 
and a direct economic interest in the success or failure of any undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government is determined to prevent a rapid rise in 
inflation, now usually put at a minimum of 7% a year, and is prepared to cut 
construction projects, defense spending, imports on some goods and the 
bureaucracy in order to maintain a financial balance while increasing the 
supplies of consumer goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Unless runaway inflation is prevented, Medvedev said, the economic reforms will 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be frank -- if we fail to curb the overflow of money, a retreat to 
rationing of goods is unavoidable," he said. "This problem has assumed 
political dimensions now, and its solution should also be political." 
</P>
<P>
Belov, the statistics agency official, described inflation and other economic 
problems as "alarming" and said their resolution was essential before the 
country attempted further reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Average wages jumped 9.4% on an annual basis in the first three months of the 
year, while productivity grew only 4.5%, according to the official figures. The 
production of consumer goods rose by only 5.8%, and that led to a 10.8% 
increase in total savings at banks. 
</P>
<P>
An official report last weekend said that an extra $8 billion had been added to 
the $51 billion set aside for importing consumer goods this year in an effort 
to satisfy this pent-up demand -- and restore the value of the Soviet currency, 
the ruble, in buying products at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet economy is going through a complicated, sometimes contradictory 
process," Belov said. "And it is necessary to control the growth of income so 
that it is in line with the growth of productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev also reviewed political developments, reaffirming the party 
leadership's determination to transform the country into "a law-governed state" 
where legislation enacted by elected representatives will determine policy, not 
declarations by party committees. 
</P>
<P>
But the process of democratization has proven to be contradictory, Medvedev 
said. Many of those with grievances had taken to the streets in anti-government 
protest, he noted, "but none of the accumulated problems can be resolved 
through confrontation or extremism."

3 UNISYS OFFICIALS NAMED IN FRAUD PROBE

<P>
In an apparent indication of the prosecution's next thrust in the massive 
Pentagon fraud investigation, the government released documents Friday 
detailing a scheme involving three previously unnamed executives of the Unisys 
Corp. who allegedly conspired to pay Defense Department officials for 
privileged information. 
</P>
<P>
The documents focus on a Unisys operation in Eagan, Minn., where executives are 
alleged to have paid defense consultants to gather confidential details about a 
$100-million Marine Corps contract. 
</P>
<P>
While the government previously had indicated that Unisys' effort to win the 
lucrative ATAAC communications equipment contract was a subject of the 
corruption probe, the decision to release new details suggests that prosecutors 
may have targeted those involved for the next round of criminal charges. The 
documents were released by the office of U.S. Atty. Henry E. Hudson in 
Alexandria, Va., which is coordinating the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Releasing Documents 
</P>
<P>
The government, which had for the last 10 months fought to block efforts to 
make information about its Minnesota investigation public, has been releasing 
documents about elements of the investigation while preparing to file formal 
charges about them. 
</P>
<P>
The new information, which was also unsealed in Minneapolis federal court, came 
eight days after the government secured the convictions of two Teledyne 
Electronics Inc. executives in a judgment that wrapped up the first round of 
prosecution efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 14 individuals and two corporations convicted in that stage of the 
probe was Jack A. Sherman, a Marine Corps official who admitted that he 
accepted $43,000 from consultants in return for confidential information on the 
ATAAC contract. Another figure convicted was consultant William L. Parkin, 
described as the chief conduit of the information. 
</P>
<P>
The new documents revealed that Sherman, who pleaded guilty in January, had 
been secretly cooperating with investigators for two months. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against the other principals alleged to have played 
a role in the scheme, including the three second-tier Unisys executives and two 
consultants named in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Some passages outlining alleged wrongdoing at the Minnesota office of the 
Pennsyvania-based corporation were deleted, indicating that portions of that 
investigation may be continuing. The leading prosecutor in the case, Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Joseph J. Aronica, declined to say whether he expected charges to be 
forthcoming in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
But Aronica made clear that the new revelations "broaden the case beyond what 
was previously known publicly." 
</P>
<P>
"When we release these (documents)," Aronica said, "we're satisfied that the 
investigation has proceeded to such a point that it won't be jeopardized by 
these things coming out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
The documents, an affidavit and a search warrant filed last June when federal 
agents searched Minnesota offices of Unisys Defense Systems, alleged that 
company employees there had "been involved in criminal activities" with 
consultants Parkin, Thomas E. Muldoon and William Sanda. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted Sanda as saying that Unisys employees had urged him to obtain details 
about their competitors' bids on the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central 
project, which involved military air traffic control equipment, and about 
Defense Department evaluations of the various bids. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys paid Sanda at least $18,000 for the service, much of which was passed on 
to other consultants who used it to pay sources within the Pentagon, the 
documents indicate. One of the consultants working with Sanda in the scheme was 
actually a confidential government informant, the papers show. 
</P>
<P>
The government names three Unisys executives -- William Geiger, Ralph Hughes 
and Robert Elfering -- as the consultants' contacts within the company. 
</P>
<P>
None of those named could be reached for comment. A Unisys spokeswoman, Janet 
Hess, declined to comment on the allegations or to provide details about the 
employees, saying, "We have to have time to examine the documents." 
</P>
<P>
Geiger, a vice president, and Elfering, a marketing manager, are still with 
Unisys, sources said. Hughes, a former marketing director, has left the 
corporation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Another former Unisys vice president who worked in the company's Long Island 
operation, Charles F. Gardner, already has pleaded guilty to charges of bribing 
Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has not been charged with any crimes, has blamed wrongdoing 
on officials who came to the company from the Sperry Corp., which was acquired 
by the Burroughs Corp. in 1986 in a corporate merger that formed Unisys.

A jury of nine women and three men deliberated for 5 1/2 hours Friday without 
reaching a verdict in the case against former White House aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell excused the jurors for the day and 
instructed them to return to the courthouse this morning to resume 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
If they fail to reach a verdict today, they will take Sunday off before 
deliberating again on Monday, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asks for Paper Clips 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Denise Anderson sent Gesell a note Friday asking for additional 
note pads, pencils and paper clips -- and requesting lunch at the same time 
each day -- indicating that deliberations on the 12 criminal counts against 
North in the Iran-Contra case may take several days. Jurors are being 
sequestered at night in a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson added that "everyone would like a copy of the instructions" that 
Gesell read to the jury Thursday. Gesell agreed to furnish duplicates of the 
approximately 40-page text. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an alternate juror who was present for all eight weeks of testimony 
said she would have voted to convict North on at least some of the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
But Horasina McKie, one of five alternates dismissed when the case went to the 
regular jury on Thursday, said that, in accordance with the judge's 
instructions, she had not discussed the evidence with other jurors.

WRIGHT PARTNER DEFENDS OIL DEAL, ASSAILS PANEL COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FT. WORTH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright's business partner said Friday that an oil deal under 
scrutiny by the House Ethics Committee was legitimate, despite implications of 
misconduct because $341,000 was made in a single day on what turned out to be a 
dry well. 
</P>
<P>
George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth millionaire and longtime friend of the 
Speaker, divulged for the first time Friday his version of the events that led 
to the sale of a share of an oil well to a German investment company, Union 
Rheinische Petroleum Inc. -- a transaction that is now a focal point of the 
investigation by the committee into the financial affairs of the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
And, in so doing, Mallick blasted the report prepared by Ethics Committee 
special counsel Richard J. Phelan, accusing him of selectively using 
information about the oil deal to cast it in its worst possible light. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Phelan Got Data 
</P>
<P>
He said Phelan had been provided with documentation about the legitimacy of the 
deal but had failed to include the material in his report to the Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Phelan's got those papers," he said. "This is just how he wants it to look." 
</P>
<P>
At issue in this latest controversy involving the embattled Wright is a series 
of events in which Mallick sought to carry out one last deal for Mallightco 
Inc. -- "to bet the farm," as he told the committee -- after the Speaker 
created a blind trust for his assets in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wright owned a half interest in Mallightco and instructed Mallick to sell his 
share of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Largely as a result of the windfall from the oil deal, Wright eventually 
received $350,000 when his share of Mallightco was sold. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report prepared by Phelan, Mallick and his son, Michael, 
invested $9,120 in the well on May 10, then turned around and sold the German 
firm a part of that share in a complicated loan transaction for $440,000 on the 
same day, netting Mallightco a profit of $341,000 after expenses were deducted. 
</P>
<P>
The case is further complicated by the fact that both deals were set up by the 
same man, M. D. (Doug) Jaffe Jr., a 38-year-old multimillionaire financier from 
San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick conceded that, with no further explanation, the huge profit had the 
look of wrongdoing about it, especially because the well was eventually capped. 
But he said the more complete story made what happened far less suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mallick, he began looking for a deal to greatly enhance the value 
of Mallightco soon after Wright asked him to prudently sell off his share of 
the corporation. He said he called a number of oilmen, telling them he wanted 
to invest $100,000 of Mallightco's $150,000 in assets, with the stipulation 
that the deal needed to be done quickly. 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the men he called was longtime friend M. D. (Morris) Jaffe 
Sr., Douglas' father and a major contributor to Democratic Party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he had a home run going," Mallick said. He said Jaffe told him he 
had invested in an oil drilling venture in East Texas, on Lake Sabine at the 
Louisiana state line. But he said his son was the biggest investor, with a 50% 
stake in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son Struck a Deal 
</P>
<P>
Mallick said his son, Michael, and Douglas Jaffe eventually struck a deal in 
which $90,000 would eventually be invested for a 4% share of the well. He said 
the letter of agreement was signed on Jan. 12, 1988, but that no money changed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
It is at this point that the Phelan report and Mallick begin to diverge in what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, drilling began on the well, and by April 9 the hole had been bored 
to a depth of 11,560 feet. Mallick said the initial tests looked very 
promising. That contention has been supported by both the engineering firm 
overseeing the drilling, Brammer Engineering Inc., and the company that sank 
the well, Dean Shank Drilling Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was really getting excited about the well," Mallick said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethics Committee report, it was clearly evident by late April 
that the well was not going to be a gusher. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick disputes that, saying that workers were still "swabbing," or cleaning 
out, the well through May and that there was every hope that it would be 
productive, as were three adjacent wells owned by Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He said Douglas Jaffe, on the basis of the well's promise, approached him in 
mid-April and asked if he would be interested in selling his 4% share to Union 
Rheinische, a company that Jaffe had advised on financial matters for a number 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick said he decided to cover himself at both ends of the deal, selling a 
part of Mallightco's share to the German company but keeping a 1.5% share for 
himself. He said a deal was struck in which Union Rheinische would pay $440,000 
but Mallick would pay back $90,000 to cover costs accrued up to then. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that the appearance of having made a large sum of money in one day 
was simply a matter of bookkeeping. In order to divest Mallightco of a part of 
the interest in the oil well, it first had to be recorded that the corporation 
was an investor. Hence, he said, both transactions took place on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Mallick said more evidence to rebut the report was that an additional $2 
million was spent on a second well at the site after the original hole 
developed problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't abandon the well until September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All this will be put to rest next week," Mallick said, when Ethics Committee 
members travel to San Antonio to take depositions from both Jaffes. 
</P>
<P>
"This was tame," Mallick said. "I've seen much wilder stuff that this."

MECHAM CAN RUN FOR OFFICE, ATTY. GEN. SAYS

<P>
Former Gov. Evan Mecham, convicted last year by the state Senate of obstructing 
an investigation, can legally run for any public office in Arizona, including 
governor, in 1990, Atty. Gen. Bob Corbin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin said his office researched the state Constitution and state laws 
governing impeachment and concluded that Mecham's 1988 impeachment and Senate 
conviction did not disqualify him from future public office. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have the right to run for any office he sees fit, including governor 
in 1990," Corbin said. The attorney general's opinions are not binding and 
Corbin said he would welcome a court challenge to his views. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham's attorney, Donald MacPherson, who earlier indicated that he would take 
the question to the Arizona Supreme Court regardless of Corbin's opinion, said 
he has decided against that. MacPherson urged anyone who might want to 
challenge Mecham's candidacy to do it soon and not wait until late in the 1990 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson also said Mecham will pursue in the courts his efforts to void his 
impeachment and Senate conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham was removed from office April 4, 1988, when the Senate convicted him of 
obstructing an investigation into an aide's alleged death threat and illegally 
loaning state money to his Glendale automobile dealership. 
</P>
<P>
On the first anniversary of his ouster, Mecham announced that he would seek the 
Republican gubernatorial nomination again. 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate convicted Mecham of impeachable offenses, it voted on the 
so-called Dracula clause, which would have barred Mecham from running again for 
any public office. The clause was approved by a simple majority, but in setting 
rules for the impeachment trial, the Senate had stipulated that a two-thirds 
majority vote would be required to invoke it.

GIONIS FACES TRIAL IN ATTACK ON AISSA WAYNE; BAIL AT $250,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Thomas A. Gionis was ordered Friday to stand trial for an attack on his 
ex-wife Aissa Wayne, daughter of actor John Wayne, after a judge found that 
authorities had amassed enough evidence to link the wealthy orthopedic surgeon 
to two street thugs who carried out the assault last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Susanne S. Shaw of Harbor Municipal Court in Newport Beach set bail of 
$250,000 for Gionis over the strong objections of prosecutors, but she offered 
a scathing summary of the evidence against the surgeon, concluding that he 
"snapped" as a result of a divorce and bitter custody battle over the couple's 
only child, 2-year-old Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
"You went off the deep end," Shaw said to Gionis after a weeklong preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 35, of Pomona, had been denied bail since his arrest April 4 because 
authorities considered him a flight risk. Gionis' lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, 
predicted Friday afternoon that his client would be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis is charged with conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon in the 
Oct. 3 assault on Wayne, 33, and her then-boyfriend, millionaire financier 
Roger W. Luby, 53, at Luby's gated Newport Beach estate. Wayne was bloodied and 
Luby suffered a slashed Achilles' tendon in the attack, which prosecutors 
contend was ordered by Gionis as a warning to Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have said he knew 
nothing about the attack.

<P>
A church Sunday school teacher charged in the rape and baseball bat murder of a 
13-year-old girl confessed the killing in a taped interview with police. 
</P>
<P>
"I murdered her. I raped her, I strangled her and I bludgeoned her," Scott 
Martin Williams told Novato detectives during a tearful admission Wednesday 
night, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Williams, 29, a volunteer teacher and groundskeeper at Bethel 
Baptist Church, made several statements containing facts about the April 13 
killing of Jennifer Moore of Novato that were not known to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Novato Police Chief Charles Brobeck and Marin County Dist. Atty. Jerry Herman 
confirmed that Williams had confessed after the Chronicle story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Williams could face the death penalty because of special 
circumstances. Specifically, he was charged with committing the murder during a 
rape or attempted rape and during lewd and lascivious conduct with a person 
under 14.

An accident at the Soviet Union's biggest nuclear plant, criticized for its 
safety record, caused a leak from a reservoir but there was no radioactive 
pollution, a Lithuanian journalist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The journalist from Lithuania's Elta news agency said the accident occurred 
Wednesday evening at the Ignalina power station in the east of the Baltic 
republic. Two fires last year caused temporary closures at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The journalist quoted the plant's director, Anatoly Khromchenko, as saying that 
a fuel "cassette" had been dropped during reloading in the station's first 
reactor, punching a hole in the floor of the storage reservoir.

GOVERNMENT WARNS BRITISH TABLOIDS TO 'CLEAN UP THEIR ACT'

<P>
The government warned Britain's tabloid newspapers Friday to "clean up their 
act" or face laws to curb sensationalist journalism which has led to huge libel 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister Timothy Renton, responding to public anger over the way 
tabloid newspapers fight their circulation wars, announced the setting up of an 
independent review of press behavior. 
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament that the investigation will be completed within a year and 
will be followed by legislation if press behavior did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Editors and publishers of the national press are on probation in this 
country," Renton said. "They have a year or two to clean up their act." 
</P>
<P>
The review was disclosed as government supporters ensured the defeat of an 
attempt by opposition Labor Party legislator Tony Worthington to provide 
victims of unfair newspaper reports with a legal right of reply. 
</P>
<P>
The government, which has had its own quarrels with the press, torpedoed 
Worthington's proposals only because it considered them unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges in Parliament coincided with a meeting in London of the 
International Press Institute to discuss accusations by some journalists that 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has eroded press and broadcasting freedom in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure for reform of the press has resulted from what critics say is its 
growing intrusions into the private lives of the famous, sexual smears and 
blatant invention of headline stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun paid a record $1.7 million in libel damages to rock star Elton John 
last December after admitting that stories about him were untrue.

TRAILING, 2-0, KINGS HAVE NOT LOST HOPE

<P>
Which was worse? Losing Game 1 in overtime, 4-3, after sitting on a lead? Or 
getting blown out in the opening minutes of Game 2 and letting frustrations 
turn to fisticuffs in an 8-3 defeat? 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one is worse than the other," said captain Dave Taylor as the Kings 
were packing up to leave the Saddledome, down two games to none to the Calgary 
Flames in their best-of-seven Smythe Division playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
"A loss is a loss, whether you lose by one or by five." 
</P>
<P>
King goalie Kelly Hrudey was even able to manage a smile as he said: "How can 
we come back? It's easy. We're professionals. We regroup. We're in the National 
Hockey League now and we're not going to pack it in after two games of a 
seven-game series." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were able to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the semifinal series 
against Edmonton by sweeping the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
To win this series, the Kings will have to win four of five. Game 3 is at the 
Forum tonight and Game 4 at the Forum Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings did not practice Friday after flying from Calgary by charter after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
A day off was needed. 
</P>
<P>
As for the effect of such a resounding defeat, Taylor said, "Maybe it will 
serve as a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings have talked about the intimidation factor and have talked 
about being willing to "push back" during the playoffs, they had not been 
involved in any real nasty exchanges before Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny McDonald of the Flames made this observation Thursday night: "If that's 
the way they want to play, no problem. I think they tried it before and it 
hasn't worked before. And I can't see it working again." 
</P>
<P>
The Calgary trainer who was on the ice tending to downed goalie Mike Vernon 
while the Flames were scoring their fourth goal, Jim (Bearcat) Murray, made an 
amazingly quick trip from the bench to the crease. Most trainers wait for a 
skater to give them a tow. Not Murray, who has small spikes on his shoes to 
allow him to run on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
He's noted for it. A Calgary official said: "Bear's ability to react instantly 
to on-ice injuries is well documented. Many times he has reached an injured 
Flame player before play has stopped. He is the only trainer in the NHL with 
his own fan club." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Kings had had a game misconduct before Thursday night. But by the 
time the third-period fight had ended, Marty McSorley, Jay Miller and Jim 
Wiemer all had game misconducts. However, since the cumulative count for these 
types of penalties starts over in the playoffs, none of them will have to sit 
out the next game. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor stayed on the ice after the game to ask the referee why McSorley had 
been assessed a game misconduct. The referee cited rule 54 (f): "A game 
misconduct shall be imposed on any player who is assessed a major penalty for 
fighting following the original altercation . . . at the discretion of the 
referee the automatic game misconduct penalty may be waived for a player in the 
altercation, if the opposing player was clearly the instigator of the 
altercation." 
</P>
<P>
McNall's pilot, Steve Purwin, has been sticking decals on the Jetstar for every 
playoff victory. He has four Oiler stickers on the nose of the plane, and he 
has Flames stickers at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings-Flames playoff game at the Forum at 7:30 tonight will be televised 
live by Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570).

DODGER HITTERS WAKE UP IN TIME TO BATTER GIANTS

<P>
For a change, the Dodgers didn't have to worry about a twinge in Orel 
Hershiser's elbow. 
</P>
<P>
For a bigger change, they detected traces of a pulse in their batting order, 
scoring five runs in the first three innings en route to an 8-2 win over the 
San Francisco Giants Friday night before 47,251 fans at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who came into the game averaging just over three runs a game, had 
10 hits while giving Hershiser more runs to work with than any other Dodger 
pitcher has had this season. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Eddie Murray, who has a run batted in for every hit he's gotten 
this season, raised his average above .200 for the first time with three hits 
-- one single to each field -- and drove in three runs. Murray, enjoying his 
first three-hit game as a Dodger, has 13 hits and 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be undefeated if I had just hit the ball with men on base," said 
Murray, who helped the Dodgers reach .500 (8-8) with their fifth victory in the 
last six games on this homestand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've left a lot of runners on base this year. I don't want to say I can carry 
the club, but when I get hot . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who had felt a twinge in his elbow in each of his previous two 
starts, said he enjoyed a pain-free outing while winning his third game against 
one loss. He went seven innings and put a lid on the Giants' only rally, in the 
fourth, when after a two-run single by Terry Kennedy, he struck out Jose Uribe 
and retired pinch-hitter Tracy Jones on a first-pitch ground-out. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope my elbow hurts that much, so I can throw the ball that hard," Kennedy 
said wryly. "He's tough when they score runs." 
</P>
<P>
With three runs in the first inning and two more in the third, the Dodgers 
chased Giant starter Kelly Downs, who gave up five runs on six hits, a walk, a 
wild pitch and a balk in just 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph triggered both rallies, with a walk to lead off the first and a 
single to open the third. Kirk Gibson, returning to the lineup after starting 
just one of the five previous games, singled on his first at-bat to send 
Randolph to third, from where he scored on Mike Marshall's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Murray then singled home Gibson and scored himself on the first of Mike 
Scioscia's two doubles. Scioscia had come into the game with just one hit in 
his previous 17 at-bats and only one RBI in April. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall collected another RBI in the third with a bad-hop double off the glove 
of Giant third baseman Ernest Riles, and Jeff Hamilton -- benched the last two 
games -- hit a bases-loaded single off the end of his bat in the fifth to drive 
in two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I told you before, we knew they were going to hit," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who struck out seven while allowing six hits, had uncharacteristic 
control problems, walking four. But he was aided by two double plays turned by 
Randolph and shortstop Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him pitch better," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "But he pitched 
well enough to win tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's own critique? 
</P>
<P>
"The inning I loaded the bases I was pitching brutal," he said, referring to 
the fourth. "Bad mechanics, walking people, bad pitches. Fortunately, I was 
able to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't he being a tad harsh? 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can improve," he said, "is by staying hard on myself. There 
have been times before when I've thrown a two-hit shutout (that) I've said I 
was brutal, and other times where I got hit that I said I had good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Even innings where I got them three up and three down, I made mistakes. I hung 
a changeup to Kennedy (in the sixth) that even though he popped it up, I walked 
off the mound disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
He was encouraged, however, by the absence of any pain in the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight my arm felt great," he said. "The only time it's going to happen 
(feeling pain) is when I overthrow the ball, and I didn't do that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Having some runs to work with, naturally, made the night even more painless. 
</P>
<P>
"That was nice, to say the least," he said. "That was even nicer. I'll pitch in 
pain if I get runs, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Pedro Guerrero, who spent spring training ripping Manager Tom 
Lasorda in interviews, will be honored by the Dodgers when the St. Louis 
Cardinals play here on May 3. Dodger officials called the pregame ceremony "an 
organizational decision." Guerrero, among other things, accused Lasorda of 
being too permissive, a laughable charge coming from Guerrero, who got more 
slack from Lasorda than did any other player. Lasorda was bitter about the 
criticism, saying he had treated Guerrero like a son.

MIKE DOWNEY: FLAMES MAKE FOR HOT TIME AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
Here they come, the Calgary Flames, now appearing at a hockey rink near you. 
Fasten your safety belts, it's going to be a bumpy couple of nights. 
</P>
<P>
From Canada they have flown, to continue their revolution against the Kings. 
The Flames want this Stanley Cup badly. The last time anybody in Calgary won 
anything, it had something to do with tying a rope around three legs of a calf. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings must now win four of the next five, starting tonight, to overtake the 
Flames in these playoffs. Obviously they can do it, so long as they still have 
Wayne Gretzky. Where there's Wayne, there's a way. 
</P>
<P>
They also still have goalie Kelly Hrudey, who has never been bested at home as 
a King. And they still have Bernie Nicholls, which is remarkable in itself. The 
way he assaulted Calgary goalie Mike Vernon in Game 2, Nicholls is lucky he 
wasn't suspended by the league, or arrested by a Mountie. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Flames, since they had the best record in the National Hockey League 
this season, they need no introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Like hell they don't. 
</P>
<P>
There's Lanny McDonald, who had to buy two airplane tickets -- one for himself, 
and one for his mustache. Lanny shouldn't trim that hedge, he should water it. 
Any more hair on this person's face and he is going to resemble the Addams 
Family's Cousin It. 
</P>
<P>
There's also Theoren Fleury, the Spud Webb of hockey, who saved the club a 
considerable amount of money by giving his seat to McDonald's mustache and 
sleeping in the overhead luggage compartment. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Joey Mullen, the highest-scoring American-born player in NHL 
history, who was reared in New York City's Hell's Kitchen and is accustomed to 
witnessing behavior such as Bernie Nicholls'. 
</P>
<P>
And we mustn't forget Mike Vernon, who was minding his own business on the 
flight to Los Angeles, having a drink, when suddenly Robbie Ftorek summoned a 
stewardess and forced her to measure Vernon's swizzle stick. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames have the Kings pretty rattled for the time being, having whipped 
them nine straight times on their home ice. They have only lost five games at 
the Saddledome all season. No wonder Ftorek demanded that Vernon's stick be 
measured Thursday night; we're surprised the King coach didn't ask an 
electrician to make sure the red light behind Vernon hadn't blown a fuse. 
</P>
<P>
Home-ice advantage is a reality at Calgary, where even the trainer is permitted 
to skate onto the ice anytime he feels like it. While tending to the fallen 
Vernon, this Jim (Bearcat) Murray person probably could have stopped a couple 
of shots with his first-aid kit and gotten away with it, the way things work at 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames have a real surprise in store for them tonight when, just at a key 
moment, sports columnist Jim (Bare Facts) Murray of The Times rushes to 
Hrudey's side and distracts the Flames while Los Angeles is scoring a goal. 
Fair is fair. 
</P>
<P>
Something definitely needs be done if the Kings intend to prolong this series. 
We remain divided between patting their backs over that valiant comeback 
against Edmonton to reminding ourselves that Edmonton was a third-place team in 
its own division. Calgary, after all, is the class of the league. It has four 
solid lines and an All-Star goaltender. Its Stanley Cup probably runneth over. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, on the other hand, have a melting pot of ex-Oilers, ex-Flames, 
ex-Islanders, ex-Bruins, ex-Rangers, ex-etceteras who somehow have blended 
together to play above their visible capabilities. King linemates change 
partners more often than couples at a square dance. King defensemen are thin in 
talent and number, although Ftorek finally saw fit Thursday to give Doug 
Crossman some ice time and might put Ken Baumgartner back to work tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Several key players have to snap out of slumps if the Kings are to have a 
chance. Luc Robitaille, who hasn't been himself since the All-Star break, made 
a devastating error that contributed to Thursday night's defeat. Mike 
Krushelnyski is way overdue to have a decent game. So is Dean Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
We hope each and every King is feeling aces-high for tonight's Game 3, because 
if they aren't, there might not be a Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
We know they will be out there trying. 
</P>
<P>
We know if anybody in a red uniform goes anywhere near Gretzky, sorehead Marty 
McSorley will be there to do something about it. When Gretzky gets a bad 
haircut, McSorley probably goes out and beats up his barber. 
</P>
<P>
We also know that owner Bruce McNall is so superstitious, he won't permit his 
wife to attend tonight's game (the Kings lost the last time she was there), 
won't permit the singing of our usual national anthem (the Kings haven't lost 
since using "America the Beautiful" instead) and won't permit the opening 
faceoff to be dropped until that dude with the lucky gluteus maximus drags his 
icy tush out there. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, a team's gotta do what a team's gotta do.

RELIEVED LAKERS WIN 8TH STRAIGHT DIVISION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers are beyond such gestures as popping champagne corks over something 
as routine as another division title, so it was mainly with a sense of immense 
relief Friday night that they celebrated the clinching of their eighth straight 
Pacific Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Their 121-114 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, a team they might meet 
in the playoffs' first round, combined with Phoenix's loss to the Houston 
Rockets, gave the Lakers the title outright. They lead the persistent Suns by 
two games with one to play, so they can finally forget all those tiebreaking 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Lakers also assured themselves of the home-court advantage 
throughout the Western Conference playoffs, which was about as strong an 
incentive as the two-time defending NBA champions can muster during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were going to do it," said Magic Johnson, who guaranteed as much 
three games ago. "This team has met so many challenges, and this is just 
another one of them. This is a championship team, and we know what we have to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need champagne to celebrate tonight. We've been celebrating these 
things now for eight or nine years in a row. It's just one goal, the first one, 
and now we got it." 
</P>
<P>
Not without some anxious moments in the last two weeks. The Suns put together a 
long winning streak, steadily eroding a Laker lead once thought impregnable. 
</P>
<P>
And while many Lakers expressed confidence all along, some admitted to stabs of 
doubt recently. 
</P>
<P>
"This one was a little different," Byron Scott said. "You appreciate it a 
little more, I guess. But the thing I liked is that we didn't back into it. We 
won it ourselves, outright. Phoenix kind of came out of nowhere to have a great 
season, but we really didn't doubt ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
It took 56 victories for the Lakers to repel the Suns' threat. The Lakers saw 
their lead dwindle to a half-game three times in the last week, but they never 
relinquished it. 
</P>
<P>
At times, it seemed the Lakers only really got interested when the Suns pushed 
them to the limit. So, as Coach Pat Riley theorized afterward, the divisional 
race may have helped put the Lakers in their playoff mode a little earlier than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, this team played bored," Riley said. "At times, we were depleted, 
but I trust this team. There's been a lot of attention in the media that we 
might be slipping, but it is foolish not to stay with this team. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a veteran team has to develop and sustain confidence, and I think that is 
what we have done this week. We had to go out and win it, and that's what we 
did. We'll probably finish three wins short of 60, and I'm satisfied with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Friday night's division clincher, before 12,880 at Memorial Coliseum, 
was a microcosm of this erratic, but ultimately successfull, regular season for 
the Lakers. They sprinted out to an early lead, struggled in the middle, then 
eventually pulled through when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, they had to overcome a 43-point effort by Portland's Clyde 
Drexler, who tried singlehandedly to make up for the absence of ailing center 
Kevin Duckworth. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler was superb. Playing 44 minutes, he made 19 of 29 shots, and had 11 
rebounds and seven assists. But not even Drexler, who fell seven points shy of 
equaling his season-high scoring total, could overcome the Lakers' team effort. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson led the Lakers with 23 points and 10 assists, and he sank a three-point 
shot with 1:40 to play that gave the Lakers an 11-point lead, virtually 
finishing the Trail Blazers' comeback hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and James Worthy added 20 and 18 points, respectively, while A.C. Green 
contributed 12 points and 12 rebounds. Green was a catalyst in the 
fourth-quarter stretch run, converting two offensive rebounds into baskets in a 
47-second span. 
</P>
<P>
As well as the starters played, the Lakers' big contribution came off the 
bench. Mychal Thompson scored 17 points in 29 minutes as a replacement for 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who suffered a bruised right knee that he later termed 
minor. And Orlando Woolridge spelled Worthy, scoring 14 points and grabbing 
seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the Laker reserves outscored the Trail Blazers' bench, 44-27. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker bench made its presence felt early. While most of the starters 
rested, the reserves broke open the game in the second quarter. Led by 
Thompson, Woolridge and Tony Campbell, the Lakers built an 11-point lead in the 
first six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Johnson and Green were reunited with the rest of the starters, the 
Lakers maintained a comfortable lead and pushed it to 55-43 with 3:13 left, 
after Campbell completed a fastbreak with a layup. But then came a late lull 
that enabled the Trail Blazers almost to erase the Lakers' lead. Portland 
sprinted to a 13-5 run in the final 2:47 as Drexler scored seven of his 24 
first-half points during that span. 
</P>
<P>
A four-point halftime lead evaporated four minutes into the third quarter. But 
the Trail Blazers, despite Drexler's exploits, could never build more than a 
two-point lead. By the end of the third quarter, the Lakers had an 89-83 lead 
and did not allow Portland to slash the lead below three points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
It was fitting, in a way, that the Lakers clinched their eighth division title 
in the 1980s on the road, where they have had all sorts of problems this 
season. They finished the regular season with 21-19 road record, their worst 
mark away from the Forum in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on what happens this weekend, the Lakers could find themselves back 
in Portland next week. The Trail Blazers (38-43) are only one game ahead of the 
Dallas Mavericks (37-44) for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Portland must beat Sacramento or Dallas must lose to Denver Sunday to ensure a 
playoff spot for the Trail Blazers. If the teams were to finish in a tie, the 
Mavericks would advance via tiebreaking procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Lakers announced the schedule for the first two games of their 
first-round Western Conference playoff series at the Forum. Game 1 will be 
Thursday night at 7:30 and Game 2 Sunday afternoon at 12:30. . . . In Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar's 24th and final tour stop before Sunday's sendoff at the Forum, 
the Trail Blazers presented the retiring Laker center with a backgammon set, 
custom-made with hand-cut and polished glass and inlaid with gold leaf and 
platinum leaf. It also includes hand-carved ivory dice. Abdul-Jabbar thanked 
the crowd for its support of basketball. "I remember coming here as a rookie 
for an exhibition game, when they were trying to test the market," Abdul-Jabbar 
said. "I think what has happened here is great. You fans have showed a lot of 
class whether you were on top or not. I never, ever remember hearing anything 
negative from you people, even when you lost." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said that injured resever center Mark McNamara most 
likely will not be put on the injured list and replaced on the roster for the 
playoffs. The Lakers have until Sunday to submit a playoff roster.

IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF COLLEGE SPORTS ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from the Jeff Koterba cartoon (April 13) depicting the (Norby) 
Walters-(Lloyd) Bloom trial as opening the Pandora's box of college sports 
deceits, the media seems to have missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was exploiting the deeper hypocrisy of college sports. If Walters and 
Bloom are guilty of fraud in advancing loans, then what about the fraud of the 
universities? 
</P>
<P>
It was really big business college sports that was on trial.

As your team starts a second-round playoff game, it is appropriate for a coach 
to show support for his team by wearing: 
</P>
<P>
A -- The team colors. 
</P>
<P>
B -- Anything but the opposing team's colors. 
</P>
<P>
C -- Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
D -- The opposing team's colors.

Well, if you're Robbie Ftorek of the L.A. Kings, the answer is D. But of

MT. SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE RELAYS; 
</P>
<P>
'DREAM' TEAM PRIMED TO BREAK 800 RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A track athlete can't guarantee a world record on any given day because there 
are too many variables. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it would be surprising if four athletes didn't set one today in the 
31st annual Mt. San Antonio College Relays at Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the world's fastest sprinters have been assembled for an assault on the 
800-meter relay record. 
</P>
<P>
It's a dream team of Joe DeLoach, Floyd Heard, Danny Everett and Carl Lewis, 
who are primed to break the record of 1 minute 20.26 seconds set by USC in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan team consisted of Joel Andrews, James Sanford, Billy Mullins and 
Clancy Edwards. That wasn't an ordinary college team. Sanford and Edwards, for 
example, are former World Cup sprint champions. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there anything ordinary about the sprinters representing the Santa 
Monica Track Club today. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoach was the Olympic gold medalist in the 200 last September at Seoul. Lewis 
was the silver medalist. They share the best low-altitude time, 19.75 seconds. 
Only Italy's Pietro Mennea has run faster, 19.72 at high altitude in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Heard has a best time of 19.95, and Everett, the Olympic bronze medalist in the 
400, is now gearing his training toward the 200. He has a best time of 20.23. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, the former UCLA star, was cautious when asked if the foursome could 
break the world record. 
</P>
<P>
"If we run each individual leg real well (with no faulty baton passes), we're 
hopeful for an extremely fast time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of today's meet, including the 800-meter relay, will be televised -- 
3:05 to 4:05 p.m. -- by the Turner Broadcasting System, a cable network. 
</P>
<P>
In a change of format, there will be open competition both today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Today 
</P>
<P>
100 -- Raymond Stewart of Jamaica, representing Texas Christian, was third in 
the World Championships in 1987 in Rome behind Ben Johnson and Lewis. He has a 
best time of 10.06 and will be opposed by Brian Cooper, 10.07; Nigeria's Chidi 
Imoh, 10.00; Mark Witherspoon, 10.04, and three-time Olympian Harvey Glance, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
400 -- Nigeria's Innocent Egbunike, formerly of Azusa Pacific, was ranked 
seventh in the world in 1988. His formidable competition includes Willie Smith, 
Mark Rowe, Kevin Robinzine and Roddie Haley. 
</P>
<P>
400-meter hurdles -- Kevin Young, former UCLA star, who placed fourth in the 
Olympic Games, is the class of this field. 
</P>
<P>
Women's 400-meter hurdles -- LaTayna Sheffield, 10th ranked in the world last 
year, has noteworthy opposition in USC's Leslie Maxie and Schowanda Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Long jump -- Larry Myricks, the world indoor champion and Olympic bronze 
medalist, is matched against Mike Powell, the Olympic silver medalist. Myricks, 
33, seemingly gets better with age. He had a personal best of 28 feet 8 1/4 
inches last year, the No. 4 performer on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
High jump -- Hollis Conway, the Olympic silver medalist and American indoor 
record-holder at 7-9 1/4, is matched against Thomas McCants, who scaled the 
same height as the U.S. outdoor record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday 
</P>
<P>
200 -- Everett calls this a "fun event" because there is less pressure on him 
than in his specialty, the 400. He's capable of breaking 20 seconds. He's in a 
classy field that includes Heard, Witherspoon and Lorenzo Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
400-meter relay -- The Santa Monica Track Club has another explosive team in 
DeLoach, Heard, Everett and Witherspoon. Texas A &amp; M, Florida, Texas Tech 
and USC could make it interesting. 
</P>

WOOD MEMORIAL; 
</P>
<P>
N.Y.'S SECOND BEST IS NOT RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second-best 3-year-old in New York will stay in his barn today while his 
heralded stablemate, Easy Goer, is expected to become the shortest-priced horse 
ever to win the Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having won five of seven starts, including the Flamingo Stakes at 
Hialeah in his last race, Awe Inspiring is still playing second banana to Easy 
Goer, who has won six out of eight. The horses have the same ownership -- Ogden 
Phipps and his son, Dinny -- and are both trained by Shug McGaughey, who has 
repeatedly said that only Easy Goer will run in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill 
Downs two weeks from today. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey can see no sense running Awe Inspiring as an entry in the $500,000 
Wood, the last of four major preps for the Derby, even though second-place 
money at Aqueduct is more than $100,000. Awe Inspiring would probably finish 
second if he ran, because the other five horses in the field are second-raters. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Diamond Donnie, ran second, 13 lengths behind Easy Goer, two weeks 
ago, and the others also have modest credentials. Triple Buck is winless this 
year, Rock Point has won three of 11 lifetime starts and A.M. Swinger and 
Militron couldn't beat lesser opposition at Garden State Park just a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring easily beat better horses than these when he won the Flamingo by 
three lengths on March 25, the same day McGaughey was saddling Easy Goer for 
his near-world-record 1:32 2/5 mile in the Gotham here. 
</P>
<P>
The Flamingo is also a major prep for the Derby, and in most years Awe 
Inspiring would be on his way to Louisville as one of the favorites in 
America's premier race. This year, Awe Inspiring would be either the third or 
fourth betting choice -- behind Easy Goer and Santa Anita Derby winner Sunday 
Silence and possibly ahead of Blue Grass winner Western Playboy -- if he ran in 
the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what he does, though, Awe Inspiring is being upstaged by Easy Goer. 
The other day at Belmont Park, where McGaughey trains his horses, Awe Inspiring 
turned in an effective half-mile workout in :48 4/5, but 24 hours later, Easy 
Goer covered the same distance 2 3/5 seconds faster. 
</P>
<P>
After Awe Inspiring's workout, a story in the Daily Racing Form hinted that 
McGaughey might be changing his mind about the Derby for his No. 2 colt, but in 
an interview Thursday, the trainer discounted that. Ogden Phipps, who is 80, 
reportedly would not care if Awe Inspiring, who races in his son's name, were 
to run in the Derby, but the decision has been left to McGaughey. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably enter both colts in the Derby," McGaughey said. "But only Easy 
Goer will run. If anything should happen to Easy Goer -- God forbid -- or if 
the track came up muddy, then it's possible that Awe Inspiring could run." 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey concedes that Awe Inspiring has developed faster than he thought he 
would. He won in his first start, in a maiden race at Belmont last September, 
but by then Easy Goer already had two victories on his record. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring was fourth in his second start, on an off track, and McGaughey 
didn't race him the rest of his 2-year-old year. This winter at Gulfstream 
Park, the son of Slew o' Gold won two allowance races in less than three weeks 
and both jockey Jose Santos and his agent, Frank Sanabria, were saying that 
this might be their Derby horse. 
</P>
<P>
But when Awe Inspiring had a rough trip and finished 10th in his first stake, 
the Fountain of Youth, Santos picked another horse, Kerosene, to ride in the 
Everglades. Under Craig Perret, Awe Inspiring beat Kerosene by three lengths, 
and the distance between them was the same in the Flamingo. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey didn't think Awe Inspiring was ready to run in the Florida Derby, 
which was two weeks after the Fountain of Youth, or the colt might have won 
that race, too. 
</P>
<P>
Racing lore is crammed with stories of trainers whose second-best horses turned 
out to be something. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1973 Wood, Lucien Laurin started both Secretariat and Angle Light, 
because they had different owners. Secretariat had beaten Angle Light three 
times when they were 2-year-olds, and the future Triple Crown champion went 
into the Wood with a 10-race winning streak, having been beaten only in the 
first race of his career. 
</P>
<P>
It was not widely known that Secretariat had been bothered by an abscessed 
tooth. In the stretch, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey, was looking around 
for Sham, the horse he thought they had to beat, when Angle Light surprised 
them and won by a head. Sham was second, four lengths ahead of Secretariat, who 
lost only three more races before he was retired. 
</P>
<P>
Secretariat reaffirmed his superiority over Angle Light in the Kentucky Derby. 
The next year, in the centennial running of the Derby, Woody Stephens ran 
Judger and Cannonade as an entry. Judger had run down his stablemate in the 
stretch of the Florida Derby, and was a big winner in the Blue Grass the week 
before the Kentucky Derby. But at Churchill Downs, Cannonade gave Stephens his 
first Derby win and Judger ran eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Stephens has made a career of winning with his second string, 
especially during the 1980s, when he won the Belmont Stakes five consecutive 
times. Stephens got his other Derby win in 1984 with Swale, who had played 
Pancho to Devil's Bag's Cisco Kid when they were 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring are flown to Louisville from New York next 
Wednesday, one horse should be put in business class and the other ought to be 
flying tourist. In racing, though, the way horses are perceived or travel 
doesn't always jibe with the turns that their careers take. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris Antley, who doesn't have a mount in the Wood, rode the winner of the 
seventh race Friday, extending his record to 57 consecutive days with at least 
one winner at Aqueduct. . . . The track is expected to be fast today. . . . The 
shortest-priced winner of the Wood has been Native Dancer, who paid $2.20 when 
he won in 1953. Easy Goer paid $2.10 -- the minimum -- in winning the Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
Manastash Ridge, with Robbie Davis riding, is the 2-1 favorite today in the 
$400,000 Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. The colt carries 123 pounds, three 
less than Trapp Mountain, Double Quick and Clever Trevor, who are co-high 
weights in the 11-horse field. . . . In the $250,000 California Derby at Golden 
Gate Fields, Flying Continental is the 7-5 favorite, with Laffit Pincay seeking 
his fourth victory in the race. Flying Continental, second in the Santa Anita 
Derby, carries 117 pounds, two less than Endow in an eight-horse field.

Two-time Olympic medalist Kelly McCormick rallied from a two-point deficit on 
her final dive Friday to win the women's three-meter springboard event in the 
U.S. Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Ferguson of Boca Raton won the men's three-meter springboard title, and 
Pat Evans of Cincinnati took the one-meter springboard event. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick beat runner-up Wendy Lucero of Aurora, Colo., by five points for her 
ninth national title. Lucero led before the last of 10 dives, but McCormick's 
reverse 1 1/2-somersault with 2 1/2-twists gave her a total of 507.66 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero tried an inward 2 1/2-somersault but rippled too much water on entry, 
was outscored and finished with 502.89 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who finished third in the last two U.S. Olympic trials, showed he has 
recovered from shoulder surgery with a 19-point margin over runner-up Mark 
Bradshaw of Columbus, Ohio, who was fifth in the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, the NCAA three-meter springboard champion from the University of 
Cincinnati, had a 20-point margin over runner-up Mark Lenzi of Fredericksburg, 
Va., the NCAA one-meter champion. The competition was interrupted by rain 
Thursday.

<P>
National Football League teams spent Friday maneuvering for position in 
Sunday's draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Steelers obtained the Minnesota Vikings' first-round pick for 
Mike Merriweather, three-time Pro Bowl linebacker who sat out last season in a 
contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Viking General Manager Mike Lynn said that before the deal is final, the 
Steelers will have to sign Merriweather to a contract agreed upon by 
Merriweather and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Eagles sent seven mid- and late-round draft picks to the 
Chicago Bears for the Bears' third-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Florida State offensive tackle Pat Tomberlin, expected to be a 
mid-round pick, remained hospitalized after a traffic accident in which he 
faces criminal charges for drunk driving and careless driving. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals signed eight-year receiver Cris Collinsworth, who had 
become a free agent after the 1988 season.

SABATINI CLOSES IN ON ANOTHER TOURNAMENT WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini beat Linda Ferrando of Italy, 6-2, 6-3, Friday in 
the quarterfinals of the Eckerd Tennis Open at Largo, Fla., but the Argentine 
said the match was tougher than it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I made it a lot more difficult," Sabatini said. "It was hot to play 
out there. It was hard to move. There were many deuces in all the games. I made 
too many mistakes and was not really into the match." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini nonetheless advanced to today's semifinals. Her opponent will be No. 
4-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of Spain, who needed just 57 minutes to eliminate 
Rosalyn Fairbank of San Diego, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal pits No. 6 Sandra Cecchini of Italy against No. 8 Conchita 
Martinez of Spain. Cecchini dropped qualifier Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia, 
6-2, 6-2, and Martinez defeated Halle Cioffi of Knoxville, Tenn., 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, ranked third in the world, said she is eager to win the tournament as 
a follow-up to last week's upset victory over top-ranked Steffi Graf at Amelia 
Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good win over Steffi, but now I have to try to win this one," 
Sabatini said. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic and last year's surprise finalist, Jerome 
Potier of France, gained the semifinals of the $200,000 Swatch Open tournament 
at Nice, France. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 5-inch Ivanisevic, 17, who advanced to the quarterfinals of the 
Australian Open in January, beat Fernando Luna of Spain, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, and 
Potier defeated Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, in another 
quarterfinal match. Potier is ranked 254th in the world, Mancini 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union beat No. 3 Guillermo 
Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. The match was delayed two hours 
because of rain.

CANSECO ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF HANDGUN 
</P>

<P>
The off-field trials of Jose Canseco continued Friday when the Oakland 
Athletics' injured outfielder was arrested and charged with illegal possession 
of a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun on a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco had his injured left wrist examined by a doctor at the UC San 
Francisco's Laurel Heights campus when a passerby, walking through the parking 
lot, spotted Canseco's bright red Jaguar, looked inside and noticed a gun lying 
on the floor on the driver's side, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
The passerby then notified campus police, who waited for Canseco to return from 
his examination and booked him for investigation of possession of a loaded 
firearm on university property, a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was later released on $2,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of his attorney, Canseco declined comment, but Athletic general 
manager Sandy Alderson told reporters he had discussed the matter with Canseco, 
who told him he was carrying the gun because of a recent threat made against 
him and his wife, Esther. 
</P>
<P>
"In our conversation, Jose expressed some concern on his part over the safety 
of him and his wife following an incident that occurred a couple of weeks ago," 
Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Already this spring, Canseco has been charged with driving his car 120 m.p.h. 
in Florida, running a red light during spring training and committing three 
other traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not happy with these series of incidents, a series of possible 
violations of the law," Alderson said. "We don't like the kind of message it 
sends to our fans and to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"My evaluation of Jose is that he is a very naive young man who doesn't grasp 
the magnitude of the interest in him as an individual or the consequences of 
not abiding by the same rules that apply to you and me. 
</P>
<P>
"I am embarrassed for the organization, but I'm not totally unsympathetic to 
Jose. He has to come to grips with his own notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's court appearance has been scheduled for April 27.

Bo Jackson still isn't hitting for average, but he is certainly hitting for 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hit a two-run home run, his fifth homer of the season, to lead the 
Kansas City Royals to a 7-4 victory over the Red Sox Friday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who spends the fall and winter as a tailback with the Raiders, also 
stole three bases (as the Royals tied a club record with seven), went 2 for 3 
and scored three runs to help Floyd Bannister improve his record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has five doubles and seven stolen bases, but he is also batting below 
.250. 
</P>
<P>
His speed accounted for two runs. In the second inning, he walked, stole second 
and third and scored on a single. In the fourth, he singled, stole second and 
continued to third on an overthrow by catcher Rich Gedman. He scored on Bob 
Boone's double. 
</P>
<P>
Even Boone stole a base. Six of the Royals' steals came while John Dopson was 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he (Dopson) was slow to the plate, and the only thing we had to do was 
get a good jump," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Boone laughed about his stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stole because they were giving me third base," he said. "I feel sorry 
for Rich Gedman. I've never had a night like that, but it must be a terrible 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals turned five double plays and shut off a ninth-inning rally. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Texas 3 -- Dave Stieb held the Rangers to just three hits in eight 
innings at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (2-0) struck out eight as the Blue Jays handed the Rangers their third 
loss in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays jumped on Kevin Brown for two runs in the first inning and were 
never headed as they ended a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 2, Detroit 1 -- Jack Morris turned in his best performance of the 
season in this game at Milwaukee, but he still lost his fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bosio, as hot a pitcher as there is in the league, simply outpitched 
Morris. Bosio, in winning his third straight game without a loss, allowed six 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, four games below .500 for only the second time in his career, went the 
distance, giving up nine hits but only one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hits was a 400-foot home run by Glenn Braggs. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 6, New York 5 -- Joe Carter wouldn't mind hitting in this situation 
every night: He drove in the winning run with a single to left field through a 
drawn-in infield in the eighth inning at Cleveland as the Indians ended a 
six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"With the infield playing in, you just swing as hard as you can, because they 
don't have time to react if you hit it hard," Carter said. "I'm surprised they 
pitched to me with first base open." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Manager Dallas Green said he won't do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Baltimore 1 -- No pitcher in the American League won more games 
after the 1988 All-Star break than the Twins' Allan Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
He has picked up where he left off. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson held the Orioles to four hits and a run in seven innings at Baltimore 
to run his record to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
The only run Anderson gave up was the first American League home run by former 
Dodger Mike Devereaux in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Backman, another former National Leaguer, led the Twins' attack with 
three hits and two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 11, Chicago 1 -- Jerry Reuss retired the first six Mariners at Chicago, 
but then the roof fell in. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, who got 16 hits, scored four runs in each of the third and sixth 
innings, batting around both times. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Leonard hit his fifth homer for the Mariners. DAN HAFNER

The Cincinnati Reds figured to be one of the best hitting teams in the National 
League. Suddenly, however, they suddenly can't score runs. 
</P>
<P>
Even returning home didn't help. After being shut out in their last two games 
at Dodger Stadium, the Reds were shut out, 7-0, Friday night by pitcher Jim 
Deshaies and the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies pitched a four-hitter, didn't walk a batter and struck out nine. Two 
of the hits were infield singles by Barry Larkin and Eric Davis. Davis also had 
a double, and the other hit was a single by Chris Sabo. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, shut out 14 times last season, started their runless streak against 
Tim Belcher Tuesday night, getting four hits and no walks as Belcher struck out 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, the Reds had five hits and no walks and struck out four times 
against four Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros made it easy for Deshaies, knocking Rick Mahler out in the sixth 
after scoring five times. Mahler had allowed just one earned run in 22 innings 
and was leading the league in earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, New York 4 -- All last season, when he had a 13-14 record, Rick 
Sutcliffe didn't win consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't pitch exceptionally well, Sutcliffe became the first 
National League pitcher to win four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Met pitcher Bob Ojeda (0-3) gave up six runs and eight hits in 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe (4-0), who lasted 7 1/3 innings, had a 6-1 lead before he started 
getting into real trouble. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Atlanta 3 -- Benito Santiago's two-run double was the big hit in a 
four-run eighth inning at Atlanta that brought the Padres from behind and gave 
Bruce Hurst his second victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning when Dale Murphy hit a two-run 
home run to become Atlanta's all-time home run hitter with 336. Hank Aaron had 
just 335 of his 755 home runs while with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 1, Montreal 0 -- Jose DeLeon pitched a two-hitter at St. Louis to 
improve his record to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Morris hit a run-scoring single in the bottom of the ninth after Pedro 
Guerrero opened the inning with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Perez held the Cardinals to five hits in eight innings before Tim Burke 
lost it in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- Floyd Youmans went 6 2/3 innings at Pittsburgh 
to win his first game for the Phillies, and Tommy Herr drove in two runs, 
including the winning one. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel, playing in just his second full game after coming off the disabled 
list, had three hits and scored twice for the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds homered for the Pirates, who have lost five times in the last eight 
games. DAN HAFNER

CENSUS METHOD SUIT CLEARS LEGAL HURDLE 
</P>

<P>
A lawsuit that would change how the U.S. Census Bureau counts urban poor, 
potentially increasing financial aid and political power for Los Angeles and 
other large cities, cleared an important hurdle Friday when a federal judge 
here refused to dismiss the case and agreed with one of its fundamental claims. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin said that "the census 
has consistently under-counted the minority population." Moreover, the judge 
said it was clear that an under-count in states with large minority populations 
would result in a loss of political representation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the ruling today," said Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz, 
who reresented the city of Los Angeles. "Now, we can get down to the real 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
The next stage in the lawsuit will be a hearing, set for July, when the 
plaintiffs will present their case on how the Census Bureau should revise its 
methods and lawyers for the federal government will attempt to discredit the 
proposed revision. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a classic battle of experts," the judge said Friday. "The plaintiffs at 
this juncture sustained their argument." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin rejected the argument, made by the federal government, that the 
proposed revisions in methodology would require major changes and jeopardize 
the Census Bureau's mandate to present a finished census to President George 
Bush on Dec. 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not Congress' intent to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of timeliness," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census taking is scheduled to begin next March. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is an effort by a group of state and local governments -- among 
them the city of Los Angeles, the state of California, New York City and state, 
Chicago and Dade County, Fla. -- to gather a more accurate count of the 
millions of homeless people, illegal aliens, non-English speaking immigrants, 
transient black men and other people, mainly poor, who are prone to be missed 
by the census takers. 
</P>
<P>
Those bringing suit argue that the populations of many large cities are 
under-counted by 5% or more. By adding under-counted residents to the 
population rolls, the plaintiffs argue, cities and states would receive 
substantially more financial aid as well as increased political representation. 
</P>
<P>
"For Los Angeles," L.A. City Councilman Richard Alatorre said Friday, "the 
stakes are tens of millions of dollars that we lose every year and up to two 
more congressional seats that we would get." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said the city now receives about $280 million annually from the state 
and federal governments, much of the money based on general population and the 
number of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Technique 
</P>
<P>
Even before the lawsuit was filed last November, population research experts 
were predicting that growth in California would lay the foundation for five or 
six new congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, a more complete census could be conducted if the 
Census Bureau agreed to use a novel and controversial technique. The technique 
was developed by bureau personnel over the last decade, but rejected by the 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
It would take the form of a post-census survey, and is designed to pick up 
people missed by the census takers' first enumeration. The method would be to 
supplement the traditional head count with a form of random sampling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey Targets 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the survey would canvass 300,000 households, reflecting the 
American society as a whole, immediately after the census. Among the survey 
targets would be city neighborhoods where the census is considered most likely 
to miss people. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the initial head-count and the canvass then would be compared; 
the percentage difference between the two counts would be projected to other 
similar areas and, ultimately, provide the basis for adjusting the nationwide 
census. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates said the additional survey would find citizens that, for a variety of 
reasons, are often uncounted in the districts of urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the new method argue that the post-census survey would be as 
vulnerable to error as the initial census. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is not the first time the Census Bureau has faced legal challenges 
by cities and states that are convinced they have gotten short shrift. But this 
is the first time the bureau has found itself arguing against its own experts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Resigned 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran bureau officials who helped refine the new technique resigned after 
it was rejected, and one of them, Barbara Bailar, a former assistant director 
of the Census Bureau, has provided written testimony in support of the lawsuit 
to force adoption of the new technique. 
</P>
<P>
Bailar accused the Reagan Administration of playing politics when it rejected 
the post-census survey method. 
</P>
<P>
Big cities tend to be Democratic, and adding poor people and minorities to the 
population rolls of big cities serves to enhance their political strength.

PACT REACHED ON OLVERA ST. FUTURE STARTS TO UNRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No sooner had an agreement been reached to end the bickering over the future of 
Olvera Street then a new dispute surfaced between two prominent Latino 
politicians -- Rep. Edward R. Roybal and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre -- that threatens the truce. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Olvera Street's 77 merchants can link up with a developer 
of their choosing and bid on the long-awaited city modernization project to 
spruce up the popular but aging tourist spot just north of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, merchants said they were worried that the renovation would go to a 
developer who would allow them little or no say in the project and who might 
evict them. Most of them have been on the street since its founding in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants said they were suspicious that the East Los Angeles Community 
Union, which has strong ties to Alatorre, would be chosen for the project and 
would turn it into an "overly commercialized Mexican Disneyland," according to 
Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
With Roybal (D-Los Angeles), Mayor Tom Bradley, Alatorre and others, a 
compromise was struck last month. Under the pact, the merchants would be 
offered a chance to become part owners of the project. They would also get 
relocation costs while their shops and restaurants were being renovated, and a 
study the merchants commissioned two years ago would become the blueprint for 
the remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement, hammered out in the days before the April 11 municipal 
primary election, started unraveling this week in a dispute over whether the 
compromise precluded the merchants from also bidding for the project itself. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal, patriarch of local Latino politicians, favors allowing the merchants to 
bid on the project to preserve the street's historical and cultural integrity. 
He cited a city attorney's opinion that said there was nothing that precluded 
the merchants from being chosen as developer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Alatorre, in whose district Olvera Street is located, contends that there 
is no need to let the merchants bid on the project because the compromise would 
allow them to have some control over it. 
</P>
<P>
Eastside observers said the project could have started as early as next year, 
but the fallout from the new dispute throws that timetable into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"This blows the deal and will delay the work that Olvera Street desperately 
needs," one Latino insider said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre chose his words carefully when asked about the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"The bidding is not in the understanding that we negotiated," Alatorre said. 
"This could be a whole different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bidding Proviso 
</P>
<P>
Roybal, reached at his Washington office, said although the bidding proviso was 
not written into the agreement, it was clearly understood by everyone who was 
party to the pact, including Alatorre, that the merchants would be allowed to 
bid for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry that Richard doesn't agree or like the idea," the veteran 
congressman said, "but as far a I'm concerned, it's in the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was seen as a way to end the rancor that has dogged the Olvera 
Street project since the discussions over improvements were initiated in 1987. 
While attracting nearly 2 million visitors a year, the Mexican-theme tourist 
marketplace has fallen on hard times because of deteriorating buildings, a lack 
of parking and rising crime in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal, a longtime supporter of the merchants, called on Bradley to push a 
compromise earlier this month. The merchants' concerns were so important to 
Roybal that he insisted on Bradley's support before he would endorse the mayor 
for reelection, Roybal said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral endorsements by his daughter, Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard 
(D-Los Angeles), and City Councilwoman Gloria Molina were also tied to the 
mayor's support of the merchants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a news conference of elected public officials to make an 
endorsement of the mayor," Roybal said, "but this had to be resolved first." 
</P>
<P>
Left unresolved was the merchants' demand that they be allowed to bid for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice Sought 
</P>
<P>
Roybal said he telephoned the mayor early this month about it, and Bradley 
asked the city attorney's office for advice on the question. A few days later 
-- just before the election -- the city attorney issued an opinion that said no 
conflict of interest would exist if the merchants who purchased equity in the 
project were also chosen as developer. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has Alatorre fuming. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear since the beginning that they weren't interested in bidding on 
the development itself," Alatorre contended. "They were more interested in an 
equity position. We put (in) the 50% equity clause to insure that they wouldn't 
be thrown into the cold."

NEW WORLD OPENS FOR DEAF WAIF; 
</P>
<P>
HE HEARS FOR FIRST TIME IN YOUNG LIFE

<P>
Not long ago, 10-year-old Jose de Jesus Aguilar lived in his own silent world 
among the hundreds of young beggars and street urchins who roam the Mexican 
border city of Ciudad Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
But through a twist of fate, the deaf and mute boy has become an international 
celebrity. And this week, the world of speech and music was opened to him as 
Los Angeles doctors completed an operation on his inner ear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time he's ever heard anything," said Dr. Jack Pulec, after he 
connected a small, portable computer processor Thursday afternoon to an implant 
that had been placed inside Jose's ear last December. 
</P>
<P>
Jose seemed to enjoy the procedure as much as he would having a tooth pulled, 
crying and casting dirty looks at Pulec as the doctor placed a small probe in 
his ear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Sense of Hearing 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, however, the tears were gone and Jose began experimenting 
with his new sense of hearing by tapping crude melodies on an electronic 
keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting quietly and listening to the boy was a man who knows a little about 
keyboards and melodies himself -- pianist and singer Ray Charles. The blind 
musician's contributions to the nonprofit Ear International foundation helped 
pay for the $26,000 operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to meet him," Charles said. "He's a very nice little kid and this is 
a very wonderful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Jose now lives in a children's home in Ciudad Victoria, in the central Mexican 
state of Tamaulipas. His plane trip to Los Angeles and the operation were only 
the latest adventures in his short but eventful life. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Jose, then 8, was found wandering the streets of Ciudad Juarez, 
carrying all of his possessions in a small airline flight bag. Unable to 
communicate with the boy, social workers nicknamed him "Sabat," a name derived 
from the Spanish word for Saturday, the day he was found. 
</P>
<P>
The social workers spent eight months trying to learn Jose's identity, and when 
he began drawing graphic pictures of planes crashing, they concluded that he 
was the lone survivor of a family killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the boy's case had received international media attention. Jose was taken 
to the local airport, where, it was hoped, he would be able to identify the 
type of plane in which his family presumably had crashed. A French woman also 
claimed for a time that Jose was her long-lost grandson, although she later 
admitted that she was mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
The drawings, it turned out, were in part the product of Jose's overactive 
imagination. Social workers found his mother, a poor barmaid, 700 miles from 
Ciudad Juarez in a poor section of the city of Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico, 
near the city's airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lives in Orphanage 
</P>
<P>
The woman agreed to enroll Jose in the Casa Hogar del Nino, an orphanage where 
he now lives with 150 children. Sunday he will return to the home with his 
new-found sense of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something he's been waiting and hoping for," Jose Villacana, a 
psychologist at the home, said of the boy's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jose has learned to read lips and can make a few sounds, he has not 
yet learned to speak more than a few simple words, such as his new nickname, 
"Pepe." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Smith there is "a real good chance" that with the implant, Jose will 
learn to speak, although the process could take years. For now, he hears only a 
mixture of sounds which his brain must still learn to interpret. 
</P>
<P>
"It's new to him," Smith said. "We're dealing with nerves that haven't been 
exercised before." 
</P>
<P>
Jose's education in speech and sound should go well. By all accounts, the wiry, 
gap-toothed boy is something of a prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty sophisticated. He's already learned how to work this thing," Smith 
said, pointing to the small computer that had been attached to Jose's ear.

BRADLEY DROPS BID TO FINANCE TASK FORCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a swirl of questions about irregularities involving a city-supported trade 
task force he has personally promoted for several years, Mayor Tom Bradley on 
Friday abruptly withdrew his latest $121,000 funding request for the group. 
</P>
<P>
The action came as state and federal officials indicated that the UCLA-based 
Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles Relations, which has received nearly $400,000 
from the city in recent years, has not had the nonprofit corporation status it 
claimed in funding contracts with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the city controller's office, citing the task force's failure to 
file required spending records with the city, announced that it was launching 
an audit to determine how taxpayer funds have been used. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which its officials said conducts trade missions, seminars and 
other activities to promote business between Los Angeles and Africa, has come 
under scrutiny as part of the recent controversy over Bradley's personal 
financial ties with area firms that do business with the city. Bradley, who has 
lobbied hard to obtain funding for the task force, is an investor in a 
Riverside County land deal with the task force's $40,000-a-year director, 
Juanita St. John. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office is probing the mayor's acceptance of tens of 
thousands of dollars in fees from local financial institutions but refused 
Friday to confirm or deny whether the inquiry would be expanded to include the 
task force. However, Councilman Mike Woo, whose Governmental Operations 
Committee is preparing its own review of Bradley's finances, said the task 
force will be included in his committee's probe. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was on a trade mission in the Far East and could not be reached for 
comment. But in the past, he has denied his personal lobbying efforts on behalf 
of the task force -- calling council members to try to sway budget votes and in 
1987 vetoing a council effort to cut the task force's funding -- constitute a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday by his office, however, Bradley said some 
questions recently raised about the task force "are still in the process of 
being resolved." 
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, I have decided that it is in the best interests of 
the city of Los Angeles to withdraw the funding request for the task force in 
the 1989-90 Los Angeles city budget," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Hide 
</P>
<P>
St. John, in a telephone interview Friday evening, said she had nothing to hide 
and would give the city any records it wants. 
</P>
<P>
"I have filed exactly what they asked for," she said. "They never called me and 
told me they wanted more." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to say exactly what the task force's annual budget is because 
it gets businesses to pick up some costs, St. John said. She said the city's 
money has been used largely to pay her salary and for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she let the group's state nonprofit status lapse. But she 
said it was unnecessary because the task force is not collecting donations as a 
charitable trust. While the Internal Revenue Service disagreed, she insisted 
that the task force had the federal nonprofit recognition it needed. 
</P>
<P>
As for Bradley's move to withdraw funding for the agency, St. John said she is 
not bothered. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force will continue, " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Council hearings on that budget were scheduled to begin Monday. The mayor's 
critics predicted that his request on behalf of the task force -- a 23% 
increase over recent years -- would not survive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longtime Critic 
</P>
<P>
Because the task force lacks official recognition as a nonprofit corporation, 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a longtime critic of the organization, said he may 
push to recover the city funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears they are in violation of their contract," Yaroslavsky said. "If 
they are . . . they owe the city quite a bit of money." 
</P>
<P>
In contracts with city in recent years, the task force has identified itself as 
a "nonprofit corporation." 
</P>
<P>
However, the state Franchise Tax Board said Friday the group's nonprofit 
corporation status was suspended four years ago for failing to file a 1984 tax 
return. Jim Rebar, a board spokesman, said the organization has not filed 
returns since. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS, which also approves nonprofit organizations, said its records show the 
task force applied for that recognition, but it was never granted. Shirley 
Nakagawa, an IRS spokeswoman, said it was not clear why. 
</P>
<P>
The city's chief auditor, Tony De Guzman, said he hoped to begin delving into 
the task force's financial matters Friday morning, but St. John canceled her 
appointment, saying her husband was ill. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the city's apparent failure to demand required spending records or 
check the nonprofit status, De Guzman said, "I don't know how it got through."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRO-CHOICE BACKERS MARCH FOR RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 women chanting "Pro! Choice!" threaded through Westwood Village on 
Friday evening, looking to recruit supporters for a face-off with another 
Operation Rescue blockade of abortion clinics set for April 29 throughout the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pro-choice town," said Julie Schollenberger, a founding member of 
Fired Up for Choice, which was organized in the wake of Operation Rescue 
demonstrations and in anticipation of the pending U.S. Supreme Court decision 
on whether to limit abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
Schollenberger said Friday night that diners, shoppers and movie-goers "would 
wave at us, join in our chant" and drivers honked their horns as the group 
walked through the village for about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
They handed out flyers asking for volunteers to join them in countering the 
anti-abortion Operation Rescue at April 29 sit-ins at Southland clinics. A 
three-day March campaign resulted in the misdemeanor arrests of more than 1,000 
anti-abortion advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Schollenberger said police ticketed one marcher for jaywalking Friday evening 
and warned the group to keep an orderly line on the sidewalks.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD APPROVES NEW SITE FOR FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encouraged by a warm welcome from nearby Lake View Terrace homeowners, the San 
Fernando Valley Fair board voted Friday to move a scaled-down version of the 
annual fair to Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The location is less than ideal, board members said, because to win consent 
from nearby homeowners and the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, 
they agreed to ban carnival rides, concerts and sale of alcoholic drinks. Those 
were the major money-makers at past fairs. 
</P>
<P>
The fair, scheduled for July 14 to 16, will be restricted to such traditional 
country fair offerings as livestock exhibits, harvest celebrations, banjo 
contests, lumberjack competitions and craft booths. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the fair was ousted from Cal State Northridge after 13 years to 
make way for campus expansion. A tentative agreement to use a 30-acre cornfield 
at Pierce College fell through after Woodland Hills homeowners and the Los 
Angeles Community College District objected, saying the fair did not fit the 
college's master plan.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE INTERVENE IN BID TO END GANG FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what authorities called an effort to end a continuing war between two gangs, 
a task force of 125 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided and searched 
11 alleged gang hangouts Friday in Norwalk and Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Nine guns were seized during the searches of homes where members of the two 
gangs are known to live or hang out, Deputy Hal Grant said. Two suspected gang 
members were arrested for resisting arrest and a third for possession of a 
controlled substance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 15, members of the gangs had a gun battle at Los Nietos Park in Santa 
Fe Springs in which one youth was wounded in the stomach, Grant said. "In order 
to prevent further bloodshed and minimize their activities," he said, deputies 
acquired search warrants for the homes to seize weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were conducted by the Operation Safe Streets' anti-gang teams at 1 
p.m.

L.A.'S BLACK COMMUNITY IN DIRE STRAITS, NAACP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While announcing plans to hold the annual convention of the nation's largest 
civil rights organization in Los Angeles next year, NAACP Executive Director 
Benjamin L. Hooks said Friday that the city's black community is in dire 
straits because of the continuing plague of gang and drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The big surge we've had in gang warfare and shootings first surfaced in Los 
Angeles at the level it is surfacing now (nationwide)," Hooks said at a morning 
press conference. "And for those of us who travel nationally, we thought it 
would have been either New York or Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of reasons why we didn't think it would happen (here) -- less 
density residentially, a big sprawling city with a black mayor. . . . Nobody 
ever thought it would happen here. (And) I don't think that drug warfare has 
anywhere near reached the intensity it is going to reach." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said the 1990 conference of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People will be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center from July 7 to 
12. John Mance, a retired Lockheed employee and veteran civil rights activist, 
will serve as general chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the NAACP held its national convention here was in 1966, the year 
after the devastating Watts riots. The despair felt then by blacks, Hooks said, 
remains unchecked despite, or perhaps in part because of, the successes of the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
The work of the late Martin Luther King Jr., Hooks said, bred "a rising tide of 
expectation that one day America would rise up and live out its promise. It has 
not done that." 
</P>
<P>
And with a continued lack of adequate job and educational opportunities, he 
added, many young blacks now maintain an outlook "so disturbing that it's going 
to be difficult to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
"In Richard Wright's book, 'Native Son,' so many years ago, he said, 'Live 
fast, die young, make a pretty corpse.' We read those words and laughed at 
them. But it seems if you talk to a lot of young people you will discover that 
many of them do not (care) about living to be 30 or 40 or 50 years old. All 
they want to do is live big for a year or two. And they even say now if you 
tell them they may be dead in two months that, well, you've got to die 
sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said increased opportunities rather than intensified law enforcement are 
the long-range solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem is our national government does not realize the dimensions 
of the problem and has no concept of how to deal with it," he said. "You cannot 
simply eradicate drugs by putting out a paramilitary force. You'd have to have 
the National Guard and the federal Army in every square block of a big city 
like Washington. And they'd still find a way to sell drugs."

STUDENTS DEMAND THAT LABOR DISPUTE END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 Huntington Park High School students walked out of classes Friday 
morning to demand an end to a protracted labor dispute between Los Angeles 
Unified School District teachers and the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Citing concerns that graduation and college applications could be disrupted 
because of a teacher union-backed strategy to withhold official grades, the 
students staged a peaceful demonstration for several hours, beginning at about 
7 a.m. It was similar to the student protests that erupted in January at more 
than two dozen junior and senior high schools throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brandon Moore, a senior who helped organize the protest: "Hopefully, the 
union and the district can work faster (to reach a settlement) so we can 
graduate on time. That's the main thing, to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Round Classes 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park operates on a year-round calendar, which divides the academic 
year into staggered terms running generally from about July 1 to June 30. About 
140,000 of the district's 595,000 students attend year-round schools. A 
prolonged strike could interfere not only with graduation and promotions for 
all students but disrupt the start of year-round classes in July. School ends 
June 23 for students in regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
Midterm grades were due in district offices on April 7, but a district official 
said that about half of the district's 26,000 classroom instructors failed to 
turn them in. The union has advised its members to send grades home with 
students on a report card supplied by United Teacher-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Teachers 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Huntington Park students said they support their teachers' contract 
demands, which center on the size of a pay increase and proposals to give 
teachers greater decision-making authority in schools. But some expressed 
irritation at the tactics -- chiefly, the refusal of teachers to file official 
grades with school offices. 
</P>
<P>
"They can strike, but they can still give us our grades," said Alma Acosta, 17. 
"Why are they involving us?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're trapped in the middle," said Abigail Aguirre, 17, who plans to graduate 
in June. "They're not giving us our grades, so we won't graduate. But we think 
teachers deserve respect and a raise." 
</P>
<P>
Some students said their teachers encouraged them to join the walkout. One 
student said her teacher, whom she declined to name, excused her from class to 
participate in the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Another student said she learned about the protest in class Thursday from one 
of her instructors. The teacher "didn't tell us to do it but said, 'Do what you 
think is right,' " said Carla Mundy, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Carey, a spokeswoman for UTLA, said Friday that the union does not 
approve of student walkouts and "in no way encouraged" the protest. "I would 
hope that teachers would not encourage it because that's not our official 
position. We want kids to stay in school and get their education, and let UTLA 
and the district do the best they can to get a contract."

INTERIM HOSPITAL AIDS UNIT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Los Angeles County officials have acceded to requests to build an AIDS 
ward at County-USC Medical Center, attention turned Friday to whether AIDS 
patients in the meantime should be "congregated" in existing wards in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists, demonstrating outside the county health department headquarters 
in downtown Los Angeles, argued that patients would receive better care if they 
were housed together. They accused county health officials of flouting an order 
by the Board of Supervisors to set up an interim AIDS ward at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
Health and hospital officials countered that AIDS patients are better off as 
they are -- many of them assigned to wards with special equipment suited to 
their needs. They said the activists' demands are unreasonable in a hospital 
consistently filled to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 51 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related disease in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Flak' 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot of flak for 51 patients, many of whom require 
specialized isolation or services they are currently receiving," said Dr. Sol 
Bernstein, medical director of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public really needs to know that there are 1,450 patients there, 
and patients that are every bit as sick or sicker and require a lot of care, 
attention and effort," Bernstein added. "We're doing everything we can to 
improve the care of AIDS patients." 
</P>
<P>
The county is building a 20-bed AIDS ward at the giant, public hospital, which 
would mean that many acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients would still 
be housed in other wards. Until the ward's opening, scheduled for September, 
patients with AIDS and AIDS-related diseases are scattered throughout the 
hospital in many different wards. 
</P>
<P>
More than half a dozen are housed in the respiratory services ward because they 
require equipment like respirators. Others are in the intensive-care unit, 
officials said. Still others are in the communicable-diseases ward because they 
require isolation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Wards 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the remainder, between 20 and 30, are housed in six or 
seven general wards. Robert Frangenberg, head of AIDS programs for the 
Department of Health Services, said those housing patterns amount to some "de 
facto congregation." 
</P>
<P>
Members of ACT-UP Los Angeles, a militant AIDS activist group, would like to 
see all patients not requiring special services in a single ward. Such an 
arrangement would improve care, save money and offer a more supportive 
environment for patients, they say. 
</P>
<P>
They point to a Feb. 21 motion by the supervisors requiring that the health 
department find an area for AIDS patients "and thereafter bring together in 
that area within 60 days the maximum number of AIDS and ARC patients for whom 
this configuration will be medically appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"As of this time, 60 days have been up, and no beds have been congregated," 
said Michaeljohn Horne of ACT-UP. "The reason that we're upset is because it 
has been proven in other cities that congregating beds saves money and improves 
the well-being of patients." 
</P>
<P>
Frangenberg said the department has prepared a response to the supervisors' 
motion explaining why an interim ward is unfeasible and not in patients' 
interests. He said the hospital is so crowded that it is impossible to reserve 
a block of beds for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Flexibility 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with 105% capacity, you don't have a lot of flexibility," 
he said. "If you designate five beds (for AIDS patients) in one of the wards, 
what do you do -- leave the leukemia patient down in the (admission area 
awaiting placement)?" 
</P>
<P>
During their demonstration outside the health department, ACT-UP members called 
for the resignation of director Robert Gates and others. Earlier, the building 
had been splattered with red paint and graffiti protesting treatment of AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and does not endorse 
its use.

DISTRICT ACCUSED OF HIRING TEACHERS IN CASE OF STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Los Angeles teachers union accused the district Friday of 
recruiting college graduates to replace instructors who may strike May 30. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District denied the recruiting 
has to do with fears of a strike, insisting that it is part of the annual 
effort to fill the estimated 2,000 to 3,000 vacancies each fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teacher recruitment effort is not part of any plan to hire teachers in the 
event of a strike, district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said. "We've been doing 
this since 1984." 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents about 22,000 of the district's 
32,000 teachers, scheduled demonstrations today at three district recruiting 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The union will announce results Monday of a strike vote taken this week. 
Teachers earlier voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, but union leaders 
wanted a second vote to set a May 30 date for the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Recruiting 
</P>
<P>
UTLA President Wayne Johnson said the district has stepped up its recruiting 
efforts with newspaper advertisements. In previous years, the district usually 
limited recruiting to notices distributed by campus education departments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that the district is trying to recruit students, give them 
emergency credentials and put them in schools in the event of a strike," 
Johnson said. "It's like the old joke, 'Yesterday I couldn't spell teacher; 
today I are one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said teachers will pass out literature at recruiting sites warning 
potential recruits to wait until a new contract is signed before seeking a job 
with the district. The UTLA is seeking a 21% raise over two years, while the 
district has offered a pay increase of 20% over three years in the contract 
dispute that has lingered for more than a year. The union also wants expanded 
authority for teachers in school decision making. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union Sends Letter 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent last week to the departments of education at 12 local colleges 
and universities, UTLA officials warned seniors that if they teach during a 
strike, "they will be identified and tracked" after the strike ends. "These new 
teachers will have, to put it politely, extremely strained relations with union 
teachers at their school." 
</P>
<P>
The UTLA official who signed the letter said recruits who work during the 
strike will face retaliatory "aggravation" by veteran teachers when the strike 
is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that they will get beat up, but normally teachers go out of 
their way to help new teachers," said Sam Kresner, the UTLA's director of 
organizational services. "The warning to new teachers is that they will do as 
little as possible to help you." 
</P>
<P>
Some college officials said they were angered by the UTLA letter. Mimi Warshaw, 
head of teacher education at Cal State Dominguez Hills, said she did not post 
the letter because she believes its only purpose "is to frighten people into 
not interviewing with the Los Angeles district." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter that will be sent to the heads of the college education departments 
next week, Associate Supt. Irene Yamahara, who oversees hiring for the 
district, says: "Let me unequivocally assure you that the offers of employment 
currently being given to prospective teachers are for vacancies in the 1989-90 
school year and are not to replace potential striking teachers. . . . I am 
dismayed, as is the district, that your students would be subjected to veiled 
threats or intimidation implied in the letter." 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the drive is to recruit for vacancies in the fall," said 
Michael Acosta, who coordinates teacher recruitment for the district. He said 
2,000 teachers will be needed because of a growing student population and to 
replace teachers who retire or take other jobs.

Trustees of the Southern Baptists' only seminary west of the Rockies have voted 
to study the possibility of selling their valuable bay-side Marin County campus 
and relocating. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no place in mind" for relocation, said William O. Crews Jr., the 
former Riverside pastor who is president of Golden Gate Baptist Theological 
Seminary in Mill Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The first step, Crews said in an interview, was to "ask if we are being the 
best manager" of the 148-acre site in light of the potential value of the 
property, the housing costs for faculty and whether the seminary will have the 
capacity to train enough pastors for the growing number of Southern Baptist 
churches in western states. 
</P>
<P>
"At maximum, we could probably have no more than 1,000 students on campus," 
Crews said. "We have 600 now and mission projections would call for three times 
that many to be educated here." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees voted unanimously to explore "options for the best use of the Mill 
Valley property" during a regular meeting this month at the Southern California 
branch of the seminary in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Crews said about 100 students now study at the Brea facility on land donated by 
the neighboring Brea Center Baptist Church. "We just dedicated a building that 
will take care of 200 to 300 students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate seminary also has a branch campus in Portland, Ore.

Father Lawrence Estrada, the personal aide to Archbishop Roger M. Mahony since 
the prelate took over the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese in 1985, will end 
his duties Aug. 1. Estrada will be replaced by Father Kevin Kostelnik, whose 
position as associate pastor at St. Andrew's Church in Pasadena will be assumed 
by Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
The latter hopes to continue celebrating occasional clubhouse Masses for 
Catholics on the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Estrada indicated he won't miss the 
frequent helicopter trips with Mahony once the archbishop ends his current 
training.

United Methodists hope that 6,300 ticket-holding church members and clergy will 
show up and virtually fill the Shrine Auditorium Sunday afternoon for a large 
musical celebration, an event unprecedented for that mainline denomination in 
Southern California. "Proud to Be a United Methodist" is the announced theme 
for a talk by Bishop Jack M. Tuell. 
</P>
<P>
A daylong briefing on issues before the state Legislature, organized by the 
Rev. Glen Holman, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for ecumenical church councils, 
will be held Friday at Culver City United Methodist Church. It will feature 
talks by several members of the state Senate and Assembly. 
</P>

Author-priest Malcolm Boyd, saying he believes the sermon is "an art form 
neglected by our culture," will combine with performance artist Tim Miller for 
a "sermon-with-performance" during the 10:30 a.m. service Sunday at Santa 
Monica's St. Augustine by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. JOHN DART

THE PERSISTENCE OF PRYING EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government reports too often gather dust rather than generate action, and 
unfortunately that seems the fate to which industry has consigned federal 
recommendations to protect the privacy of employees and customers. In its 1977 
report, the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission expressed the belief that 
industry would voluntarily adopt fair information practices, but most have not. 
More than half the nation's largest employers don't tell workers what records 
they are keeping about them, and 38% have no policies to control how employee 
records should be made available to government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Following up on that 1977 report of the commission he chaired, University of 
Illinois professor David F. Linowes did another study and found that industry 
still does far too little to protect privacy. They make matters worse by using 
outdated or inaccurate records, and often sharing the data with outside credit 
agencies and landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have, however, taken a few important steps to provide greater 
privacy. Since 1979, when Linowes made a similar follow-up survey, he found 
that more companies have definite policies on privacy. More give workers access 
to their records. And more will send corrections to anyone who has received 
inaccurate information in copies of personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
Linowes wants Congress to limit to the essential minimum the information 
collected by employers. Further, he thinks employees should know what 
information has been collected and have the opportunity to check their files, 
and to seek legal remedies if their privacy has been violated. Those, he says, 
are the minimum guarantees of privacy, especially in the age of the computer 
which allows vast expansion of data collection and analysis.

THE UPROAR IN BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death a week ago of Hu Yaobang, who was forced to step down as the 
reform-minded leader of China's Communist Party in 1987 in the wake of 
nationwide demonstrations for greater democracy, has provided the occasion for 
Beijing's biggest public protests since 1976. The precipitating event 13 years 
ago was almost identical, as tens of thousands of Chinese took to the streets 
to mourn the death of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and condemn the radicals who 
had been responsible for the destructive Cultural Revolution. Then as now, to 
mourn was to make a political statement. This week's student-led protests, 
which have continued despite occasional police stong-arm tactics and repeated 
orders to disperse, have been marked by demands for greater democracy, 
denunciations of ruling officials and questioning of the regime's political 
legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a remarkable demonstration of defiance and courage, very much in a 
Chinese tradition that dates back to the last century, and surprising not just 
for its intensity but also for the relative tolerance the authorities have 
shown by letting things run on. The regime, of course, retains the power to 
quash the protests and arrest those participating in them. It has not hesitated 
to do so before, most recently in 1987. But even if steps are taken to punish 
the protesters, their message must still be taken seriously. The resentment 
that has been manifested against authoritarianism, lack of intellectual 
freedoms, and -- increasingly explicit -- alleged corruption among the party's 
leaders won't disappear when the protests are suppressed or abate. 
</P>
<P>
The students and intellectuals expressing these views represent only a tiny 
fraction of China's 1.1 billion people. But it is this fraction, the educated 
elite, on whom China's hopes for future modernization and increased prosperity 
largely depend. The demonstrators demand more democracy. They aren't likely to 
get it, at least now, but neither are they likely to abandon their claims and 
retreat into political passivity. They know that, and so does the regime.

Nicaragua's revolutionary government this week began the complex process of 
preparing for a national election early next year. The first steps in the long 
process were not easy, and they provide a glimpse of the controversies still to 
come as the Sandinista government jockeys for ascendancy over rival political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas agreed to move up the date of their nation's 1990 election from 
November to February as part of a peace agreement negotiated among the five 
Central American presidents. To begin carrying out that agreement, Nicaragua's 
National Assembly voted Tuesday to amend the nation's election laws. But 
opposition Assembly members walked out, claiming that many of the amendments 
enacted by the Sandinista-dominated Assembly favor Sandinista candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders are particularly troubled by the proposed membership of a 
five-person Superior Electoral Council, which will regulate all aspects of the 
campaign and oversee next year's voting. Under existing law, all members of the 
council will be named by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. Acknowledging a 
stacked deck, Sandinista officials offered to compromise, saying that Ortega 
would name any two persons the opposition selected to the council, along with 
two Sandinista loyalists. The fifth appointee would be an "independent eminent 
person." But when opposition leaders wanted that guarantee written into law, 
the Sandinistas refused. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's voting could well be the most pivotal election in Nicaraguan 
history. It could mark the end of a decade of political turmoil and violence 
that began when the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza was overthrown. The 
Sandinistas played a key role in that revolution, but they did not bring the 
dictator down without help. Whether the Sandinistas like it or not, the burden 
of proof that Nicaragua's elections will be fair and open is on them. That 
means they must be ready to compromise with the opposition on all the electoral 
disputes that are sure to arise in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega could get the process off to a constructive start with a written 
guarantee that Nicaragua's Electoral Council will be a truly balanced and 
independent body.

At least one of the charges of the House Ethics Committee regarding the conduct 
of Wright portends an interesting philosophical question: In the minds of the 
goose and gander, is that which is good for one necessarily good for the other? 
</P>
<P>
One thing my mother never let me forget was that my father never would pay her 
poll tax. One was a Lincoln Republican, and the other was a Roosevelt Democrat. 
My father said that he didn't want my mother to kill his vote, and my mother 
said that she might have voted like he wanted her to vote, but that she wasn't 
going to let him tell her how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
I reckon it's insignificant to the point of this letter, but mother always 
finished that story by saying that on the first election day after the poll tax 
was abolished and she could have voted, dad took her fishing.

EARMARKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY: 'A NEW PLAN FOR FOREIGN AID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I strongly disagree with a key point raised in your editorial "A New Plan for 
Foreign Aid" (March 29). You implied that "earmarking and conditionality 
written into law" are the culprits in the U.S. foreign aid program and offered 
your support for broad general priorities recommended by a congressional task 
force report. 
</P>
<P>
The existing foreign aid bill, originally written in 1961, has, in fact, 
laudably stated general priorities. Earmarking and conditionality crept in, it 
would seem, because even the most laudably stated priorities are prey to 
conflicting interpretations and inevitable tinkering. The public generally 
perceives foreign aid as being rife with corruption and inefficiency, lining 
the pockets of defense and development contractors and foreign leaders while 
doing little for the people it is intended to help. 
</P>
<P>
What has been missing in foreign aid legislation and is also missing in the 
recommendations you endorse, is measurable accountability. More than a billion 
people in developing countries live day-by-day in the shadow of hunger, 
malnutrition, disease and ignorance. The toll (an estimated 15-plus million 
deaths each year) is most clearly reflected in child mortality and illiteracy 
rates which can be measured. They are the same things the U.S. had to conquer 
when it was a developing country. 
</P>
<P>
Accountability through measurable goals should not be confused with inflexible 
earmarking. Specific goals for reducing child mortality and illiteracy should 
be cornerstones of U.S. foreign aid policy, and not merely implied in otherwise 
meaningless rhetoric.

The front page of The Times (April 13) was a real lulu. Three separate stories 
dealing with the strange topic of "ethics." One on Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) 
and his problems with the House of Representatives. Another one describes our 
noble Mayor Tom Bradley deciding at this late date to divest himself from the 
savings and loan with its sizable contributions to his pocket. And lastly, our 
noble President Bush deciding on a list of "ethics" for the national 
government.

We all know about man's inherent crookedness -- the sleaze that infects all

WILSON'S BILL FOR CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is correct in its editorial "Crossroads for Child Care" (March 28) 
that the time appears right for national legislation designed to increase the 
supply of quality, affordable child care for working families. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Act for Child Care (better known as the ABC bill), which The Times 
applauds, fails to meet the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the good intentions of its author, Sen. Christopher Dodd 
(D-Conn.), I believe the bill is misguided in several respects: it is overly 
reliant on the federal government; it fails to adequately address the issue of 
accessibility, and it simply costs too much. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC bill would set up a national advisory committee for the purpose of 
establishing national child-care standards. 
</P>
<P>
These standards would be imposed on states without regard to each state's 
unique needs and could not be modified even if the standards were found too 
stringent to allow for special state circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Further, states would not be allowed to use federal funds to support any 
child-care projects that failed to meet federally-mandated requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps of greater concern, parents who received federal child-care funds could 
not send their children to child-care providers who failed to fully comply with 
these national standards even though that provider currently meets all state 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
This one-size-fits-all approach to child care I believe wrongfully interferes 
with a parent's basic right to determine the most appropriate child care for 
their children. Instead, each state -- and not an ad hoc national committee -- 
should have the authority to set standards based on their unique needs. The 
parents of children -- and not Washington bureaucrats -- should be able to 
choose what is the appropriate type of child-care service for their children. 
</P>
<P>
While the ABC bill expands the power of federal bureaucrats to rule over the 
prerogatives of American families, it fails to provide sufficient incentives 
for the establishment of new programs. The net result is child-care providers, 
unable to cope with burdensome regulations, will close their doors with few new 
providers stepping in to take their place. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the ABC bill falls short on the question of accessibility. Due to the 
funding structure of the ABC bill, many eligible low-income families would be 
denied access to child-care services. About 70% of the funding provided in the 
bill would be directed to provide assistance to about 750,000 children 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the demand for child-care services is far greater. To put this in 
perspective, a million children in California alone are in need of child-care 
services. The question arises: What about the other families who qualify for 
support? Are they just out of luck, or will the federal government be expected 
to approrpriate even more money? 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the ABC bill, I have authored the KIDS in Day-Care 
Services Act, or the KIDS bill. This bill would establish a working partnership 
among the federal government, states, and the private sector. It would maintain 
parental choice for the selection of child-care services, encourage the 
establishment of new services by private industry, and provide revenues to 
offset the cost of assisting low-income families for child-care services. 
</P>
<P>
The KIDS bill would ensure access to child care for all eligible families 
through the establishment of a new, refundable "children's tax credit" for low- 
and modest-income families. For those families who do not earn enough to pay 
taxes, KIDS would also make the current dependent care tax credit refundable. 
Families could choose between the two credits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the KIDS bill, each state, and not a federal commission, would set 
specific standards for services based on their unique needs. Parents would have 
the opportunity to determine the appropriate type of child care for their 
family without losing eligibility for state and federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing the demand for child-care services will increase, the KIDS bill 
offers tax credits and insurance funding for small businesses to encourage the 
establishment of on-site or near-site child-care facilities.

cost only $2 billion over the same four-year period when taking into 
consideration offsetting revenues.

NIXON AND VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taylor's letter states that "in 1970, American and South Vietnamese forces were 
suffering terrible and unnecessary losses at the hands of the communist troops 
. . . ." In view of the fact that the Vietnamese were defending their fight for 
independence against devastating attacks by the Americans, who had flown over 
10,000 miles to wipe them out, I have to agree that the suffering and losses on 
both sides were tragically unnecessary. What were we doing killing people in 
their own tiny country who had done absolutely nothing to us? 
</P>
<P>
We were doing the same thing the Ayotollah vows to do to Salman Rushdie. He 
claims that if you write something blasphemous about the prophet you must die. 
The American government says if you propose to create a socialist/communist 
form of government you must die -- and we've carried out this Cold War agenda 
all over the world (most recently Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan, Grenada, 
etc.). We have tried -- and failed -- to wipe out the Russian, Chinese, Cuban 
and Vietnamese revolutions, and now we are working on Nicaragua and El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tragedy that few high school and college students learn that when the 
French finally admitted defeat in the Vietnam struggle for independence, we 
secretly took over, starting with covert CIA operations and continuing to 
escalate the war as the Vietnamese refused to cry "uncle," until at last 58,000 
Americans died and untold numbers of Vietnamese and their families -- and for 
what? Because socialism/communism was the system the Vietnamese were struggling 
for, rather than capitalism. When will we learn that there is more than one 
social/economic/political system in the world and that we can't insist that it 
be our way or no way?

RE-CREATION OF NIJINKSKY'S 'SACRE' KEEPS GETTING BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet's reconstruction of Vaslav Nijinsky's watershed ballet "Le 
Sacre du Printemps" was introduced to Orange County on Thursday, capping a 
program devoted to works created for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. 
</P>
<P>
It was simply sensational. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacre" made dance and music history in 1913 when audiences rioted at the Paris 
premiere. Which had proved more inciting -- Stravinsky's rhythm-mad score or 
Nijinsky's violently anti-classical choreography? For nearly 74 years, the 
answer had to be Stravinsky's music, because the choreography had virtually 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
But dance historian Millicent Hodson and art historian Kenneth Archer 
painstakingly re-created the work for Robert Joffrey, and the answer to the 
question perhaps shifted to Nijinsky's corner when the provocative results were 
first seen in 1987 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company has grown only stronger in the chugging steps, foot 
stompings, vertical arm thrusts, massed circlings, hypnotic rituals, visual 
counter-rhythms and eerie delicacy of women floating upon raised toe. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, the company also 
more powerfully projected a sense of inner drama, swooping in response to the 
Old Woman (Carole Valleskey) whose divinations will precipitate events, 
cowering from unseen dread overhead, shuddering spastically at the Old Sage's 
charisma. 
</P>
<P>
Beatriz Rodriguez has sharpened her portrayal as the Chosen One, combining rage 
and swooning weakness in "Petrushka" gestures, and evoking sympathy as the 
character worked to keep her legs from giving way because she seemed to know 
that as long as she could keep moving, she could stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
But "Sacre" is by no means entirely kinetic. Stop-action interrupts impelled 
movement, underscoring parallels with another work on Thursday's program, 
"L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" (to Debussy's score), Nijinsky's first effort at 
choreography, created less than a year before. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Walters was seen as the Faune when the Joffrey danced at the Center in 
September, 1987. Walters has deepened an already fine conception, adding 
nuances to the stages of emotional transition, particularly in transforming 
awakening sensuality into vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Gehm again was the warm Leader of the Nymphs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Narbutus made his first local appearance as the Chinese Conjurer with an 
otherwise familiar cast in Leonide Massine's "Parade" (music by Satie). 
Narbutus hovered weightlessly in impressive bounds, hissed with visceral power 
and uncovered feline aspects of the role. But his leg work was not yet fully 
tensed, crisp or sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Pacific Symphony played securely for John Miner ("Parade" and 
"Faune") and Allan Lewis ("Sacre"). 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey Ballet performs through Sunday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. At 2 p.m. the ballet will dance 
"Parade," "L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" and "Le Sacre du Printemps." A second 
performance, at 8 p.m., includes "Cloven Kingdom," "Billy the Kid" and "Suite 
Saint-Saens." Tickets: $13 to $39. Information: (714) 556-2787.

A USER OF WELL-WORN PROPS, BRUCE BAUM CAN BOMB OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Baum's appearance this week at the Irvine Improvisation calls local 
attention to the Great Prop Debate that rages in stand-up comedy. (OK, maybe it 
doesn't exactly rage, but it does exist.) 
</P>
<P>
One side, certainly the majority, looks down its collective nose at prop 
comedy, dismissing it as an easy, bastardized form of stand-up. The attitude is 
that performing with props is akin to the way Rosie Ruiz runs marathons: You 
arrive at the punch/finish line, but it's kind of like taking a bus to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The other side counters that it's a perfectly valid form, that if it entertains 
people and makes them laugh, nothing else should matter. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of it, of course, comes down to individuals: How bright and creative is 
this comic's use of props? There is a cream of the prop crop: Gallagher, Rich 
Hall, Steve Martin (in his stand-up days), Gary Mule Deer and precious few 
others. Baum clearly used to belong to that group. But his show Wednesday at 
the Improv raised serious questions about whether he still does. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he performed for exactly 40 minutes, about the bare minimum for 
a headliner. And there were a few occasions when you could almost hear the 
bottom of the barrel being scraped. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't help but feel that he was coasting: Many of Wednesday's bits have 
been in his act for several years, and some of the musical references and 
parodies were quite dated. 
</P>
<P>
Letting your act get stale is dangerous in any form of stand-up (any form of 
entertainment at all, for that matter), but if you are specializing in prop 
routines and/or song parodies -- which have an extremely short shelf life -- 
it's deadly. This problem was evident even during Baum's straight monologue 
material, and it was telegraphed as early as his opening piece. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing his irritation with advertising, he pointed to that commercial where 
Mark Harmon is standing in the middle of a Rocky Mountain stream: "He's 
standing in the stream, going 'Hey, only Coors uses the finest of Rocky 
Mountain spring water.' (I'm thinking) 'Get your feet out of my beer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even if that were a lot funnier, there would still be a nagging question: How 
many years has it been since that spot was put on the air -- or, more 
importantly, taken off? 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he later held up a cassette player that blared the Cars' "Shake It 
Up." Then, over the instrumental break, he proceeded to sing "Monster Mash," 
making the implicit point that the tunes are the same. It was a neat 
observation, though it might have seemed more inspired if the newer song wasn't 
8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps all this would have been less disappointing if Baum hadn't once seemed 
to be one of comedy's more innovative performers, or if there weren't hints 
Wednesday that he still could be quite inventive, verbally and visually. 
</P>
<P>
When working as a straight monologuist, many of his better bits involve a 
clever switch, usually a last-second maneuver away from the punch line that you 
think he's heading for: "When I was younger, I got this girl in trouble -- I 
framed her for murder," or "Anybody here into hunting at all? I've been getting 
into nonviolent hunting: I only go after lemmings, cause all you need is a 
cliff and a bucket." 
</P>
<P>
As for sharper prop stuff, he used a globe to punctuate this confession: "I 
couldn't kill a fly. I couldn't even hurt a fly, though I don't mind (messing) 
with their heads. Matter of fact, what I like to do is, I like to catch a bunch 
of flies, hold 'em above a globe of the world and watch 'em all go 'Ahhhh! I'm 
way too high!' " 
</P>
<P>
But this kind of inspired whimsy was offset by some weak visual business. 
Explaining, for instance, that "the doctor told me when the lights are this 
bright, I should be wearing my prescription glasses," he held up eyeglasses 
with prescription bottles for lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Even things that seemed to bode well got away from him. He revealed that he was 
considering going into ventriloquism, but without a dummy, using an eyelid -- 
which he called "Wilbur" -- instead. 
</P>
<P>
Both the premise and the execution were wonderfully ludicrous. Then he turned 
ventriloquism further on its side when he announced that he would sing a song 
while Wilbur drank a bottle of contact lens solution, inviting song requests 
from the audience. But one guy's shouted request -- "I Can See Clearly Now" -- 
was probably the single funniest moment of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of night: It not only bolstered the position of the anti-prop 
comic faction, but -- for the moment, at least -- eliminated Baum from that 
group of funny folks performing prop comedy exceptionally well. Say it aint' 
so, Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining a bill that also includes Frank King and Stan Sellers, Baum 
continues at the Irvine Improv through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Improv is at 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Showtimes: 8 and 10 tonight and 
8:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $8 to $10. Information: (714) 854-5455.

CRITICISM DIRECTED AT REVIEWER'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rarely do I take the time to respond to a review. I must, however, take 
exception to Mark Chalon Smith's review of my production of "Lu Ann Hampton 
Laverty Oberlander" (" 'Lu Ann' Offers Flavor Over Substance," Calendar, April 
12) largely because he is so completely wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the script "neglects to tell us much about her or how she got to be 
the person she is." Nothing is further from the truth. The play is riddled with 
recall as the character fills us in on the consequences that have shaped her 
life. Evidently, Smith is far more used to TV, where all one has to do is watch 
instead of listen. 
</P>
<P>
Smith indicates that a "more complex performance might be able to" transcend 
the "superficial" script. Deborah-Leigh Schmidt's performance is so complex 
that audience members have failed to recognize her as the same actress in all 
three acts. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's evaluation of Mark Perkins portrayal of Skip is that "he does pretty 
well." What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
Smith, moreover, missed the carefully layered nuances in the play that make the 
script strong and actually replicate the sadness and stagnation from decade to 
decade. To anybody with a trained eye, it is almost painfully obvious that 
daughter Charmane's teen-age years mirror those of the now adult Lu Ann, and 
that her future is just as dim as Lu Ann's past has been. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a superficial script, only a superficial review / reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure you won't have the nerve to print this. What is more unfortunate is 
that you will continue to print the unsophisticated drivel of Mark Chalon 
Smith, who desperately needs some classes in dramatic theory and criticism.

CUTBACK SEEN IN BUSH REQUEST FOR 'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will ask Congress for about $4.7 billion for the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile program next year, substantially less than the $5.9 billion 
President Ronald Reagan requested in his final budget but more than most 
congressional Democrats have been willing to spend, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal would accelerate work on ground-based systems of rocket 
interceptors and continue research on more futuristic space-based weapons, but 
at a reduced pace from that recommended by Reagan. The current budget contains 
$3.9 billion for "Star Wars," formally known as the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, or SDI. 
</P>
<P>
A key component of the Bush "Star Wars" proposal would be development of a 
weapon known as "brilliant pebbles," swarms of small space-based interceptors 
designed to knock out Soviet ballistic missiles headed toward the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Because of budget constraints, however, the entire "Star Wars" program will be 
pushed back about two years, officials said. The earliest possible deployment 
of any components -- probably ground-based -- is now set for sometime after the 
year 2000, they said. 
</P>
<P>
On another major weapons question, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is struggling 
to craft a political deal with congressional leaders on which of two land-based 
nuclear missiles to build, the 10-warhead MX transported on rail cars or the 
single-warhead Midgetman carried on trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Friday that the Administration is likely to ask for immediate 
deployment of the MX on rail cars and, in a compromise with congressional 
Democrats, to seek funds to continue developing -- but not to deploy -- the 
Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney had recommended to Bush that Midgetman be killed because of its 
$24-billion price. Pulling the existing 50 MX missiles from their silos and 
placing them on flatbed rail cars would cost $5.4 billion, according to the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Wars" funding and the choice between the MX and Midgetman have been among 
the most contentious weapons issues facing the government in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, over the objections of Democrats on Capitol Hill, advocated aggressive 
development of space weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The missile issue has congressional Democrats, who favor the Midgetman, on one 
side and the White House and the Air Force, which are pushing the big MX 
missile, on the other. Congressional leaders have threatened to kill the 
rail-borne MX if funds for the smaller missile are deleted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoided Contra Fight 
</P>
<P>
Bush's approach to both controversies parallels his strategy on another point 
of friction with Congress -- support for the Nicaraguan rebels. He avoided a 
bruising fight on the Contras early in his Administration by cutting a deal 
with congressional leaders before announcing a formal policy. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official, a strong MX advocate, called the proposed missile 
compromise "preemptive surrender." He complained that such deals only embolden 
congressional Democrats to meddle in executive branch decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney met with Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft Friday to 
discuss a plan to keep both missiles alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aide Favors Small Missiles 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft has long supported small mobile missiles because they present an 
unattractive target for the Soviet military, which would first have to find 
them and then expend a large number of warheads to destroy them. He was 
chairman of a 1983 commission that urged building a mobile single-warhead 
missile as a means of ensuring the survivability of the nation's land-based 
missile force. 
</P>
<P>
The national security adviser spoke up forcefully in favor of the Midgetman in 
a White House meeting on Tuesday. Cheney presented the Defense Department view 
that the country did not need the small missile and could not afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen an opening gambit," one Defense Department official said of 
Cheney's initial MX-only recommendation to the President. "We have not seen the 
final move." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney himself acknowledged the possibility that his view would not prevail 
when he said Tuesday: "It may be we come up with some kind of mix out of the 
options that have been provided." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Cheney met with the chairmen and ranking members of the House 
and Senate Armed Services committees and defense appropriations subcommittees 
to discuss the missile question and his budget priorities. Among the 
congressional leaders were staunch Midgetman advocates, including Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) and Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
None of the participants would comment on the session. Officials familiar with 
the meeting said that Cheney had sounded out the lawmakers on a possible 
compromise on the missile issue but did not commit the Administration to 
funding the Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
A possible compromise that was discussed would be to take about $300 million of 
the savings from the "Star Wars" cutback and apply it to continued work on the 
Midgetman, sources said. The program could be kept alive at that funding level 
for several years, with the cost rising later if the government decided to 
deploy the missiles, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Costs Cited 
</P>
<P>
But defense experts warned that stretching out weapons programs increases their 
cost and often produces weapons that are obsolete by the time they are fielded. 
The Air Force has warned that a decision will have to be made immediately if 
the Midgetman is to be deployed by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) said that a compromise linking a rail-mobile MX 
with a limited Midgetman development program "would be unbeatable . . . . I 
think he could win with this." 
</P>
<P>
But, if Bush does not bend, he said, congressional partisans of the Midgetman 
are likely to override him and retaliate against the rail-garrison program.

Tens of thousands of students demonstrated in central Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square early today in a dramatic public rejection by China's elite youths of 
Communist controls 
</P>
<P>
At least 20,000 to 30,000 students -- some estimates ran as high as 80,000 -- 
marched to the square in a miles-long procession late Friday evening from 
university campuses in northwestern Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The marching column of students, chanting, "Long live democracy," were greeted 
upon their post-midnight arrival by another crowd of about 30,000 cheering 
supporters already at the square or lining the street approaching it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bystanders Sympathetic 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, there had been even more people in the area, perhaps as many as 
100,000. But observers said as much as half of that crowd was composed of 
by-standers and the curious, although they seemed sympathetic to those whose 
protests they were watching. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers sang China's national anthem and the revolutionary socialist hymn, The 
Internationale, both of which call for revolutionary action in strong language. 
</P>
<P>
The students also carried banners calling for freedom of the press and 
demanding that civil liberties guaranteed in China's constitution be granted in 
practice. Banners and chants criticized the police for allegedly using force in 
breaking up a demonstration early Thursday morning.

It took more than two hours after the arrival of the head of the procession for 
the entire column to file into the square, where student organizers kept order 
among the total crowd of about 50,000 to 60,000 and directed a sit-down 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Students marched in groups according to their universities, and it appeared 
that at least two dozen schools, including a few from other cities, were 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who drove through streets near the square saw dozens of army and 
police trucks bring at least 2,000 troops or police to the area. A thin line of 
soldiers stood guard before the Great Hall of the People on the west side of 
the square, but the security forces took no immediate action against the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hours before dawn, however, many expected the police to try to 
clear the square. 
</P>
<P>
This was partly because during the pre-dawn hours Wednesday and Thursday, 
police forcibly cleared thousands of protesters from a major thoroughfare in 
central Beijing near Zhongnanhai, a compound that houses the headquarters of 
the Communist Party and government. At least a few students were roughed up by 
police in the second of these incidents, and many banners complained about 
this. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the official Chinese media announced Friday that access to the square 
will be restricted from 8 a.m. this morning to ensure order during a 10 a.m. 
memorial service at the Great Hall of the People for the late Communist Party 
leader Hu Yaobang. Many top leaders were to attend the memorial, and the image 
of tens of thousands of students gathered in the square to sing revolutionary 
songs and chant for democracy is a severe embarrassment to China's rulers. 
</P>
<P>
Hu, who died of a heart attack April 15 at the age of 73, was widely viewed as 
the most liberal of China's leaders. As such, he enjoyed great popularity among 
intellectuals. But he was ousted from the party leadership two years ago, 
partly for being too lenient during earlier demonstrations for greater 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations of the past week have nominally been in his honor. Some 
banners and posters at the square this morning paid homage to Hu, but it was 
clear that for many students his death was simply a convenient excuse to 
justify pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
As the night progressed, many in the crowd drifted away, leaving perhaps 10,000 
or 15,000 as dawn broke. About that time, a rumor began to spread through the 
crowd that an agreement had been reached between student representatives and 
the government. It was said that so long as the protesters remained orderly, 
the police would not take action to drive them from the square. 
</P>
<P>
During the night, students sat or stood in groups, discussing political issues 
or singing songs. A series of speakers climbed onto the Monument to the 
People's Heroes, bedecked with wreaths and a photograph of Hu. Among them was 
Ren Wanding, an activist in the 1978 "Democracy Wall" movement who served 
prison time as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"People are praying for the awakening of a legal system," Ren said. "This is a 
historical necessity. Democracy Wall lives again!" 
</P>
<P>
In 1978 and early 1979, authorities allowed a brick wall several blocks west of 
Tien An Men to be plastered with political writings and wallposters. This 
unaccustomed freedom of expression, not long after the repressive era of the 
Cultural Revolution, drew daily crowds of readers and became known as the 
Democracy Wall. In a later crackdown by authorities, the writings were banned, 
some writers such as Ren were tried and jailed, and the wall itself was torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the current dissidents Friday voiced rare public criticism of China's 
paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, who has masterminded a decade of generally 
successful economic reforms but who has refused to allow major political 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leader is old," one speaker told the crowd. "Maybe he is crazy. Many 
people hope he will die." 
</P>
<P>
One of the hundreds of student organizers in the square said in a brief 
interview that one purpose of the demonstration is to push Deng from power. 
</P>
<P>
Deng has served his country well in the economic reforms, but China has now 
progressed enough that he should step down to make way for younger people who 
understand the country's new situation better, this man said. Chinese students, 
he added, would prefer an American-style system where leaders serve fixed terms 
of office and then give up power. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before dawn, a spokesman with a hand-held battery-powered loudspeaker 
read out a new list of demands drawn up by a caucus of student leaders: a 
proper re-evaluation of Hu Yaobang, acknowledging his contributions; press 
freedom; more funds for education and intellectuals' pay; a repudiation of 
anti-liberal political campaigns of the 1980s; truthful reporting in the 
Chinese press of Thursday morning's demonstration at Zhongnanhai and the police 
action against it, and safety for students who have led the past week of 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought communism was a selfless system," said one student in the crowd. 
"But we've achieved no such thing. We have a new feudal dynasty. We are very 
pessimistic. It looks like communism was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Another student encouraged the crowd over a hand-held loudspeaker: "The final 
victory surely belongs to us! The final victory surely belongs to the people!"

SOCIAL SECURITY UNDER FIRE FOR ROUTING CALLERS TO OFFICES THAT CAN'T HELP THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Social Security Administration's national toll-free number becomes so 
overloaded on busy days that many calls from Los Angeles are routed to 
Pittsburgh, where no service operators speak Spanish, and calls from 
Pennsylvania coal miners about black-lung benefits are shifted to New Jersey, 
where the topic is a mystery, a congressional hearing was told Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always tell when an employee in my office has a Spanish (speaking) 
caller because they talk extra loud," said Joy Sloan, a Social Security service 
representative from Pittsburgh. "It's a frustrating and impossible task" when 
20% of the calls dialed in the Los Angeles region between 2 and 3 p.m. are 
shifted to Pittsburgh on busy days, she told the House Aging Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Force Being Cut 
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration has been reducing its work force for five 
years, and last October it initiated a national toll-free service to maximize 
the use of available operators. In most parts of the country, Social Security 
abolished the local telephone numbers for its offices, replacing them with the 
single toll-free number, 1-800-234-5772. 
</P>
<P>
When calls in one place get backed up, they can be routed automatically to any 
of the 37 tele-service centers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the result is sometimes not hometown-like service. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied," said Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), the committee 
chairman, angered because he had previously been assured by Social Security 
officials that bilingual telephone service representatives would be on duty 
throughout the country. "I want to see them in place in 30 days," he said in an 
interview after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Beneficiaries 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide line is used by persons seeking information about retirement and 
disability benefits, complaining about checks that did not arrive and arranging 
appointments at local offices. 
</P>
<P>
On seven heavy calling days in March and five in April, 20% of the calls made 
in the Los Angeles region between 2 and 3 p.m. were routed to Pittsburgh 
operators. "Numerous calls from Spanish-speaking callers" could not be handled 
because no one in that office speaks Spanish, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are there Spanish-speaking operators at service centers in St. Louis, 
Parlin, N. J., and Upper Darby, Pa., even though the Pennsylvania office must 
handle overflow calls from Miami, Roybal said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, backed-up calls from Pennsylvania have been switched to the New Jersey 
office, which "has led to much bad and erroneous information" being given to 
miners, Sloan said. "Pittsburgh (representatives) know the black lung program, 
Parlin does not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems to Be Corrected 
</P>
<P>
Social Security officials defended the telephone program, insisting that it 
generally has improved service to the 38 million beneficiaries. Problems caused 
by switching calls to inappropriate centers "will be corrected," Jack McHale, 
project director for the telephone program, told the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert R. Doggette Jr., deputy commissioner for operations, said that start-up 
problems "might be expected in any undertaking of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
Social Security offices "are now offering interviews by appointment to reduce 
waiting times, experimenting with extended office hours and offering to conduct 
most Social Security business over the telephone if a claimant or beneficiary 
prefers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites High Phone Use 
</P>
<P>
Doggette said that about 50% of Social Security claims are now "taken over the 
telephone by local offices versus only 15% in 1986, and in some areas over 80% 
of claims are filed by telephone." 
</P>
<P>
He cited recent studies by the General Accounting Office showing a high level 
of public satisfaction with Social Security services. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal released a survey showing dissatisfaction and low morale among workers 
at five Social Security offices in the Los Angeles area. A majority of the 101 
respondents said that their offices had insufficient staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poorer Service Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Roybal and another committee member, Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), said the quality 
of service is suffering as Social Security reaches its goal of cutting its 
payroll by 17,000 workers during a five-year period. The current budget calls 
for elimination of 2,000 jobs by attrition during fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Graham, who worked in the Social Security Administration for 14 years, 
told the committee that he resigned this month from the Boyle Heights office in 
Los Angeles in frustration over an "intolerable" working environment. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel turnover is very high, and there is a shortage of secretaries and 
claims representatives, Graham said. "In the past three or four years, the job 
has changed dramatically for the worse," he said.

PALSY VICTIM REACHES OUT BEYOND HIS WHEELCHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Honicky sat in the middle of Pierce College and watched as the world 
passed him by. 
</P>
<P>
He was in a wheelchair. A sign hanging on the chair asked passers-by to stop 
and chat and not be scared off by the fact that Honicky talks by pointing with 
his nose to letters of the alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done most school days for the last 15 years, Honicky had laboriously 
maneuvered himself onto the Woodland Hills campus looking for someone to talk 
to. And as usual, most of the students hurrying along the school's central mall 
seemed to pass him by. 
</P>
<P>
Honicky, 38, has cerebral palsy, which prevents him from walking or talking 
normally. But that's all the central nervous system disorder does, Honicky 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think and reason normally, just like you," reads the wheelchair sign -- 
painted on the flip side of a worn piece of Masonite that contains the painted 
alphabet. "Please don't be afraid of me." 
</P>
<P>
Those who looked the other way when they passed Honicky seemed to be, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may be frightened because he looks different," said Kitty Bean, a liberal 
arts major who stopped recently for the first time to talk with Honicky. "I've 
seen him every day, but I never took the time to stop until now. I'll take time 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropology student Priscilla Murillo said she stops and picks up Honicky's 
alphabet board every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I read his horoscope to him," she said. "We talk about what's going on in the 
world. He just wants to be a part of life. He's lonely. He's not stupid. A lot 
of people figure he can't communicate, but he can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Senator 
</P>
<P>
Honicky has taken psychology and sociology courses during his years at Pierce. 
Officials said he was an appointed student senator two years ago, representing 
the special services department. 
</P>
<P>
A student helped him communicate when he pecked out comments during student 
government meeting debates, recalled Judy Ponsor, assistant dean of student 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Honicky has become a campus fixture who may contribute more to 
school life than anyone expects. 
</P>
<P>
By appealing daily to students to loosen up, slow down and talk, "Chris is a 
reminder that physically handicapped people can contribute," said Art 
Hernandez, dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
But only a handful of Pierce's 18,000 students take time to talk to Honicky, 
said Leslee Cook, chief counselor for the college's 266 disabled students -- 
including 61 who attend classes in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trapped in His Body' 
</P>
<P>
"Those with a caring heart take the time to talk to Chris," she said. "This is 
his only opportunity not to feel like he's in jail. He's got a mind and 
intelligence. He's just trapped in his body." 
</P>
<P>
Although campus grounds administrators tried last month to persuade Honicky to 
relocate away from the center of the mall and out of the way of service 
vehicles that travel down it, Honicky was unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
It's tougher for students to ignore him when he is in the middle of things, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fighter," he said, slowly spelling out the words with his nose. "Only a 
few people take time now." 
</P>
<P>
Honicky is driven to school and pushed to the mall by David Moss, an accounting 
major who struck up a conversation with him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right Thing to Do' 
</P>
<P>
"It takes me 10 minutes extra, while it would take him hours to come by bus. 
He'd have to ride to the end of the line and then turn around to avoid having 
to cross the street out here," Moss said. "It's a balance of efforts. It's the 
right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moss will transfer next year to Cal State Northridge. But Honicky won't be 
going along. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there," Honicky explained. "People are too busy to stop and talk" at 
Northridge. Those who talk with him learn that Honicky, who is financially 
independent from his family, collected aluminum cans and made wake-up phone 
calls to supplement his income until the state threatened to deduct his 
earnings from his $500-a-month Supplemental Security Income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Concerns 
</P>
<P>
They learn that he worries about the values of youths today and about nuclear 
arms, and that he likes soft rock music, UCLA football and basketball, 
attending Christian Science church services and food without sugar in it. 
</P>
<P>
"And he likes blondes," said Mark McIntosh, a volunteer at the Crippled 
Children's Society-run Rancho del Valle in Canoga Park, where Honicky sometimes 
attends Friday night socials. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reseda apartment where he had lived nearly 15 years was recently 
burglarized twice, Honicky moved to a more secure building in Sepulveda. He has 
not yet been able to replace a stolen TV set. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of a new television, he'd prefer visitors, Honicky said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to meet people who really care," he said, slowly spelling out the 
words -- and ending with an exclamation point.

FALLBROOK MAN SCOOPS 6 TODDLERS FROM FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It could have been an unusual though mundane event, an empty, burning car that 
draws a gazing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kereluik was one of several people who saw the melting car Thursday 
afternoon in the parking lot of El Camino North Shopping Center in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
But, instead of just staring, he decided to put out the fire. And it's a good 
thing he did, because the car wasn't empty. 
</P>
<P>
"The window of the car was open about an inch," said Kereluik, recalling his 
efforts to put out the flames. "I couldn't see anything because there was so 
much smoke. That's when I heard it. A child's voice screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost panicked . . . right then it raced through my mind, 'My God, there's 
someone in the car,' " Kereluik said. "I just dropped the extinguisher that I 
had and opened the door. And that's when I saw the kids." 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, Kereluik's heroic actions saved the lives of six 
toddlers: Cory Hiatt, 4; Danielle Hiatt, 2; Ashley Campbell, 2; Kyle Koets, 3; 
Brittany Cougler, 2, and Kevin Brusch, 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We had kind of a miracle here," senior Fire Inspector Tom Fitzgerald of the 
Oceanside Fire Department said. "You should have seen the car . . . a minute 
after Kereluik pulled them out, the car was completely engulfed in flames. If 
it wasn't for him, we would be talking about six obituary names instead." 
</P>
<P>
The six children, all from Oceanside and Vista, were taken to Tri-City Medical 
Center, where they were treated for smoke inhalation and released. None of the 
youngsters suffered any burns. 
</P>
<P>
The children were left in the car by their baby sitter, Rita Napier, a 
36-year-old from Oceanside. She had left the children unattended about 1 p.m. 
Thursday while she went into a clothing store at the mall, according to 
Fitzgerald. Napier told authorities 
</P>
<P>
she was in the store less than five minutes. But, by the time she came out, she 
said, the car was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators contemplated charging Napier with child endangerment, but, since 
the fire was ruled accidental, no charges will be filed, according to Bob 
George, an Oceanside police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was not right for her to leave them unattended," George said. 
"But the fire was not her doing. It was accidental." An electrical or gas line 
malfunction most likely started the fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Kereluik, who lives in Fallbrook and serves as a supervisor for 
four McDonald's restaurants in Oceanside, was working at the shopping center 
when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed there were a lot of people watching this car in the parking lot," 
said Kereluik, who grabbed the restaurant's emergency fire extinguisher and 
told a co-worker to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea there was anybody in there," Kereluik. "I just wanted to keep 
the flames down until the fire department got there. There were a lot of cars 
nearby, and if it had exploded, it could have snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Kereluik save a lot of cars; he saved precious lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 3-year-old daughter myself," Kereluik said. "Her name is Elizabeth. 
If I ever came home from work and someone told me my baby was injured, let 
alone killed, I would be devastated. I think about these children's families, 
and I'm just glad I spared them that nightmare."

JUDGE WARNS OF 'FERTILE GROUND' BUT DENIES MISTRIAL FOR HOOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial on Friday turned down a 
request by her lawyers that a mistrial be declared because prosecutors had 
failed to turn over documents related to a witness who testified Thursday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam said the lawyers were on "very 
fertile ground" and may raise the issue again next week when the trial resumes. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 234 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, fraud by a 
commodity pool operator, making false statements to a federal agency, 
income-tax evasion, and aiding and assisting in the false preparation and 
filing of income-tax returns. The charges stem from her role as a top executive 
in the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, which bilked investors of at least 
$80 million in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The mistrial request came as one of Hunter's lawyers, Robert Brewer, concluded 
his cross-examination Friday of John Farrish, the former manager of a Bache, 
Halsey, Stuart, Shields branch office where Hunter once worked as a stock 
broker. Farrish, who now works for a brokerage firm in Minneapolis, took the 
stand Thursday as the fourth prosecution witness. 
</P>
<P>
Farrish testified that he was suspicious of J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, the 
founder of J. David &amp; Co., long before the firm was forced into bankruptcy 
court by nervous investors in February, 1984. Hunter, who became Dominelli's 
live-in companion, and several other Bache employees quit their jobs and went 
to work for Dominelli in 1980 and 1981 as Dominelli's business began to boom, 
Farrish said. Dominelli himself had worked for Bache but quit in 1979 to begin 
his own firm. 
</P>
<P>
Farrish said he could not understand how Dominelli could be producing 40% to 
50% returns on investments. He said he once wrote Dominelli a letter asking him 
to explain documents that apparently were false investment "track records" 
prepared by Dominelli to indicate that he had made large profits at Bache when, 
in fact, he had lost money for investors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite several confrontations, Dominelli never explained the discrepancies, 
Farrish said. Hunter was present during one of those confrontations, which 
occurred on a street in La Jolla, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's lawyers are attempting to persuade the jury that Dominelli alone knew 
of the fraud being committed and that she was unaware of his illegal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 Pages of Notes 
</P>
<P>
The documents that were not turned over to the defense were 11 pages of 
handwritten notes and typed memorandums prepared by Internal Revenue Service 
agents, who interviewed Farrish in 1982, and by FBI agents, who talked to him 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of cross-examination, Farrish mentioned that he had seen a 
memorandum in a prosecutor's office earlier this year, prompting Brewer to 
complain that the document had never been turned over to him as required by 
federal court "discovery" rules. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen P. Clark said he had been under the impression 
that the defense had received the document and pointed out that an inventory 
filed with the court listed the handwritten notes.

It's exaggerating to say that developers are falling over themselves to get a 
crack at downtown San Diego's building boom. But not by much. 
</P>
<P>
That was made clear again Friday, when downtown redevelopment officials found 
themselves in increasingly familiar territory: sorting through competing 
multimillion-dollar proposals for a small piece of city-owned property, this 
one at the southwest corner of Broadway and State Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice position to be in," said Pam Hamilton, chief of Centre City 
Development Corp., the agency in charge of downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Different Proposals 
</P>
<P>
Competing for a chance to build on the 33,321-square-foot site are three 
development groups. The front-runner, selected by a committee of CCDC 
directors, is called The Huntington, a 38-story, $91-million luxury condominium 
project with 196 units. It is proposed by the Koll Co. and Davidson Communities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The other two are a 30-story, $44-million high-rent apartment building with 287 
units called 900 State Street, by El Dorado Asset Management Inc. and Trammell 
Crow Co., and a 16-story, 296-room, $25-million all-suites hotel called City 
Suites, by First Integrity Hotel Corp. and Sandor Shapery. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing from all developers, CCDC delayed a decision until May 19, 
because board member Tom Carter was absent and board president John Davies had 
to leave the meeting early. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Huntington proposal, CCDC would be paid a minimum of $2 million for 
the site and receive $912,000 a year in special redevelopment taxes, more than 
double its closest competitor, 900 State Street. Aside from the financial 
return, some CCDC board members and staffers like the look of the 500-foot-tall 
building, which resembles a 1930s tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Up to $1 Million 
</P>
<P>
The condominiums, which are expected to cost $350,000 to $1 million, would 
range in size from two-bedroom, 1,525-square-foot units to three-bedroom, 
2,565-square-foot units. They would include wooden floors and 9-foot ceilings. 
The Koll Co. also is building two high-rise office towers on the property next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is perfect to be looking at downtown housing," said Bill Davidson, 
president of Davidson Communities, who last year was president of the Building 
Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 900 State Street project would pay CCDC a minimum of $3.2 million for the 
property and generate $442,000 in special redevelopment taxes annually. El 
Dorado Asset Management recently added Trammell Crow, one of the nation's 
strongest and most-experienced real estate developers, as a 50% partner, to 
help counter fears about El Dorado's strength as a developer. The apartments 
would range from 467-square-foot studios to 1,892-square-foot, three-bedroom 
units priced for "downtown yuppies," in the words of the developer's spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Lirot, of El Dorado Asset Management, and Daniel Golozato, of Trammell 
Crow, maintained that an apartment complex would be easier to finance and would 
fill up with tenants faster than a condominium such as The Huntington or 
downtown's first luxury condominium high-rise, the Meridian, which after nearly 
four years is about 80% sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We can adjust rents . . . we can make it fill up," Lirot said. 
</P>
<P>
The building includes a child-care center for up to 60 children, and, at 20,000 
square feet, much more ground-floor retail and commercial space than either of 
the other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel for Extended Stays 
</P>
<P>
The third project, City Suites, appears to be in last place among the 
competitors. Sandor Shapery said the hotel would provide extended-stay 
accommodations to business travelers who must live in San Diego for less than a 
year and often return home on weekends. He likened the concept to the services 
provided by the Oakwood Apartments chain. 
</P>
<P>
The rooms would rent for $60 to $70 a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shapery also is familiar with the site. He is a developer of the 
Emerald-Shapery Center high-rise office and hotel complex under construction 
directly across Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyu Corp., a Japanese firm that is putting up the $130 million for the 
Emerald-Shapery Center, has expressed concern about the height of some of the 
proposals, since it had been told that nothing higher than a 16-story hotel 
would be built on the Broadway and State Street property. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington project, for example, would be about 100 feet taller than the 
Emerald-Shapery hotel. A Tokyu Corp. official, in a letter to CCDC, said that, 
if views from its building are blocked, the company would "suffer (a) 
substantial economic loss." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, CCDC'S head administrator, said the agency has neither guaranteed 
protection of private views nor, as she specified in a letter to Tokyu, "is it 
recommended that such a practice be instituted." CCDC plans also call for tall 
high-rises in specific areas of downtown, such as on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stepner, San Diego city architect, had recommended that The Huntington be 
reduced to 400 feet, but the developers said they couldn't cut the height and 
keep the project financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
That CCDC is in a position to be picky is another example of how things have 
changed. For years, downtown was an urban desert. The opening of Horton Plaza 
almost four years ago helped signal a transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Horton Plaza, though, the common practice was for a 
development-hungry CCDC to call for bids and then find itself working with a 
single developer. But in the last two years, there has been more interest in 
property designated for some of the city's tallest buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It began in 1987, with competing proposals for property at Broadway and Kettner 
Boulevard, where the victors, Starboard Development Corp. and Great American 
Development Co., plan to build a $200-million plaza consisting of a 33-story 
office tower and 15-story hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were dueling development proposals for the block between 1st Avenue 
and Front, Market and G streets, eventually won by the Tutor Saliba/Paragon 
Group, which plans to build a 40-story apartment tower.

FAITH HELPS EX-ADDICTS REACH OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jamie Smith chuckled as he remembered the man who, two years ago, led him to 
Victory Outreach, the fundamentalist Christian church that helped him break his 
16-year-old heroin addiction. That man was his drug supplier. 
</P>
<P>
"My heroin connection knew about Victory Outreach, and he brought me here. . . 
. We went in through the front door and he went out the back and left me 
there," Smith said. "God ministered to me, and I got saved that night." 
</P>
<P>
Smith entered the Victory Outreach rehabilitation program and, after 13 months, 
he dedicated his life to helping others through the outreach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operates Four Homes 
</P>
<P>
Smith is now a spokesman for Victory Outreach church in Logan Heights, a 
nondenominational rehabilitation ministry that operates four live-in homes in 
the county for hardened gang members, alcoholics and drug addicts. At the homes 
-- situated in remote parts of Lakeside and El Cajon, and in Encanto and Logan 
Heights -- the residents follow strict rules designed to help them 
"reintegrate" into society. 
</P>
<P>
Victory Outreach was founded by Sonny Arguinzoni, a former gang member and drug 
abuser who began the program in his East Los Angeles home 24 years ago. It has 
expanded to form more than 50 churches in 14 states nationwide, in Mexico, 
Holland and Africa. By the end of the year, it hopes to have churches in Brazil 
and England, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Each day Outreach program members, themselves former addicts, walk the worst 
sections of town in search of lost souls. One-on-one, they talk with society's 
castaways, giving them testimonies of their own rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Outreach members and supporters will march through downtown San Diego to 
show the community that their program, which relies heavily on their Christian 
religious beliefs, can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"We work with drug addicts, prostitutes and gang members, basically those with 
a criminal background," Smith said. "We get them away from their environment 
and teach them basic Christian principles. They come in because they're hurting 
and tired, they're sick of their life style. The reason we can relate to them 
is because we came from that background, from the pastor on down. We don't ever 
forget where we came from and who we left behind. We have to go back and reach 
those people." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Guzman, the pastor who founded San Diego's Victory Outreach in 1984, 
agreed. "I don't think it takes a dope fiend to reach a dope fiend, but it sure 
helps." Guzman said he was an addict who tried every drug he could get his 
hands on. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus filled the emptiness I was trying to fill with drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded San Diego Branch 
</P>
<P>
After he was helped by a Victory Outreach church in San Bernardino, Guzman 
founded the San Diego branch to help other addicts fill the emptiness in their 
lives. "I want to try to reach the people no one else wants to reach and 
possibly can't reach. Our philosophy is, 'Reach, teach and train.' We reach 
them, teach them a new life and train them to go back and reach others," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Moore, 27, a former Crips gang member and "crack" addict, became a 
counselor in one of the homes after the program changed his life. "I tried all 
the worldly drug programs -- Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, CRASH 
(Community Resources and Self Help Inc.), Second Chance -- I always went back 
to the same thing. It was just superficial healing. . . . God heals the 
problem," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Victory Outreach has been criticized by some in the county probation department 
because it is unlicensed, but Outreach officials said that, until recently, 
they lacked the money for licensing. Nevertheless, other county and community 
officials say Victory Outreach is singularly successful. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Ortiz, executive director of the Barrio Station, said, "They're very 
religious, and for those who can respond to that and be helped by that, I think 
it's wonderful. They've been able to help people I didn't think could be helped 
. . . hard-core, middle-aged heroin addicts, people who have had a good 20- to 
30- year addiction." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz believes the program is a success in part because ex-addicts run it. "I 
have seen that concept fail over and over and over . . . but they've been doing 
an excellent job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can match their success rate," said Ricardo Jimenez, a parole agent 
with the Department of Corrections in El Cajon who has referred parolees to 
Victory Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
"They use Bible study and lot of prayer as principal means of dealing with 
changing behavior . . . they make no bones that that is their primary 
treatment," Jimenez said. "But I'm not inclined to question them, given their 
outcome. Where other programs have failed miserably, these guys are batting 
.500 in my book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
43% Stay Off Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Of the 72% that complete the program nationwide, 43% of the residents remain 
drug-free, said Gary Penovich, administrative director for rehabilitation 
services at Victory Outreach corporate headquarters in La Puente. An estimated 
20% of San Diego's residents agree to be court-committed to Victory Outreach in 
alternative sentencing or conditions of probation, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bobo, supervising attorney for the public defender's office in El Cajon, 
said his office uses Victory Outreach on a case-by-case basis. "We will not 
recommend it unless a person wants to go there. If they're comfortable with it, 
we've found it does have success . . . . They demand a real, total commitment 
to total abstinence, and substitute a zealous religion for the use of drugs and 
alcohol," Bobo said. 
</P>
<P>
Victory Outreach keeps a low profile and relies entirely on donations and 
fund-raisers organized by the residents of the homes to support its daily 
operations. Today's march, called "The Right Step," is an attempt to gain 
exposure and raise funds for their program. 
</P>
<P>
The march, which begins at 10 a.m. in front of police headquarters on Broadway 
between 14th and 15th streets, will proceed south on 14th Street, west on 
Market Street and south on Kettner, ending at the Embarcadero Marina Park near 
Seaport Village. A festival is planned in the park after the march. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've gone public to push what we're doing," said 
Carlos Alaniz, a Victory Outreach member and the former "heroin connection" who 
brought Smith to the program two years ago. Shortly afterward, Alaniz also 
became committed to working with the outreach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proclaiming to the city that we want to reach these people and bring 
them into society as productive citizens," Alaniz said. "We plan on opening 
seven more (homes) throughout the community, where there's gang violence, where 
there's drug addicts, anywhere where there's trouble."

JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES PUT L.A. PORT, SAN DIEGUITO RIVER MITIGATION ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State legislation allowing the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to preserve 
a San Dieguito River lagoon as mitigation for their expansion projects has been 
put on hold because of jurisdictional disputes over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is just going to sit there until all of this gets sorted out," Mary 
Jo Martin, an aide to state Sen. William Craven, R-Oceanside, said Friday. 
Craven is sponsoring the legislation, which has yet to undergo committee 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the most recent challenge came from state coastal commissioners at 
their meeting last week in San Diego. Two commissioners, both from the Los 
Angeles area, opposed the measure because they felt that mitigation measures 
should be carried out within the area in which the environmental damages were 
done. 
</P>
<P>
And Chula Vista Councilman David Malcolm argued that the environmental 
mitigation should be done in the South Bay area, Martin said. Chula Vista 
bayfront redevelopment has been stalled by environmental restrictions for more 
than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the San Dieguito River mitigation plan, which was quietly discussed for 
more than a year but not made public until February, the two port districts 
would double the size of their facilities in San Pedro Harbor and offset the 
environmental damage by financing development of a wetlands habitat in the San 
Dieguito River Valley, just east of Interstate 5 and the Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told a San Diego Assn. of Governments executive committee that Craven 
had been approached by local officials and asked to sponsor a bill that would 
allow the off-site mitigation and permit a land swap between the state and the 
San Dieguito Trust, a group owning more than 500 acres in the San Dieguito 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, a member of the Sandag committee 
planning a 43-mile-long park along the San Dieguito River, warned Friday that 
Malcolm's opposition to the San Dieguito project could be a serious because 
Malcolm "has a lot of say" on Coastal Commission matters. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not underestimate his power," Roberts said. "We should talk to him 
and settle up." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm could not be reached for comment Friday. A spokeswoman for the Chula 
Vista financier said he was "out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Golding, chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors and the Sandag 
committee, instructed other committee members -- all local elected officials -- 
to try to persuade Malcolm to drop his opposition to the San Dieguito 
mitigation plan. She also instructed that letters be sent to all state coastal 
commissioners and the commission's executive director urging them to support 
off-site mitigation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it means that we in San Diego lose some projects, I think we need 
transference," or the ability to locate mitigation projects away from the areas 
where the environmental damage is done, Golding said. Otherwise, she said, 
funds could not be spent on the most important projects. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that Craven's decision to hold up the bill (SB 546) also was 
influenced by a jurisdictional dispute between the port officials and the state 
Lands Commission over who controls mitigation projects. The political dispute 
was the subject of two opposing bills in last year's legislative session, one 
giving power to the commission and the other giving power to the port 
authorities. Neither bill survived, she said.

PROTEST POPS OPENING-DAY BALLOON; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS WANT BIG BUSINESSES OUT OF UCSD PRICE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ribbon-cutting ceremony for UC San Diego's $19.4-million Price University 
Center was disrupted Friday by a raucous group of student protesters who popped 
balloons, yelled over bullhorns and held up signs reading, "We're Students, Not 
Consumers" and "We're Here to Learn, Not to Buy." 
</P>
<P>
University police arrested four of the more than 30 demonstrators on suspicion 
of obstructing and delaying an officer. 
</P>
<P>
One student, who led university police on a chase as he continued to shout and 
play loud music over a bullhorn, is still being sought. Several students were 
arrested after they helped in his escape, according to university police Sgt. 
Bob Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Another student was arrested on suspicion of malicious mischief after popping 
an archway of balloons that he later tore down, Jones said. All the students 
were released shortly after they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate -- a big mess," Jones said. "It was kind of entertaining, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students, administrators and faculty members attended the opening. 
</P>
<P>
But according to one organizer of the protest, many UCSD students think the new 
Price Center is not the social and cultural center that administrators 
promised, but is instead a "franchise that has a shopping mall atmosphere, like 
downtown La Jolla." Student fees covered $9.5 million of the construction cost. 
</P>
<P>
Student Peter Bogdanovich, 20, who helped organize Friday's demonstration, 
conceded that the center is there to stay. However, some students are already 
organizing to boycott it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If students are conscious -- if they don't spend their money (at the new 
center) -- those businesses will leave," Bogdanovich said. "Then the university 
will have to come to the students and ask, 'What will you accept in your 
student center?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want Student Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the new center, named after San Diego businessman Sol Price and 
his family, object to the corporate-run businesses in the center, including 
Wendy's and Round Table Pizza. 
</P>
<P>
"The old student center was for businesses run by students, to learn," 
Bogdanovich said. "Now it seems like students are only good for slinging 
burgers." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's opening ceremony was almost complete when university police began 
confiscating musical instruments and even pens -- for popping balloons -- from 
the protesters as they marched about 100 yards from the site of the ribbon 
cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the police should drag people around and throw them in (patrol) 
cars because they were expressing their opinion," said 19-year-old James Field, 
a sophomore studying psychology and writing.

SEPULVEDA TEACHER ARRESTED ON CHILD ANNOYANCE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sepulveda Junior High School science teacher was arrested in connection with 
allegations that he fondled four female students while measuring them for Cadet 
Corps uniforms, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Estaville, 34, was arrested at his Chatsworth home on eight counts of 
misdemeanor child annoyance, which is less serious than child molestation, and 
eight counts of misdemeanor battery, Detective Ken Buscarino said. 
</P>
<P>
Estaville, who could not be reached for comment, taught science and Cadet 
Corps, a junior high school version of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. 
</P>
<P>
While measuring students for the uniforms, he touched the four students in an 
offensive manner, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One student complained to her parents, who complained to school officials, said 
Diana Munatones, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing three-week investigation by police revealed that three other 
students had similar complaints, she said. Munatones said she could not provide 
further details about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Estaville was arrested Thursday and taken to the Devonshire Division Jail, 
where he was released on $6,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
His arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court is scheduled May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Estaville, who had taught at the school since March, has been placed on 
compulsory unpaid leave of absence until the allegations are resolved.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Pacoima brothers were sentenced to prison Friday in the stabbing death of a 
26-year-old man during a dispute over a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
John Garcia, 22, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the Dec. 18 
killing of Freddie Ruiz and was sentenced to 11 years in prison by San Fernando 
Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor. His brother, Rudy Garcia, 27, pleaded 
guilty to a charge of assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced by Taylor 
to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A third brother, 21-year-old Kirk Garcia, also pleaded guilty to assault with a 
deadly weapon in the slaying and was sentenced earlier to three years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was attacked outside the San Fernando Gardens housing project after 
an argument concerning the drug deal, Nison said.

Police are investigating the shooting death of a man found slumped in the 
passenger seat of a van that they stopped while responding to a report that 
shots had been fired in a Pacoima neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped the van about 4:45 a.m. Friday near Vaughn Street and Dronfield 
Avenue. The victim, who was not identified, was rushed to Holy Cross Medical 
Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Rick Diolano. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the van told police that he discovered the wounded man sitting in 
the vehicle with the motor running, so he got behind the wheel to take the 
victim to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who police would not identify, was taken into custody for 
questioning. "He might be a good Samaritan," Diolano said. "We're just not 
positive."

THE PLAY'S THE THING WHERE ROSE IS CONCERNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first saw Pete Rose play baseball, I didn't like him. I thought he was 
brash and arrogant and clumsy, and that nickname of his really grated on me, 
"Charlie Hustle," as if nobody else ever hustled before. But then I watched him 
dive headfirst and run over people and get a lot of hits and back up his talk 
with wins and I started to respect and admire him not because he was perfect, 
but because he asked no favor and gave none and always met his opponents head 
on. 
</P>
<P>
I would be disappointed if Pete bet against his own team but even that would 
not sway my opinion of the man one bit. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other present-day professional athletes who are only glad to be 
where they are, Pete Rose wanted to be the greatest baseball player ever. And 
now, with our goldfish bowl morality, we are trying to stain a legend. As far 
as I'm concerned, Pete Rose is guilty of only one thing: living his dream.

LOADED PISTOL ON FLOOR OF HIS CAR GETS A'S CANSECO ARRESTED IN SAN FRANCISCO

Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics was arrested Friday on a campus of the 
University of California for investigation of carrying a loaded gun, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1988, was "totally 
cooperative" when arrested by campus police at 1:40 p.m. as he returned to his 
sports car after an examination of his injured wrist at the university's Laurel 
Heights campus, Lt. Mark Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The A's right fielder, who is out of the lineup for at least three more weeks, 
was booked at the Hall of Justice for investigation of possession of a loaded 
firearm on university property, a felony, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, 24, was released several hours later, after his wife, Esther, posted 
$5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
A passerby attracted to Canseco's red Jaguar in the school's parking lot 
noticed the fully loaded 9mm automatic handgun lying on the floor in the 
driver's side of the locked car, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Police could find no permit on file with the state allowing Canseco to carry a 
weapon but are continuing their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
After the passerby reported the gun, "We went out, and an officer 
investigated," Kurtz said. "We ran the plate and found out who the registered 
owner was. We checked the visitor entry log and found he was at the facility. 
We waited until his appointment was over and waited until he came out to his 
car and arrested him." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 21, a traveling companion of Canseco's was arrested at a Detroit 
airport for trying to board a flight with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol in his 
briefcase.

ANGEL PITCHERS RIPPED EARLY IN LOSS TO A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels and their new pitch-inside philosophy breezed into Oakland, home of 
the defending American League champions, Friday night and promptly watched 
their pitching staff get turned inside-out. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Chuck Finley couldn't last two innings, victimized by an infield error 
and an eventual five-run second inning. Reliever Dan Petry couldn't complete 
two innings, either, victimized by another error and that old Angel killer, a 
home-run pitch to Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Between the two, Finley and Petry surrendered eight runs -- too much weight for 
a four-game Angel winning streak to bear -- and the Angels lost to the 
Athletics, 10-6, before 26,903 at Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The streak, consisting of back-to-back shutouts sandwiched between 9-2 and 7-2 
victories, was staggered early, as the Angels fell behind, 5-0, in the second 
inning. And despite a nine-hit attack that knocked Oakland starter Bob Welch 
out of the game in the sixth inning, the Angels were never able to recover from 
their game-opening jitters. 
</P>
<P>
The second inning began, and was critically extended, by a pair of balls that 
had no business leaving the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford led off with a chopper over the mound which Angel shortstop 
Kent Anderson fielded behind second base, but fell before he could make a 
throw. Lansford was thrown out attempting to steal, but rookie Lance 
Blankenship negated that play by following with a drive into the left-field 
seats, his second major-league hit and his first major-league home run. 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Gallego grounded out to Finley, the Angels were an out away from 
ending the inning. And Finley appeared to have clinched the out by inducing Ron 
Hassey to hit a grounder to the right side of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
A routine play, but second baseman Mark McLemore's curious defensive slump 
continues and he misplayed the ball for an error, his fourth in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Five batters later, the second inning was still in progress and Finley was out 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the error, Walt Weiss singled and Tony Phillips walked, 
loading the bases. Billy Beane then worked the count full before doubling into 
the left-field corner, scoring both Hassey and Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Another walk to Dave Henderson loaded the bases again -- and another hit, this 
a single by Mark Steinbach, brought home two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
Down 5-0, Angel Manager Doug Rader put an end to Finley's start and began the 
bullpen cavalcade. Willie Fraser replaced Finley and retired Lansford, the 
inning's 10th batter, on a fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser proceeded to retire all seven batters he faced, allowing the Angel 
offense time to chip away at the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored twice in the top of the fifth inning when an infield grounder 
by Devon White exploded on Oakland second baseman Mike Gallego for a bad-hop 
double that brought home Jack Howell and Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
And after Henderson's home run off Dan Petry in the bottom of the inning, the 
Angels pulled to within 6-4 with two more runs in the sixth. Chili Davis 
walked, Jack Howell ended a 2-for-37 slump with a double and both scored -- 
Davis on a sacrifice fly by Anderson, Howell on a single by Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
Petry, however, gave the runs right back in the bottom of the sixth, with 
another defensive assist. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego opened with a single, stole second and advanced to third on catcher 
Lance Parrish's overthrow. Hassey then lofted a sacrifice fly to left and the 
A's led, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss walked and quickly made it 8-4, stealing second and coming home on a 
single by Henderson, the last batter Petry faced. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton came on to close out the sixth by retiring Steinbach on a fly to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels pulled to within 8-6 with runs in the seventh and eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
White led off the seventh with a bloop single to left and stole second base, 
his second steal of the evening and seventh of the season. He moved to third on 
an infield grounder and scored on a wild pitch by A's reliever Eric Plunk, just 
prior to Wally Joyner's inning-ending strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' home run to right field, his third of the season, accounted for the 
Angels' run in the eight. But there was room for more, with Howell and Downing 
on base with one out. 
</P>
<P>
But both runners were stranded when Oakland's second reliever, Rick Honeycutt, 
struck out McLemore and White. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner's running out of hobbies. With a day off in the Bay Area Thursday, 
Joyner decided to go golfing, but never got out of the pro shop. He re-injured 
the same ankle he sprained during a spring basketball game by tripping over a 
floor mat. "I hit the corner of the mat, where you clean your shoes, and 
twisted the ankle," said Joyner, the Angels' new Mr. Klutz. "I didn't even get 
the clubs on the cart. I drove for 45 minutes, got out of the car for five and 
drove back for 45." Joyner had the ankle X-rayed, which proved negative, and he 
was back in the starting lineup Friday night. Someone suggested that Joyner 
develop some less strenuous outside interests. "I'm going to try the triathlon 
next," he quipped. "No, maybe I should try jacks. Or tiddly winks." 
</P>
<P>
It's also been a rough trip on the Angel coaching staff. Wednesday in Chicago, 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann hurt his back while packing his suitcase and 
Friday, Manager Doug Rader had his left elbow lock up while hitting pregame 
fungoes. "I've got so much garbage in there," Rader said with a note of 
disgust. "Bone chips, spurs, hubcaps." After examining the elbow, trainer Ned 
Bergert advised the removal of the fungo bat from Rader's hands. "I prescribed 
that he go back to the sedate career he had before," Bergert said. . . . Dick 
Schofield's stint on the disabled list could be a long one, Rader fears. "It 
sure doesn't look like he'll be back anytime soon," Rader said. "Unfortunately, 
whenever you deal with soft tissue (Schofield has an injured chest muscle) it's 
hard to diagnose. You don't know if it's stretched, strained or torn. Based on 
the length of time it's taken (to heal) so far, it sounds like a tear. And 
that's no different than a hamstring tear. A tear's a tear, and it takes time 
to heal."

RUNAWAYS STUN DAMEWORTH AT MT. SAC MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former age-group standout with six years of racing experience, Bryan 
Dameworth of Agoura High is not easily surprised by his opponents' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But the Charger junior was startled not once, but twice in the invitational 
3,000-meter race of the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks senior Mike Williamson surprised Dameworth initially by running 
the opening 400 meters in a blistering 61 seconds, and David Welsh of 
Carmichael Jesuit shocked Dameworth roughly 2,000 meters later by running the 
last lap in 59 seconds to win the race in a nation-leading time of 8 minutes, 
23.11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, who finished third in a personal best of 8:29.02, had defeated Welsh 
handily in winning the 3,200 meters at the Arcadia Invitational two weeks ago, 
but he couldn't keep up with Welsh or Jorge Ibarri of Mexico (8:25.97) on the 
last lap Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt flat," said Dameworth, who didn't catch the fast-starting 
Williamson until the fifth lap. "I felt like I could have held that pace for a 
5,000, but I couldn't go any faster. I tried to go with them on the last lap, 
but when they took off, it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how he did that. At Arcadia he was way behind me, and what was 
that, two weeks ago? I don't know how a guy could improve that much in that 
short a time." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson led at 1,600 meters in 4:29, but it looked as though he might fade 
badly after he was caught with three laps left. The Lancer senior hung on to 
place fourth, though, running a personal best of 8:29.45. 
</P>
<P>
Other lifetime bests were recorded by Camarillo's Abe Valdez, who finished 
ninth in 8:38.4, and Granada Hills' Craig Lawson, 10th in 8:39.2. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth and Williamson also ran relay legs for their respective teams later 
in the evening, Dameworth running the second leg on Agoura's 1,600 relay that 
placed fifth (3:27.0) in the fifth heat, and Williamson clocking 4:17 on the 
anchor leg of the Lancers' 4 x 1,600 relay that finished sixth (18:05.40). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 3,000, Agoura sophomore Deena Drossin ran a personal best of 
9:59.22 to place fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin was among the leaders for the first five laps but couldn't keep pace 
with Gisela Vallejo of Mexico (9:48.64), Jamie Park of Santa Barbara (9:49.61) 
or Zarco Cruz of Colorado Sargent High (9:56.47) in the last 2 1/2 laps. 
</P>
<P>
The high school portion of the four-day meet concludes today with several 
outstanding match-ups scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200, is 
scheduled to resume her rivalry with Pasadena Muir's Inger Miller in the 100, 
but Muir assistant Mike Knowles said that Miller may not run today because of 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Miller runs, Burnham's main focus will be on the 400, an event she 
seldom runs in open competition. 
</P>
<P>
"She's ready to run under 55 seconds," Spartan co-Coach Brian FitzGerald said 
last week. "There's no reason why she can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is also expected to run on the Spartans' 400 and 1,600 relays. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth and Williamson also will be busy. Dameworth will run a leg on the 
Chargers' 4 x 800 relay and then in the invitational 1,500, in which Williamson 
also is entered. 
</P>
<P>
Russell White of Crespi, eighth in the 200 in last year's state championships, 
is entered in the 100, 200, long jump and triple jump.

HOME RUNS PROPEL BURROUGHS INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE WITH HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burroughs High collected just four hits Friday against visiting Hart -- but two 
of them figured prominently. 
</P>
<P>
Tony MacCaughtry launched a two-run home run and Tommy Phillips added a solo 
blast to account for all of the Indians' runs as Burroughs defeated Hart, 3-1, 
to create a first-place tie in the Foothill League. With six league games to 
play, Burroughs (12-8, 6-3 in league play) and Hart (15-4, 6-3) both hold a 
one-game lead over San Gabriel (5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Chris Westbury (6-2) yielded an unearned run in the first 
inning, then shackled Hart the rest of the way. Westbury scattered eight hits, 
struck out four and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
MacCaughtry belted his third home run, with Rob Arroyo on base in the third. 
Phillips' home run, also his third, came in the fifth. Both home runs were 
allowed by starter Andrew Lorraine (5-3).

With a win, Hoover could have moved to within a half-game of the first-place 
Apaches. Instead, the Tornadoes (11-5, 6-4) remain in third behind Arcadia 
(16-4, 8-1) and Pasadena (11-5, 8-2). 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia scored two runs in the second inning when, with the bases loaded and 
two out, Mike Gerken hit a routine grounder that shot between shortstop Brian 
Day's legs. Earlier in the inning, Jon Graves reached base after Day's high 
throw pulled first baseman Mickey Moreno off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, with Hoover trailing, 3-1, pitcher David Berkey spun and 
attempted to pick off Jim Aiwasian at first. But he misfired and the ball 
rolled into the outfield, allowing Ted Pilmer to score from third. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the inning, with the bases loaded, left fielder Reggie Mercado 
misplayed a fly ball that sailed over his head and brought home the final three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's trying their best but we just can't win with errors like that," 
Hoover Coach Bob Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tornadoes might have committed an error long before they stepped on the 
field. Berkey (5-3) had pitched complete games in Hoover's past two victories, 
on Tuesday and last Friday. He had never before pitched two -- let alone three 
-- consecutive games in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Although Berkey held the Apaches to seven hits and one earned run in 4 2/3 
innings, he was running on empty for much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to save my arm but we weren't getting any runs," said Berkey, who 
tried to get by with off-speed pitches early. "When I started heating it up, it 
wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Berkey was not too tuckered to swing the bat, though, collecting two of 
Hoover's five hits and scoring its only run.

MONTCLAIR PREP NOT READY TO TURN OVER LEAGUE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS J. PARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montclair Prep baseball team sent an early message to Village Christian 
High, its Alpha League rival and the team that was supposed to replace the 
Mounties at the top of the league heap. 
</P>
<P>
Mounties' shortstop Keyaan Cook barreled into Village Christian catcher Greg 
Lloyd to end the top of the first inning Friday night, leaving Lloyd obviously 
shaken and causing Cook to be ejected from the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Cook's hit -- combined with 10 of the more traditional kind, a pair of 
five-run innings and a 13-3 victory at Bluebird Field in Sun Valley -- 
definitely served notice that Montclair Prep was not about to step aside 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take a message to them that we're still the team to beat in this 
league," Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
Message received. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (10-5-1 overall, 5-0 in league play) scored five runs in the 
third inning to break a 1-1 tie. J. T. Billingslea hit a home run just inside 
the foul pole in left field to break the tie, and Andy Shaw and Brent Polacheck 
each added two-run singles in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties scored single runs in the fourth and fifth innings before rallying 
for five more runs off reliever Drew Martenson in the sixth. Russell Ortiz and 
Polacheck each had two-run singles in that inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen everyone else and this is the team we wanted to take it to," 
Montclair Prep pitcher Chris Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen (7-0) kept Village Christian (13-5, 4-1) off balance all night. The 
6-foot-3, 240-pound senior allowed one hit -- a solo home run by Matt Smay -- 
while striking out 11 in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
He tired in the seventh, however, allowing a pair of runs on two walks and two 
singles.

CRAWFORD SHOWS CENTRAL STRENGTH, 18-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was lots of time for fidgeting. Time for kicking some dirt. Time for 
thinking about which team might have a prayer of taking a chip out of 
Crawford's perfect record in City Central League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
There was so much spare time, Crawford baseball Coach Roger Engle was a bit 
worried about his pitcher. Crawford clubbed visiting Hoover, 18-5, Friday, and 
Chris Townsend (8-0) went the distance for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Problem was, Townsend spent more time sitting and hitting than he did pitching. 
So Engle had him warm up a couple of times while Crawford (16-3, 8-0) was 
having a field day against Hoover (9-8-1, 4-3) at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's hard to pitch if you're sitting in there for 20 minutes," Engle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the alternative is not getting all those hits and all those runs. 
Right? 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than going one-two-three," Engle admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend helped his own cause, though it hardly needed assistance, going five 
for five with three singles and two doubles. There are two kinds of doubles at 
Crawford's ballpark, the regular kind and those that could be mistaken for home 
runs by spectators not familiar with the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? The right field foul pole is just 240 feet from home plate. So, on 
days when the wind is cooperating, baseballs arrive frequently in the ice plant 
located just beyond the right field fence. A shot hit between the 240 pole and 
the 297 pole is a double. Townsend hit two of those. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend also gave up three home runs. Two, both by Hoover leadoff hitter 
Tyrone Upton, snuck in just to the left of the 297 pole. 
</P>
<P>
"I jammed him twice," Townsend said. "They're outs on other fields. It's 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
But not too frustrating. Crawford did a tub full of hitting of its own, chasing 
Hoover starter and loser John Maes (2-4) in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Manny Gagliano was three for four with a home run. First baseman 
John Edge was two for four with a double. Left fielder Joe McWilliams was three 
for five. 
</P>
<P>
Friday wasn't unusual. Crawford has scored 55 runs in the past three games. 
</P>
<P>
League play doesn't figure to offer much of a challenge for Crawford. Townsend 
put it this way: "I think the teams that can give us trouble are the ones that 
we've destroyed in the last two games -- Saints and Hoover." DON PATTERSON

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MCGWIRE, WESSELMAN STAR IN SCRIMMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juniors Dan McGwire and Patrick Rowe and senior John Wesselman continued to 
impress San Diego State football coaches in the Aztecs' third intrasquad 
scrimmage of the spring Friday at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, who completed 19 of 33 passes for 305 yards, has thrown for 953 yards 
on 59-of-95 passing in three scrimmages. Rowe had his third consecutive 
seven-catch afternoon, this for 192 yards including a 61-yard touchdown from 
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
Wesselman's interception of a McGwire pass gave him four, at least one each 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill was more pleased with Friday's effort than last week's. "I 
felt our intensity on both sides of the ball was better," he said. "We didn't 
move the ball as efficiently as we have, but that could be that our defense was 
playing well." 
</P>
<P>
While the offense struggled at times -- Brad Platt (10 for 24) threw for just 
110 yards -- the defense probably had its best spring showing. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Monty Gilbreath, who injured his right knee earlier this spring, will 
undergo arthroscopic surgery to remove some cartilage Monday at Mercy Hospital. 
Defensive end Todd Coomes reinjured the ankle on which he had surgery last year 
and will have X-rays taken Monday. JIM LINDGREN

IACOCCA IS LATEST BIG NAME IN EASTERN-LORENZO DRAMA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the big-name derby that has surrounded the long public agony of Eastern 
Airlines, add Lee A. Iacocca. The savior of Chrysler and sometime hero of 
organized labor surfaced this week as a labor-relations guru to chum Frank 
Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air and of strikebound, bankrupt Eastern, 
dropped in at Iacocca's offices in Detroit on Thursday for what was described 
as a consultation on what to do about the reeling airline and Lorenzo's bitter 
relations with its workers. 
</P>
<P>
Their meeting was not as secret as planned. Flying a Northwest jetliner from 
Washington to Detroit under an assumed name, Lorenzo was recognized, and the 
pilot announced his presence to the passengers, the Detroit Free Press 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting a local machinists union official, the newspaper said Lorenzo was booed 
by passengers and that the Northwest flight attendants donned anti-Lorenzo 
buttons like those sported by many of Eastern's striking flight attendants, 
pilots and machinists. Tipped ahead of time, Detroit machinists greeted Lorenzo 
at the airport with picket signs. 
</P>
<P>
The license number of the car meeting Lorenzo at the airport was apparently 
traced to Chrysler, which led to the disclosure that the beleaguered Eastern 
boss was meeting with Iacocca. They met for about 90 minutes, Chrysler 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Iacocca denied through a Chrysler spokesman a rumor that 
he was involved with, or interested in, a purchase of Eastern. Company 
officials reiterated that denial Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chrysler chairman's apparent role as adviser to Lorenzo is in keeping 
with the flavor of the Eastern story. The airline's woes have attracted big 
names like flies. 
</P>
<P>
A sampler: former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who was offered a job as 
interim boss of the airline but begged off because he is a director of Eastern 
creditor Boeing Co.; ex-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who was offered 
the same job, which ultimately was never created; Peter V. Ueberroth, the 
former baseball commissioner, Los Angeles Olympics chairman and travel agent, 
who tried to buy the airline; financier Kirk Kerkorian, who at one point was 
reported to be helping Ueberroth finance his deal; takeover artists Carl C. 
Icahn and Jay A. Pritzker, who apparently remain serious bidders; Michael 
Milken, the indicted Beverly Hills "junk bond" king, who injected himself into 
the deal some time ago by calling Ueberroth with financing advice, and Frederic 
V. Malek, an investor and pal of President Bush, who was the latest rumored 
bidder.

Gibraltar Won't Seek to Remove Regulators: Gibraltar Financial Corp. of Beverly 
Hills, parent of two still-solvent savings and loans that federal regulators 
seized last month, said it will not seek to remove the regulators from running 
the thrifts. The company said the decision stemmed from its belief that, if it 
took such an action, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board would withhold its 
cooperation and assistance and a liquidity crisis would result. Regulators 
seized the thrifts March 31, saying they were being operated in an unsound 
manner and had dissipated their assets.

McDonnell Douglas posted a $10-million first-quarter loss Friday, the result of 
a stunning $66-million loss at its Douglas Aircraft operation in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas took a $31-million charge on the Navy T-45 trainer aircraft program, a 
development under a fixed-price contract. The project has encountered problems 
that the company will have to solve at its own expense. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the losses at Douglas, $35 million, apparently occurred on its 
commercial aircraft business. The company said it lost money on its 
long-running MD-80 aircraft line, despite an increase in deliveries to 27 for 
the quarter from 24 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's first quarter, the Douglas subsidiary reported a $26-million 
profit, which included a $21-million gain resulting from conversion of a 
short-term lease to long-term. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell's first-quarter performance was helped by an accounting change, which 
resulted in net income of $169 million on sales of $3.34 billion, compared to 
earnings of $51 million on sales of $3.31 billion the year earlier. But the 
accounting change added $179 million to the bottom line, meaning that there 
would have been a $10-million loss without it. 
</P>
<P>
News of the operating loss sent McDonnell shares sharply down. They ended the 
day on the New York Stock Exchange at $88.125, down $5.625. 
</P>
<P>
Paine Webber aerospace analyst Jack Modzelewski slashed his 1989 earnings 
estimate for McDonnell Douglas to $7 per share from $9.25 after the 
first-quarter report was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew that they were having trouble on the commercial side and 
certainly this proved that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell has undertaken a top-to-bottom reorganization of its Douglas Aircraft 
unit, including the reassignment of almost every top level manager. Douglas 
President James E. Worsham was replaced by Robert H. Hood Jr., who recently 
characterized Douglas as having deep problems with antiquated systems and high 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Even more disturbing, Modzelewski said, is the poor performance McDonnell 
reported on its combat aircraft operations, which have historically carried the 
commercial business. Operating profit on military aircraft dropped to $62 
million in the quarter from $73 million the year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon budget cutbacks have reduced production of the company's four major 
combat aircraft, but the cutbacks have been modest compared to the larger 
reductions expected in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are going to have margin problems now, what are they going to do later 
on?" the analyst said. "It portends for not great things." 
</P>
<P>
The company's long-troubled information systems operation posted a loss of $9 
million, down from $28 million the year earlier. Interest expense soared to $99 
million from $41 million the year earlier, resulting from a special provision 
in connection with a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. Negotiations 
are continuing, the company said.

PEOPLE: GOLDBERG LEAVES FOX AFTER A TWO-YEAR STRING OF HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Leonard Goldberg, who for more than two years has presided over a resurgence in 
movie hits at 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., said he is leaving the studio soon 
to return to "the entrepreneurial life." 
</P>
<P>
The company indicated that no successor has been picked to succeed him as 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The news surprised some Hollywood industry observers. The 55-year-old veteran, 
who for 10 years had produced network television series such as "Charlie's 
Angels" in partnership with Aaron Spelling, had overseen Fox's theatrical film 
program since he joined the firm in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Fox ranked No. 3 in domestic box office share, rising from No. 5 in 
1987 and No. 6 in 1986. The company's biggest hit was "Big," which last year 
was the first Fox movie to gross more than $100 million since a "Star Wars" 
sequel in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Other Fox films during his tenure included "Die Hard," "Broadcast News," "Wall 
Street" and "Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, whose three-year contract has more than six months to run, said: 
"Although I've enjoyed my experience enormously, I felt it was time to return 
to the entrepreneurial life that I enjoyed before I joined Fox." 
</P>
<P>
A Fox insider commented: "One of the tricks in this business is to quit when 
you're ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Diller, who is chairman and chief executive of Fox Film as well as its 
parent, Fox Inc., was quoted in the announcement as saying that Goldberg has 
done "a wonderful job in his too short tenure . . . stabilizing and 
revitalizing our film production activities." AL DELUGACH

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: 'BOILER ROOMS' STILL DRAW THE NAIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sing

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to hear about an investment guaranteed to double your money in six months 
with virtually no risk? An opportunity that is a "sure thing" to give you a 
sevenfold return in 12 years? 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. No such high-return, risk-free investments exist, at least not legally. 
Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of unwary investors are led to believe that 
they do and are fleeced by con artists pitching such investments over the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Investors nationwide lose $10 billion a year -- or the equivalent of $1 million 
an hour -- to such high-pressure "boiler room" telemarketing operations hawking 
anything from precious metals to land leases to cellular phones, says the North 
American Securities Administrators Assn., an organization of state securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Newer scams pitch such things as penny stocks, stocks usually costing below $1 
but whose real value is nothing. They also offer prizes or free trips, but 
require you to pay hefty membership fees that more than pay for the "free" 
items. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a major crackdown, securities regulators from seven states over the 
past two weeks raided a dozen such boiler room operations in the greater Los 
Angeles area. This area has come to be known as the nation's boiler room 
capital for its preponderance of scamsters attracted by the Southland's weather 
and living conditions but preying on victims in all 50 states. Authorities 
called the raids the biggest multistate attack on boiler rooms ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is to investment fraud what Colombia is to cocaine," says 
Doug Mays, Kansas securities commissioner and enforcement chair for the state 
regulators group. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress are trying to enhance crackdown efforts by sponsoring 
a bill that would give state regulators greater powers to bash boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But despite these and other stepped-up actions, the boiler room problem is 
likely to persist as long as investors are uninformed and susceptible to 
letting greed overcome common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers such as The Times have reported tips on how to spot and avoid such 
scams many times before, including in this column. But they are worth repeating 
as long as the message still isn't getting through. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, are some tips, courtesy of the North American Securities 
Administrators Assn. and other authorities: 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid any deal promising unusually high returns with no risk. Let your common 
sense prevail. If a risk-free, high-return investment existed, whoever 
discovered it would keep the secret -- and the profits -- to himself and 
certainly wouldn't tell you about it. There simply is no such thing as a 
legitimate investment with above-market returns without above-market risk. The 
higher the return, the higher the risk. 
</P>
<P>
For example, investigators report that some investors in an oil and gas 
partnership sold by an unregistered Los Angeles-area boiler room were told that 
there would be little or no risk to their principal, which was guaranteed to 
return 17% in the first year and up to 25% in following years. Such investments 
are not risk-free, as one woman found out when she received just $44 in income 
payments on her $25,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if you invest anyway and initially get back a nice profit, still 
beware. Scamsters operating so-called Ponzi schemes often use money collected 
from other investors to pay you, as a way of coaxing even more money out of 
you. 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of deals involving delays of more than a few weeks for delivery of 
your investment. This is a classic red flag. Scamsters selling precious metals 
or other investments may in fact never use your money to purchase the intended 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid investments you do not understand. This rule applies to any investment, 
even to those pitched by reputable firms. It is particularly true of 
investments pitched to you by total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
* When hounded by high-pressure tactics, hang up. Many shysters want you to 
commit your bucks fast, before you develop second thoughts. They will say their 
deal is just about sold out, and that you have only a limited time to get in. 
</P>
<P>
But beware also of soft-sell tactics. Some scamsters are using friendly 
approaches in which they first try to get to know more about you and your kids, 
dog, etc. They won't pitch their wares until much later, after they've won your 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not make an immediate decision. Ask questions and get written information 
first about the firm, salesperson and investment. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if you do get written materials, that is not enough. Many con 
artists have prepared elaborate, slick brochures touting their investments. But 
they usually fail to disclose potential risks in the investment. 
</P>
<P>
If you get such a brochure, have a trusted lawyer, accountant, investment 
expert or knowledgeable friend take a look before you cough up big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
* Contact your local securities authority to see if the firm is registered to 
sell investments in your state. In California, telemarketing firms doing 
business in the state must register with the state attorney general's office. 
For information, call that office's public number at (213) 736-2457. 
</P>
<P>
For information on California broker-dealers and investment firms that don't 
necessarily use telemarketing, check with the state Department of Corporations, 
at (213) 736-2481 in Southern California, (415) 557-3812 in Northern California 
and (916) 445-8027 in the Sacramento area. They also can tell you if they have 
taken any public actions against those firms. 
</P>
<P>
However, be aware that a firm's registration is no guarantee that it will not 
swindle you. Call your local Better Business Bureau to see if other investors 
have complained about the outfit. 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of advertisements in newspapers and other publications that give 
little or no information other than a toll-free "800" number. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not give your credit card number over the phone to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not invest more money to those promising to "make good" on your earlier 
losses; they will just rob you for more. 
</P>
<P>
* If you have been swindled, or suspect that an unscrupulous operator has 
called you, take the name and number of the salesman and the firm and report it 
to your state securities office. 
</P>
<P>
In California, that is the state Department of Corporations, at (213) 736-2502 
in Southern California and (415) 557-3679 in Northern California. In other 
states, call the North American Securities Administrators Assn. at (202) 
737-0900 to get the phone number or address of the appropriate agency.

AT&amp;T WANTS JUDGE'S OK TO OWN DATA SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Friday asked a federal judge to lift 
provisions in a consent decree that prohibit AT&amp;T from owning the computer 
data, financial data and other information services it transmits on its wires. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, in a brief filed with U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, noted that 
the agreement under which the old Bell System was broken up allowed the 
restrictions on "electronic publishing" to be lifted after seven years unless 
it were shown it should be continued. The prohibition on electronic publishing 
was worked out on Aug. 24, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who oversaw the Bell breakup, stated at that time that the burden after 
seven years would be on any opponents of removal "to show that competitive 
conditions clearly require the maintenance of the ban," AT&amp;T's filing said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the leading firms in the electronic publishing industry "are 
large, financially strong corporations." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said those include Knight-Ridder (on-line 
database services), Citicorp, Dow Jones and Reuters (securities quotations and 
financial information), Dun &amp; Bradstreet and TRW (credit data) and General 
Electric, IBM and Sears (videotex services). 
</P>
<P>
Linnen said AT&amp;T had no plans to enter the electronic yellow pages and 
television businesses -- two areas that are of special concern to the seven 
regional Bell telephone companies that were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 and 
to the broadcast and cable-TV industries. 
</P>
<P>
The company, quoting from the consent decree guiding AT&amp;T's breakup, said: 
"There are now 'means other than AT&amp;T's network for the transmission of the 
messages of electronic publishers,' and those firms providing electronic 
publishing services unquestionably have 'sufficient strength to permit them to 
compete.' " 
</P>
<P>
It cited MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint as being among those 
transmission competitors and said "it is beyond serious dispute that these 
carriers offer ample alternatives to all of the AT&amp;T interexchange 
transmission services used by electronic publishers." 
</P>
<P>
MCI officials did not immediately return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for one of the seven regional Bell companies, 
BellSouth, said company officials had not seen the filing and could not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Smith Jr., executive director of the Videotex Industry Assn., said 
AT&amp;T could be a "potentially very important participant" in electronic 
publishing, "and I think probably the one area to watch out is if they use this 
as an opportunity to get into electronic yellow pages." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the regional Bell companies are banned from this area, he said a 
"vacuum" existed there. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Greene gave the regional Bell companies permission to transmit but not 
originate information services, which, besides electronic publishing, also 
includes data processing and related computer services.

TAKEOVER RUMORS FOLLOW F. HOFFMAN-LAROCHE ACTION

Swiss drug giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. asked Friday for trading of its 
shares to be suspended pending an announcement on Monday, triggering market 
rumors that it might launch a major takeover or a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the unusual announcement rumors swept through European 
and U.S. markets that Roche, the jilted suitor of U.S. drug company Sterling 
Drug, was planning to acquire another major pharmaceutical firm, namely Syntex 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Syntex jumped $2.875 to $47.25 and was the most actively traded stock 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Syntex declined comment, citing company policy. 
</P>
<P>
Roche said in a statement it would divulge "a series of measures which are of 
considerable significance for the structure and future development of the Roche 
group." A company spokesman declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Roche said the company has been looking seriously at Syntex 
and U.S. drug concern Rorer Group Inc., which markets a successful line of 
non-prescription medicines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named as Likely Suitor 
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts generally ruled out the possibility that Roche was interested in 
SmithKline Beckman Corp. because of lock-out provisions in its merger agreement 
with Beecham Group PLC. Swiss and U.S. analysts said Roche's other potential 
targets include Schering-Plough Corp., Marion Laboratories Inc. and 
Warner-Lambert Co., but Syntex was the focus of much of the speculation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Roche has been repeatedly named as a likely suitor for a U.S. drug company 
after its unsuccessful and hostile $4.2-billion bid for Sterling Drug last 
year. Sterling was subsequently bought by Eastman Kodak Co. for $5.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Roche's bid for Sterling prompted a wave of takeover speculation in the 
lucrative and clubby U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which is now undergoing the 
biggest consolidation in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss and U.S. analysts, however, believe Roche will not announce a takeover 
Monday but instead may unveil a restructuring of its expensive shares and 
dividend rights certificates and outline the reorganization of its large 
chemicals business. 
</P>
<P>
"Roche is under siege and they will have to restructure and make an 
acquisition," said independent pharmaceutical analyst Hemant Shah, a former 
employee at Roche's U.S. headquarters in Nutley, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rumored to Have War Chest 
</P>
<P>
Shah said Roche invested hundreds of millions of dollars in fine chemicals 
about 15 years ago and is now losing business to lower-priced Japanese and 
other foreign competitors. Chemicals accounts for more than half of Roche's 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Roche has been rumored for months to be building a huge war chest for an 
acquisition. A revamp of Roche's 50-year-old share structure could help finance 
potential takeovers by widening its shareholder base, analysts said.

ROBERT HILBURN: GETTING HOOKED ON JANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if you hear about sightings of Black Flag's ghost around the 
John Anson Ford Theatre, where Jane's Addiction opened a seven-night stand 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct Black Flag did more to define Los Angeles rock in the '80s than any 
group other than X and Motley Crue as it explored dark and unsettling themes 
with a visceral force that could be labeled truly frightening. 
</P>
<P>
While the independent South Bay outfit built a fiercely loyal, if unlikely, 
coalition of previously warring heavy metal and punk fans, it never moved 
beyond a cult status in rock. One reason is that it was considered simply too 
extreme by much of the pop-rock establishment. Its albums were all released on 
its own SST Records label. 
</P>
<P>
That was unfortunate, because Black Flag's live shows reflected such convincing 
alienation and rage that wide exposure -- say an arena tour -- would have 
pointed out to millions of young heavy metal fans just how toothless and hollow 
most of today's heavy metal or hard-rock heroes are. 
</P>
<P>
Black Flag's spirit was conjured up when hundreds of fans near the front of the 
Ford Theatre stage got so caught up in the fury of Jane's Addiction that they 
seemed like helpless figures in a human Mixmaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles quartet doesn't deal in the pure punk explosiveness of Black 
Flag, but there is an energy and aggression in the music that can be equally 
powerful. On a more global rock scale, the parallel suggested by the intensity 
level is Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
Don't, however, mistake the group for another Zeppelin clone such as Kingdom 
Come. There is originality and personality in the singing of Perry Farrell and 
in the tenacious rhythms of guitarist David Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins 
and bassist Eric A.. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's not just the fierce beat that makes Jane's Addiction so absorbing. The 
group's best material on its "Nothing Shocking" album asks us to look at life 
through the twisted reflections of a broken mirror. 
</P>
<P>
One of the messages of the music is that it takes an extreme approach to break 
through the jaded consciousness of a world that has been desensitized at every 
turn by tabloid sensationalism. It's a condition outlined in "Ted, Just Admit 
It." Sample lines: Camera got them images / Camera got them all . . . / Showed 
me everybody / Naked and disfigured / Nothing's shocking. 
</P>
<P>
For all the fury in the music, the message of Jane's Addiction is quite 
traditional. Much of the anger is over the loss of integrity and values. 
</P>
<P>
"Had a Dad" is an impassioned statement of loss that, on its widest level, 
speaks about a world without order -- or even, perhaps, hope. Elsewhere, Jane's 
Addiction offers visions of comfort ("Summertime Rolls"), mixed with times of 
outrage ("Idiot's Rule") and periods of confusion ("Standing in the Shower . . 
. Thinking"). 
</P>
<P>
Even though the band -- especially the manic, colorfully attired Farrell 
(complete with magenta dreadlocks) -- didn't seem fully focused Thursday, the 
audience seemed caught up in the band's spell. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Black Flag, Jane's Addiction does enjoy the support of a major record 
company, Warner Bros., and it is making slow but solid progress in building a 
national audience. The group's debut album has sold approximately 200,000 
copies despite virtually no airplay. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's high point came when the band returned for the second encore to 
perform "Jane Says," a bittersweet tale of looking for love (and self-esteem) 
in all the wrong places. It's as poignant an '80s anthem of lost souls as David 
Bowie's "All the Young Dudes" and "Rebel, Rebel" were in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
If Jane's Addiction can come up with another song as elegant and as accessible 
on the next album, radio airplay may not be far away. If so, it may not be long 
before ghosts of Black Flag are seen around the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The sold-out Ford Theatre engagement is a sort of homecoming celebration, 
complete with a theme -- "El Ritual de la Habitual" -- and decorations (mostly 
religious statutes and photos) that gave the outdoor theater the feel of a 
weekend religious festival on Olvera Street. To add to the color, Jane's 
Addiction is using a different opening band each night. The engagement 
continues tonight, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: On sale Monday is Jimmy Buffett, with opening act the Neville 
Brothers, at the Universal Amphitheatre on June 23 and 24. . . . Rap innovators 
De La Soul will be at the Palace on May 29. . . . A second night has been added 
for Tanita Tikaram at the Roxy on May 3. . . . New on the McCabe's schedule are 
a "Music for Nicaragua" benefit featuring Excene Cervenka, Tony Gilkyson, Steve 
Wynn and Cindy Lee Berryhill on May 7, former Husker Du member Bob Mould on May 
19 and English folk singer June Tabor on June 2 and 3. . . . Rapper Slick Rick 
will be at the Strand on May 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles premieres of plays by Christopher Durang and Marlane Meyer and 
a production of "Death of a Salesman" starring Philip Baker Hall are the 
highlights of the fall-winter season at Los Angeles Theatre Center, announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The season opens with Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo," Aug. 12-Sept. 
17. Dennis Erdman, who recently staged "Loot" and "How the Other Half Loves" at 
the Tiffany and "Making Noise Quietly" at the Taper Too, will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer's "The Geography of Luck" is slated for Aug. 26-Oct. 15, after the 
production of this Las Vegas tale at South Coast Repertory (May 16-June 4). 
Mayer's "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish" were seen at the center last year. Davis 
Schweizer, who staged "Kingfish," directs. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kent, founder of the defunct but once-renowned Company Theatre, will 
direct Jo Carson's "Daytrips," a play about a woman who cares for her 
grandmother and her afflicted mother. This West Coast premiere is scheduled for 
Sept. 23-Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Theater artistic director Bill Bushnell will stage "Death of a Salesman," the 
Arthur Miller classic, Oct. 7-Nov. 26. Three of the actors who were in 
Bushnell's staging of Miller's "All My Sons" at the center in 1986 will 
re-unite for "Salesman": Philip Baker Hall ("Secret Honor"), Bill Pullman and 
Gregory Wagrowski. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth play of the season, Nov. 11-Jan. 7, is still to be announced. A 
center representative said Friday that the three offerings suggested as 
possibilities for this slot on a recent mailing to subscribers are no longer 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Ryan and Marian Mercer will appear in Alan Mandell's staging of 
Strindberg's "Dance of Death," Dec. 16-Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The center also announced an entry in its next spring-summer season. British 
director Simon Callow, acclaimed for his 1987 staging of "Jacques and His 
Master" at the center, will direct Eduardo Machado's "Project X2" in February. 
Machado's "A Burning Beach" was presented at the center this year.

'SALOME' CONDUCTOR THRIVES ON CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I need a clone, at the very least," Randall Behr says ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old conductor is the resident associate conductor for Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera, music director for Long Beach Opera and music director of 
USC Opera -- all three of which have productions running or in preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little strange this morning, throttling down," Behr says from the Long 
Beach Opera offices, where he is deep in preliminary "Marriage of Figaro" 
rehearsals for that company's Beaumarchais trilogy, after conducting the 
opening night of Music Center Opera's "Salome" revival in what amounts to his 
major company/major production debut. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Behr new to the MCO production, this is his first "Salome," period. 
Would he rather have tried this in less visible circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
"I think one would always prefer that. On the other hand, it has to be 
somewhere and one has to grasp the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Behr's preparation for "Salome" was about two years of close study of the 
score. He was tapped for the MCO revival after general director Peter Hemmings 
observed Behr leading "Ariadne on Naxos" in Long Beach in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mammoth thing. It feels like a giant piece rammed in a trash 
compactor," Behr says of "Salome." 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a great deal of imaginative deconstruction and 
reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
Though local audiences may now know him best for "Ariadne" and "Salome," Behr 
does not consider himself a Strauss specialist -- or any other kind of 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like a specialist. One of the problems with American conductors 
is that we don't get a chance to repeat works. In European houses, a piece may 
be done many times over years, and really enters your blood." 
</P>
<P>
The MCO "Salome" was widely hailed when first presented in 1986. The current 
run at the Music Center, with further performances Sunday, Thursday and May 1, 
reunites the original cast. Additionally, Maria Ewing has sung the title in 
this production as presented in London and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Behr, however, is little daunted by coming into an established production. 
</P>
<P>
"On one level, it's actually very helpful to have them (his singers) know 
exactly what they want. I have no problem with that -- I love working with 
people who have strong ideas. I would have liked to have had more time to 
explore with the singers, but I certainly had enough orchestra time, nine 
rehearsals, and that's rare. It's not unusual for Music Center Opera, but it is 
for other companies." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the University of the Pacific, Behr began an extended association 
with the San Francisco Opera and its Merola Program and Western Opera Theatre 
in 1975. From there to the Music Center pit has been a long, sometimes bumpy, 
road, leading to engagements around the country and in Canada and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things are always tricky. This is the biggest piece I have done up to 
now with a big company," Behr says of his career. 
</P>
<P>
What interests Behr most about opera "is the ability of the great composer to 
portray psychological developments. In purely musical terms, Strauss is able to 
show the turning of desire into hatred and vengeance," which Behr proceeds to 
illustrate for his listener by singing examples of motivic permutations from 
"Salome." 
</P>
<P>
"I like very much the danger of the theater," he adds, "the multiplicity of 
approaches that one must meld together." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, Behr has also conducted "The Ballad of Baby Doe" and a benefit 
concert with Marilyn Horne. The "Figaro" that he is preparing is the central 
component of a trilogy opening next month. It begins with Paisiello's setting 
of "The Barber of Seville" and concludes with the play "The Guilty Mother," 
with new incidental music by Mark McGurty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to allow the designers to try to connect it (the trilogy) 
visually," Behr says, "but I think, basically, each of these pieces will work 
on their own terms, and that the cumulative effect will be an audience one." 
</P>
<P>
As these productions are rehearsing simultaneously, Behr is only responsible 
for "Figaro." 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a limit to me," he says, laughing, and that is the reason he 
is not conducting the program of one-act operas based on Cocteau librettos, 
running at USC this weekend (Murry Sidlin is guest conductor there). 
</P>
<P>
With his multiple responsibilities here, Behr says, "I'm pretty much locked in 
for the next three years. As wonderful as it is to travel, it's nice to have a 
home base." 
</P>
<P>
For the future, he hopes to get into symphonic conducting. Working in the pit, 
he says, "seems to be a young man's profession. It's exhausting -- it's also 
wonderful."

Re the April 13 story on "Wired," by Nina J. Easton and Jack Mathews: 
</P>
<P>
Only a bumpkin who just fell off the turnip truck would be surprised to learn 
that many Hollywood big shots are liars and hypocrites. The fact is, it's 
perfectly OK to blaspheme Jesus Christ, Mohammed or God Almighty in this burg; 
this ruffles no feathers and might even win you an award or two. But John 
Belushi -- hey, that's a different story, and the makers of "Wired" surely knew 
as much. 
</P>
<P>
They were probably counting on the adverse publicity to boost "wanna see" for 
that crucial opening weekend, before word-of-mouth on the picture's actual 
quality had time to spread. 
</P>
<P>
Every press agent since the invention of ink has known there's no such thing as 
bad publicity.

It really doesn't matter what performance Martin Bernheimer is reviewing so 
long as he provides us with vintage Bernheimeranian verbiage -- which he did 
April 7 in reviewing two works of Lee Hoiby. To wit: "a melismatic purr," "the 
televisionary culinary auteur," "the Leitmotivic fioriture," "giddy parlando . 
. . soupy Sprechgesang," "hemidemisemiquavering opera."

CINEMA MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Heathers," reviewed in Calendar March 31: 
</P>
<P>
This film deals with the problem of teen suicide by advocating murder. It is a 
disgrace to think that because the murderess is going to have popcorn with the 
fat girl she has somehow made a moralistic turn-around. Who are you kidding? 
Not me. Not my family. And not the 40,000 murder victims in the United States 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
My son was murdered last October. At some point, 1 in 3 families will 
experience such a loss. 
</P>
<P>
As a film writer I understand and applaud everyone involved in this movie for 
attempting to expose the obsession teen-agers often have with death. I am, 
however, saddened that the producers, directors, actors, crew and most of all 
the writer would take on a subject as devastating as murder without portraying 
it responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of all who've lost a loved one to homicide I plead with the makers of 
"Heathers" to re-examine the film and realize that not only does it not work 
but it is the most dangerous kind of message that we in our industry can give. 
</P>
<P>
Please don't leave youngsters with the message that murder is all right. Remove 
"Heathers" from the theaters. Show society that Hollywood can entertain 
responsibly and that it isn't just a bloodthirsty, moneymaking monster.

FACES . . .: THIRD TIME OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"This is not heavy, serious leading-man adventure stuff," says Scott Bakula, 
who takes a "Quantum Leap" every Friday night on NBC. "Just your classic 
American hero who faces adversity with humor." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Pretty lofty stuff coming from an actor who is no stranger to the tube 
but has yet to make a name for himself beyond the theatrical stage. 
</P>
<P>
Bakula (rhymes with Dracula) stars in this new sci-fi fantasy series (moving to 
Wednesday nights, starting May 3) with Dean Stockwell, who appears as a 
hologram known as The Observer. A quantum physicist who can travel through 
time, Bakula is caught in a warp and bounces from body to body, decade to 
decade. Though its premise mirrors the '60s "Time Tunnel," this show deals with 
altering history, which gives it a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
"In this show we take the liberty of getting involved," says the 33-year-old, 
who has "leading man" written all over his face. "A pilot is supposed to die 
and I get him out of there before it happens . . . or, I can help some 
grandmother win at bingo." When the viewer sees his character in the show, 
they'll see Bakula, but those in the show will be looking at the body he's 
inhabiting at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Bakula, one can sense, is itching to get into films, but right now seems 
content jumping back and forth from the stage to the tube. Having starred in 
the short-lived "Gung Ho" on ABC, and "Eisenhower and Lutz" on CBS, he is one 
of the few actors who can boast major roles in shows on all three networks. 
</P>
<P>
Where would the actor like to see himself at 50? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be mixing a little more film with stage and I'd like to have a 
little more control of what I'm doing, whether in the producing end of it or 
the creating end," Bakula said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I'll still be working then," he says with a laugh. "It can all go 
bye-bye real quick." DAVID PECCHIA

MALASHOCK COMPANY AT LYCEUM SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Tharp dancer John Malashock choreographs as if each piece were his last. 
</P>
<P>
Even when his ideas are all over the map -- as they are in his new 25-minute 
quartet, "Departure of the Youngsters" -- Malashock's sense of creative 
brinkmanship generates excitement. And the dancing itself swoops and lunges 
with enormous force from one unsparing confrontation to another. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced Thursday at the Lyceum Space in Horton Plaza on a program of 
otherwise familiar works, "Departure" focuses on the outcasts of society, with 
mime and gesture motifs that suggest drug addicts and the homeless as well as 
the physically handicapped and mentally ill. Malashock identifies fiercely with 
their pain but, most of all, his piece seems to be about power and 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Against a moody wash of woodwinds and percussion composed by Mark Attebery, one 
or two of the dancers repeatedly enact rituals of anguish interrupted by others 
who attempt to subdue and control their behavior but, increasingly, commit acts 
of extreme brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In one sequence, Malashock is literally shaken out of his near-catatonic 
isolation and then abandoned. In another, Kate Lounsbury (a watchful authority 
figure in the piece) and Malashock trap and terrorize Maj Xander. As they hold 
her down, it isn't hard to imagine a straitjacket -- just as their hands 
shooting past her face evoke the violent pulse of shock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Our helplessness in the face of human misery is powerfully depicted here, along 
with the ruthless mindset that can evolve when humane attempts at social 
engineering fail. 
</P>
<P>
But Malashock is more committed to engulfing you in an experience than in 
explaining his purposes. So, inevitably, there are moments of confusion (ours, 
if not his) -- passages that even the combined skills of Xander, Lounsbury, 
Debbie Toth and Malashock himself cannot untangle -- along with concepts that 
seem part of another piece entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural analysts will recognize in Malashock the key characteristics of New 
Romanticism: the exaltation of emotion over intellect (or form), an obsession 
with the hopelessness of human relationships, the need to consume yourself in 
your art. Malashock thus belongs to the generation after postmodernism, and 
though he is still very young as a choreographer, nobody in Southern California 
is growing as fast. 
</P>
<P>
Malashock Dance Company performs through Sunday in Horton Plaza, and "Departure 
of the Youngsters" is scheduled to be seen in Los Angeles on a "Dance 
Kaleidoscope" program in July. LEWIS SEGAL

PREVIN LEADS PHILHARMONIC IN PROKOFIEV PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think about Andre Previn's repertory specialties, and probably Prokofiev does 
not come immediately to mind. But he has been working consistently and 
effectively with the composer's music, as witness his recent recordings with 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Previn will also soon record the Sinfonia Concertante, with the orchestra and 
Austrian cellist Heinrich Schiff, who made his Philharmonic debut in the work 
on Thursday evening on a Prokofiev program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
That should be a disc worth getting. In what remains the most comprehensively 
challenging concerted work for cello, Schiff displayed conquering technical 
heroics in service to well-thought communication, and there was nothing mean 
about the vital contributions of Previn &amp; Co. either. 
</P>
<P>
Schiff held nothing back, whether in concentrated lyricism or tortured 
passagework. Yet all remained thoroughly under control, sensitively supported 
with taut sound. 
</P>
<P>
Previn and the Philharmonic backed Schiff's effort with clarity and 
accommodating balances. The whole was purposefully paced, with even the 
longueurs of the opening integrated in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with explosive readings of the March and Scherzo from "The 
Love for Three Oranges." The brisk, direct performance hit with a sonic impact 
rare in the Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
In between came the Seventh Symphony, product of a composer broken on the rack 
of Stalinist cultural ideology in 1948. Inspired in large measure by 
Rostropovich, Prokofiev was able to overcome the effects of official censure in 
recomposing the Sinfonia from an earlier concerto, but the careful textures and 
simple charms of the Seventh reveal little of his typical bite and power. 
</P>
<P>
Previn laid it out neatly enough, without communicating anything more 
compelling than a sense of compassionate affection for what the work could have 
been. The Philharmonic responded in kind, with fluent solos and ensemble 
strength, but aloof in spirit. JOHN HENKEN

 A funny, slick technical exercise, with an all-star Brat Pack guest cast, 
about two girl-crazy teen-agers who crash into a beautiful young model's car in 
the desert. When the model turns out to be a Manhattan-bound lesbian, feminism 
and male hormones are put to a severe test. The most impressive thing about 
writer-director Adam Rifkin is his age: At 20, he's got a good handle on many 
of the pop-movie skills and tricks that would-be sellouts struggle for at 40. 
If he comes on here a bit too much like imitation Robert Zemeckis, salted with 
Ron Howard and John Hughes, at least he has lots of time to grow and develop.

 Languid inertia grips newlyweds Amanda Plummer and Christopher Rich, faced 
with almost too many ways to spend their New York Sunday afternoon. But before 
this pleasant satiric comedy is over almost one of everything has happened. New 
director Jeffrey Noyes Scher works with a pungent sense of what's new and 
what's not in New York and his actors are cracklingly funny, although their 
vehicle winds down around them. SHEILA BENSON

 Huang Shuquin, one of China's few women film makers, finds complex meanings 
and considerable ambiguity in her story of an actress coming to terms with her 
life and career in this exquisitely nuanced and strikingly original film. Her 
heroine has from her youth defied convention in insisting on playing male roles 
in the Chinese opera which require mastery of martial arts and gymnastics. 
There's an interplay between Qiu's fascination with a demon in a popular opera 
and in her own independent nature that gives the film a strong feminist spirit.

'I'm the One You're Looking For'

Spain, 1988, 90 minutes 
</P>
<P>
4:45 p.m. 
</P>

A beautiful model falls in love with her biker rapist and pursues him 
obsessively through the dangerous, lower-class dives of Barcelona, taking as 
her accomplices an embittered lady taxi driver and a gentle voyeur-transvestite 
artiste. That's the explosive subject of this Gabriel Garcia Marquez-scripted 
fable. But it's the weakest of the "Dangerous Love" series. Director Jaime 
Chavarri has a rudimentary, flat style; he can't work up the whiff of danger or 
eroticism, so the script's deliberate provocations, embedded in an emotionless 
drift, seem simply shocking or shallow. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

APARTHEID PROBLEMS TAKE KCET SPOTLIGHT; PETER USTINOV REPORTS ON HIS CHINA TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An afternoon of apartheid, an evening in China and a dark night hunting Nazis 
round out this weekend's small-screen schedule. 
</P>
<P>
KCET Channel 28 devotes five hours to programs about apartheid and South Africa 
beginning at 1 p.m. today. "Sanctions and Apartheid: A Firing Line Special From 
South Africa" kicks things off, with William F. Buckley interviewing five South 
African leaders, including foreign minister Pik Botha, progressive member of 
Parliament Helen Suzman and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the afternoon features cultural performances by South African 
artists and a documentary about Winnie Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 tonight, Peter Ustinov spends an hour in China. "Beijing to Tibet," the 
first of two programs chronicling Ustinov's journey through the world's most 
populous nation, focuses on the mixing of old and new cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Ben Kingsley stars as Simon Wiesenthal in the HBO movie "Murderers 
Among Us," beginning at 8 p.m. The three-hour movie tells the story of the man 
who, after being liberated from a Nazi death camp in 1945, committed his life 
to tracking down the men responsible for the Holocaust. STEVE WEINSTEIN

'PHARMACY' PAINTS VAGUE PICTURE OF FOREST DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medicine men using native plants to cure illness and prevent miscarriages or 
conception? Mere superstition, right? 
</P>
<P>
Not really, as more and more scientists, doctors and pharmaceutical companies 
are realizing. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, as shown in "Jungle Pharmacy" (tonight at 6:50 p.m. and again 
Sunday at 8 p.m. on the TBS cable channel), the South American rain forest that 
holds the most promising plants may be chopped and burned down before most of 
its trees, bushes, vines and flowers can be examined. (So far, only 1% of 
potential medicinal plants have been studied, the program states.) 
</P>
<P>
Along with the forests go the beliefs, culture and secret knowledge of the 
tribes that live within them. Or lived. "Civilization" and its own diseases 
have wiped out many. 
</P>
<P>
Television is doing its part in telling the sad stories of deforestation and 
culture destruction, as well as the encouraging one of ethnobotany -- the 
increasingly important science recently covered by "National Geographic 
Explorer" and a PBS documentary. It's too bad, however, that the important 
information in "Jungle Pharmacy" is delivered in a rather vague, sleepy manner. 
The program is worth watching, but you may need a couple of cups of that old, 
unendangered South American brew -- coffee -- to stay with it. TERRY ATKINSON

A LOWBROW LOOK AT THE 'LITTLEST VICTIMS' OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 1982, and a doctor has diagnosed AIDS in several of his non-gay, 
non-addict patients, but the public, the medical community and especially the 
Reagan Administration are all seen as suspicious or nonplussed about what was 
still widely considered a "gay plague." It's "the wrong disease, hitting the 
wrong people," says one of the many naysayers who tries to keep this medical 
maverick in his place. 
</P>
<P>
Does this sound a little like something out of "And the Band Played On," the 
landmark investigative book about the neglect of AIDS in the earlier part of 
this decade? It should, but it's been watered down for popular consumption. 
"The Littlest Victims," a TV movie airing Sunday at 9 p.m. (on Channels 2 and 
8), is pretty much the lowbrow companion piece to that tome, assigning plenty 
of historical blame for the escalating AIDS crisis but in a dramatically 
simplistic and sentimental manner that Mom, Dad, Grandma and, heck, the whole 
family can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy hunters might be able to find a wee twinge here: The film makers get 
on the case of the authorities for underplaying the disease's significance as 
long as it was mostly limited to homosexuals. Yet the movie's way of tugging at 
heartstrings includes neglecting to create a single gay character among the 
litany of victims. 
</P>
<P>
Instead we get cute kids, all about to be cut down in the prime of their 
presumably heterosexual childhood, all due to bad blood transfusions or 
repentant parents who made boo-boos. It's a sympathetic way into the tragedy 
for a TV audience, certainly, but can the film makers really be critical of 
those who leave homosexuals out of the equation when they do the same thing 
with their plot? 
</P>
<P>
That debatable quibble aside, the movie has its politically correct heart in 
the right place. It's only dramatically that it is really prone to attack. The 
hero is Dr. James Oleske (Tim Matheson), a New Jersey pediatrician who butts 
heads with his superiors when he concludes that several children suffer a 
condition previously assumed to be exclusively sexually transmittable. 
</P>
<P>
Generally unconvincing as it is, "The Littlest Victims" is not without moments 
of clarity, as when a distraught mother asks, "I messed up my own baby -- is 
that what you're saying to me?" Even that scene doesn't play as an epiphany 
should, but set apart from its soft dramatic bed to loll around in the 
consciousness of the viewer, it's a horrifying thought -- which, when all is 
said and done, may be enough for one show to induce. CHRIS WILLMAN

POIGNANT LESSONS IN 'TEACHING MORALITY TO KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could your child lie? Cheat? Murder? 
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of our nation's youth are doing just that, apparently 
without conscience. We can thank decades of "epidemic greed, dishonesty and 
corruption," says a remarkable program, "See Dick &amp; Jane Lie, Cheat &amp; 
Steal: Teaching Morality to Kids," airing Sunday at 8 p.m. on KTLA Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
Don't tune out. This isn't a harangue, a religious tome or an hour of doom and 
gloom. The first part of the show, intelligently hosted by Tom Selleck, does 
offer shocking examples of "moral collapse" -- children, teens and young adults 
talking on camera of their misdeeds and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the hour shows us we aren't powerless, with an illuminating 
cross-country tour of "pockets of hope," where sound new programs teaching 
basic decency are making a difference. We're shown pilot projects involving 
basic values, self-esteem and personal responsibility that reportedly have 
resulted in higher academic scores and a major reduction of disciplinary 
problems and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
All of them share one thing: Children are treated with respect and they respond 
in kind. Remember the Golden Rule? 
</P>
<P>
This is the first in a four-part series, "Raising Good Kids in Bad Times," 
written, produced and directed by Carol L. Fleisher for Academy Award-winning 
executive producer Arnold Shapiro ("Scared Straight!"). 
</P>
<P>
Viewers are offered a number to call for videotapes of the show and for 
information on values-teaching programs to start in their own communities.

EPIPHYLLUM SHOW WILL BLOOM AT THE SOUTH COAST BOTANIC GARDEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You may have a little trouble pronouncing the name, but don't let that stop you 
from admiring the beauty of the epiphyllums on display from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Sunday at South Coast Botanic Garden. The stunning blossoms of these plants are 
vibrantly colored, have many different shapes and petal forms, and may range 
anywhere from 2 to 11 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Epiphyllums (also called epies or orchid cactus) are native to the jungle areas 
of Mexico and Central America. They grow on trees but they are not parasites, 
using the trees only for support. These easy-care plants can be grown in pots 
and require only weekly or biweekly watering, depending on location and 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay Epiphyllum Society will be displaying single flowers, 
arrangements and blooming plants. There will also be epiphyllum cuttings and 
rooted plants on sale. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the garden and show, at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and students, 75 cents for 
children from 5 to 12 years of age. JOAN DRAKE

GARDENING: AN URBAN OASIS AT GREEN SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON ARBORETUM LOOKS AT EARLY-CENTURY LIFE, PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's an urban oasis tucked away in the northeast corner of Cal State 
Fullerton campus reminiscent of H. G. Well's "The Time Machine." Today and 
Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Green Scene at Fullerton Arboretum offers 
"an opportunity to see how people lived at the turn of the century, then come 
back to the present to view plants and buy things for your home," said Joyce 
Rosenthal, event chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Glimpse the past with a guided tour of Heritage House, the Victorian cottage 
that was originally the home of Fullerton's first physician. Inside the 
restored one-story home you can see the doctor's office, parlor, dining room, 
kitchen, pantry and a bedroom. "The whole house acts as a living museum. If the 
doctor were to return today, it would be as if he were walking back into his 
own home," said Rico Montenegro, arboretum assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Common to Exotic 
</P>
<P>
At the annual plant sale, there will be everything from common begonias and 
fuchsias to the drought-resistant, unusual bulbines and exotic bonsai, palms, 
bromeliads, orchids and rare fruits. "We'll have a number of things you 
probably can't get at your local nursery," Rosenthal said. All sale items are 
supplied by local horticultural and garden clubs, nurseries and members of the 
Potters, the Friends of the Fullerton Arboretum plant propagators. Take a tip 
from veteran shoppers and bring a wagon for ease in carrying your treasures. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of gardening demonstrations will be presented by green-thumb experts 
beginning at 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today; 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Get tips on 
such subjects as bromeliad care and potting, how to care for fuchsias, bee 
keeping, organic soil amendments and drip irrigation. A complete listing of 
demonstrations and exhibitors will be in the program, available at the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chances to Win 
</P>
<P>
Door prizes, donated by the exhibitors, will be awarded throughout the weekend. 
Watch for the person roving the event selling chances. 
</P>
<P>
The arboretum gift shop will also be open for sales of books, seeds and other 
items. And in case you work up an appetite from all the activity, there will be 
refreshment booths offering hot dogs, chili, lemonade, soft drinks and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
A donation of $2 per person or $5 per family is requested. Parking is free and 
there's easy access for strollers and wheelchairs. The Fullerton Arboretum is 
located at Yorba Linda Boulevard and Associated Road, west of the Orange 
Freeway. Look for the balloons at the top of the hill.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: SOME CLUBBY ARTIFACTS FROM THE LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a collection of golf clubs and balls going back, I believe, 
more than half a century. If I search for even older golf collectibles, what 
luck will I have finding them? -- W.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You'll be on a difficult mission. 
</P>
<P>
Although golf has been played in Scotland since the 15th Century, few 
collectors have equipment that can be authenticated as having been manufactured 
before the 19th Century. Even finding books on golf published before the 1850s 
is extremely difficult, collectors say. 
</P>
<P>
Some historians say they have found evidence that golf was played in this 
country before the American Revolution. But the game's popularity did not 
appear to catch on until just a few years before 1900. 
</P>
<P>
There is a school of collectors who maintain that if you are a dedicated 
accumulator of golf collectibles, you should search the countryside shops of 
Great Britain and pay particular attention to Scotland, where some valuable old 
equipment has surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Also, major auction houses have put valuable golf equipment on the block, 
sometimes as part of an estate. 
</P>
<P>
Along with equipment, golf collectibles have included prints, drawings, pottery 
and glass, all depicting some phase of the game or a famous tournament or 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment prices appear to vary widely, according to dealer catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Walter Hagen wood, manufactured in the 1930s, has sold for about 
$130. And, at the high end of the price range, a 19th-Century club associated 
with Scottish golf legend Willie Dunn has sold for approximately $2,000. But we 
also saw a number of clubs, about half a century old, selling in the $50-$100 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a number of glasses I inherited from my mother. She called them 
"kitchen glassware," to which I didn't attach any special meaning. But recently 
I was told that this label is for a particular type of collectible. Is that 
true? -- N.L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Kitchen Glassware is a label that was put on thick tumblers produced during 
the Great Depression. The label depicted a durable type of glassware that was 
manufactured in great numbers. Hence, its collectible price tag has not been 
astronomical -- not often above $100 for a single glass. 
</P>
<P>
Such glassware often had ornate patterns, which made them pretty to look at but 
not so easy to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen Glassware began disappearing from the American marketplace following 
World War II as new manufacturing techniques were developed. 
</P>
<P>
Bookshelf 
</P>
<P>
Consider the outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Collectible author Ronald S. Barlow of El Cajon did, and the result is a 
nostalgic 136-page paperback coffeetable-size paperback, "The Vanishing 
American Outhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Containing nearly 200 color photographs and plan drawings of American privies 
constructed between 1820 and 1940, the book will definitely appeal to 
collectors looking for offbeat stuff and to anyone searching for a quaint 
back-yard conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't met anyone who owns more than half a dozen," said Barlow, who is 
selling the book for $15.95 a copy, plus $1.50 postage and handling (Windmill 
Publishing Co., 2147 Windmill View Road, El Cajon, Calif. 92020). 
</P>
<P>
For a nation that prides itself on being on the cutting edge of technology, 
Barlow notes in his introduction, there are still approximately "4 million 
old-fashioned privies in back yards from Maine to California. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this is not anywhere near the 50 million 'unplumbed households' 
reported in the 1950 census, but we have put a man on the moon since then." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a topic of conversation in a civilized society, Barlow says, outhouses 
nevertheless are catching the eyes of landscape architects who "are moving many 
of these quaint folk art buildings to the back yards of their wealthiest 
clients. Even a good reproduction can run you up to $2,500 before any 
electrical or plumbing hookups." 
</P>
<P>
In this genre of collectibles, Barlow told us that even outhouse post cards of 
the 1930s have been selling for $2 apiece and that post cards with pictures of 
Victorian privies have sold for as much as $25 each.

FAMILY SPOTS: NURSERY WALKS LET TODDLERS GET IN STEP WITH NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The docents at Nursery Nature Walks, who lead family walks at 31 Southern 
California sites, like to get their charges off on the right foot -- well 
before that foot can even walk. "We like to start them on walks right after 
birth," director Judy Burns says. "Kids who start the walks right after they're 
born are so sensitive to nature. When they start talking, they say all the 
names of plants." 
</P>
<P>
Geared for families with preschool children (although older siblings are 
encouraged to come along), the walks usually are two hours long and paced for 
beginning walkers. Most of the sites are stroller-accessible. Participation is 
not limited to parents and their children; grandparents, aunts and uncles -- 
anyone with a preschooler in tow -- is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of touching and feeling and smelling" along the path, Burns says. 
"They look under things and then put back the rock homes. The docents talk 
about what grows where and about Indian life." 
</P>
<P>
The program began four years ago under the sponsorship of the Palisades-Malibu 
YMCA with walks in the Santa Monica Mountains. Now, as the program has 
attracted 80 volunteers from different areas, walks are offered from Orange 
County to San Gabriel to Ventura. Sites include Will Rogers State Historic 
Park, Arroyo Seco, Charmlee Park, Chatsworth Park South, Griffith Park, 
Chantree Flats and Almansor Park. Most walks are limited to 10 families and 
reservations are required. One to two weeks advance reservations are necessary 
for most walks, longer for the most popular outings such as the one at 
Placerita State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Spaces still are available for walks May 13 and 20 at Topanga State Park, May 
14 at El Dorado Park (Long Beach), May 21 at Malibu Creek State Park and May 27 
for Almansor Park duck pond. 
</P>
<P>
Donations are requested for walks ($3 per family). For reservations or to be 
put on the mailing list of upcoming walks, call (213) 454-5591.

GIONIS ORDERED TO TRIAL IN WAYNE ATTACK, FREED ON BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Thomas A. Gionis was ordered Friday to stand trial on charges of attacking 
his ex-wife, John Wayne's daughter, Aissa, after a judge decided that 
authorities had enough evidence to link the orthopedic surgeon to two men who 
carried out the assault in Newport Beach last fall. 
</P>
<P>
While Newport Beach Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw did set bail of $250,000 
for Gionis over the strong objections of prosecutors, she offered a scathing 
summary of the evidence against the surgeon, concluding that he "snapped" as a 
result of a divorce and bitter battle over custody of the couple's only child, 
2-year-old Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
"You went off the deep end," Shaw said to Gionis after a weeklong preliminary 
hearing in her courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 35, of Pomona was released after the court hearing Friday afternoon, 
according to a spokesman for the Orange County Jail, where he had been held 
since his arrest April 4. "I feel fine," said Gionis, smiling, after the court 
hearing. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' sister, Xanthi, 25, who manages the surgeon's string of five Southland 
medical clinics, said her brother now will be able to resume his practice. She 
said that the surgeon is also booked through June for non-related court 
appearances as an expert medical witness. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw set Gionis' arraignment for May 5 in Orange County Superior Court. He is 
charged with conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon in the Oct. 3 
assault on Wayne, 33, and her former boyfriend, financier Roger W. Luby, 53, at 
Luby's gated Newport Beach estate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Pleaded Not Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Gionis has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have said he knew 
nothing about the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, praised Shaw for setting bond in the case, 
although it was higher than the $50,000 he had requested. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got a fair shake," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans had asked for no bail and then a 
$5-million bail, but the judge announced during a hearing Friday that she had 
decided to allow Gionis' release. Evans said, however, that he was generally 
pleased with the outcome of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"She did her job," Evans said of Shaw's ruling that Gionis must stand trial. 
"She held him to answer." 
</P>
<P>
In setting bail, Shaw attached the unusual condition that Gionis receive weekly 
counseling by a psychiatrist or psychologist to help contain his emotions over 
the custody case. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Gionis, who according to testimony spent $500,000 in legal fees 
to gain custody of his daughter, was obsessed with his "passion" for the child, 
leading him to commit the crime. Wayne has been awarded custody of the girl 
pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings against Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Obsessed' 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gionis, you are obsessed with losing your daughter, who is a beautiful 
child. Genetically, she is (looks like) you," Shaw said, referring to a 
photograph that she had seen of the child. "The passion between you and the 
daughter is beyond description. In a strange sort of way, my heart goes out to 
you because I understand the intensity (with) which you love your daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the case "a passion play," Shaw chastised both Gionis and Wayne for 
failing to resolve differences and effectively raise Anastasia. Shaw said the 
girl will be the loser if the two don't learn to get along. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, you two are going to have to get your acts together and raise 
that child (or) that kid is going to be a basket case," Shaw said to Gionis, 
who listened impassively. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw suggested that the "straw that broke the camel's back" for Gionis occurred 
last August when, according to court testimony, Wayne violated a court 
visitation order and took Anastasia to Arizona for a 3-day vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither parent was allowed at the time to take the child outside Orange or Los 
Angeles counties, pending a custody trial that was to start Sept. 29. The trial 
date was later changed to Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"In your mind, 'that gal is stealing my child,' " Shaw said. "That put you over 
the brink. You were put into (emotional) overload," Shaw contended. "You said, 
'I want to teach them (Wayne and Luby) a lesson. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luby Theory Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bailey's assertions that the attack was directed at Luby, not Wayne, 
Shaw said the court evidence shows that Gionis began arranging for the assault 
immediately after the Arizona trip. 
</P>
<P>
She cited as evidence $40,000 in payments over a 2-week period made by Gionis 
to a private investigator, O. Daniel Gal, 32, of Beverly Hills, who is charged 
with hiring the men who carried out the attack. Gal, who conducted 
custody-related surveillance work for Gionis, had been paid only $22,000 in the 
6 months before that, Shaw noted. 
</P>
<P>
Gal is in custody in Switzerland and is to be extradited to California to face 
conspiracy charges in the case. Held in Orange County Jail are the men Gal 
allegedly hired: Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, an unemployed apartment manager 
from Burbank, and Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool cleaner from Simi 
Valley. All three are being held on $1-million bail each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Phone Calls 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said that further evidence of conspiracy comes from a series of telephone 
calls made between Gionis and Gal on the day of the attack, which, she said, 
shows that Gionis was intricately involved. The calls were documented through 
seizure of telephone records by Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
"Phone calls don't lie," the judge said. "They're like fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw warned Gionis not to take Anastasia and flee the country, as prosecutors 
allege he was preparing to do at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"You would not only make yourself a fugitive, you would make (the child) a 
fugitive," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw also offered some parting advice: 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope, Dr. Gionis, that you get this experience behind you and get on 
with your life."

JORDAN POLICE ARREST 144 AS RIOTS SPREAD

<P>
Hundreds of rioters smashed bank windows, looted buildings and pelted police 
officers with rocks Friday as riots caused by price increases spread to 
northern Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 14 people outside Amman and 130 elsewhere around the country, 
including 70 members of the banned Communist Party in a crackdown on the unrest 
that has raged for four days and engulfed much of southern Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Troops banned Muslims from weekly prayers in troubled southern cities in an 
attempt to prevent more unrest, which has killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hussein Cancels Meeting 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British Foreign Office said King Hussein canceled plans to stop 
there on his way back to Amman from a visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jordan Valley town of Salt, a city of 100,000 about 12 miles north of 
Amman, children played inside shattered offices, and hundreds of people milled 
around on the glass-strewn streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The demonstrators shouted slogans hailing King Hussein, but like their fellow 
citizens in south Jordan demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid 
Rifai," said one witness contacted by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators blame Rifai for the austerity measures and declining living 
standards. They shouted support for Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all our money," said a 
man in his 60s who refused to give his name. He said demonstrators "trust the 
king's leadership, and we know he will respond." 
</P>
<P>
Riots also occurred Thursday night in the northern towns of Madaba and Taiyiba. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time disturbances had spread beyond the south since the unrest 
began Tuesday in the southern city of Maan. The demonstrations came in response 
to price increase of 10% to 50% on gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
The increases were imposed Sunday as part of an agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund to reschedule Jordan's $6-billion foreign debt. 
They came on top of rising unemployment and soaring inflation.

SUSPECT RELEASED IN MIX-UP ARRESTED ON RAPE CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Baldwin Park man is back in custody after a paper-work snafu allowed him to 
be released from jail Wednesday and allegedly rape an 18-year-old housekeeper 
upon returning to the same Seal Beach home he was accused of burglarizing a 
week before. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Madrid, 19, was rearrested by Baldwin Park police and turned over to Seal 
Beach police Thursday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid had allegedly confessed his first break-in of the Seal Beach home to 
Police Detective Darrell Hardin last Friday. Hardin thought he had until 
Wednesday to finish transcribing the interview tape, Police Chief Bill Stearns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the detective apparently didn't realize that a new judicial policy cut the 
inmate holding time from 72 to 36 working hours for arraignment, the hearing in 
which a defendant is formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
When Madrid appeared for arraignment in Westminster Municipal Court on Tuesday, 
the transcript of his Monday night confession to Hardin was unavailable to 
prosecutors, and the hearing could not be postponed. So charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns said that on that day, Hardin had been meeting with prosecutors in 
Santa Ana on an unrelated murder case. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as he knew, he had until the next day to finish his paper work," 
Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office had to drop the charges against Madrid, and he 
was released early Wednesday. Later in the morning, an intruder broke into the 
same house Madrid had been accused of burglarizing. 
</P>
<P>
The housekeeper, making beds, was confronted by a man who had grabbed a kitchen 
knife. She was beaten, raped and sodomized, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid surrendered to Baldwin Park police officers early Thursday when he heard 
they were looking for him, Stearns said. He was held in the Orange County Jail 
on $50,000 bail after being booked for investigation of rape, auto theft and 
receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns said that even if Madrid had been charged Tuesday, it was likely that 
he would not have been held in jail because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not clairvoyant," Stearns said. "We had no reason to think this guy had 
violent tendencies." 
</P>
<P>
Hardin said he did not transcribe Madrid's statement because he had already 
worked a 14-hour day Monday. He said he knew Madrid's arraignment was scheduled 
for Tuesday morning, but "we couldn't get the paper work done, and the D.A. 
kicked it out. We just didn't have time." 
</P>
<P>
Madrid was originally arrested April 13, a few hours after the Seal Beach home 
had been broken into. El Monte police, who made that arrest, said Madrid was 
driving a $20,000 Porsche that had been reported stolen from the home. 
</P>
<P>
The housekeeper attacked Wednesday is a Long Beach resident. She was treated at 
Los Alamitos Medical Center and released to her family, police said.

DRUG MONEY TO PAVE WAY FOR PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county has provided bulldozers, trucks and a cement mixer. A rock quarry is 
hauling tons of crushed gravel. Squads of jail inmates are scrambling to spruce 
up the area. The transit district will supply 20 buses for the lucky few. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's talk of serving lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The expenses for the special ceremony planned at a remote ranch will be paid by 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Sheriff Brad Gates said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The site was used by a drug smuggler, and President George Bush will use that 
stage Tuesday to turn over to Gates and other law enforcement officials $4.39 
million -- their share of money confiscated during a heroin raid last year. 
</P>
<P>
How much will the VIP-only visit cost? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where we are with that right now," Gates said Friday. "It will 
come out of the drug money itself." 
</P>
<P>
Most officials don't have firm estimates, but grading and clearing work to 
improve the road and build two helicopter pads needed for Tuesday's 2-hour 
visit could total as much as $40,000, possibly more. And there will be extras: 
phone lines, latrines, extra sheriff's patrols, among other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Money Well Spent' 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors were not available Friday 
afternoon to discuss the costs involved. But county officials said there is 
little or no concern about the wisdom of spending the money for what is 
essentially a media event. This despite Gates' reputation for regularly coming 
hat-in-hand to the Board of Supervisors for more money. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done any research on it, but I believe the drug money can be used 
for sheriff's programs related to drug enforcement, and I would guess that a 
visit by the President could fall under this category," said Deputy County 
Counsel Art Wahlstedt. "I would speculate that the whole thing is for publicity 
against drugs, and that would probably be OK, especially since (the ranch) is 
going to be used as a training facility, part of which might involve anti-drug 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"It's money well spent," Gates said in an interview Friday. "The money is 
similar to what we would spend whenever the President is here. . . . I 
certainly feel honored as an officeholder, a citizen and a father." 
</P>
<P>
Added Gates: "The exposure, based on what the President says about communities 
getting involved in turning off the faucet of (drug) consumption, will help and 
certainly his presence here and his conversation will add to getting that goal 
accomplished for us." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that many of the improvements will be of benefit later, when the 
ranch becomes an anti-narcotics training center. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was willing to guess Friday afternoon about what the county's final tab 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
County bulldozers were being used, along with work crews to trim trees, grade 
roads, parking areas and helicopter pads, said Bill Reiter, the county's public 
works operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
Reiter said that 25 to 35 honor farm inmates are being used to clear brush and 
work on a fence at the site, a number which could rise to 65 over the weekend. 
Inmates have been there before, driving posts for a new fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably our charge is going to be from $25,000 to $40,000, but that's only a 
'guesstimate' and it could go higher," Reiter said. 
</P>
<P>
The county was buying tons of road material from Ortega Rock on Ortega Highway, 
about 10 miles from the ranch, but John Schmutz, general manager of the firm, 
said he had no estimate of the final cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supplying and hauling on as-needed basis," Schmutz said. "The price 
depends on the customer. The county has annual contracts with us, so (on price) 
we take care of the county." 
</P>
<P>
Without any discounts, Schmutz said, the cost to a new customer would be about 
$6.60 a ton, plus $3.30 per ton-mile for delivery. Schmutz said he did not know 
how many tons were being used. A steady stream of trucks was delivering the 
crushed aggregate base for the roadway Friday, each truck carrying 10 to 15 
tons, a dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Love, administrative director for county's General Services Agency, said 
his agency was procuring materials and issuing contracts as needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our instruction to staff is to assist them (the sheriff and the White House) 
and get whatever they need," said Love. "The sheriff's special narcotics fund 
is supposed to reimburse us for everything. We're talking about getting 
electricians, plumbers, catering trucks out there, and I don't have a handle on 
everything yet. We were told to do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Transit District spokeswoman said her agency would supply 20 
buses for transportation to the ranch, with no estimate yet of the cost. 
Normally, it costs the district about $60 an hour to run each bus, or $1,200 
for a fleet of 20, not including administrative overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we will have some mechanics out there in case something happens," said 
Claudia Keith, the spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said he was counting on Gates' 
personal assurances that all county expenses will be paid by the Sheriff's 
Department. In fact, several county agency chiefs said Friday that Gates' staff 
had given them an account number to which expenses could be charged. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I thought I was free of this when I left Santa Barbara," said 
Parrish, referring to former President Ronald Reagan's frequent visits to his 
Santa Barbara ranch when Parrish was that county's chief administrative 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling a presidential visit to Santa Barbara with Queen Elizabeth several 
years ago, Parrish said: "It nearly bankrupted us."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
MAN IS ARRESTED IN TWO SANTA CRUZ DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man has been arrested in connection with the slayings of his 
estranged wife and her lover in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Antonio Varela, 27, was arrested in the alley in the 1400 block of 
North Durant Street about 9 p.m. Thursday after police received a report of a 
commotion. Officers said they found Varela alone, yelling at apartments facing 
the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz police said that Varela is a suspect in the murders of Barbara 
Prowley, 38, and Rogelio Conejo, 22, on Feb. 20 at Prowley's apartment in the 
Beach Flats area of Santa Cruz. The two had been severely chopped with a "brush 
hook," a gardening tool with a curved blade, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Prowley and Varela, who had been married since 1980, were in the process of 
divorce and had been separated for 5 months, police said. Varela often visited 
Prowley at her apartment, where the two had once lived, and worked at odd jobs 
around the apartment complex where Prowley was the manager. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said Varela gave as his address a home on South Flower Street 
in Santa Ana. But Santa Cruz police said that Varela had been living in a 
trailer with his brother in Scotts Valley, about 5 miles north of Santa Cruz, 
before the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz Police Sgt. Joe Haebe said that Varela was "very jealous of his wife 
seeing other men during their separation. We think it's a crime of passion and 
rage." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence in the apartment led police to Varela, Haebe said. 
</P>
<P>
Varela, who is being held in Orange County Jail, is expected to be returned to 
Santa Cruz to face murder charges.

SCHOLARS WILL EXAMINE BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush's track record during his first 100 days in office will 
be examined by six presidential scholars at a symposium Wednesday at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 100 days has been the traditional evaluation period since F.D.R.," 
said J. Vincent Buck, a political science professor at the school. "I think 
most people expected more out of Bush in the first 100 days. Everything people 
said could go wrong did." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Buck, the symposium speakers will be Harry P. Jeffrey, associate 
professor of history at CSUF; Anthony Rimmer, associate professor of 
communications at CSUF; Mark Petracca, assistant professor of political science 
at UC Irvine; Michael Genovese, associate professor of political science at 
Loyola Marymount University, and Fred Bergerson, professor of political science 
at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., will be in the 
University Center Theater on the Fullerton campus. More information can by 
obtained by calling 773-3521.

2 TRAPPED IN SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
STATE LAUNCHES SEARCH FOR FRUIT FLY INFESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two male Mexican fruit flies have been captured within the past month in Santa 
Ana, and the state has launched a search, state officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A door-to-door hunt began Friday in the neighborhoods around Bishop Street and 
Lingan Lane, where the flies were spotted in traps, Gera Curry, spokeswoman for 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said Friday. The second fly was 
found Thursday ; the first was found March 22 about 2 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
A fruit fly infestation could devastate California fruit crops and cause losses 
of more than $100 million, Curry said. "We're talking about a possible major 
economic loss, and we don't want to get it started in California." 
</P>
<P>
The last fruit fly infestation was in Los Angeles County in 1983 and 1984, and 
the cost to eliminate it about $2.7 million, Curry said. Fruit crops were not 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Curry asked that residents comply when state employees ask to cut fruit growing 
in their back yards "to determine whether there is a breeding population." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone in the area who notices worms or maggots in a piece of fruit from a 
back-yard tree should call the Orange County agricultural commissioner's 
office, (714) 447-7100.

HIT-RUN DRIVER CLAIMS PRISON RAPE, LOSES PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite tearful testimony in which Gary Alan Haw described being raped twice in 
prison, an Orange County Superior Court judge Friday rejected the hit-and-run 
driver's plea to serve his sentence elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Haw, who struck and killed a bicyclist in Laguna Hills in 1987, told Judge 
James K. Turner that he had been sexually assaulted twice during his first 3 
months in prison. Haw, 26, said he had been afraid to call for help or report 
the incidents because his life was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"They put me in Chino Central and they placed me in a cell with another man 
just for 1 night," Haw said, describing his first night in prison. "He raped me 
and when he got done he urinated on me." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 30, Haw was sentenced to 2 years in state prison for hit-and-run 
driving and conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
Haw was driving his father's 1986 Porsche 911 on Alicia Parkway on Sept. 8, 
1987, when he passed a van that had slowed down for bicyclist Jason Klein, 17. 
Haw stuck Klein, throwing him more that 300 feet and killing him on impact. 
</P>
<P>
Haw, who was 24 at the time, and his father, Ronald Haw, concocted a story that 
put the senior Haw behind the wheel because the insurance on the car did not 
cover drivers under 25. According to police reports, the front end of the 
$80,000 Porsche was shattered in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
However, when officers talked to a witness who identified the younger Haw as 
the driver, the Haws admitted that they made up the story. Ronald Haw was 
convicted and sentenced to 1 year in a halfway house in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Haw also testified Friday that both a nurse and a prison doctor failed to 
examine him when he complained of bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, citing reports that stated there were no visible physical injuries 
to Haw and a prison report recommending that his sentence remain the same, also 
questioned Haw's story that he was denied proper medical attention. He said he 
found it difficult to believe that the nurse and doctor took "this cavalier, 
don't-give-a-damn attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Haw has been out of prison on $50,000 bail and living with friends since Jan. 
5. He remains free but under court order not to drive pending appeal on his 
case.

VICTIMS IN 3-CAR CRASH IN BUENA PARK ARE AIRLIFTED TO UCI MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two motorists with serious injuries were airlifted by helicopter to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange on Friday night after they were involved in a three-car, 
chain-reaction crash in Buena Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Richard McMillan said one of the motorists who was airlifted -- Lorie 
M. McDermott, 25, of Fullerton -- was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, who was driving a red Chevrolet Vega, failed to stop for a red light 
at the corner of Orangethorpe and Stanton avenues about 6:45 p.m., police said. 
Her car hit the rear end of a white Dodge Colt driven by Donald B. Spalding, 
65, of Buena Park. Spalding's car then struck the rear of a black Buick Regal, 
McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the conditions of McDermott and Spalding were still unlisted by 
hospital personnel late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kenneth E. Collins, 49, of Downey, who was a passenger in the 
Regal, was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital by ambulance with neck and back 
injuries. He was listed in stable condition.

6 ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH 2 ANAHEIM THEFT RINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim police Friday announced the arrest of suspects in 2 alleged theft 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
One ring involved the theft of wallets and purses from hotel guests in the 
Disneyland area, and the other ring specialized in stealing computers, 
facsimile machines and cellular car phones. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jack Para, commander of Anaheim's property crimes bureau, said 3 men were 
arrested on suspicion of grand theft at the Anaheim Marriott hotel Friday after 
they had fled from the neighboring Anaheim Hilton and Towers, where employees 
had spotted them. 
</P>
<P>
Para said the Hilton employees recognized the suspects from police flyers given 
to them. The employees notified the Marriott's security staff and the arrests 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, another person suspected of being connected with the same theft 
ring was arrested after a similar incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there have been five cases of grand theft in the Disneyland Hotel 
area in the last 4 days. 
</P>
<P>
In four of the cases, police said, the victims were Asian tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves had been operating in groups of at least three, police said, so as 
to distract the guests as their wallets and purses were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Booked at the Anaheim jail were Jorge Gonzales, 34, Manuel Juanes, 21, and 
Sergio Zapata, 38, all Colombian nationals, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police arrested two men on Wednesday who are suspects in at least 12 
commercial burglaries in the east Anaheim area involving costly electronic 
office equipment and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
Jailed on suspicion of grand theft were David Owen Wiggins, 27, and Martin 
Aaron Pfortmiller, 21, both of Anaheim. More than $50,000 in stolen equipment 
has been recovered, police said. The two men were taken to Orange County Jail, 
with their bail set at $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after Orange police, who had arrested the same pair on 
suspicion of attempted burglary, notified Anaheim detectives. The Anaheim 
detectives linked the men to the Anaheim incidents, Para said.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: LPGA IS HOPING OC TURNS OUT OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's official: Orange County is now the proud owner of the initial-heavy LPGA 
NTA/MBS Classic, which has an ETA of Sept. 21 at LCCC, a first tee-off time of 
8 a.m. (PST), a Pro-Am that might feature a CEO or two and a field that likely 
will include M.J. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Alphabet lessons aside, this means the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. Nippon 
Travel Agency/Mainichi Broadcasting System Classic (a moment, please, to catch 
my breath) begins Sept. 21 at Los Coyotes Country Club. It also means that if 
you're a golf fan, you applaud the news. The tournament name (the worst title 
since the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic), however, will take some getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
The LPGA has wanted -- needed -- a tournament in Orange County ever since the 
dearly departed Uniden Invitational died a hero's death at Mesa Verde Country 
Club in 1986. Think about the possibilities: populous area, lots of golfers, 
agreeable weather, major market, growing market. And no tournament . . . until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year absence, the LPGA returns, apparently wiser and more organized 
than during its stay at Mesa Verde. To hear new commissioner William Blue tell 
it, the LPGA intends on making The LPGA NTA, etc. Classic an annual affair, a 
tournament that will stand the test of time and rocky starts. 
</P>
<P>
How serious is Blue? Well, serious enough to endure a strange, almost comical 
news conference this week that featured two interpreters, Zsa Zsa Gabor jokes, 
Japanese television crews and one reporter who kept asking if the tournament 
would run 54 or 72 holes (for the final time -- 72!). When it was over, the 
LPGA got what it wanted (two rich sponsors), the sponsors got what they wanted 
(exposure) and Orange County got what it deserved (a tournament). 
</P>
<P>
This was some scene, this news conference. Japanese dignitaries outnumbered 
local reporters. Japanese television crews and reporters outnumbered local 
reporters. Long, monotonic speeches by several of the sponsor representatives 
somehow became two-sentence utterances, all courtesy of the interpreters. And 
every few minutes, you could count on a certain person to ask if the Classic 
was a 54-hole event. 
</P>
<P>
But the most interesting part of the proceedings was Blue's impromptu speech. 
Turns out it was a mini-State of the LPGA Address. Lucky for you, I was able to 
understand most of what the interpreter was telling the assembled Japanese 
sponsors and Japanese media about Blue's oration. 
</P>
<P>
Here goes: 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "Trying to talk more and give better superlatives about Orange County and 
golf makes me feel like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband on their wedding night. I 
know what's expected of me -- I'd just like to make it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter (in Japanese): "Distinguished corporate members of NTA and MBS, as 
well as Far East media: That was such a bad joke, I will not waste your time 
retelling it. Let's hope this guy can run the LPGA better than he can give a 
speech. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "One month ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Japan . . . to announce a 
multiyear, multimillion dollar program that will provide both live and 
rebroadcast of LPGA events in Japan. We are very pleased to welcome the Nippon 
Travel Group to our LPGA family and we thank them very much for their interest. 
We know it will be a very long and profitable relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter: "Mr. Funny says thanks for bankrolling another LPGA event. He says 
you'll turn a profit on your investment. Of course, didn't the LPGA tell the 
Uniden event the same thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "We recognize the enthusiasm and the potential of Orange County -- not 
just for the next two or three years -- but in the 1990s, leading to the 21st 
century. The growth of amateur women, especially in Orange County, says that 
there is a wonderful long-term opportunity for the LPGA." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter: "He says that Orange County women are large. Wait -- that's not 
right. He says that the number of women amateur golfers in Orange County is 
growing and because of that, he likes your chances for a successful tournament 
this year and for years to come. At about $600,000 a pop to sponsor a 
tournament, he'd better be right." 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "The relationships of the community, LPGA, country club, charities, all 
form a perfect combination to bring great golf, great contributions and 
community involvement that we feel is healthy, necessary and very important for 
the future of golf." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter: "He said -- I have no idea what he just said. What I'll do is talk 
a little longer so he'll think I'm telling you what he just said. Actually, I 
think the Zsa Zsa Gabor joke made more sense than what he just said." 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "Therefore, in summary, I am very pleased with the addition of Orange 
County, not only for 1989, but for many, many years to come as one of the 
foundation tournaments for the future of the LPGA." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter: "He says Orange County is a great place to have a tournament. But 
what I really think he's saying is that he needs some deep-pocketed sponsors, 
like you fellas, to foot the tab." 
</P>
<P>
Blue: "And positioned in the lovely fall season, and the second tournament 
before the end of our official money program, the field that the LPGA will 
deliver will be one of the best of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Interpreter: "He says he'll deliver the goods as long as you keep writing the 
checks. If you ask my opinion, it sounds like a pretty good deal for everyone: 
NTA, MBS, the LPGA and Orange County. Just work on shortening the name of this 
thing and you might have something. Thank you."

TUSTIN BREAKS ESTANCIA GRIP IN A BIG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tustin High School has had more than a few problems against Estancia pitchers 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers hadn't scored a run against the Eagles in 12 innings. They were 
shut out Wednesday by Estancia, putting the two teams in a tie for first place 
in the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
Things have been so bad that Tustin Coach Vince Brown taped a photo of Estancia 
starting pitcher Greg Brannis in the Tiller dugout before Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it took a while, but it worked. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers vented their frustration Friday with a 13-run sixth-inning for a 
14-5 rout-from-behind victory at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Tillers into first place, one game ahead of Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
"With the problems we've had scoring runs against them this year, Estancia must 
have felt pretty good about having a four-run lead in the sixth," Brown said. 
"But once we broke through, it became a tidal wave." 
</P>
<P>
After Ted Wieczorek led off the sixth with homer to cut the deficit to 5-2, the 
Tillers loaded the bases with no outs. 
</P>
<P>
Brown then reached deep into his dugout to find someone to create the 
breakthrough. Pete Gerlach was sent up to pinch-hit for shortstop Erik 
Lagafuaina. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach, a reserve outfielder, was hitless in five previous at-bats this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday he lashed a two-strike pitch down the right-field line, scoring 
three runs to tie the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a hunch," Brown said. "Yesterday we had worked on a few things and 
corrected a flaw in his swing." 
</P>
<P>
After Gerlach's triple, Clayton Nelson replaced Brannis and gave up a single to 
Shawn Green, which gave the Tillers (12-7 overall, 7-2 in league play) a 6-5 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, it became batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the Tustin lineup, with exception of Dave Sagan, got a hit. 
Everyone scored a run, some two. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Gerlach tied the score, everyone relaxed and began hitting like they are 
capable," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The benefactor of the offensive awakening was pitcher Dan Baker, who went the 
distance for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Baker (4-2) had struck out 14 in a one-hitter a week ago, but on Friday he was 
wild through the first three innings. He walked four batters, hit another, and 
committed a balk. 
</P>
<P>
He also served up a three-run homer to Mark Hartley in the second, which gave 
Estancia (13-6, 6-3) a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who finished with 13 strikeouts, gathered momentum after working out of 
a base-loaded jam in the third. But, by then, it looked too late. 
</P>
<P>
"After the third inning I told the guys in dugout they had to come through for 
me," Baker said. "I told them I needed their help." 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, the Tillers honored that request. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 12, Newport Harbor 5 -- Second baseman Greg Haack was three for 
three and knocked in four runs to lead Corona del Mar (6-12, 3-6). First 
baseman Todd Kehrli hit a three-run homer in a nine-run first inning for Corona 
del Mar. Left-hander Matt Goldstein picked up his second league victory. 
Newport Harbor dropped to 1-8 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
University 4, Saddleback 0 -- Senior left-hander Kevin Squires (4-2) pitched a 
one-hitter with five strikeouts for host University (8-10-1, 5-4). First 
baseman Al Marlinga went two for three with two RBIs for University. Saddleback 
is 5-4 in league play.

WALNUT TAKES DANA HILLS OUT OF RELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tansley never had a chance. And for that, he can thank Matt Hempel. 
</P>
<P>
Tansley, running the anchor leg of the boys' 4 x 1,600-meter relay at the Mt. 
San Antonio College Relays Friday, never got a chance to show his speed. 
</P>
<P>
Hempel, part of a brother combination for Walnut, broke the race open on the 
leg before Tansley got the baton, and Dana Hills was too far behind to make it 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Hempel got the baton back in fifth place but ran powerfully into the lead 
midway through his leg. And when he handed off to brother Scott, Walnut had a 
10-second lead on Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut went on to win in a meet-record 17 minutes 35.61 seconds, breaking Santa 
Barbara's 10-year-old standard of 17:42.8. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills, despite a fine 4:19.75 leg by Tansley, was a well-beaten second in 
17:44.77. Tansley had turned in a personal-best and school-record of 9:10.11 
for 3,200 two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Niednagel, Andrew Tansley and Dan Niednagel ran the first three legs for 
Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, thanks to a strong 4:17.5 anchor leg by Mike Nielsen, came from 
behind to take third in 17:47.94. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena was fifth in 18:02.27. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, with 600 meters to go in the boys' invitational 
3,000, a pack of about six runners -- including Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana 
Valley -- were bunched at the front. 
</P>
<P>
But David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit quickly ruined any hopes the others had of 
winning. Welsh used a long, drawn-out kick to win in a meet-record 8:23.11, 
breaking the old mark of 8:24.7 set by Ramon Gomez of L.A. Belmont in 1984. And 
in the process he pulled the field to some very fast times. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Ibarri of Mexico was second in 8:25.97, and Bryan Dameworth of Agoura was 
third in 8:29.02. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was fifth in 8:31.12, a personal best for the distance, which is run 
less often than the 3,200 in boys' competition. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar, who had run in third until just past the 1,600 
mark, finished seventh in 8:34.06. Lavelle will run the invitational 1,500 
today at 11:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams fared well in boys' 4 x 400 meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
Edison had the fastest time among county teams, running 3:24.97 for second in 
its race. Ken Arao, a transfer student from Japan, ran an unofficial 50.8 
leadoff leg, Matt Hart followed with a 53.8, Tom Tyler 50.5 and Dave Baker 50.0 
as Edison finished a close second to Leuzinger (3:24.44). 
</P>
<P>
Katella ran 3:26.84 to edge Valencia, which ran 3:26.88, to win its heat. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4 x 100 relay, Valencia's team of Eric Whitcomb, Rick Smith, Brian 
Anderson and Kevin Thomas ran 44.1 to win its heat over second-place Etiwanda 
(44.4) and third-place Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC Notes 
</P>
<P>
The high school portion of the meet continues today at 8 a.m. . . . Brian 
Zeiler of Trabuco Hills won the pole vault with a leap of 13-feet-6. . . . Andy 
Marron of Dana Hills finished second to Terry Pearce of Paso Robles in the 
discus. Pearce outthrew Marron 154-7 1/2 to 144-9.

The last name of the spokesman for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine and its 
parent firm should look familiar. It's Connally, as in John B. Connally, the 
former Texas governor and presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman is the former politician's youngest son, Mark M. Connally. Before 
taking on his new duties, the 36-year-old Connally worked for Lincoln's parent 
firm, American Continental Corp., overseeing land development and loan 
administration at its Tucson office for the last 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's chairman, the politically well-connected Charles H. 
Keating Jr., served a short stint as campaign manager for the senior Connally's 
presidential campaign in 1980.

PRIME COMPUTER TO APPEAL TAKEOVER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Computer Inc. said Friday that it will appeal a federal judge's decision 
allowing MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin to proceed with its $1.3-billion hostile 
takeover bid for Prime once it makes additional financial disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston refused to grant an injunction that would 
have barred MAI's bid on grounds that the $20-per-share tender offer violated 
federal margin rules limiting the amount of stock that can be pledged as 
collateral in a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker, on Friday asked the U.S. 1st 
Circuit Court of Appeals for an expedited hearing on the margin issue. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow said the Orange County 
computer firm will "vigorously oppose" Prime's appeal "and any other effort by 
Prime to avoid or delay the prompt sale of Prime." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from that appeal, MAI's offer remains blocked by the federal district 
court until 10 days after MAI's investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
supplies 1988 financial information to Prime shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Judge A. David Mazzone has ruled that Drexel is a "co-bidder" in MAI's tender 
offer and must therefore provide detailed financial information to Prime. DAVID

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS INFORMATION SYSTEMS LOST $9 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine-based McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Co., which has posted losses 
for each of the last 5 years, on Friday reported an operating loss of $9 
million for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But company officials said they were encouraged because the loss was a sharp 
improvement over the whopping $28-million deficit recorded during the same 
period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Information Systems is a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp., a St. Louis-based 
aerospace and defense giant, and is an amalgam of companies in various 
high-technology businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Information Systems has been undergoing a reorganization and cost-cutting drive 
in an effort to reduce its losses, said Nissen Davis, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that restructuring, the company recently sold its Irvine-based 
hospital computer business to a unit of American Express Co. The company has 
also reduced its worldwide employment from 12,000 in early 1988 to just 9,000 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really tightened our belts and eliminated a lot of costs," Davis said. 
"We've concentrated on those areas of the business that are profitable. We 
believe the company is well on its way to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that excluding costs associated with debt payments on some 
businesses acquired several years ago, Information Systems would have reported 
a profit for the quarter. DAVID OLMOS

3RD OFFICER TO LEAVE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFEGUARD EXECUTIVE RESIGNS, SELLS BACK STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Kay, a founder and a major stockholder in Safeguard Health Enterprises 
Inc., has resigned as an officer and director of the Anaheim-based dental care 
provider and has sold his stock back to the company for nearly $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kay, who was a senior vice president and member of Safeguard's board, is the 
third officer to leave the company in a little more than a year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President Ronald I. Brendzel said Kay, 56, had assumed fewer 
responsibilities in recent years and chose to step down because he wanted to be 
"semi-retired." Kay could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said that in the past, executives have left the company partly 
because of frustration caused by their working relationships with members of 
the Baileys family, which controls Safeguard operations. 
</P>
<P>
The family members include Safeguard Chairman Alvin M. Baileys; his son and 
company President Dr. Steven J. Baileys, and Brendzel, who is related to the 
Baileyses by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy E. Ryan, an analyst at the brokerage of Swergold &amp; Chefitz in San 
Francisco, said managers from outside the family have found it difficult to 
implement their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
Safeguard, which has 830,000 members in dental plans in 13 states, reported 
earnings of $3.4 million last year, a 17% increase over earnings for the 
previous year. Revenue fell 4% to $67.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the elder Baileys, Kay was the last of the company's four founders 
to have remained with the firm. Another founder left soon after the company was 
formed in 1974; a second, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Brendzel said Kay will remain with the company for 1 year as a consultant and 
will be paid a figure that is "in line" with the $150,000 salary he received 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Safeguard said it purchased Kay's 900,764 shares of company stock for $5.50 per 
share. It said he received an initial payment of $3 million, with the rest to 
be paid over the next 3 years with interest. The stock closed Friday at $5.50 
per share, unchanged in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said Safeguard's purchase of Kay's 17% stake may signify that the firm is 
moving "little by little" toward a total buyout, which would transform it into 
a privately owned company. 
</P>
<P>
Including the purchase of Kay's shares, Safeguard has bought 3.5 million of the 
8 million shares that were outstanding 3 years ago. Brendzel said 4.5 million 
shares are now outstanding, with company officials holding about 39% of those. 
He said there are no plans for the company to become private.

JOSEPH N. BELL: F. LEE BAILEY'S TRAVELING LAW REVIEW COMES TO ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I dropped by Harbor Municipal Court this week to check out F. Lee Bailey. In 
case you don't follow such things, Bailey is certainly one of a handful of 
famous criminal attorneys -- if not the most famous -- in the country. He was 
flown out here over last weekend to defend Pomona orthopedic surgeon Thomas A. 
Gionis, who was accused of ordering the Oct. 3 assault on his ex-wife, Aissa 
Wayne, and her then-companion, Roger W. Luby, in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the spectator area on the first 2 days of Gionis' preliminary 
hearing was well-populated but never full, and about half the audience appeared 
to be working press and lawyers looking for a short course in 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
When I arrived Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans had just 
finished questioning an employee of Pacific Bell about phone records apparently 
showing a number of calls between Gionis and private investigator O. Daniel 
Gal, who was observed at the scene of the attack and employed the two men 
allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey is a portly, ruddy-faced, avuncular man who approached his 
cross-examination with almost cherubic bonhomie. Toying with his glasses, he 
spoke extemporaneously, quite remarkable in view of the fact that he had 
arrived on the scene less than 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had crossed my life once before, rather obliquely, when I did a magazine 
piece about a medical doctor who specialized in hypnosis and told me that he 
had worked for Bailey for some years. One of his jobs, he said, was to sit in 
the spectator area of the courtroom and listen carefully to the questioning of 
prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
He said jurors always offered telltale signs that would enable him to flash 
signals to Bailey to indicate whether Bailey should accept them. The doctor had 
also hypnotized two of Bailey's most famous clients: "Boston Strangler" Albert 
DeSalvo and Dr. Sam Sheppard, for whom Bailey won a retrial and freedom after 
Sheppard was convicted of killing his wife in Cleveland. (There have been some 
spectacular failures too -- the best-known was his unsuccessful defense of 
Patty Hearst.) 
</P>
<P>
Stars of Bailey's stature don't often appear in a municipal court, and his 
presence had an electric quality, dominating even the imposing Gionis, a 
stocky, curly-haired, rather swarthy man in a dark suit who followed even the 
most technical questioning intently. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that struck me most about the early part of the proceedings was the 
good ol' boy camaraderie of the participants -- rather like an advanced law 
seminar. Amid the one-liners, the inside jokes between Judge Susanne S. Shaw 
and the attorneys and witnesses, and the general aura of good fellowship, it 
was sometimes hard to remember that the man at the defense table was accused of 
hiring thugs to assault his ex-wife. I had a feeling that everyone involved 
wanted to show Bailey that they could match his sophistication and this was no 
backwoods operation. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Evans -- a tall, rail-thin man with a high-domed forehead and 
well-trimmed mustache -- told me before the Tuesday-morning session: "I heard 
rumors, but I didn't know until I came to court and saw him that Bailey would 
be involved. I wasn't surprised, though, because the Gionis family has lots of 
money, and I thought they would come up with a name lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bailey is) very smooth and competent in every facet of the job -- and he also 
seems to be a pleasant guy. I don't have any special strategy to deal with him. 
We have some pretty competent defense attorneys in Orange County too -- 
including the people who represented Gionis before Bailey took over. Let's say 
I was whelmed when I saw him, but not overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
The good fellowship struck a discordant note with me because I've always found 
a courtroom threatening, stirring in me a deep sense of jeopardy that I feel in 
few other places. That feeling didn't coalesce with the atmosphere in Judge 
Shaw's courtroom until late Tuesday morning when Jeffrey Kendall Bouey -- a 
Simi Valley pool cleaner wearing an Orange County jail jump suit -- took the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey has confessed to being one of the two assailants, and he described the 
attack on Wayne and Luby in some detail. Evans' last question was: "Why are you 
telling this story here today?" And Bouey -- a remarkably handsome young man 
who looks more like an All-American wide receiver than a hired thug -- answered 
softly, his voice breaking, that being deprived of seeing his children since he 
has been in jail has given him insight into what Aissa Wayne had been going 
through in her custody battle with Gionis over their 2-year-old daughter, 
Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
Then Bailey took over to cross-examine, and the whole tone of the proceedings 
changed dramatically and drastically. Bailey cut up Bouey with surgical 
precision, leading him down paths and then pulling the path from under him, 
deriding Bouey's "new-found sensitivity" and challenging his motives for 
cooperating with the prosecution. Exchanges between counsel turned rancorous, 
and comments from the bench -- still delivered with a kind of fixed smile -- 
became testy. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Bailey I'd come to see, and he put on a terrific show. Although he 
is a consummate performer, he long ago learned the value of understatement and 
doesn't use histrionics at all. Whenever he makes a point, he says, "Oh," in a 
kind of throwaway signature that says quite eloquently, "Well, now we've taken 
care of that matter." He is confident without being arrogant, and knowledgeable 
without being supercilious. Everybody's favorite uncle -- with a stiletto in 
his shoe. 
</P>
<P>
If Judge Shaw decides there is enough evidence to send Gionis to trial, Bailey 
will apparently defend him. If he gets Gionis off the hook at his preliminary 
hearing, Bailey can go home in triumph to await the next call. 
</P>
<P>
Have law books, will travel. For lots of money.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: IRVINE MAN TO PUBLISH DIRECTORY OF WRITERS' AVAILABLE 
WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problem with Hollywood, Orange Coast College writing instructor Raymond 
Obstfeld says, is that nobody has the time to read. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always the same story," says the author of nearly 30 novels. "They want a 
one-page synopsis. Nobody wants to read the books." 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for the 25,000 screenplays that are registered with Writers Guild 
of America (West) each year. As a teacher who has read "a ton" of student 
manuscripts, Obstfeld said he is sympathetic with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine writer, who has had five screenplays optioned by Hollywood producers 
over the years, thinks he has a solution that will benefit both writers and 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
It is called the Official Directory of Available Scripts, Treatments, Novels, 
Plays and Stories, a large-format quarterly publication that will feature 
one-page synopses of manuscripts available for purchase or optioning by film 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
Obstfeld's Windmill Press will publish the first directory in July. 
</P>
<P>
The directory will be distributed free of charge to more than 900 studio 
executives and independent producers in Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, according to Obstfeld, is to allow producers to tell by reading the 
synopsis whether they would be interested in the project. If so, they can then 
call the writer or the writer's agent to request the full manuscript. Obstfeld 
said he got the idea for the service after his own agent kept "bugging" him for 
years to do one-page synopses of all his novels. 
</P>
<P>
Each synopsis will include a summary of the plot and a description of each 
major character, in addition to listing the length, genre, major settings and 
time period. It also will include the author's credits and, if applicable, his 
literary representative. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to a writer for a one-page synopsis is $100. For an additional $75 
fee, Obstfeld will include a full-page author profile. And for writers who find 
it too difficult to encapsulate their screenplay or book manuscript, he will 
write the entire synopsis for an additional $100. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll get their exposure of their writing project to people who are in a 
position to actually do something about it whereas to actually reach those 
people on their own may take much longer," Obstfeld said. "The usual process 
without this is to find an agent first, which is just as hard, or harder, than 
finding an actual producer. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it not worth $100 to get your idea out to the people who have the power to 
move on it?" 
</P>
<P>
Obstfeld, who has been sending brochures about the directory to writing groups 
and college and university writing programs, said nearly 50 writers from around 
the country already have signed up for the service, 
</P>
<P>
"This is just an effort to get some control over what happens," he said. "We 
are not acting as an agent. We don't get a cut. We just do the editorial 
service. Whatever representative they list with us, that's who gets called." 
</P>
<P>
For information, call Windmill Press at (714) 786-7062.
